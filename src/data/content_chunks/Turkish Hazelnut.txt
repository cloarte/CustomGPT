Selecting Tree Species for Planting in Areas Where ALB/EAB Are a Concern 
Why a Replacement Tree Table 
Recently Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) and Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) have had a significant impact on communities in 
the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. We received requests from communities for a list of trees that do 
well in urban environments and are not ALB or EAB host trees. To develop this list, we combined all the recommended 
replacement trees for areas where ALB has been found and added information on EAB tree replacement from the 
Michigan State University website. Information about each tree species was compiled from the references listed 
below the Replacement Tree Table. Drafts of the table were sent to urban forestry professionals and we used their 
suggestions to make edits. 
To promote species diversity, we included many trees that do well in urban areas, but we also realize that the table 
does not include every non-host tree species. Users of the Replacement Tree Table are encouraged to use this as a 
starting reference for potential replacement trees and then to do their own research to identify species that fit their 
specific site characteristics and geographic area. 
Planting Trees: Tips for Planning, Tree Selection, Planting, and Care 
Tree planting is a critical component to help a community recover from a pest infestation or natural disaster. If 
properly planted and cared for, trees are a valuable and growing asset worth 3½ times the investment! They “pay us 
back” by providing many benefits such as improved air quality, reduced stormwater runoff, energy savings and higher 
property values for homeowners. 
Whether working in your yard, or doing a large community project, plant the right tree in the right place to ensure

 valuable and growing asset worth 3½ times the investment! They “pay us 
back” by providing many benefits such as improved air quality, reduced stormwater runoff, energy savings and higher 
property values for homeowners. 
Whether working in your yard, or doing a large community project, plant the right tree in the right place to ensure 
that the trees grow well, provide desired benefits and don’t conflict with infrastructure. There are many good 
references, but to help you get started, a partial list of recommended species is included below.  
The “Tree Owner’s Manual”, developed by the U.S. Forest Service, provides detailed information on the basic steps 
for tree selection, planting and maintenance. A copy of this can be down loaded at: www.treeownersmanual.info. 
Basic steps to consider in tree planning, selection, planting, and care are: 
 Plan –Work with knowledgeable professionals to develop a comprehensive reforestation plan. This can 
address prioritization of planting areas, planting and maintenance specifications, recommended species, 
working with partners and volunteers, inspecting work and documenting progress. Detailed planting site plans 
should be developed for specific areas. 
 Assess Planting Site –Assess all aspects of the site that may affect the tree such as: rooting space, distance to 
buildings, sidewalks, utilities, and competing trees. Check for underground utilities through the location 
service in your area. Within 25 feet of overhead utility lines, plant only species with a small mature height. 
Consider the hardiness zone, soil type, drainage and pH. Check local ordinances that regulate planting on 
public property. 
 Select Appropriate Species – There are many non-host species that make good choices for urban areas. Select 
a variety of species so that the

. Within 25 feet of overhead utility lines, plant only species with a small mature height. 
Consider the hardiness zone, soil type, drainage and pH. Check local ordinances that regulate planting on 
public property. 
 Select Appropriate Species – There are many non-host species that make good choices for urban areas. Select 
a variety of species so that the future tree population is diverse and more resilient to stresses. Match the 
characteristics of the tree, including mature size, to the site. Consider what function you want the tree to 
serve shade, aesthetics, privacy, etc. Consult the many useful references, websites and listings to help with 
tree selection. 
 Purchase Quality Trees and Handle Them Properly –Determine the type of stock that is best for your project 
and budget; bare root, potted, balled-and-burlapped. Work with a respected nursery and make sure the trees 
meet accepted standards. Tree stock should be protected during transportation and storage prior to planting. 
Warranties for tree survival and health are recommended. 
 Plant the Tree Correctly –Prepare the appropriate size hole for the root ball—not too deep! Remove burlap 
and wire basket. Check for encircling roots. If trees must be staked, do it correctly and plan to remove all 
staking materials within one to two years. Mulch and water thoroughly at time of planting. 
 Provide Care after Planting –Maintenance is critical for at least 3 years after planting. Water newly planted 
trees from spring through fall, as needed, based on the soil and natural rainfall. Prune young trees lightly, 
removing only dead or poorly located limbs. Protect trees from mowers, other equipment and construction 
damage.

The Replacement Tree Table was developed by Angie Hammond, Forest Health Protection Technician, in July 2012 
and it was first revised in January 2016. Species recommendations can vary greatly, and the list of available trees is 
constantly changing. We plan to update this document periodically. Comments and suggestions are encouraged!

Selecting Tree Species for Planting in Areas Where ALB/EAB Are a Concern 
Why a Replacement Tree Table 
Recently Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) and Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) have had a significant impact on communities in 
the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. We received requests from communities for a list of trees that do 
well in urban environments and are not ALB or EAB host trees. To develop this list, we combined all the recommended 
replacement trees for areas where ALB has been found and added information on EAB tree replacement from the 
Michigan State University website. Information about each tree species was compiled from the references listed 
below the Replacement Tree Table. Drafts of the table were sent to urban forestry professionals and we used their 
suggestions to make edits. 
To promote species diversity, we included many trees that do well in urban areas, but we also realize that the table 
does not include every non-host tree species. Users of the Replacement Tree Table are encouraged to use this as a 
starting reference for potential replacement trees and then to do their own research to identify species that fit their 
specific site characteristics and geographic area. 
Planting Trees: Tips for Planning, Tree Selection, Planting, and Care 
Tree planting is a critical component to help a community recover from a pest infestation or natural disaster. If 
properly planted and cared for, trees are a valuable and growing asset worth 3½ times the investment! They “pay us 
back” by providing many benefits such as improved air quality, reduced stormwater runoff, energy savings and higher 
property values for homeowners. 
Whether working in your yard, or doing a large community project, plant the right tree in the right place to ensure

 valuable and growing asset worth 3½ times the investment! They “pay us 
back” by providing many benefits such as improved air quality, reduced stormwater runoff, energy savings and higher 
property values for homeowners. 
Whether working in your yard, or doing a large community project, plant the right tree in the right place to ensure 
that the trees grow well, provide desired benefits and don’t conflict with infrastructure. There are many good 
references, but to help you get started, a partial list of recommended species is included below.  
The “Tree Owner’s Manual”, developed by the U.S. Forest Service, provides detailed information on the basic steps 
for tree selection, planting and maintenance. A copy of this can be down loaded at: www.treeownersmanual.info. 
Basic steps to consider in tree planning, selection, planting, and care are: 
 Plan –Work with knowledgeable professionals to develop a comprehensive reforestation plan. This can 
address prioritization of planting areas, planting and maintenance specifications, recommended species, 
working with partners and volunteers, inspecting work and documenting progress. Detailed planting site plans 
should be developed for specific areas. 
 Assess Planting Site –Assess all aspects of the site that may affect the tree such as: rooting space, distance to 
buildings, sidewalks, utilities, and competing trees. Check for underground utilities through the location

. Within 25 feet of overhead utility lines, plant only species with a small mature height. 
Consider the hardiness zone, soil type, drainage and pH. Check local ordinances that regulate planting on 
public property. 
 Select Appropriate Species – There are many non-host species that make good choices for urban areas. Select 
a variety of species so that the future tree population is diverse and more resilient to stresses. Match the 
characteristics of the tree, including mature size, to the site. Consider what function you want the tree to 
serve shade, aesthetics, privacy, etc. Consult the many useful references, websites and listings to help with 
tree selection. 
 Purchase Quality Trees and Handle Them Properly –Determine the type of stock that is best for your project 
and budget; bare root, potted, balled-and-burlapped. Work with a respected nursery and make sure the trees 
meet accepted standards. Tree stock should be protected during transportation and storage prior to planting. 
Warranties for tree survival and health are recommended. 
 Plant the Tree Correctly –Prepare the appropriate size hole for the root ball—not too deep! Remove burlap 
and wire basket. Check for encircling roots. If trees must be staked, do it correctly and plan to remove all 
staking materials within one to two years. Mulch and water thoroughly at time of planting. 
 Provide Care after Planting –Maintenance is critical for at least 3 years after planting. Water newly planted 
trees from spring through fall, as needed, based on the soil and natural rainfall. Prune young trees lightly, 
removing only dead or poorly located limbs. Protect trees from mowers, other equipment and construction 
damage.

The Replacement Tree Table was developed by Angie Hammond, Forest Health Protection Technician, in July 2012 
and it was first revised in January 2016. Species recommendations can vary greatly, and the list of available trees is 
constantly changing. We plan to update this document periodically. Comments and suggestions are encouraged!
