Wyoming

Classification of Cases  
Premises that have laboratory diagnostic confirmation of VSV are categorized as confirmed positive 
premises.  Once a county is confirmed as VSV-positive, new equine premises presenting with 
clinical signs of VSV in that county are not required to be tested for confirmation of the disease, but 
the premises will be quarantined and classified as a suspect premises.  Premises not meeting 
diagnostic confirmed case definition, but showing some evidence of recent VSV infection on testing 
may also be classified as suspect premises.   
 
Quarantines 
Confirmed positive and suspect premises are quarantined for at least 14 days from the onset 
of lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.

2019 Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) 
Situation Report – January 6, 2020  
Information current as of 6:00pm MDT, 01/06/2020  
 
 
VSV-positive premises were confirmed during the 2019 outbreak year in 8 states: Colorado, Kansas,

As of December 27, 2019, all VSV-affected premises have been released from quarantine in all 
previously affected states.   
 
Since the last situation report (December 19, 2019), there have been no new VSV-affected

Wyoming 
• Since the last situation report, 6 previously VSV-infected or suspect premises 
have been released from quarantine.    
• There are currently no VSV-affected premises under quarantine in Wyoming 
   
 
 
 
Classification of Cases  
Premises that have laboratory diagnostic confirmation of VSV are categorized as confirmed positive 
premises.  Once a county is confirmed as VSV-positive, new equine premises presenting with 
clinical signs of VSV in that county are not required to be tested for confirmation of the disease, but 
the premises will be quarantined and classified as a suspect premises.  Premises not meeting 
diagnostic confirmed case definition, but showing some evidence of recent VSV infection on testing 
may also be classified as suspect premises.   
 
Quarantines 
Confirmed positive and suspect premises are quarantined for at least 14 days from the onset 
of lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.
