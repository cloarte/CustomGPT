What is bovine theileriosis? 
 
• Bovine theileriosis is caused by Theileria 
orientalis. This is a blood-borne parasite 
(protozoan) that can infect wild and domestic 
animals including cattle, sheep, water buffalo, 
yak, and other bovids.   
 
• There are several types of T. orientalis found in 
the United States. However, to date, only T. 
orientalis Ikeda has been shown to cause 
severe illness in animals. 
 
• T. orientalis is transmitted by ticks, primarily the 
Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis 
longicornis - ALHT). Transmission may also 
occur through re-use of needles, or during 
transfusions. 
 
• Signs of infection include weakness, fever, 
reluctance to walk, loss of appetite, difficulty 
breathing, reduced milk production, foamy 
nasal discharge, and abortion.  
 
• Symptoms, such as anemia, may cause 
mucous membranes to turn yellowish or pale in 
color. Signs and symptoms may mimic bovine 
anaplasmosis. 
 
 
 
 
 
• A diagnostic test is required to confirm the 
presence of the parasite. PCR may be the 
most specific test, but IFA and ELISA may 
also be used.

anaplasmosis. 
 
 
 
 
 
• A diagnostic test is required to confirm the 
presence of the parasite. PCR may be the 
most specific test, but IFA and ELISA may 
also be used. 
 
• T. orientalis Ikeda infections have been 
reported to cause mortality in an average of 
1- 5% of infected cattle but can be as high 
as 50%. Pregnant heifers and calves are 
particularly susceptible to the infection. 
Once infected, cattle can be lifetime 
carriers.  
• There is no approved treatment for bovine 
theileriosis currently in the United States. 
 
• Theileria are not known to be human 
pathogens.  
 
     Distribution of bovine theileriosis 
 
• Throughout the world, bovine theileriosis is 
found in tropical and subtropical areas. In 
these areas, it can be a major constraint to 
cattle production. 
 
• In the United States, bovine theileriosis 
caused by T. orientalis Ikeda has been 
found in 15 states: New York, Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, 
Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, 
Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska

Pasture Management and Tick 
Control 
You can help control the spread of bovine 
theileriosis by: 
 
• Modifying tick habitat - keep grasses cut 
short and remove weeds and brush from 
grazing areas.  
 
• Restricting cattle from grazing in heavily 
tick-infested pastures to reduce tick 
exposure.

Bovine Theileriosis 
 

 
  
United States Department of Agriculture  
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
 
• Routinely using Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) approved insecticide treatments (products 
that kill ticks) on animals, vegetation, and 
equipment. Use Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved drugs for tick management on 
animals. 
 
• Regularly inspecting cattle for ticks. Ticks can be 
found especially in the ears, under the tail area, 
between the hind legs, and in udder skin folds.  
 
• Closely checking the health and tick status of all 
animals before and after herd introduction. 
 
Biosecurity practices 
 
• Protect yourself from ticks by using insect 
repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil 
of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane diol, or 2-
undecanone. 
 
• When handling livestock, do not use farm medical 
instruments like needles on multiple animals.

• When handling livestock, do not use farm medical 
instruments like needles on multiple animals. 
Thoroughly clean and sanitize tools and devices 
before and after use on each animal.  
 
• Clean, treat, and sanitize equipment before 
moving off tick infested premises. 
 
• If you suspect Theileria infection, experience 
livestock losses, or observe other conditions such 
as signs of anemia report these to a local 
veterinarian immediately. 
 
Report Suspicious Cases 
Suspect cases should be reported to your State 
Animal Health Official.
