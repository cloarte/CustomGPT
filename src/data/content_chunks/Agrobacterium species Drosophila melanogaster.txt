Guide for Movements and Imports of Disarmed Agrobacterium species  
and Drosophila melanogaster Developed using Genetic Engineering 
 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulates introductions of certain organisms 
developed using genetic engineering (modified organisms) which are, or have the potential to be, plant 
pests. Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) issues Letter of No Permit Required (LONPR) for certain 
modified organisms that are exempt from the requirement for permits for import and interstate 
movement upon request to facilitate their movement, which might otherwise be impeded by the 
organism's similarity to regulated organisms. 
 
Modified and disarmed Agrobacterium species, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens (synonyms 
include: A. radiobacter and Rhizobium radiobacter), A. rhizogenes (synonym include: R. rhizogenes) and 
A. vitis,  do not require a BRS permit for their movement when the modified genetic material is stably 
integrated into the genome and does not include the complete infeciotus genome of a plant pest, and 
are specifically exempted under 7 CFR § 340.5(d), which states: 
(d) Exemption for GE disarmed Agrobacterium species. A permit for importation or interstate 
movement is not required for any GE disarmed Agrobacterium species, provided that it is moved 
as a secure shipment, the modified genetic material is stably integrated into the genome, and 
the modified material does not include the complete infectious genome of a plant pest.

 Agrobacterium species, provided that it is moved

the modified material does not include the complete infectious genome of a plant pest. 
 
Modified Drosophila melanogaster developed for research purposes that do not contain genetic 
material designed to propagate through a population by biasing the inheritence rate do not require a 
BRS permit for their movement and are specifically exempted under 7 CFR § 340.5(e), which states: 
(e) Exemption for Drosophila melanogaster. A permit for importation or interstate movement is 
not required for modified Drosophila melanogaster, provided that it is moved as a secure 
shipment and that any introduced genetic material is not designed to propagate through a 
population by biasing the population inheritance rate. 
 
How to Request a LONPR for the Importation of Modified Agrobacterium species (disarmed) and 
Drosophila melanogaster 
Make a request via email to BRSNoPermitRequired@usda.gov with the following information: 
{Applicant's Name} 
{Applicant’s Institution} 
{Applicant's Full Mailing Address} 
{Applicant's phone number} 
{Applicant's email} 
 
The requestor should certify that the organism(s) in the request meets the criteria for exemption from 
the requirement for a permit and that any supporting information provided in the request and any 
attachments is complete and accurate to the best of their knowledge. 
 
Note:  
A Letter of No Permit Required does not expire. Once it has been issued, additional requests from the 
applicant are not necessary, and it can be used indefinitely for future

the requirement for a permit and that any supporting information provided in the request and any 
attachments is complete and accurate to the best of their knowledge. 
 
Note:  
A Letter of No Permit Required does not expire. Once it has been issued, additional requests from the 
applicant are not necessary, and it can be used indefinitely for future movements of modified disarmed 
Agrobacterium species and D. melanogaster that meet the exemptions listed above. 
Wild-type D. melanogaster, other Drosophila and Agrobacterium species may require a permit from 
USDA-APHIS Plant Protection Quarantine.

When a BRS Permit is Needed for the Movement and Importation of modified Agrobacterium species 
and D. melanogaster: 
 
The movement of modified Agrobacterium species and D. melanogaster needs a BRS permit if it: 
• Contains an introduced genetic sequence from plant pests and the introduced genetic 
sequences are capable of producing an infectious agent that causes plant disease, or encoding a 
compound that causes plant disease,  
• Contains an introduced genetic sequence that produces a biological agent or toxin that is on the 
select agents and toxins list.   
• Is used for biocontrol of plant pests and could pose a plant pest risk , or 
• For D. melanogaster, contains a sequence capable of influencing biased inheritance rate (e.g., 
any gene drive that influences biased inheritance rates). 
 
A BRS permit can be obtained from APHIS e-File.
