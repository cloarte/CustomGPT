        Factors to Consider in Determining Control Area Size for ASF 
1Premises designa�on: Infected Premises (IP), Contact Premises (CP), At -Risk Premises (ARP), Monitored Premises (MP), Free Premises (FP).  
2Frequency of sampling is subject to change and can be adjusted based on observed incuba�on periods, likely route of disease introduc�on, feasibility of sampling and di sease introduc�on risk. 
3If feral swine are present, more frequent sampling throughout the quaran�ne period is recommended.

The first Infected Premises (IP1) identified an epidemiologically -linked Contact 
Premises outside of the initial Control Area. NBCs requiring testing were placed 
on that Contact Premises, which resulted in a positive detection. This additional 
Infected Premises (IP2) triggered a new Control Area that led to additional Con-
tact Premises. 
 
All premises that are traced/linked to an Infected Premises are subject to Control 
Area restrictions and diagnostic testing.
