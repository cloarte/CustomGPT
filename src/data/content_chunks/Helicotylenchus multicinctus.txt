Vulva is a depressed transverse slit on ventral side of the body. Tail slightly tapering, with anus marked by a slight depression; terminus annulated, hemispherical in shape, with dorsal margin more curved than ventral; 6-13 cuticular rings on ventral side. Phasmids punctate, 1-6 annuli anterior to anus.Adult Males Abundant, similar to females, except for genital characters. Testis single, outstretched. Caudal alae crenate, enveloping tail but not protruding beyond it in lateral view. Spicules weakly cephalated. Gubernaculum simple.

 reports of Minz et al. (1960) and Zuckerman and Strich-Harari (1963) , H. multicinctus is able to complete its life cycle within the cortical layer of the roots where all eggs, juveniles and adult stages can be found. Thus it is regarded as an endoparasite, although there is no evidence of nematode migration through the cortical tissues ( Blake, 1966 ). Blake (1966) , studying the host-parasite relationships of this species on banana roots, observed that adults inoculated fed within 36 hours upon parenchymatous cells partly embedded in the root; after 4 days they were wholly inside the cortical layer to a depth of about 4-6 cells. Surrounding tissues showed cellular damage consisting of contracted cytoplasm, ruptured walls and enlarged nuclei. Discoloration and necroses often also occurred near the infection points.The introduction of the nematode into new areas occurs by 'seeds', sets or suckers (= rhizomes), usually brought from old infested plantations; infected planting material is the main means of dissemination. Strich-Harari et al. (1966) studied the spread of nematodes in a growing plant, whereas Stoyanov (1967) observed that the nematode can also survive for 4 months without the host plant.Life CycleThe life cycle of H. multicinctus was studied in detail by Zuckerman and Strich-Harari (1963) . Groups of 8-26 eggs, orientated parallel to the long cell axes, were frequently observed in discoloured cortical tissues. Gravid females, held in tap water at 30°C, laid eggs within 24 hours, and 48-51 hours later the hatch occurred.

 cell axes, were frequently observed in discoloured cortical tissues. Gravid females, held in tap water at 30°C, laid eggs within 24 hours, and 48-51 hours later the hatch occurred. The second-stage juvenile is characterized by having a ventral digitate tail process, which disappears during the second moult. The third-stage juvenile has a convex-conoid tail, without any projection, and a gonad primordium averaging 2-6 cells. In the fourth-stage juvenile the gonad is longer than 60 µm, and during the fourth moult its development is completed. Adult males and females reproduce sexually by amphimixis.For a review of selected papers see Siddiqi (1973) and McSorley and Parrado (1986) ; a more comprehensive review, including other major damaging endoparasitic nematodes, is by Gowen and Quénéhervé (1990) .
 Sintomas: The damage symptoms are similar to those caused by other serious root endoparasites of the family Pratylenchidae, both on banana plants and plantains. The nematode attacks the outer cortical part of the root causing characteristic necrotic lesions, which are at first yellow in colour and then turn reddish-brown to black. Minz et al. (1960) and Luc and Vilardebó (1961) reported brown root flecks in discoloured tissues, that they indicated were symptomatic of H. multicinctus infestation; later, Zuckerman and Strich-Harari (1963) noticed that these were associated with egg laying within the root cortex. Rarely, in heavy infestations, the root lesions can coalesce and the necrosis becomes extensive, causing distortion followed by decay of the root. Infected plants are stunted and may topple.
