Multi-criteria analysis (MCAS-S)
The Multi-Criteria Analysis Shell for Spatial Decision Support (MCAS-S) is a tool to view and combine mapped information. MCAS-S can inform spatial decision making and help with stakeholder engagement. MCAS-S is free, powerful, and easy to use. 
MCAS-S projects are: 
transparent - you can see all inputs used to meet an objective and how these are combined
flexible - you can use MCAS-S to compare options and explore trade-offs. You can use your own data (or ours).
fast - immediately see changes to your objective when any input or method changes
Who can use MCAS-S?
MCAS-S is designed for decision-makers. It shows transparently how mapped information can be combined to meet an objective. MCAS-S allows stakeholders to see the effects that their decisions may have. 
MCAS-S makes it easier to analyse spatial information without Geographic Information Systems programming.

What has it been used for?
MCAS-S is the latest of several MCA decision aids used in the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry policy environment since the early 1990s. MCAS-S has been used at the international, national, regional and catchment scale for:
Climate and species distribution modeling (partnership with EcoCloud) 2018
Estimating impact of incursion of plant pest Xylella fastidiosa 2017 
National soil condition assessments 2017
Climate change impacts for biodiversity (AdaptNRM) 2014-2017
