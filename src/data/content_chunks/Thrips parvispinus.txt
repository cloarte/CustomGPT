 Invasion: Eggs: Female thrips use their saw-like ovipositor to lay eggs in plant leaves, petioles, bracts, petals and developing fruits (Rachana et al., 2018). Thrips eggs are opaque white, smooth, kidney-shaped and are imbedded in leaf tissue. Well-developed eggs are visible through the leaf under illuminating light.
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: Cultivated / agricultural land, Protected agriculture (e.g. glasshouse production)
 Reproduccion: Thrips parvispinus is known to feed on pollen (J Pijnakker, Biobest Nederland, De Lier, Netherlands, unpublished). Hutasoit et al. (2019) found in a thrips sampling on peppers a predominance of females towards males with a sex ratio of 3:1. The reproduction reported for this thrips is sexual. The pest development time is temperature-dependent and also varies with the host plant. Murai et al. (2010) found a mean generation time of 37.6, 24.8 and 18.8 days and a mean fecundity of 50, 69 and 56 eggs at 20, 25 and 30°C, respectively. The intrinsic rate of natural increase at 20, 25 and 30°C was 0.18, 0.24 and 0.37 days, respectively. Hutasoit et al.

. The intrinsic rate of natural increase at 20, 25 and 30°C was 0.18, 0.24 and 0.37 days, respectively. Hutasoit et al. (2017) studied the duration of the development stages of T. parvispinus on chilli peppers. In their experimental conditions, the eggs, two nymphal instars, prepupa and pupa lasted 4.79, 1.36, 3.54, 1.08 and 1.96 days, respectively. They found a preoviposition period of the insect of 1.11 days, a fecundity of 15.33 eggs per female, a life cycle of 13.68 days, females living 8.55 days and males living 6 days, a generation time of 11.49 days and a doubling time of 4.57 days. The intrinsic rate of increase was 0.15 individual per day per female. A female produced 5.71 offspring during her lifetime. Thrips parvispinus seems to be a species with a higher level of flight activity in greenhouses than Echinothrips americanus . Pratiwi et al. (2018) studied the daily flight activity on chilli peppers in Indonesia.
 Sintomas: Thrips parvispinus inflicts direct damage on plants by feeding and reproducing on young leaves and flowers. The feeding activity results in lightly spotted leaves with streaks ( Moritz et al., 2013 ) and can also stunt plant growth.
