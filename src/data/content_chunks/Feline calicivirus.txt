200 µL of the previous dilution to the next dilution tube until the tenfold dilution 
series is completed. 
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   On the day of test initiation, label the Test Plates and remove the Growth 
Medium.  
 
Note: Presence of confluent cells is necessary in order to distinguish plaques due to 
infection by FRV. If cells are not confluent at two days incubation, start of the test 
may be delayed an additional day in order to obtain confluency.

4.2   Inoculate one well/dilution with 200 µL from dilutions 10-6 through 10-3 of the 
Test Vaccine, starting with the highest dilution (most dilute). Inoculate one well/dilution 
from dilutions 10-9 through 10-7 of the FCV Positive Control. Change tips between each 
unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine), but tip changes are not necessary between each

dilution in a series when pipetting from the most dilute to the most concentrated (e.g.,  
10-6 through 10-3). Gently rotate the plates to evenly disperse the inoculum. 
 
4.3   One uninoculated well on a Test Plate serves as a negative cell control. 
 
4.4   Incubate the inoculated Test Plates at 36°± 2°C for 75 ± 15 minutes in a CO2 
incubator. To evenly disperse the inoculum, gently rotate the plates at intervals of          
25 ± 5 minutes.

25 ± 5 minutes. 
 
4.5   Add 8 mL/well of the Overlay Medium to the plates with a 25-mL pipette. 
Discard any unused, warmed Overlay Medium. 
 
4.6   Incubate the Test Plates undisturbed at 36°± 2°C in a CO2 incubator for 4 days ± 
1 day. 
 
4.7   After incubation, without removing the Overlay Medium, pipette 5 mL of the 
Crystal Violet Stain (Section 2.2.9) into each well of the Test Plates with a 25-mL 
pipette; mix by gentle rotation. Note the precaution statement in Section 2.2.9(4). 
 
4.8   Allow Test Plates to incubate at room temperature 25 ± 5 minutes. 
 
4.9   Wash the Overlay Medium and the Crystal Violet Stain from the cell monolayers 
by dipping each plate several times in a container overflowing with running water from 
the cold water tap until the water is clear. Allow to air dry. 
 
4.10   Count the number of FCV plaques for each well and record observations. If FRV 
and FCV plaques are counted together in a combination vaccine, the FCV plaques will 
contrast markedly from FRV. The FRV plaques are visible as small, clear plaques 
approximately 1 mm in diameter with distinct edges. The FCV plaques are large, clear 
circular areas (averaging 3 to 4 mm in diameter) with fuzzy edges. If the plaques are not 
distinguishable by size

contrast markedly from FRV. The FRV plaques are visible as small, clear plaques 
approximately 1 mm in diameter with distinct edges. The FCV plaques are large, clear 
circular areas (averaging 3 to 4 mm in diameter) with fuzzy edges. If the plaques are not 
distinguishable by size, use an inverted light microscope with 100X magnification to 
differentiate the plaque edges. 
 
4.11   Record results as the number of FCV plaques for each dilution of a Test Vaccine 
and the FCV Positive Control.  
 
4.12   Calculate the FCV titers of the Test Vaccine and the FCV Positive Control from 
the dilutions with plaque counts containing 10-100 plaques. The titer may be expressed as 
PFU per dose of vaccine.

Example: 
 
During the titration of a Test FCV vaccine, the plaque count obtained at dilution 10-3 was 
65. Calculation of the titer of this vaccine is done according to the following formula: 
 
Test Vaccine Titer = X + p, where 
 
X = Log10 of plaque count 
p = Log10 of dilution counted  
 
In the above example:  
 
Log10 of plaque count (65)  = 1.8 
Log10 of dilution counted (10-3) = 3.0  
 
FCV Test Vaccine Titer
Text Len: 1336
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, where 
 
X = Log10 of plaque count 
p = Log10 of dilution counted  
 
In the above example:  
 
Log10 of plaque count (65)  = 1.8 
Log10 of dilution counted (10-3) = 3.0  
 
FCV Test Vaccine Titer = 1.8 + 3.0 = 4.8 
 
Adjust the titer to the recommend Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A.  Divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose 
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for this test 
FCV vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL) 
 
Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine added to each well of the 
Test Plate (for this test FCV vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.2 mL) 
 
    1 mL dose      = 5  
      0.2 mL inoculum     
 
B.  Calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine Titer as 
illustrated below: 
 
Log of 5 = 0.7 
 
FCV Test Vaccine Titer = 4.8 + 0.7 = 5.5 
 
Therefore, the titer of the FCV Test Vaccine is 105.5 PFU50/mL.  
 
4.13   One plaque represents a single infective unit (IU), whereas one, 50% tissue 
culture infective dose (TCID50) is statistically equivalent to a theoretical 0.69 IU. A 
TCID50 endpoint per dose will be 1.44

 of the FCV Test Vaccine is 105.5 PFU50/mL.  
 
4.13   One plaque represents a single infective unit (IU), whereas one, 50% tissue 
culture infective dose (TCID50) is statistically equivalent to a theoretical 0.69 IU. A 
TCID50 endpoint per dose will be 1.44 times those expressed as PFU per dose. Therefore, 
to express a PFU titer as a TCID50 titer, multiply the plaque count by 1.44. In the example 
above, multiply 65 times 1.44 resulting in 93.6. Convert 93.6 to log10 resulting in 1.97.

Add the log for the dilution counted (3) and the conversion factor for dose (0.7) which 
results in a log10 TCID50/mL of 5.67. In practical use, 0.16 (the log of 1.44) may be added 
to the log10 value of the PFU titer per mL to convert to TCID50/mL. From the above 
example, the titer of the Test Vaccine is 105.66 TCID50/mL. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Validity requirements 
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the FCV Positive Control must fall within plus or 
minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers.

5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Validity requirements 
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the FCV Positive Control must fall within plus or 
minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers. 
 
5.1.2   The uninoculated cell control cannot exhibit any plaques, cytopathic 
effects (CPE), or cloudy media that would indicate any contamination. 
 
5.1.3   For endpoint determination, only those tenfold dilutions of the Test 
Vaccine and the FCV Positive Control inducing 10 to 100 plaques are included in 
the plaque counts. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice.  
 
5.3   If the validity requirements are met and the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater 
than or equal to the titer contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is 
considered SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.4   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is less than the titer contained in the 
APHIS filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine may  
be retested in accordance with title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, part 113.8.b.

10-2 tube; mix by vortexing. 
 
3.4.5   Repeat Section 3.4.4 for each of the subsequent dilutions, transferring  
200 µL of the previous dilution to the next dilution tube until the tenfold dilution 
series is completed. 
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   On the day of test initiation, label the Test Plates and remove the Growth 
Medium.  
 
Note: Presence of confluent cells is necessary in order to distinguish plaques due to 
infection by FRV. If cells are not confluent at two days incubation, start of the test 
may be delayed an additional day in order to obtain confluency.

4.2   Inoculate one well/dilution with 200 µL from dilutions 10-6 through 10-3 of the 
Test Vaccine, starting with the highest dilution (most dilute). Inoculate one well/dilution 
from dilutions 10-9 through 10-7 of the FCV Positive Control. Change tips between each 
unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine), but tip changes are not necessary between each

dilution in a series when pipetting from the most dilute to the most concentrated (e.g.,  
10-6 through 10-3). Gently rotate the plates to evenly disperse the inoculum. 
 
4.3   One uninoculated well on a Test Plate serves as a negative cell control. 
 
4.4   Incubate the inoculated Test Plates at 36°± 2°C for 75 ± 15 minutes in a CO2 
incubator. To evenly disperse the inoculum, gently rotate the plates at intervals of          
25 ± 5 minutes.

25 ± 5 minutes. 
 
4.5   Add 8 mL/well of the Overlay Medium to the plates with a 25-mL pipette. 
Discard any unused, warmed Overlay Medium. 
 
4.6   Incubate the Test Plates undisturbed at 36°± 2°C in a CO2 incubator for 4 days ± 
1 day. 
 
4.7   After incubation, without removing the Overlay Medium, pipette 5 mL of the 
Crystal Violet Stain (Section 2.2.9) into each well of the Test Plates with a 25-mL 
pipette; mix by gentle rotation. Note the precaution statement in Section 2.2.9(4). 
 
4.8   Allow Test Plates to incubate at room temperature 25 ± 5 minutes. 
 
4.9   Wash the Overlay Medium and the Crystal Violet Stain from the cell monolayers 
by dipping each plate several times in a container overflowing with running water from 
the cold water tap until the water is clear. Allow to air dry. 
 
4.10   Count the number of FCV plaques for each well and record observations. If FRV 
and FCV plaques are counted together in a combination vaccine, the FCV plaques will 
contrast markedly from FRV. The FRV plaques are visible as small, clear plaques 
approximately 1 mm in diameter with distinct edges. The FCV plaques are large, clear 
circular areas (averaging 3 to 4 mm in diameter) with fuzzy edges. If the plaques are not 
distinguishable by size

circular areas (averaging 3 to 4 mm in diameter) with fuzzy edges. If the plaques are not 
distinguishable by size, use an inverted light microscope with 100X magnification to 
differentiate the plaque edges. 
 
4.11   Record results as the number of FCV plaques for each dilution of a Test Vaccine 
and the FCV Positive Control.  
 
4.12   Calculate the FCV titers of the Test Vaccine and the FCV Positive Control from 
the dilutions with plaque counts containing 10-100 plaques. The titer may be expressed as 
PFU per dose of vaccine.

Example: 
 
During the titration of a Test FCV vaccine, the plaque count obtained at dilution 10-3 was 
65. Calculation of the titer of this vaccine is done according to the following formula: 
 
Test Vaccine Titer = X + p, where 
 
X = Log10 of plaque count 
p = Log10 of dilution counted  
 
In the above example:  
 
Log10 of plaque count (65)  = 1.8 
Log10 of dilution counted (10-3) = 3.0  
 
FCV Test Vaccine Titer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, where 
 
X = Log10 of plaque count 
p = Log10 of dilution counted  
 
In the above example:  
 
Log10 of plaque count (65)  = 1.8 
Log10 of dilution counted (10-3) = 3.0  
 
FCV Test Vaccine Titer = 1.8 + 3.0 = 4.8 
 
Adjust the titer to the recommend Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A.  Divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose 
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for this test 
FCV vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL) 
 
Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine added to each well of the 
Test Plate (for this test FCV vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.2 mL) 
 
    1 mL dose      = 5  
      0.2 mL inoculum     
 
B.  Calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine Titer as 
illustrated below: 
 
Log of 5 = 0.7 
 
FCV Test Vaccine Titer = 4.8 + 0.7 = 5.5 
 
Therefore, the titer of the FCV Test Vaccine is 105.5 PFU50/mL.  
 
4.13   One plaque represents a single infective unit (IU), whereas one, 50% tissue 
culture infective dose (TCID50) is statistically equivalent to a theoretical 0.69 IU. A

culture infective dose (TCID50) is statistically equivalent to a theoretical 0.69 IU. A 
TCID50 endpoint per dose will be 1.44 times those expressed as PFU per dose. Therefore, 
to express a PFU titer as a TCID50 titer, multiply the plaque count by 1.44. In the example 
above, multiply 65 times 1.44 resulting in 93.6. Convert 93.6 to log10 resulting in 1.97.

Add the log for the dilution counted (3) and the conversion factor for dose (0.7) which 
results in a log10 TCID50/mL of 5.67. In practical use, 0.16 (the log of 1.44) may be added 
to the log10 value of the PFU titer per mL to convert to TCID50/mL. From the above 
example, the titer of the Test Vaccine is 105.66 TCID50/mL. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Validity requirements 
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the FCV Positive Control must fall within plus or 
minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers.

5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Validity requirements 
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the FCV Positive Control must fall within plus or 
minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers. 
 
5.1.2   The uninoculated cell control cannot exhibit any plaques, cytopathic 
effects (CPE), or cloudy media that would indicate any contamination. 
 
5.1.3   For endpoint determination, only those tenfold dilutions of the Test 
Vaccine and the FCV Positive Control inducing 10 to 100 plaques are included in 
the plaque counts. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice.  
 
5.3   If the validity requirements are met and the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater 
than or equal to the titer contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is 
considered SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.4   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is less than the titer contained in the 
APHIS filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine may  
be retested in accordance with title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, part 113.8.b. 
 
 
6.  Report of Test Results 
 
Report results as PFU50 or TCID50 per dose of Test Vaccine.
