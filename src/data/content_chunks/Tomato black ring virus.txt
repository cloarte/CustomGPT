TBRV is transmitted by species of the free-living, soil-inhabiting nematode, Longidorus ( Brown et al., 1996 ). These nematodes feed ectoparasitically on the roots of host plants with their long mouth stylets. The mechanism of retention and transmission of TBRV in nematodes is not well understood, but nepoviruses transmitted by Longidorus spp. are usually associated with the odontostyle (stylet) ( Sanfaçon et al., 2009 ). In ultrastructural studies of nematodes carrying the virus, virus-like particles were associated with the odontostyle and the stylet guiding sheath of vector nematodes (Taylor and Robertson, 1969). Isolates of TBRV belonging to the Scottish serotype are transmitted most efficiently by Longidorus elongatus ( Harrison et al., 1961 ; Taylor and Murant, 1969), and isolates of the English serotype by Longidorus attenuatus ( Harrison, 1964 ). Nevertheless, transmission efficiency by each of these species is relatively poor (5-25%). Isolates of the G serotype from England and Germany differed greatly in their transmission by a single population of L. attenuatus from England ( Brown et al., 1989 ). The vector specificity is controlled by determinants on RNA-2 of the virus, probably the virus coat protein ( Randles et al., 1977 ).

uatus from England ( Brown et al., 1989 ). The vector specificity is controlled by determinants on RNA-2 of the virus, probably the virus coat protein ( Randles et al., 1977 ). Both larvae and adult nematodes transmit the virus but the virus does not multiply in the vector, and it is not retained after moulting, nor is it passed to nematode progeny. L. elongatus retained infectivity for up to 9 weeks when maintained in fallow soil ( Lister and Murant, 1967 ). Nepoviruses are generally restricted by the distribution of their nematode vectors. Due to the restricted movement of nematodes, the spread of nematode-transmitted viruses through an infected field is often slow and occurs in patches ( Sanfaçon et al., 2009 ). In Scotland, isolates of the S serotype of TBRV share the same nematode vector ( L. elongatus ) as Raspberry ringspot virus and the viruses can occur in soils together. The TBRV population is highly diverse. Many of its isolates have been described as originating from varied host plants and geographic regions. More than 60 nucleotide sequences, including full-length TBRV genomes, have been deposited in the GenBank database. The analysis of phylogenetic relationships among TBRV isolates has revealed a high level of genetic diversity. The genome size shows some flexibility depending on virus isolate ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ). The majority of sequence length differences are caused by the diversity of both 5′ UTR and 3′ UTRs. Phylogenetic tests have been performed for the Polish and Lithuanian isolates by analysis of parts of the polymerase gene, coat protein gene, ORF1 and ORF2, respectively ( Rymelska et al., 2013 ; Šneideris and Staniulis, 2014 ; ( Zarzyńska-Now

Phylogenetic tests have been performed for the Polish and Lithuanian isolates by analysis of parts of the polymerase gene, coat protein gene, ORF1 and ORF2, respectively ( Rymelska et al., 2013 ; Šneideris and Staniulis, 2014 ; ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ). The Polish TBRV isolates collected from different hosts are grouped in two separate phylogenetic clusters, with an average nucleotide similarity ranging from 82.9 to 99.6% ( Rymelska et al., 2013 ). Similarly, phylogenetic analysis based on the CP gene shows that Lithuanian isolates tend to cluster into two groups and display genetic diversity ranging from 78.2 to 97.6% ( Šneideris and Staniulis, 2014 ). Budzyńska et al. (2021) carried out an exhaustive phylogenetic and population genetic analysis based on the coat protein gene (CP) sequence of 57 TBRV isolates originating from different host plants and European geographic regions (47 isolates from Poland, eight from Lithuania, one from the UK and one from Hungary). The analysis revealed that TBRV CP identity ranged from 76.9 to 99.8% and 86.4 to 100% at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Moreover, the placement of TBRV isolates in the phylogenetic trees was shown to be non-random, with isolates clustering according to host plant families and geographic origin. The genetic structure and diversity of viral populations can be affected by several factors, such as recombination and selection pressure. Bioinformatical analysis on TBRV population reveals that such a population is shaped by recombination and both positive and purifying selection ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ; Budzyńska et al., 2021 ).

 and geographic origin. The genetic structure and diversity of viral populations can be affected by several factors, such as recombination and selection pressure. Bioinformatical analysis on TBRV population reveals that such a population is shaped by recombination and both positive and purifying selection ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ; Budzyńska et al., 2021 ). An analysis of full-length genomes of ten different TBRV isolates revealed the presence of numerous point mutations. In comparison to the TBRV tomato isolate sequence (TBRV-P1), the highest number of mutations was present within Pro-cof, NTB and RdRp gene while Vpg gene region was the most conserved among the isolates tested. The most variable isolates were those that originated from the woody plants, black locust (TBRV-M1, TBRV-MJ) and grapevine (TBRV-MIRS) ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ). Their potential role in virus adaptation to different hosts and environmental conditions requires further study. The analysis of genetic diversity of satRNAs associated with different isolates of TBRV was also carried out (Minicka et al. 2022). Population of satRNA was characterized by a large genetic variability ranging from 91.1% to 100% for the nucleotide and 89.4% to 100% for amino acid sequences, respectively. Moreover, a strong effect of selection operating upon the satRNA population was confirmed. Phylogenetic analysis showed significant clustering of satRNAs, however no clear correlation was found between the genetic variation of satRNA, the host species and the site of origin, which requires further analysis using a larger data set ( Minicka et al., 2022 ).

TBRV, as other viruses, is an obligate intracellular parasite that requires for propagation specialized host cells supplying the complex metabolic and biosynthetic machinery. TBRV is durable and can remain infective for long periods of time. In laboratory experiments, the virus was found to remain infective after a 10-min exposure to 58°C (136°F) but failed to infect after exposure to 62°C (144°F) ( Smith, 1946 ). After 6 years in storage, TBRV-infected seed of Capsella bursa-pastoris (common chickenweed) and Stellaria media (shepherd's purse) germinated to produce virus-infected seedlings ( Lister and Murant, 1967 ). TBRV is distributed worldwide; the virus can be found in both moderate and tropical climate conditions.
 Sintomas: Most naturally infected weed and crop plants may show few or no symptoms, especially in the year of infection or when infection occurs through the seed.

Isolates of the G serotype from England and Germany differed greatly in their transmission by a single population of L. attenuatus from England ( Brown et al., 1989 ). The vector specificity is controlled by determinants on RNA-2 of the virus, probably the virus coat protein ( Randles et al., 1977 ). Both larvae and adult nematodes transmit the virus but the virus does not multiply in the vector, and it is not retained after moulting, nor is it passed to nematode progeny

uatus from England ( Brown et al., 1989 ). The vector specificity is controlled by determinants on RNA-2 of the virus, probably the virus coat protein ( Randles et al., 1977 ). Both larvae and adult nematodes transmit the virus but the virus does not multiply in the vector, and it is not retained after moulting, nor is it passed to nematode progeny. L. elongatus retained infectivity for up to 9 weeks when maintained in fallow soil ( Lister and Murant, 1967 ). Nepoviruses are generally restricted by the distribution of their nematode vectors. Due to the restricted movement of nematodes, the spread of nematode-transmitted viruses through an infected field is often slow and occurs in patches ( Sanfaçon et al., 2009 ). In Scotland, isolates of the S serotype of TBRV share the same nematode vector ( L. elongatus ) as Raspberry ringspot virus and the viruses can occur in soils together. The TBRV population is highly diverse. Many of its isolates have been described as originating from varied host plants and geographic regions. More than 60 nucleotide sequences, including full-length TBRV genomes, have been deposited in the GenBank database. The analysis of phylogenetic relationships among TBRV isolates has revealed a high level of genetic diversity. The genome size shows some flexibility depending on virus isolate ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ). The majority of sequence length differences are caused by the diversity of both 5′ UTR and 3′ UTRs. Phylogenetic tests have been performed for the Polish and Lithuanian isolates by analysis of parts of the polymerase gene, coat protein gene, ORF1 and ORF2, respectively ( Rymelska et al., 2013 ; Šneideris and Staniulis, 2014 ; ( Zarzyńska-Now

Phylogenetic tests have been performed for the Polish and Lithuanian isolates by analysis of parts of the polymerase gene, coat protein gene, ORF1 and ORF2, respectively ( Rymelska et al., 2013 ; Šneideris and Staniulis, 2014 ; ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ). The Polish TBRV isolates collected from different hosts are grouped in two separate phylogenetic clusters, with an average nucleotide similarity ranging from 82.9 to 99.6% ( Rymelska et al., 2013 ). Similarly, phylogenetic analysis based on the CP gene shows that Lithuanian isolates tend to cluster into two groups and display genetic diversity ranging from 78.2 to 97.6% ( Šneideris and Staniulis, 2014 ). Budzyńska et al. (2021) carried out an exhaustive phylogenetic and population genetic analysis based on the coat protein gene (CP) sequence of 57 TBRV isolates originating from different host plants and European geographic regions (47 isolates from Poland, eight from Lithuania, one from the UK and one from Hungary). The analysis revealed that TBRV CP identity ranged from 76.9 to 99.8% and 86.4 to 100% at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Moreover, the placement of TBRV isolates in the phylogenetic trees was shown to be non-random, with isolates clustering according to host plant families and geographic origin. The genetic structure and diversity of viral populations can be affected by several factors, such as recombination and selection pressure. Bioinformatical analysis on TBRV population reveals that such a population is shaped by recombination and both positive and purifying selection ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ; Budzyńska et al., 2021 ).

 and geographic origin. The genetic structure and diversity of viral populations can be affected by several factors, such as recombination and selection pressure. Bioinformatical analysis on TBRV population reveals that such a population is shaped by recombination and both positive and purifying selection ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ; Budzyńska et al., 2021 ). An analysis of full-length genomes of ten different TBRV isolates revealed the presence of numerous point mutations. In comparison to the TBRV tomato isolate sequence (TBRV-P1), the highest number of mutations was present within Pro-cof, NTB and RdRp gene while Vpg gene region was the most conserved among the isolates tested. The most variable isolates were those that originated from the woody plants, black locust (TBRV-M1, TBRV-MJ) and grapevine (TBRV-MIRS) ( Zarzyńska-Nowak et al., 2020 ). Their potential role in virus adaptation to different hosts and environmental conditions requires further study. The analysis of genetic diversity of satRNAs associated with different isolates of TBRV was also carried out (Minicka et al. 2022). Population of satRNA was characterized by a large genetic variability ranging from 91.1% to 100% for the nucleotide and 89.4% to 100% for amino acid sequences, respectively. Moreover, a strong effect of selection operating upon the satRNA population was confirmed. Phylogenetic analysis showed significant clustering of satRNAs, however no clear correlation was found between the genetic variation of satRNA, the host species and the site of origin, which requires further analysis using a larger data set ( Minicka et al., 2022 ).

TBRV, as other viruses, is an obligate intracellular parasite that requires for propagation specialized host cells supplying the complex metabolic and biosynthetic machinery. TBRV is durable and can remain infective for long periods of time. In laboratory experiments, the virus was found to remain infective after a 10-min exposure to 58°C (136°F) but failed to infect after exposure to 62°C (144°F) ( Smith, 1946 ). After 6 years in storage, TBRV-infected seed of Capsella bursa-pastoris (common chickenweed) and Stellaria media (shepherd's purse) germinated to produce virus-infected seedlings ( Lister and Murant, 1967 ). TBRV is distributed worldwide; the virus can be found in both moderate and tropical climate conditions.
 Sintomas: Most naturally infected weed and crop plants may show few or no symptoms, especially in the year of infection or when infection occurs through the seed.

Transmission by nematodes TBRV is transmitted by species of the free-living, soil-inhabiting nematode, Longidorus ( Brown et al., 1996 ). These nematodes feed ectoparasitically on the roots of host plants with their long mouth stylets. The mechanism of retention and transmission of TBRV in nematodes is not well understood, but nepoviruses transmitted by Longidorus spp. are usually associated with the odontostyle (stylet) ( Sanfaçon et al., 2009 ). In ultrastructural studies of nematodes carrying the virus, virus-like particles were associated with the odontostyle and the stylet guiding sheath of vector nematodes (Taylor and Robertson, 1969). Isolates of TBRV belonging to the Scottish serotype are transmitted most efficiently by Longidorus elongatus ( Harrison et al., 1961 ; Taylor and Murant, 1969), and isolates of the English serotype by Longidorus attenuatus ( Harrison, 1964 ).
