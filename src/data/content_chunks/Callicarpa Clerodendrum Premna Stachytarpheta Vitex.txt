Among these areVitex agnuscastusLinnaeus andHolmskioldia sanguineaRetzius. According to H. Keng (pers. comm.),Teijsmanniodendron coriaceum(C. B. Clarke) Kostermans, a species characterized by indehiscent 1-seeded dry fruits, was collected near the Guangxi-Vietnam border and is expected to be found in China.The classification of Verbenaceae is in a state of flux, especially regarding its relationship to Lamiaceae. There is evidence to suggest a significant division between members of subfamily Verbenoideae, genera 1-5 in this account, and the remaining genera, including genera 6-20, which for convenience are here referred to as subfamily Viticoideae s.l.
