Biebersteiniaceae YASIN J. NASIR National Herbarium, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, Islamabad. Perennial rhizomatous herbs. Leaves pinnate, stipulate; stipules usually much divided. Flowers in racemes or panicles. Sepals and petals 5. Stamens 10, at the base fleshy, connate. Ovary 5-lobed, 5-locular, with a solitary pendulous ovule in each locule. Styles 5, connate above to form the stigma, gynobasic. Capsule not beaked.Closely allied to the Geraniaceae (and often included in it), from which it differs in yellow flowers borne in racemes or panicles, the gynobasic style and a fruit which is not beaked. Palynological studies by Borten-Schlager (Grana Palynol. 7:420-1. 1967) showed that it was anomalous in the Geraniaceae and merited independent family status; he also pointed out that it had some similarities to Rosaceae -Potentilleae. 1 genus and 5 species are found from SE Europe to C. Asia and the Himalayas. Represented in Pakistan by 1 species. Acknowledgements: We are grateful to the United States Department of Agriculture for financing this research under PL-480. Thanks are also due to Mr. I.C. Hedge, Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, for going through the manu script. Lower Taxon Biebersteinia Steph. Related Objects Flora of China Biebersteiniaceae.pdf PDF
