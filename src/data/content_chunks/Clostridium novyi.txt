1.   Introduction  
 
This Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) describes the method used to determine whether 
biological products containing Clostridium novyi type B alpha antigen can stimulate the 
production of satisfactory immunity as prescribed by the title 9, Code of Federal Regulations    
(9 CFR), section 113.108. For products that require 2 vaccinations, rabbits are vaccinated twice 
20 to 23 days apart and bled 14 to 17 days following the second vaccination. For products that 
require a single vaccination, rabbits are vaccinated and bled 34 to 40 days later. The serum is 
titrated by a toxin-antitoxin neutralization test, using mice as an indicator.

2.  A volume of 0.5 mL of standard alpha toxin and 0.5 mL of peptone 
diluent represents 0.1 Lo dose. A volume of 0.8 mL of standard alpha toxin 
plus 0.2 mL of peptone diluent represents 0.1 L+ dose.  
 
3.  For the purposes of this SAM, 0.1 Lo dose is defined as the greatest 
amount of toxin that, when mixed with 0.1 AU, results in 100% survival 
of all mice inoculated intravenously (IV) with 0.2 mL of this mixture. The 
0.1 L+ dose is defined as the least amount of toxin that, when mixed with 
0.1 AU, results in the death of 80%-100% of all mice inoculated IV with 
0.2 mL of this mixture.  
 
4.4.2  Preparation of standard alpha antitoxin  
 
Thaw the 10 AU/mL C. novyi type B alpha antitoxin previously described (see 
Section 3.3.2). Further dilute the antitoxin to 1 AU/mL by adding 1 mL of the 
well mixed 10 AU/mL antitoxin to 9 mL of diluent in a 17 x 100-mm snap-top 
tube. Finally dilute the antitoxin to 0.1 AU/mL by adding 1 mL of the well mixed 
1 AU/mL antitoxin to 9 mL of diluent in a 17 x 100-mm snap-top tube. For the

tube. Finally dilute the antitoxin to 0.1 AU/mL by adding 1 mL of the well mixed 
1 AU/mL antitoxin to 9 mL of diluent in a 17 x 100-mm snap-top tube. For the 
purpose of this test, this 0.1 AU/mL dilution of antitoxin is referred to as the 
standard alpha antitoxin.  
 
4.4.3  Product and standard alpha toxin  
 
1.  Mix a sufficient volume of standard alpha toxin and peptone diluent 
(0.5 mL of standard alpha toxin and 0.5 mL peptone diluent [0.1 Lo dose]) 
for each serum pool and the Lo control in a 17 x 120-mm screw-cap tube. 
Add 1 mL of each of the serum dilutions to 1 mL of this alpha toxin-
peptone diluent Lo mixture in 17 x 100-mm snap-top tubes. Mix each tube 
with a vortex-type mixer.  
 
2.  Let the mixtures sit at 22°- 26°C (room temperature) for 1 hour.  
 
3.  Place tubes in ice.  
 
4.4.4  Standard alpha toxin and antitoxin controls  
 
1.  Add 1.0 mL of standard alpha antitoxin (0.1 AU/mL) to 1 mL of the 
alpha toxin-peptone diluent (0.1 Lo dose) mixture (see Section 4.4.3) in a 
17 x 100-mm snap-top tube. Mix well with a vortex-type mixer.

4.5.6  The test is concluded 72 hours after the mice are inoculated.  
 
 
5.   Interpretation of Test Results  
 
5.1  Criteria for a valid test  
 
5.1.1  All 5 mice inoculated with the standard 0.1 Lo/0.1 AU control mixture 
must survive.  
 
5.1.2  At least 4 of the 5 mice inoculated with the standard 0.1 L+/0.1 AU control 
mixture must die.  
 
Note: Moribund animals exhibiting clinical signs consistent with the expected 
disease pathogenesis that are unable to rise or move under their own power may be 
humanely euthanized and considered as deaths as outlined in 9 CFR 117.4.

5.2  Interpretation of test results  
 
5.2.1  If 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:5 diluted serum-toxin mixture (see 
Section 4.3.3) survive, the serum contains at least 0.5 AU/mL of C. novyi type B 
alpha antitoxin and the product is satisfactory.  
 
5.2.2  If 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:10 diluted serum-toxin mixture 
(see Section 4.3.4) survive, the serum contains at least 1.0 AU/mL of C. novyi 
type B alpha antitoxin.  
 
5.2.3  The product is considered unsatisfactory if the serum pool from at least 7 
rabbits contains less than 0.5 AU/mL of C. novyi type B alpha antitoxin.

1.   Introduction  
 
This Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) describes the method used to determine whether 
biological products containing Clostridium novyi type B alpha antigen can stimulate the 
production of satisfactory immunity as prescribed by the title 9, Code of Federal Regulations    
(9 CFR), section 113.108. For products that require 2 vaccinations, rabbits are vaccinated twice 
20 to 23 days apart and bled 14 to 17 days following the second vaccination. For products that 
require a single vaccination, rabbits are vaccinated and bled 34 to 40 days later. The serum is 
titrated by a toxin-antitoxin neutralization test, using mice as an indicator.

2.  A volume of 0.5 mL of standard alpha toxin and 0.5 mL of peptone 
diluent represents 0.1 Lo dose. A volume of 0.8 mL of standard alpha toxin 
plus 0.2 mL of peptone diluent represents 0.1 L+ dose.  
 
3.  For the purposes of this SAM, 0.1 Lo dose is defined as the greatest 
amount of toxin that, when mixed with 0.1 AU, results in 100% survival 
of all mice inoculated intravenously (IV) with 0.2 mL of this mixture. The 
0.1 L+ dose is defined as the least amount of toxin that, when mixed with 
0.1 AU, results in the death of 80%-100% of all mice inoculated IV with 
0.2 mL of this mixture.  
 
4.4.2  Preparation of standard alpha antitoxin  
 
Thaw the 10 AU/mL C. novyi type B alpha antitoxin previously described (see 
Section 3.3.2). Further dilute the antitoxin to 1 AU/mL by adding 1 mL of the 
well mixed 10 AU/mL antitoxin to 9 mL of diluent in a 17 x 100-mm snap-top 
tube. Finally dilute the antitoxin to 0.1 AU/mL by adding 1 mL of the well mixed 
1 AU/mL antitoxin to 9 mL of diluent in a 17 x 100-mm snap-top tube. For the

tube. Finally dilute the antitoxin to 0.1 AU/mL by adding 1 mL of the well mixed 
1 AU/mL antitoxin to 9 mL of diluent in a 17 x 100-mm snap-top tube. For the 
purpose of this test, this 0.1 AU/mL dilution of antitoxin is referred to as the 
standard alpha antitoxin.  
 
4.4.3  Product and standard alpha toxin  
 
1.  Mix a sufficient volume of standard alpha toxin and peptone diluent 
(0.5 mL of standard alpha toxin and 0.5 mL peptone diluent [0.1 Lo dose]) 
for each serum pool and the Lo control in a 17 x 120-mm screw-cap tube. 
Add 1 mL of each of the serum dilutions to 1 mL of this alpha toxin-
peptone diluent Lo mixture in 17 x 100-mm snap-top tubes. Mix each tube 
with a vortex-type mixer.  
 
2.  Let the mixtures sit at 22°- 26°C (room temperature) for 1 hour.  
 
3.  Place tubes in ice.  
 
4.4.4  Standard alpha toxin and antitoxin controls  
 
1.  Add 1.0 mL of standard alpha antitoxin (0.1 AU/mL) to 1 mL of the 
alpha toxin-peptone diluent (0.1 Lo dose) mixture (see Section 4.4.3) in a 
17 x 100-mm snap-top tube. Mix well with a vortex-type mixer.

4.5.6  The test is concluded 72 hours after the mice are inoculated.  
 
 
5.   Interpretation of Test Results  
 
5.1  Criteria for a valid test  
 
5.1.1  All 5 mice inoculated with the standard 0.1 Lo/0.1 AU control mixture 
must survive.  
 
5.1.2  At least 4 of the 5 mice inoculated with the standard 0.1 L+/0.1 AU control 
mixture must die.  
 
Note: Moribund animals exhibiting clinical signs consistent with the expected 
disease pathogenesis that are unable to rise or move under their own power may be 
humanely euthanized and considered as deaths as outlined in 9 CFR 117.4.

5.2  Interpretation of test results  
 
5.2.1  If 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:5 diluted serum-toxin mixture (see 
Section 4.3.3) survive, the serum contains at least 0.5 AU/mL of C. novyi type B 
alpha antitoxin and the product is satisfactory.  
 
5.2.2  If 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:10 diluted serum-toxin mixture 
(see Section 4.3.4) survive, the serum contains at least 1.0 AU/mL of C. novyi 
type B alpha antitoxin.  
 
5.2.3  The product is considered unsatisfactory if the serum pool from at least 7 
rabbits contains less than 0.5 AU/mL of C. novyi type B alpha antitoxin.
