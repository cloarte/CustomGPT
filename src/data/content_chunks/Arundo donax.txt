There are generally low levels of genetic variation in introduced populations as they tend to reproduce only vegetatively ( Malone et al., 2017 ). Molecular studies confirm low levels of genetic diversity being comparable to clonal species ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ; Hardion et al., 2014 ). Breeding efforts are hampered by the species seldomly producing seeds ( PROTA, 2023 ). No germplasm collections are available ( McWilliams, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Very little information is available in the literature regarding the biology of A. donax . Although plants have been grown in scattered locations from seed collected in Asia, it is reported that A. donax does not produce viable seeds in most areas where it is apparently well-adapted. Seed production has not been detected in the Mediterranean or the USA. When available, seeds usually germinate in 1-3 months at 15°C. Viable seeds have been found in Iran, Afghanistan, China and Pakistan ( PROTA, 2023 ). The non-fruiting character of Mediterranean populations is attributed to their high ploidy level which may disrupt meiotic processes ( Hardion et al., 2014 ). Population expansion thus occurs almost exclusively through vegetative reproduction in most reported cases, either from underground rhizome extension of a colony or from plant fragments carried downstream, to become rooted and form new clones ( Else, 1996 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Root formation can also occur where an attached culm falls over and is in contact with the substrate, and such layering has now been proposed as a more common means of reproduction in invasive stands in the USA than either via rhizome extension or plant fragments ( Boland, 2006 ). Much of the cultivation of A. donax is therefore initiated by planting rhizomes that root and sprout readily. Rhizome parts planted as deeply

 culm falls over and is in contact with the substrate, and such layering has now been proposed as a more common means of reproduction in invasive stands in the USA than either via rhizome extension or plant fragments ( Boland, 2006 ). Much of the cultivation of A. donax is therefore initiated by planting rhizomes that root and sprout readily. Rhizome parts planted as deeply as 25 cm readily sprout, but sprouting of stem parts is hindered by planting deeper than 10 cm. In storage, the viability of rhizome and stem parts decreases, but after being kept for 16 weeks under cool (9-10°C) and moist conditions the rhizomes still produce about 70-75% sprouting ( PROTA, 2023 ). Wild stands in the USA have reportedly yielded over 20 t of oven-dry biomass per ha ( Perdue, 1958 ). The importance of sexual reproduction to the species, as well as seed viability, dormancy, germination and seedling establishment has yet to be well studied. Physiology and Phenology Arundo is a C3 plant, but with the unsaturated potential of a C4 plant, and high photosynthetic rates. The plant contains various noxious chemicals, including triterpenes, sterols, cardiac glycosides, curare-mimicking indoles, hydrozamic acid and silica. Plants respond strongly to excess nitrogen from anthropogenic and fire sources. Research on growth and transpiration indicate that water availability is the primary factor affecting metabolic rates and productivity. Plants have a shorter stature and are less productive when there is limited water availability, such as on higher elevation riparian terraces or drier portions of the watershed ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ). It is able to survive low temperatures but is subject to serious damage by frosts, especially after the initiation of spring growth ( PROTA, 2023 ).

 stature and are less productive when there is limited water availability, such as on higher elevation riparian terraces or drier portions of the watershed ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ). It is able to survive low temperatures but is subject to serious damage by frosts, especially after the initiation of spring growth ( PROTA, 2023 ). New shoots arise from rhizomes in nearly any season, but most commonly in the spring. Growth also occurs in any season but is highly sensitive to temperature and moisture. Under favourable conditions (warm and wet months), A. donax grows very rapidly. Growth rates of up to 0.7 m/week have been recorded, putting it among the fastest growing terrestrial plants. Young culms develop at the full diameter of older canes and further growth involves thickening of the walls. The new growth is soft, very high in moisture and has little wind resistance ( Perdue, 1958 ). Both rhizomes and stems can withstand a certain amount of drying out. Drying rhizomes to 58.8% moisture loss and stems to 36.5% moisture loss does not affect their ability to sprout ( Cal-IPC, 2023 ). Age of individual culms is certainly more than 1 year, and branching seems to represent stem growth in later years, whereas rhizomes show indeterminate growth. Branches can also form when a stem is cut or laid over. Die-back is infrequently observed but culms fade or turn partially brown in winter, becoming dormant under cold conditions ( PROTA, 2023 ). In Indonesia, A. donax flowers in February and March. In Iraq, it flowers and fruits from June to December. It flowers from February to April in southern Africa ( PROTA, 2023 ).

Longevity Arundo donax has a rapid growth, with the culms beginning to branch during the second year. During each growing seasons, new culms arise from the rhizomes giving the species a perennial character. New plants require up to 5 years to produce a good quality cane ( PROTA, 2023 ). Population Size and Density Arundo donax can form huge clones which can cover hundreds of acres ( PIER, 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Arundo donax is extremely tolerant to different climates, being adapted to tropical, subtropical and warm temperate climates, and growing under a wide variety of environmental conditions. However, it does not appear to tolerate high elevations over much of its native and introduced ranges, nor does it like continental environments where regular freezing occurs. It is often found on sand dunes near seashores. It tends to favour low gradients (<2% grade) over steeper and smaller channels, but scattered colonies can be found in moist sites or springs on steeper slopes. It is tolerant to annual precipitation of 300-4000 mm, annual temperatures of 9-29°C and a soil pH of 5.0-8.7 ( Duke, 1975 ). It does not grow well in areas subjected to winter frosts, although it has been reported to be hardy to -5 to -10°C. It can survive very low temperatures when dormant, but it is seriously damaged by frost after growth has started ( PROTA, 2023 ). Arundo donax is a hydrophyte but can grow in a wide range of conditions, from moist well-drained soils to those with a water table at or near the surface.

Arundo donax is a hydrophyte but can grow in a wide range of conditions, from moist well-drained soils to those with a water table at or near the surface. It prefers sunny sheltered areas, as the young culms have little wind resistance. It occurs on coarse sands, gravelly soils, heavy clays and river sediments from freshwater to semi-saline soils on brackish estuaries or in ditches, and along the banks of streams, rivers and lakes. It does not grow in swamps, as the rhizomes do not withstand permanent or prolonged submersion in water ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ; Csurhes, 2016 ; PROTA, 2023 ). It can grow in areas exposed to maritime winds and saline conditions and can survive prolonged periods of severe drought or excessive rain ( PROTA, 2023 ). It is also adapted to fire events ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ).

 Reproduccion: Genetics The base chromosome is x=12, but with numerous ploidy levels reported, with 2n=40, 2n=60, 2n=72, 2n=110 and 2n=112 ( PROTA, 2023 ). Asian populations have lower cytotypes than those in the Mediterranean region ( Hardion et al., 2014 ). Several horticultural cultivars, some with variegated leaves, are cultivated as ornamentals ( PIER, 2023 ). There are generally low levels of genetic variation in introduced populations as they tend to reproduce only vegetatively ( Malone et al., 2017 ). Molecular studies confirm low levels of genetic diversity being comparable to clonal species ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ; Hardion et al., 2014 ).

 horticultural cultivars, some with variegated leaves, are cultivated as ornamentals ( PIER, 2023 ). There are generally low levels of genetic variation in introduced populations as they tend to reproduce only vegetatively ( Malone et al., 2017 ). Molecular studies confirm low levels of genetic diversity being comparable to clonal species ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ; Hardion et al., 2014 ). Breeding efforts are hampered by the species seldomly producing seeds ( PROTA, 2023 ). No germplasm collections are available ( McWilliams, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Very little information is available in the literature regarding the biology of A. donax . Although plants have been grown in scattered locations from seed collected in Asia, it is reported that A. donax does not produce viable seeds in most areas where it is apparently well-adapted. Seed production has not been detected in the Mediterranean or the USA. When available, seeds usually germinate in 1-3 months at 15°C. Viable seeds have been found in Iran, Afghanistan, China and Pakistan ( PROTA, 2023 ). The non-fruiting character of Mediterranean populations is attributed to their high ploidy level which may disrupt meiotic processes ( Hardion et al., 2014 ). Population expansion thus occurs almost exclusively through vegetative reproduction in most reported cases, either from underground rhizome extension of a colony or from plant fragments carried downstream, to become rooted and form new clones ( Else, 1996 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Root formation can also occur where an attached culm falls over and is in contact with the substrate, and such layering has now been proposed as a more common means of reproduction in invasive stands in the USA than either via rhizome extension or plant fragments ( Boland, 2006 ). Much of the cultivation of A. donax is therefore initiated by planting rhizomes that root and sprout readily. Rhizome parts planted as deeply

 culm falls over and is in contact with the substrate, and such layering has now been proposed as a more common means of reproduction in invasive stands in the USA than either via rhizome extension or plant fragments ( Boland, 2006 ). Much of the cultivation of A. donax is therefore initiated by planting rhizomes that root and sprout readily. Rhizome parts planted as deeply as 25 cm readily sprout, but sprouting of stem parts is hindered by planting deeper than 10 cm. In storage, the viability of rhizome and stem parts decreases, but after being kept for 16 weeks under cool (9-10°C) and moist conditions the rhizomes still produce about 70-75% sprouting ( PROTA, 2023 ). Wild stands in the USA have reportedly yielded over 20 t of oven-dry biomass per ha ( Perdue, 1958 ). The importance of sexual reproduction to the species, as well as seed viability, dormancy, germination and seedling establishment has yet to be well studied. Physiology and Phenology Arundo is a C3 plant, but with the unsaturated potential of a C4 plant, and high photosynthetic rates. The plant contains various noxious chemicals, including triterpenes, sterols, cardiac glycosides, curare-mimicking indoles, hydrozamic acid and silica. Plants respond strongly to excess nitrogen from anthropogenic and fire sources. Research on growth and transpiration indicate that water availability is the primary factor affecting metabolic rates and productivity. Plants have a shorter stature and are less productive when there is limited water availability, such as on higher elevation riparian terraces or drier portions of the watershed ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ). It is able to survive low temperatures but is subject to serious damage by frosts, especially after the initiation of spring growth ( PROTA, 2023 ).

 stature and are less productive when there is limited water availability, such as on higher elevation riparian terraces or drier portions of the watershed ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ). It is able to survive low temperatures but is subject to serious damage by frosts, especially after the initiation of spring growth ( PROTA, 2023 ). New shoots arise from rhizomes in nearly any season, but most commonly in the spring. Growth also occurs in any season but is highly sensitive to temperature and moisture. Under favourable conditions (warm and wet months), A. donax grows very rapidly. Growth rates of up to 0.7 m/week have been recorded, putting it among the fastest growing terrestrial plants. Young culms develop at the full diameter of older canes and further growth involves thickening of the walls. The new growth is soft, very high in moisture and has little wind resistance ( Perdue, 1958 ). Both rhizomes and stems can withstand a certain amount of drying out. Drying rhizomes to 58.8% moisture loss and stems to 36.5% moisture loss does not affect their ability to sprout ( Cal-IPC, 2023 ). Age of individual culms is certainly more than 1 year, and branching seems to represent stem growth in later years, whereas rhizomes show indeterminate growth. Branches can also form when a stem is cut or laid over. Die-back is infrequently observed but culms fade or turn partially brown in winter, becoming dormant under cold conditions ( PROTA, 2023 ). In Indonesia, A. donax flowers in February and March. In Iraq, it flowers and fruits from June to December. It flowers from February to April in southern Africa ( PROTA, 2023 ).

Longevity Arundo donax has a rapid growth, with the culms beginning to branch during the second year. During each growing seasons, new culms arise from the rhizomes giving the species a perennial character. New plants require up to 5 years to produce a good quality cane ( PROTA, 2023 ). Population Size and Density Arundo donax can form huge clones which can cover hundreds of acres ( PIER, 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Arundo donax is extremely tolerant to different climates, being adapted to tropical, subtropical and warm temperate climates, and growing under a wide variety of environmental conditions. However, it does not appear to tolerate high elevations over much of its native and introduced ranges, nor does it like continental environments where regular freezing occurs. It is often found on sand dunes near seashores. It tends to favour low gradients (<2% grade) over steeper and smaller channels, but scattered colonies can be found in moist sites or springs on steeper slopes. It is tolerant to annual precipitation of 300-4000 mm, annual temperatures of 9-29°C and a soil pH of 5.0-8.7 ( Duke, 1975 ). It does not grow well in areas subjected to winter frosts, although it has been reported to be hardy to -5 to -10°C. It can survive very low temperatures when dormant, but it is seriously damaged by frost after growth has started ( PROTA, 2023 ). Arundo donax is a hydrophyte but can grow in a wide range of conditions, from moist well-drained soils to those with a water table at or near the surface. It prefers sunny sheltered areas, as the young culms have little wind resistance. It

Arundo donax is a hydrophyte but can grow in a wide range of conditions, from moist well-drained soils to those with a water table at or near the surface. It prefers sunny sheltered areas, as the young culms have little wind resistance. It occurs on coarse sands, gravelly soils, heavy clays and river sediments from freshwater to semi-saline soils on brackish estuaries or in ditches, and along the banks of streams, rivers and lakes. It does not grow in swamps, as the rhizomes do not withstand permanent or prolonged submersion in water ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ; Csurhes, 2016 ; PROTA, 2023 ). It can grow in areas exposed to maritime winds and saline conditions and can survive prolonged periods of severe drought or excessive rain ( PROTA, 2023 ). It is also adapted to fire events ( Cal-IPC, 2011 ).
