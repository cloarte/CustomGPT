 Reproduccion: Cultivated Carrot Growth and Development Carrot seed will remain viable (70-80% germination) for 6-7 years when stored dry (moisture content 9%) at temperatures below 18°C. Germination is epigeal with first appearance of seedlings 9-12 days after sowing. The first four true leaves are formed at 4 to 5-day intervals, starting 3-4 weeks after sowing, but then the interval increases gradually to 15-18 days for subsequent leaves. A thin taproot grows down vertically to 20-25 cm, and 30-40 days after germination it starts swelling and gradually turning orange (in carotene carrots) from the hypocotyl stem downwards. About 80% of all carbohydrates produced in the plant are diverted to the root during this stage of development.

, and 30-40 days after germination it starts swelling and gradually turning orange (in carotene carrots) from the hypocotyl stem downwards. About 80% of all carbohydrates produced in the plant are diverted to the root during this stage of development. The roots are mature 70-120 days after sowing according to the type of cultivar and growing conditions. The generative phase is induced by low temperatures. Carrot plants become sensitive to vernalization after the formation of at least eight leaves. The bolting-resistant cultivars of higher latitudes require 5- 12 weeks at 2-6°C to induce bolting. Local cultivars grown in the tropics show bolting when the night temperatures drop below approximately 16°C. The generative phase is accelerated by long days after devernalization (20°C). First a new rosette of leaves is formed, followed by elongation of the flowering stalk and first flowering 3 months later. Flowers are arranged in spirals and development is centripetal: the first mature flowers are on the outer edges of the outer umbellets. Flowering may last for one month, starting with the primary umbel. Initially the umbels are flat and concave. At anthesis the umbellets turn downwards progressively from the outside towards the centre, so that by the time the central flowers are mature, the umbels are more or less convex to conical. After pollination the umbellets turn upwards again. Carrot is predominantly outbreeding due to protandry. Insects such as bees and flies, attracted by abundant nectar, effect cross-pollination. The stigma becomes receptive 2-3 days after pollen dehiscence. Petals drop soon after fertilization and the seeds (mericarps) are mature 40-50 days later.

Petals drop soon after fertilization and the seeds (mericarps) are mature 40-50 days later. Ecology In their adaptation to the northern latitudes of Europe, carrots became biennial and tolerant of long days (non-bolting) during the vegetative phase. They require subsequent vernalization at low temperatures to induce flowering. Carrots adapted to tropical and subtropical latitudes respond to long days by bolting even before the roots have properly thickened. Carrots are mostly cultivated as a cool season crop. High soil temperatures, in excess of 25°C, induce slow growth rates, fibrous roots and low carotene content. For economic yields, carrots should be grown in tropical regions at altitudes above 700 m. Early-maturing carrot cultivars may grow in the lowlands, but yields will be low and roots will have a poor colour. Optimum air temperatures are 16-24°C. Soils should be well-drained, fertile and of a sandy texture. Heavy clay soils may induce malformed and twisted roots and harvesting will be difficult. Optimum pH is 6.0-6.5. A regular supply of water is essential to obtain smooth and even roots. Flowering and seed set are successful only in climates with mean day temperatures below 20°C.

 is considered a source of genes for traits such as cytoplasmic male sterility required in domesticated carrot breeding. However, gene flow from wild carrot can be a problem for carrot seed producers; pollination with pollen from wild carrot can result in genetically impure seed lots. As pollen can be transported long distances by insects and pollen remains viable for 10 days, a minimum distance of at least 1 km is required between cultivated fields and wild carrot habitats, with at least 5 km being required in some cases ( Grzebelus et al., 2011 ). Each flower in a wild carrot umbel has five irregularly shaped petals. The flowers on the outer edge of the umbel often have larger petals, perhaps to make the umbel more conspicuous to pollinators. Each flower has five tiny thread-like stamens and most also have two pistils. Although the flowers in each umbel have both male and female parts, the inner flowers are functionally male only. In the centre of many wild carrot umbels there is often a purple, sterile flower, the function of which is unknown ( Stokes and Stokes, 1985 ). Like the cultivated form, wild carrot exhibits a protandrous dichogamous reproductive strategy, with anthers maturing before stigma development. Pollination is by insects. After flowering and going to seed at the end of the growing season, the whole plant dies, but the flower stems often remain, dispersing seeds through the winter. As in cultivated carrot, seed germination in wild carrots is epigeal. After emergence, the plant grows to a height of around 60-120 cm. In the first year it typically grows just a basal rosette with a deep taproot. Although wild carrot is often referred to as a biennial (growing as a rosette of basal leaves in the first growing season, then growing upward, flowering and dying the next), in fact its life history depends on environmental conditions (e.g., what

 a height of around 60-120 cm. In the first year it typically grows just a basal rosette with a deep taproot. Although wild carrot is often referred to as a biennial (growing as a rosette of basal leaves in the first growing season, then growing upward, flowering and dying the next), in fact its life history depends on environmental conditions (e.g., what time of year the seed germinated, nutrient and light availability, competition etc.). Under good conditions, germination may occur in the spring and the plant may flower in late summer of the same year. Under poor conditions, the rosette may grow for several years before the plant flowers. When flowering occurs, the top-most flowers in the umbel generally mature and develop seeds first. New flower stems are produced from the basal rosette throughout the growing season, which makes wild carrot unusually resilient to mowing. Once the flowers are pollinated, the umbel closes in on itself and dries out as the seeds mature ( Stokes and Stokes, 1985 ). Wild carrot, like the domesticated form, is a biennial, producing seed in its second year. Research on the persistence of the seedbank in Oregon prairie showed that 28% of seeds survived the first winter, with most going on to germinate in the following spring, but 40% of the surviving seed germinated in the second year. No seeds survived beyond the second year ( Grzebelus et al., 2011 ). In North America, the nectar and pollen of wild carrot flowers attract small bees, wasps, flies and beetles, including wild carrot wasps ( Gasteruption spp.). The foliage, roots and other parts are food for other insects. Seeds are eaten by the ring-necked pheasant ( Phasianus colchicus ), ruffed grouse ( Bonasa umbellus ) and pine mouse ( Microtus spp.).

Seeds are eaten by the ring-necked pheasant ( Phasianus colchicus ), ruffed grouse ( Bonasa umbellus ) and pine mouse ( Microtus spp.). The aromatic and somewhat bitter foliage is browsed sparingly by mammalian herbivores ( Hilty, 2015 ). Wild carrots require vernalization at low temperatures to induce flowering. Optimum air temperatures for growth are 16-24°C. Flowering and seed set are successful only in climates with mean day temperatures below 20°C. High soil temperatures (in excess of 25°C) induce slow growth rates. The preference is for full sunlight, mesic to dry conditions, and soil that contains either loam or clay-loam with a slightly acidic to alkaline pH. However, wild carrot will also adapt to partial sun, moist conditions, and other kinds of soil ( Hilty, 2015 ).

New flower stems are produced from the basal rosette throughout the growing season, which makes wild carrot unusually resilient to mowing. Once the flowers are pollinated, the umbel closes in on itself and dries out as the seeds mature ( Stokes and Stokes, 1985 ). Wild carrot, like the domesticated form, is a biennial, producing seed in its second year. Research on the persistence of the seedbank in Oregon prairie showed that 28% of seeds survived the first winter, with most going on to germinate in the following spring, but 40% of the surviving seed germinated in the second year. No seeds survived beyond the second year ( Grzebelus et al., 2011 ). In North America, the nectar and pollen of wild carrot flowers attract small bees, wasps, flies and beetles, including wild carrot wasps ( Gasteruption spp.). The foliage, roots and other parts are food for other insects. Seeds are eaten by the ring-necked pheasant ( Phasianus colchicus ), ruffed grouse ( Bonasa umbellus ) and pine mouse ( Microtus spp.).

Seeds are eaten by the ring-necked pheasant ( Phasianus colchicus ), ruffed grouse ( Bonasa umbellus ) and pine mouse ( Microtus spp.). The aromatic and somewhat bitter foliage is browsed sparingly by mammalian herbivores ( Hilty, 2015 ). Wild carrots require vernalization at low temperatures to induce flowering. Optimum air temperatures for growth are 16-24°C. Flowering and seed set are successful only in climates with mean day temperatures below 20°C. High soil temperatures (in excess of 25°C) induce slow growth rates. The preference is for full sunlight, mesic to dry conditions, and soil that contains either loam or clay-loam with a slightly acidic to alkaline pH. However, wild carrot will also adapt to partial sun, moist conditions, and other kinds of soil ( Hilty, 2015 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Cultivated Carrot Growth and Development Carrot seed will remain viable (70-80% germination) for 6-7 years when stored dry (moisture content 9%) at temperatures below 18°C. Germination is epigeal with first appearance of seedlings 9-12 days after sowing. The first four true leaves are formed at 4 to 5-day intervals, starting 3-4 weeks after sowing, but then the interval increases gradually to 15-18 days for subsequent leaves. A thin taproot grows down vertically to 20-25 cm, and 30-40 days after germination it starts swelling and gradually turning orange (in carotene

 9-12 days after sowing. The first four true leaves are formed at 4 to 5-day intervals, starting 3-4 weeks after sowing, but then the interval increases gradually to 15-18 days for subsequent leaves. A thin taproot grows down vertically to 20-25 cm, and 30-40 days after germination it starts swelling and gradually turning orange (in carotene carrots) from the hypocotyl stem downwards. About 80% of all carbohydrates produced in the plant are diverted to the root during this stage of development. The roots are mature 70-120 days after sowing according to the type of cultivar and growing conditions. The generative phase is induced by low temperatures. Carrot plants become sensitive to vernalization after the formation of at least eight leaves. The bolting-resistant cultivars of higher latitudes require 5- 12 weeks at 2-6°C to induce bolting. Local cultivars grown in the tropics show bolting when the night temperatures drop below approximately 16°C. The generative phase is accelerated by long days after devernalization (20°C). First a new rosette of leaves is formed, followed by elongation of the flowering stalk and first flowering 3 months later. Flowers are arranged in spirals and development is centripetal: the first mature flowers are on the outer edges of the outer umbellets. Flowering may last for one month, starting with the primary umbel. Initially the umbels are flat and concave. At anthesis the umbellets turn downwards progressively from the outside towards the centre, so that by the time the central flowers are mature, the umbels are more or less convex to conical. After pollination the umbellets turn upwards again. Carrot is predominantly outbreeding due to protandry. Insects such as bees and flies, attracted by abundant nectar, effect cross-pollination.

 progressively from the outside towards the centre, so that by the time the central flowers are mature, the umbels are more or less convex to conical. After pollination the umbellets turn upwards again. Carrot is predominantly outbreeding due to protandry. Insects such as bees and flies, attracted by abundant nectar, effect cross-pollination. The stigma becomes receptive 2-3 days after pollen dehiscence. Petals drop soon after fertilization and the seeds (mericarps) are mature 40-50 days later. Ecology In their adaptation to the northern latitudes of Europe, carrots became biennial and tolerant of long days (non-bolting) during the vegetative phase. They require subsequent vernalization at low temperatures to induce flowering. Carrots adapted to tropical and subtropical latitudes respond to long days by bolting even before the roots have properly thickened. Carrots are mostly cultivated as a cool season crop. High soil temperatures, in excess of 25°C, induce slow growth rates, fibrous roots and low carotene content. For economic yields, carrots should be grown in tropical regions at altitudes above 700 m. Early-maturing carrot cultivars may grow in the lowlands, but yields will be low and roots will have a poor colour. Optimum air temperatures are 16-24°C. Soils should be well-drained, fertile and of a sandy texture. Heavy clay soils may induce malformed and twisted roots and harvesting will be difficult. Optimum pH is 6.0-6.5. A regular supply of water is essential to obtain smooth and even roots. Flowering and seed set are successful only in climates with mean day temperatures below 20°C.

6.5. A regular supply of water is essential to obtain smooth and even roots. Flowering and seed set are successful only in climates with mean day temperatures below 20°C. Wild Carrot Genetics D. carota is an outcrossing diploid species with 2n = 18 chromosomes. Wild carrot is considered a source of genes for traits such as cytoplasmic male sterility required in domesticated carrot breeding. However, gene flow from wild carrot can be a problem for carrot seed producers; pollination with pollen from wild carrot can result in genetically impure seed lots. As pollen can be transported long distances by insects and pollen remains viable for 10 days, a minimum distance of at least 1 km is required between cultivated fields and wild carrot habitats, with at least 5 km being required in some cases ( Grzebelus et al., 2011 ). Reproductive Biology Each flower in a wild carrot umbel has five irregularly shaped petals. The flowers on the outer edge of the umbel often have larger petals, perhaps to make the umbel more conspicuous to pollinators. Each flower has five tiny thread-like stamens and most also have two pistils. Although the flowers in each umbel have both male and female parts, the inner flowers are functionally male only. In the centre of many wild carrot umbels there is often a purple, sterile flower, the function of which is unknown ( Stokes and Stokes, 1985 ). Like the cultivated form, wild carrot exhibits a protandrous dichogamous reproductive strategy, with anthers maturing before stigma development. Pollination is by insects. After flowering and going to seed at the end of the growing season, the whole plant dies, but the flower stems often remain, dispersing seeds through the winter. Physiology and Phenology As in cultivated carrot, seed germination in wild carrots is epigeal. After emergence, the plant grows to a height of around 60-120 cm.

Physiology and Phenology As in cultivated carrot, seed germination in wild carrots is epigeal. After emergence, the plant grows to a height of around 60-120 cm. In the first year it typically grows just a basal rosette with a deep taproot. Although wild carrot is often referred to as a biennial (growing as a rosette of basal leaves in the first growing season, then growing upward, flowering and dying the next), in fact its life history depends on environmental conditions (e.g., what time of year the seed germinated, nutrient and light availability, competition etc.). Under good conditions, germination may occur in the spring and the plant may flower in late summer of the same year. Under poor conditions, the rosette may grow for several years before the plant flowers. When flowering occurs, the top-most flowers in the umbel generally mature and develop seeds first. New flower stems are produced from the basal rosette throughout the growing season, which makes wild carrot unusually resilient to mowing.
