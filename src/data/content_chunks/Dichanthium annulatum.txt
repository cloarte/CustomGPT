Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a warm season bunchgrass from South Africa, useful for pasturein South Texas. Stems are slender, erect to semi-decumbent, up to 5 feet inheight. In one variety stems are leafy and have stiff leaves at the nodes.Plants reseed aggressively. The grass is palatable both as pasture and hay.Plants are drought tolerant, somewhat alkali tolerant, and well adapted torange seeding on heavy soils.
