UPDATE: Import Alert: New World Screwworm Restrictions for Live Animals 
Originating from or Transiting Mexico  
Issuance Date: February 3, 2025 
3:52 PM, U.S. Eastern  
 
Effective Date: January 31, 2025 
NOTE: On November 22, 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) temporarily suspended the importation of 
live animals originating from or transiting Mexico based on the confirmation of New World 
screwworm (NWS) in cattle. This import alert provides updated restrictions for live animals 
originating from or transiting through Mexico. 
Effective January 31, 2025, and until further notice, APHIS is reducing restrictions on the 
importation of live cattle and bison from Mexico. In addition to meeting all previously 
established import requirements, imported animals must successfully complete pre-clearance 
inspection and treatment for screwworm and import through APHIS-approved facilities 
associated with specific ports of entry. More information on the pre-clearance program, required 
health documentation, and approved inspection facilities is available at: 
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/live-animal-import/cattle-bison-germplasm/mexico,  Importation of 
bovine germplasm, sheep and goats and their germplasm, and swine and their germplasm from 
Mexico remains prohibited.  
APHIS will continue to allow the importation of dogs from Mexico if accompanied by a health 
certificate signed by a veterinarian trained and approved by the Mexican Competent Authority 
(SENASICA). The certificate must state that the animal has been inspected for screwworm

APHIS will continue to allow the importation of dogs from Mexico if accompanied by a health 
certificate signed by a veterinarian trained and approved by the Mexican Competent Authority 
(SENASICA). The certificate must state that the animal has been inspected for screwworm 
within 5 days prior to shipment to the United States and the animal is either free from 
screwworm OR was found to be infested with screwworm, held in quarantine, and treated until 
free from screwworm prior to the certificate being issued and the dog being exported to the 
United States. SENASICA maintains a list of approved veterinarians online at: 
https://www.gob.mx/senasica/documentos/directorio-de-mvra-en-clinicas-y-hospitales-
veterinarios?state=published. 
Horses originating from or that have resided in Mexico within the 60 days immediately 
preceding export to the United States must complete the established import screwworm protocol. 
The protocol and required health documentation are available at: 
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/live-animal-import/import-horses-mexico. This includes pre-export 
treatment and examination, as well as treatment, examinations, and a 7- day quarantine in a 
permanent import quarantine facility upon arrival. Horses transiting Mexico will be required to 
complete screwworm mitigations upon arrival. Please note that horses that have resided in a 
screwworm-free country for a minimum of 7 days after residing in Mexico do not need to 
complete the screwworm protocol, if they are then examined by a veterinarian authorized to do 
so

applicable.

The NWS was found in a cow in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas, at an inspection checkpoint close to the border with Guatemala. NWS are fly larvae that infest living tissue of warm-blooded animals, causing infection. “Given the northward movement of NWS, APHIS has in recent months stepped up its efforts in Central America to partner with impacted countries to push this pest out of newly affected areas,” said Dr. Rosemary Sifford, Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States. “With this latest find in Mexico, we will further intensify this work to protect American agriculture and reestablish the barrier in Central America.” Given the severity of the threat from NWS, APHIS is restricting the importation of animal commodities 1 originating from or transiting Mexico effective immediately and pending further information from Mexican veterinary authorities on the size and scope of the infestation. A complete list of regions APHIS recognizes as affected by screwworm and well as more detailed information on trade restrictions can be found on the USDA APHIS Animal Health Status of Regions website. NWS maggots can infest livestock and other warm-blooded animals, including people. They most often enter an animal through an open wound and feed on the animal’s living flesh. While they can fly much farther under ideal conditions, adult flies generally

orm and well as more detailed information on trade restrictions can be found on the USDA APHIS Animal Health Status of Regions website. NWS maggots can infest livestock and other warm-blooded animals, including people. They most often enter an animal through an open wound and feed on the animal’s living flesh. While they can fly much farther under ideal conditions, adult flies generally do not travel more than a couple of miles if there are suitable host animals in the area. APHIS is working with partners in Mexico and Central America to stop the spread of NWS into the United States and asking all producers along the southern border to watch their livestock and pets for signs of NWS and immediately report potential cases. Screwworm infestations are difficult to detect at first. Check your pets and livestock for draining or enlarging wounds, and signs of discomfort. Also look for screwworm larvae or eggs. Screwworm eggs are creamy and white and are deposited on near the edges of superficial wounds. If you suspect your animal is infected with screwworm, contact your veterinarian. While not common in humans, if you notice a suspicious lesion on your body or suspect you may have contracted screwworms, seek immediate medical attention. Since 2006, APHIS has collaborated with Panama to maintain a barrier zone in eastern Panama, working to prevent the northward movement of NWS from South America to NWS-free areas in Central and North America. In the last two years, screwworm has spread north of the barrier throughout Panama and into Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and now Mexico. This increase is due to multiple factors including new areas of farming in previous barrier regions for fly control and increased cattle movements into the region. APHIS is releasing sterile flies through aerial and ground release at strategic locations throughout Central America.
