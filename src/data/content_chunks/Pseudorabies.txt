Introduction 
 
These Program Standards were adopted for the eradication of pseudorabies from all domestic swine in 
the United States.  These are the minimum standards developed by the Veterinary Services division of the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), and endorsed by swine health practitioners and State animal health officials at the annual 
meeting of the United States Animal Health Association in October 2003.

meeting of the United States Animal Health Association in October 2003. 
 
The following list highlights changes adopted in this version of the Program Standards.  
 
Throughout the document, “National Pork Board” has replaced “National Pork Producers Council.” 
 
Part I, Definitions 
 
Definitions have been added for commercial production swine, confirmed case, feral or wild swine, and 
transitional production swine. 
 
Part II, Administrative Procedures 
 
Sec. B., when entering and while on a premises, biosecurity procedures must be used by Program 
personnel.  
 
Sec. G., only the original Application for Program entry and advancement in status is required to be sent to 
the National Center for Animal Health Programs staff for approval.  No additional copies are necessary. 
 
Sec. I., a new section is added about the procedure for changing the Program Standards.  
 
Part III, Stage I (Preparation) 
 
Sec. A.6., State progress and activity reports are now required to be produced monthly.  
 
Part III, Stage IV (Surveillance)  
 
Sec. A.4., a new subsection is added that requires states to develop and adopt a management plan that 
adequately separates and controls the interface of feral and transitional production swine with commercial 
production swine.

Sec. A.4., a new subsection is added that requires states to develop and adopt a management plan that 
adequately separates and controls the interface of feral and transitional production swine with commercial 
production swine. 
 
Sec. G., now requires that only confirmed cases of pseudorabies in commercial production swine be 
reported immediately to Veterinary Services for action.  Additionally, after a confirmed case is identified in 
commercial production swine, all movement of swine from herds withing a five-mile radius of the case and 
from exposed herds must be stopped until such herds are tested and found to be negative using an official 
random sample test (95/5); and this testing must be completed within 15 days of identifying the infected 
herd. 
 
Part III, Stage V (Free)  
 
Sec.B.6. now requires states to develop and adopt a management plan that adequately separates and 
controls the interface of feral and transitional production swine with commercial production swine. 
 
Sec. C., now requires that only confirmed cases of pseudorabies in commercial production swine be 
reported immediately to Veterinary Services for action.  Additionally, after a confirmed case is identified in 
commercial production swine, all movement of swine from herds withing a five-mile radius of the case and 
from exposed herds must be stopped until such herds are tested and found to be negative using an official 
random sample test (95/5); and this testing must be completed within 15 days of identifying the infected

State or Federal Program officials should notify swine owners in the immediate 
community within 30 days after a swine herd has been quarantined for pseudorabies.  
Program officials should also notify herd owners in the immediate community when they 
grant approval for a quarantined feedlot.  Notification may be by an educational letter 
emphasizing the importance of taking appropriate actions to protect swine against 
pseudorabies.  When the herd quarantine is released or the approval of the quarant

ined for pseudorabies.  
Program officials should also notify herd owners in the immediate community when they 
grant approval for a quarantined feedlot.  Notification may be by an educational letter 
emphasizing the importance of taking appropriate actions to protect swine against 
pseudorabies.  When the herd quarantine is released or the approval of the quarantined 
feedlot is terminated, herd owners should be notified within 30 days by an informational 
letter. 
 
E. Dealers—Registration and Recordkeeping 
 
The following dealers (individuals or other legal entities) of swine must be registered or 
licensed with the appropriate State agency:  
 
• Dealers who purchase, deal in, or sell swine; 
• Dealers who act as commission representatives or brokers; 
• Dealers who operate and conduct an auction where swine are sold. 
 
These dealers must maintain records required by the licensing agency to make it 
possible for State authorities to trace swine to their herds of origin or destination. 
 
1. Registering dealers —After giving due notice and opportunity for a hearing to the 
dealer involved, the State agency must have the authority to deny an 
application for registration, or to suspend or cancel the registration, when the 
 
 14 
agency is satisfied of either or both of the following: 
 
a. There is adequate evidence to establis h that the dealer had the intent to 
violate or circumvent recordkeeping requirements of this section and/or 
other animal health regulations; 
 
b. The dealer has repeatedly demonstrated failure to keep records adequate 
to trace his swine sales and purchases. 
 
2. Keeping records —Each registered or licensed swine dealer must keep sufficient 
records of all swine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 had the intent to 
violate or circumvent recordkeeping requirements of this section and/or 
other animal health regulations; 
 
b. The dealer has repeatedly demonstrated failure to keep records adequate 
to trace his swine sales and purchases. 
 
2. Keeping records —Each registered or licensed swine dealer must keep sufficient 
records of all swine purchased for resale to enable the State agency to trace 
purchased animals satisfactorily to their herds of origin and destination.  The 
records must be kept for a minimum of 2 years. 
 
3. Dealing with violations —State animal health officials must have the authority to 
enforce compliance with dealer registration and recordkeeping requirements.  
This includes the authority to subpoena appropriate records and/or persons who 
allegedly violate these minimum standards.  The appropriate State officials must 
also have authority to petition the local court that has venue for an order to 
enforce these subpoenas. 
 
F.  Administrative review of Program activities 
 
Appropriate Veterinary Services personnel will review the progress of State/Area 
pseudorabies programs on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the Program 
Standards. 
 
G.  Application for Program status 
 
Application for Program entry and advancement in status, jointly signed by the State 
animal health official and Veterinarian-in-Charge, along with required documentation, 
must be submitted to the Veterinary Services National Center for Animal Health 
Programs, Pseudorabies Eradication Program staff for approval. The application shall 
be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies Control Board prior to a final decision by the 
Deputy Administrator.

Programs, Pseudorabies Eradication Program staff for approval. The application shall 
be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies Control Board prior to a final decision by the 
Deputy Administrator. 
 
H.  Other movements 
 
The State Veterinarian may, upon request in specific cases, permit the movement of 
livestock not otherwise provided for in these Program Standards to prevent the spread 
of pseudorabies virus.  It is the intention of these Standards that such authority be used 
only in situations and under circumstances that could not have been reasonably 
anticipated in advance.  It is not the intention that such authority be used repeatedly to 
cover the same problem, but that the Program Standards be amended to conform with 
needed changes as they come to light. 
 
 15 
 
I.  Changes to the Program Standards 
 
All proposed changes to Program Standards must first be reviewed and approved by 
the Pseudorabies Program Standards Committee, a subcommittee of the United States 
Animal Health Association (USAHA) Pseudorabies Committee.  Proposed changes 
must then be reviewed and approved by the full USAHA Pseudorabies Committee 
during the annual USAHA meeting.  Proposed changes that are approved by the 
USAHA Pseudorabies Committee and included in the Pseudorabies Committee report 
will be forwarded as a recommendation for final approval to Veterinary Services, 
National Center for Animal Health Programs staff.

the pseudorabies epidemiologist, all swine in quarantined herds and all swine in herds 
located within 2 miles of a quarantined herd must be vaccinated for pseudorabies.  
States failing to recertify as required will be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies 
Control Board and may lose their Stage II status. 
 
 
Stage III—Mandatory Herd Cleanup  
 
In this stage, the cleanup of infected herds becomes mandatory.  The State 
pseudorabies committee shall provide time limits for developing and completing official 
pseudorabies herd-cleanup plans in conformity with Section C.  An official pseudorabies 
epidemiologist will consult with the herd owner and his or her veterinary practitioner, 
when applicable, to develop a mutually acceptable official pseudorabies herd-cleanup.  
This plan should be based on the strategies outlined in the Livestock Conservation 
Institute's Swine Pseudorabies Eradication Guidelines.  The attending accredited 
veterinarian should play a major role in selecting and implementing herd-cleanup plans. 
 Pseudorabies prevalence in the affected community must be determined for all groups 
of swine, including swine in feedlots. 
 
A. To qualify for Stage III recognition, the application for Program status shall 
provide documentation as follows:

 accredited 
veterinarian should play a major role in selecting and implementing herd-cleanup plans. 
 Pseudorabies prevalence in the affected community must be determined for all groups 
of swine, including swine in feedlots. 
 
A. To qualify for Stage III recognition, the application for Program status shall 
provide documentation as follows: 
 
1. The standards of Stage II are implem ented and, with the endorsement of the 
State pseudorabies committee, the State animal health official is implementing 
mandatory herd-cleanup procedures. 
 
 
 21 
2. Epidemiology 
 
a. Swine movements into and out of infe cted premises or premises suspected 
of being infected are traced, and the status of receiving and source herds is 
appropriately established by either a test of all breeding swine or an official 
random-sample test. 
 
b. All swine units, including feedlots within a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) radius of 
infected premises, are monitored either by a test of all breeding swine or by 
an official random-sample test. 
 
c. The State prevalence of infected herds is 1 percent or less, based on 
surveillance testing that meets the requirements of section 3, below. 
 
3. Surveillance 
 
a. Surveillance by slaughter or first-point testing: 
 
At least 10 percent of the breeding swine population is surveyed annually 
using an official pseudorabies serologic test with at least 80-percent 
successful traceback of seropositives to the farm of origin, or testing and 
traceback to achieve a surveillance index of 0.08.  Current data from the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
At least 10 percent of the breeding swine population is surveyed annually 
using an official pseudorabies serologic test with at least 80-percent 
successful traceback of seropositives to the farm of origin, or testing and 
traceback to achieve a surveillance index of 0.08.  Current data from the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, on breeding swine 
populations will be used to calculate surveillance data.  The surveillance 
program must be random and must be representative of all herds in the 
State.  Tests of swine from premises currently known to be infected may not 
be included in totals to meet the requirements of this section. 
 
Only two specific forms of surveillance testing may be included in the 
surveillance index calculation:  (1) samples collected at slaughter, and (2) 
samples collected at markets (first point). 
 
If sows and boars from herds tested for other purposes (e.g., feeder-pig 
monitoring, circle testing, etc.) can be eliminated from the population being 
tested at slaughter or first point, then the number of sows in such herds can 
be deducted from the population to be sampled for surveillance.  
Applications for status for States/Areas taking advantage of this provision 
must explain how this is being accomplished. 
 
b. Surveillance by herd testing: 
 
If an official random sample test (95/10) or a monitored herd test is used, 25 
percent of the herds or 10 percent of the breeding swine in the Stage III 
area must be tested annually. 
 
 
 22 
If an official random-sample test (95/20) is used, 33 percent of the herds in 
the Stage III area must be tested annually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) or a monitored herd test is used, 25 
percent of the herds or 10 percent of the breeding swine in the Stage III 
area must be tested annually. 
 
 
 22 
If an official random-sample test (95/20) is used, 33 percent of the herds in 
the Stage III area must be tested annually. 
 
Herds to be tested must be selected randomly during the surveillance 
period.  Herds are eligible for selection when more than 12 months have 
elapsed since the last herd test.  Quarantined herds are not eligible for 
selection. 
 
4. Vaccination 
 
Vaccination may be permitted by the State animal health official as part of an 
approved herd-cleanup plan and in area control programs. 
 
5. Transmission of pseudorabies virus from wild or feral swine shall be controlled 
as follows: 
 
Regulations to prevent virus transmission from wild or feral to domestic swine 
within the State are implemented.  
 
B. During Stage III:  
 
1. Information and education efforts are intensified. 
 
2. The effectiveness of regulations is monitored, and enforcement is strengthened 
as necessary. 
 
3. Industry commitment for Program advancement is secured. 
 
4. Epidemiologic evaluation of Program activities is utilized. 
 
5. Swine may not be moved from a quar antined herd to any location within a 
Stage III area unless part of the herd was at this location when the original herd 
quarantine was issued or such movement is required as part of an approved 
herd-cleanup plan. 
 
C. Disposition of quarantined herds  
Owners of quarantined herds must complete their cleanup plans and

C. Disposition of quarantined herds  
Owners of quarantined herds must complete their cleanup plans and fulfill the 
requirements for quarantine release as follows: 
 
Quarantines issued before January 1, 1997, must be released by January 1, 
1999. 
 
Quarantines issued during 1997 must be released within 24 months from the 
quarantine date. 
 
 
 23 
Quarantines issued after January 1, 1998, must be released by January 1, 
2000. 
 
These time frames must be included in all herd-cleanup plans. 
 
D. Duration of status  
 
Twelve to 14 months following assignment of Stage III status by Veterinary Services, a 
State/Area must (1) certify that it meets the requirements of a higher program stage, or 
(2) indicate that it continues to meet Stage III requirements, utilizing the same 
certification procedure as followed initially, and demonstrate progress in herd cleanup 
consistent with the goal of eradication by the year 2000, by, at a minimum, meeting the 
following  provisions:  (A) herd-cleanup plans written on all herds within 30 days of 
quarantine; (B) all herd plans reviewed semiannually and revised as necessary; (C) all

pseudorabies virus, no additions of swine may be made to the premises until the 
quarantine is released; (E) unless otherwise determined by the State Veterinarian and 
the pseudorabies epidemiologist, all swine in quarantined herds and all swine in herds 
located within 2 miles of a quarantined herd must be vaccinated for pseudorabies.  
States failing to recertify as required will be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies 
Control Board and may lose their Stage III status. 
 
In the event that the prevalence of infected herds exceeds 1 percent at any time during 
the recertification period, the national coordinator for Veterinary Services shall be 
notified immediately.  Such notification shall be followed by a written explanation for 
review and consideration by the National Pseudorabies Control Board.

(2) That the swine be restricted to the designated feedlot until they are 
sent to slaughter. 
 
F. Intrastate swine movements —no restrictions.  
 
G. Duration of status  
 
 
 26 
Twelve to 14 months following assignment of Stage IV status by Veterinary 
Services, a State/Area must (1) indicate that it continues to meet the Stage IV 
requirements, utilizing the same certification procedures as followed initially, or (2) 
certify that it meets the requirements of another Program Stage.  States/Areas 
failing to recertify as required will automatically lose their Stage IV status. 
 
In the event of a confirmed case of pseudorabies in commercial production swine, 
the national program coordinator for Veterinary Services shall be notified 
immediately, and the county or counties within a 2-mile radius of the new case will 
revert to Stage III status (except as noted below) until 60 days following cleanup 
and quarantine release.  During the 60 days following quarantine release, and 
before Stage IV status is reinstated, all exposed herds and all swine herds within 2 
miles of the new case must be tested with an official random sample test (95/5) and 
be found negative. 
 
The national pseudorabies coordinator and

 until 60 days following cleanup 
and quarantine release.  During the 60 days following quarantine release, and 
before Stage IV status is reinstated, all exposed herds and all swine herds within 2 
miles of the new case must be tested with an official random sample test (95/5) and 
be found negative. 
 
The national pseudorabies coordinator and officials from the State where a 
confirmed case in commercial production swine occurs must notify all 50 states 
within 24 hours.  Such notification is to include the location of the break and the 
circumstances surrounding the case, including herd size, clinical signs, and type of 
herd. 
 
Immediately after a confirmed case is identified in commercial production swine, all 
movement of swine from herds within a five-mile radius of the case and from 
exposed herds must be stopped until such herds are tested and found to be 
negative using an official random sample test (95/5).  Testing must be completed 
within 15 days of identifying the infected herd. 
 
If one or more counties revert to Stage III, animal health officials from the State 
where a confirmed case occurs in commercial production swine must immediately 
notify producers and veterinarians that breeding swine from the affected counties 
must again be tested for pseudorabies within 30 days prior to interstate shipment. 
 
If the newly infected herd is isolated and disposed of within 15 days after test results 
are reported to State animal health officials, and there is no spread to additional 
premises as determined by testing of all exposed herds and all swine herds within 2 
miles of the new case with an official random sample test (95/5), Stage IV status 
may be maintained.  Testing of the above herds must be accomplished, with 
negative results, no

miles of the new case with an official random sample test (95/5), Stage IV status 
may be maintained.  Testing of the above herds must be accomplished, with 
negative results, no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after cleanup. 
 
 
 
 
Stage V—Free 
 
This is the stage in which a State is declared pseudorabies free. 
 
 27 
 
A. To qualify for this final surveillance stage, the application for Program status 
shall provide evidence that the State is implementing the standards of Stage 
IV. 
 
B. In addition, the State must document that:  
 
1. The State has been free of pseudorabies for 1 year since recognition of Stage 
IV status. 
 
2. Surveillance of breeding herds has been continued at one-half the rate required 
for Stage III and Stage IV.  Once all States have achieved Stage IV or V status, 
surveillance will no longer be required to maintain Stage V status in states that 
have maintained Stage V status for five consecutive years, have had no 
confirmed cases of pseudorabies during the same period, and have 
demonstrated that no feral swine exist in the state. 
 
3. Swine imports are controlled as follows: 
 
a. Slaughter swine —same as Stage IV; 
 
b. Breeding swine —same as Stage IV; 
 
c. Feeder pigs —same as Stage IV.

certain high-risk herds. 
 
5. Intrastate swine movements—no restrictions. 
 
6. States must develop and adopt a m anagement plan that adequately separates 
and addresses controls of the interface of feral and transitional production 
swine with commercial production swine.  The plan is to be reviewed by the 
Control Board and Veterinary Services, National Center for Animal Health 
Programs staff. 
 
C.  Duration of status 
 
Twelve to 14 months following assignment of Stage V status by Veterinary 
Services, a State/Area must indicate that it continues to meet Stage V 
requirements, utilizing the same certification as followed initially.  States/Areas 
failing to recertify as required will automatically lose their Stage V status. 
 
In the event of a confirmed case of pseudorabies in commercial production swine, 
the national program coordinator for Veterinary Services shall be notified

Part IV—Participation in Herd Plans and Release of Quarantines 
 
Subpart I—The Qualified Pseudorabies-Negative Herd 
 
A. Establishment of a qualified pse udorabies-negative (QN) breeding herd: 
 
1. For breeding herds, QN status is atta ined by (1) subjecting to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test all swine over 6 months of age plus a number of 
progeny equal to 20 percent of the breeding swine population of the herd, and 
(2) finding that all swine are negative to the test.  Progeny shall be randomly 
selected from swine between 4 and 6 months of age.  The herd must not have 
been a known infected herd within the 30 days prior to the qualifying test.  A 
minimum of 90 percent of the swine in the herd must have been on the 
premises and a part of the herd for at least 60 days prior to the qualifying official 
pseudorabies serologic test or have entered by direct shipment from another 
 
 29 
QN herd. 
 
2. When all swine are shipped directly fr om existing QN herds, a new QN breeding 
herd may be established if, within 30 days of arrival, all swine in the initial 
shipment (up to 50 animals) are tested and found negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test.

2. When all swine are shipped directly fr om existing QN herds, a new QN breeding 
herd may be established if, within 30 days of arrival, all swine in the initial 
shipment (up to 50 animals) are tested and found negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test. 
 
3. Any breeding herd in a Stage IV or V State/Area is recognized as a QN herd. 
 
B. QN breeding herd status may be maintained by monthly or quarterly 
pseudorabies testing as follows: 
 
1. Monthly testing: 
 
a. Every 30 days, conduct an official pseudorabies serologic test of 7 percent 
of all breeding swine 6 months of age or older, and test a number of 
offspring 4 to 6 months of age located on the same premises as the 
breeding herd equal to 2 percent of the breeding animals in the herd, or 
 
b. On approval of the State Veteri narian, herds in Stage III, IV, or V 
States/Areas may maintain status on the basis of a monthly negative official 
random sample test (95/5) in each separate population of breeding swine 
on a premises, and a monthly test of 50 offspring 4 to 6 months of age 
located on the same premises as the breeding herd.  Sampling in the 
population must be random and the testing protocol in the herd must be a 
part of the approval.  Progeny must be selected at random from all groups 
on the premises. 
 
c. Progeny testing on multisite herds is covered in item D. on pages 25 –26 
regarding establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on 
which no adult

part of the approval.  Progeny must be selected at random from all groups 
on the premises. 
 
c. Progeny testing on multisite herds is covered in item D. on pages 25 –26 
regarding establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on 
which no adult breeding swine are maintained. 
 
2. Quarterly testing: 
 
a. Every 80 to 105 days, conduct an official pseudorabies serologic test of 20 
percent of all breeding swine 6 months of age or older, and test a number of 
offspring 4 to 6 months of age located on the same premises as the 
breeding herd equal to 6 percent of the breeding animals in the herd. 
 
b. Progeny testing on multisite herds is covered in item D. on pages 25 –26 
regarding establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on 
which no adult breeding swine are maintained. 
 
3. All swine tested shall be randomly select ed and, in the case of the adult swine, 
representative of all age groups on the premises.

4. All swine intended to be added to a QN herd shall be isolated until they are 
negative to an official pseudorabies serologic test conducted 30 days or more 
following their placement in isolation except: 
 
a. Swine from a herd of unknown status must be negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test not more than 30 days prior to movement, with 
a second test in isolation at least 30 days after movement. 
 
b. Swine intended to augment a QN herd and coming directly from another 
QN herd may be added without isolation or testing
Text Len: 1549
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Swine from a herd of unknown status must be negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test not more than 30 days prior to movement, with 
a second test in isolation at least 30 days after movement. 
 
b. Swine intended to augment a QN herd and coming directly from another 
QN herd may be added without isolation or testing. 
 
c. Swine intended to be added to a QN herd from another QN herd, but with 
interim contact with swine other than those from a QN herd, shall be 
isolated until they have been found negative to an official pseudorabies 
serologic test, conducted 30 days or more after the swine have been placed 
in isolation. 
 
C. Reestablishment of QN breeding herd status following confirmation of 
infection in the herd  
 
1. A QN herd that has been determined to  be infected with pseudorabies virus 
may qualify for reinstatement as a QN herd if: 
 
a. All swine in the herd 6 months of  age and over are negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test, and 
 
b. An official random-sample (95/10) test of progeny 2 –6 months of age is 
conducted and all swine tested are negative, and 
 
c. In 30 or more days, the testing described in a and b above is repeated. 
 
2. If on a qualifying official pseudorabies se rologic test or any subsequent official 
pseudorabies test, any swine test positive, QN herd status is suspended until 
the infection status of the herd is determined by an investigation conducted by 
an official pseudorabies epidemiologist. 
 
3. The

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 above is repeated. 
 
2. If on a qualifying official pseudorabies se rologic test or any subsequent official 
pseudorabies test, any swine test positive, QN herd status is suspended until 
the infection status of the herd is determined by an investigation conducted by 
an official pseudorabies epidemiologist. 
 
3. The official pseudorabies epidemiologist  will consider the following factors in 
determining the presence or absence of pseudorabies in the herd: 
 
a. The specific titers of titered swine; 
 
b. The percentage and number of titered swine; 
 
c. The vaccination history of titered swine; 
 
 31 
 
d. Proximity and pseudorabies virus infe ction status of  neighboring herds; 
 
e. The possibility of laboratory or  sample identification error; 
 
f. Other pertinent herd history and clinical signs. 
 
4. Based on the above information obtained by the official pseudorabies 
epidemiologist, a final determination of infection status will be made; however, 
before QN herd status may be attained or maintained, all seropositive swine 
must either: 
 
a. Be sold for slaughter, and a complete herd test conducted at least 30 days 
later must be negative; or 
 
b. Be negative to an official pseudorabies serologic test. 
 
D. Establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on which no adult 
breeding swine are maintained:

QN status may be attained and maintained by monthly negative official random sample 
tests (95/5) beginning within 30 days after establishment of the herd, except that in all-
in/all-out units, 1 test of 50 head is required of each group.  If herds A, B, and C are in 
the same State and program stage, this testing is not required. 
 
Herd C 
QN status is attained by a negative official pseudorabies serologic test of the entire 
initial shipment or 50 head selected at random, whichever is less. 
 
QN status may be maintained by a monthly negative official pseudorabies serologic test

except that in all-in/all-out units, 1 test of 50 head is required of each group.  Each 
segregated group of swine on an individual premises must be considered a separate 
herd. 
 
Subpart II—The Qualified-Negative Gene-Altered Vaccinated (QNV) Herd  
 
Qualified-negative gene-altered vaccinated (QNV) herd status is attained and 
maintained under the same guidelines as for qualified pseudorabies-negative (QN) herd 
status, except that swine may be vaccinated with an approved gene-deleted 
pseudorabies virus vaccine, and testing may be completed using an official 
pseudorabies serologic test. 
 
Subpart III—The Pseudorabies-Monitored Feeder-Pig Herd 
 
A. Monitored status in Stage II States or Areas  
 
1. For breeding herds, pseudorabies-monitor ed feeder-pig status is attained when 
the herd has been sampled and was negative to an official pseudorabies 
serologic test during the last 12 months at the following rate: 
 
   10 head—test all  
11–35 head—test 10 
36 or more—test 30 percent or 30, whichever is less 
 
Tested breeding swine are to be selected at random from all age groups, 
including herd boars, and all age groups are to be proportionately represented.

2. An offsite nursery that is not other wise part of a pseudorabies-monitored herd, 
to which pigs have been moved within 1 week of weaning from pseudorabies-
monitored feeder-pig herds, may be recognized as a pseudorabies-monitored 
feeder-pig herd on the basis of a negative official random sample test (95/10) 
as determined by an official pseudorabies epidemiologist.  The required tests 
must be conducted within 30 days prior to movement out of the offsite nursery. 
 
An official random sample test (95/10) as determined by an official 
pseudorabies epidemiologist must be conducted on each group of pigs moving 
through the offsite nursery.  In the case of a continuous-flow facility, monthly 
tests (95/10) must be conducted. 
 
B. Monitored status in Stage III, IV, or V States or Areas  
 
1. Any breeding herd in a Stage III, IV, or V State or Area not known to be infected 
is recognized as a pseudorabies-monitored feeder-pig herd. 
 
 
 33 
2. Offsite nurseries in Stage III, IV, or V States or Areas shall be recognized as 
pseudorabies-monitored feeder-pig herds if all pigs in the nurseries come from

breeding herds in Stage III, IV, or V States or Areas.  If part of the pigs in the 
offsite nursery originate from a Stage II area, the nursery must be tested as 
outlined in Part A of this section. 
 
C. Monitored status in the vaccinated swine breeding herd is attained and 
maintained as outlined in parts A and B of this section. 
 
Subpart IV—Quarantine Release Procedures  
 
A herd of swine shall no longer be classified as a known infected herd when no livestock 
or other animals on the premises show clinical signs of pseudorabies after removal of 
the positive swine, and at least one of the four following conditions has been met.  
Additionally, if the herd is vaccinated, all vaccinates must be vaccinated with the same 
official gene-altered pseudorabies virus vaccine. 
 
A. All swine were removed from the premises; the premises were cleaned and 
disinfected under official supervision with a disinfectant approved by 
Veterinary Services for such use; and the premises have been maintained free 
of swine for 30 days or a period of time determined adequate by an official 
pseudorabies epidemiologist. 
 
B. All swine positive to an official p seudorabies serologic test or an approved 
differential pseudorabies test have been removed from the premises and all 
remaining swine, except suckling pigs, were subjected to an official (or

or more after removal of all positive swine. 
 
C. All swine positive to an official p seudorabies serologic test or an approved 
differential pseudorabies test have been removed from the premises; all 
breeding swine that remain in the herd and an official random sample (95/10) 
of grower-finishing swine over 2 months of age are subjected to an official (or 
approved differential) pseudorabies serologic test and found negative 30 days 
or more after removal of positive swine.  A second test of grower-finishing 
swine at least 30 days after the first is required if the State is in Stage III or IV 
of the Program. 
 
D. (Stage I, II, and III only)  All swine present on the date the quarantine was 
imposed have been removed, and there have been no clinical signs in the 
herd for at least 6 months.  Two successive official (or approved differential) 
random-sample (95/10) tests of the breeding herd [95/5 for Stage III States], 
conducted at least 90 days apart, have been determined by the official 
pseudorabies epidemiologist to reveal no infection, and two successive

Introduction 
 
These Program Standards were adopted for the eradication of pseudorabies from all domestic swine in 
the United States.  These are the minimum standards developed by the Veterinary Services division of the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), and endorsed by swine health practitioners and State animal health officials at the annual 
meeting of the United States Animal Health Association in October 2003.

meeting of the United States Animal Health Association in October 2003. 
 
The following list highlights changes adopted in this version of the Program Standards.  
 
Throughout the document, “National Pork Board” has replaced “National Pork Producers Council.” 
 
Part I, Definitions 
 
Definitions have been added for commercial production swine, confirmed case, feral or wild swine, and 
transitional production swine. 
 
Part II, Administrative Procedures 
 
Sec. B., when entering and while on a premises, biosecurity procedures must be used by Program 
personnel.  
 
Sec. G., only the original Application for Program entry and advancement in status is required to be sent to 
the National Center for Animal Health Programs staff for approval.  No additional copies are necessary. 
 
Sec. I., a new section is added about the procedure for changing the Program Standards.  
 
Part III, Stage I (Preparation) 
 
Sec. A.6., State progress and activity reports are now required to be produced monthly.  
 
Part III, Stage IV (Surveillance)  
 
Sec. A.4., a new subsection is added that requires states to develop and adopt a management plan that 
adequately separates and controls the interface of feral and transitional production swine with commercial 
production swine.

Sec. A.4., a new subsection is added that requires states to develop and adopt a management plan that 
adequately separates and controls the interface of feral and transitional production swine with commercial 
production swine. 
 
Sec. G., now requires that only confirmed cases of pseudorabies in commercial production swine be 
reported immediately to Veterinary Services for action.  Additionally, after a confirmed case is identified in 
commercial production swine, all movement of swine from herds withing a five-mile radius of the case and 
from exposed herds must be stopped until such herds are tested and found to be negative using an official 
random sample test (95/5); and this testing must be completed within 15 days of identifying the infected 
herd. 
 
Part III, Stage V (Free)  
 
Sec.B.6. now requires states to develop and adopt a management plan that adequately separates and 
controls the interface of feral and transitional production swine with commercial production swine. 
 
Sec. C., now requires that only confirmed cases of pseudorabies in commercial production swine be 
reported immediately to Veterinary Services for action.  Additionally, after a confirmed case is identified in 
commercial production swine, all movement of swine from herds withing a five-mile radius of the case and 
from exposed herds must be stopped until such herds are tested and found to be negative using an official 
random sample test (95/5); and this testing must be completed within 15 days of identifying the infected

pseudorabies.  When the herd quarantine is released or the approval of the quarantined 
feedlot is terminated, herd owners should be notified within 30 days by an informational 
letter. 
 
E. Dealers—Registration and Recordkeeping 
 
The following dealers (individuals or other legal entities) of swine must be registered or 
licensed with the appropriate State agency:  
 
• Dealers who purchase, deal in, or sell swine; 
• Dealers who act as commission representatives or brokers; 
• Dealers who operate and conduct an auction where swine are sold. 
 
These dealers must maintain records required by the licensing agency to make it 
possible for State authorities to trace swine to their herds of origin or destination. 
 
1. Registering dealers —After giving due notice and opportunity for a hearing to the 
dealer involved, the State agency must have the authority to deny an 
application for registration, or to suspend or cancel the registration, when the 
 
 14 
agency is satisfied of either or both of the following: 
 
a. There is adequate evidence to establis h that the dealer had the intent to 
violate or circumvent recordkeeping requirements of this section and/or 
other animal health regulations; 
 
b. The dealer has repeatedly demonstrated failure to keep records adequate 
to trace his swine sales and purchases. 
 
2. Keeping records —Each registered or licensed swine dealer must keep sufficient 
records of all swine
Text Len: 1723
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 had the intent to 
violate or circumvent recordkeeping requirements of this section and/or 
other animal health regulations; 
 
b. The dealer has repeatedly demonstrated failure to keep records adequate 
to trace his swine sales and purchases. 
 
2. Keeping records —Each registered or licensed swine dealer must keep sufficient 
records of all swine purchased for resale to enable the State agency to trace 
purchased animals satisfactorily to their herds of origin and destination.  The 
records must be kept for a minimum of 2 years. 
 
3. Dealing with violations —State animal health officials must have the authority to 
enforce compliance with dealer registration and recordkeeping requirements.  
This includes the authority to subpoena appropriate records and/or persons who 
allegedly violate these minimum standards.  The appropriate State officials must 
also have authority to petition the local court that has venue for an order to 
enforce these subpoenas. 
 
F.  Administrative review of Program activities 
 
Appropriate Veterinary Services personnel will review the progress of State/Area 
pseudorabies programs on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the Program 
Standards. 
 
G.  Application for Program status 
 
Application for Program entry and advancement in status, jointly signed by the State 
animal health official and Veterinarian-in-Charge, along with required documentation, 
must be submitted to the Veterinary Services National Center for Animal Health 
Programs, Pseudorabies Eradication Program staff for approval. The application shall 
be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies Control Board prior to a final decision by the 
Deputy Administrator.

Programs, Pseudorabies Eradication Program staff for approval. The application shall 
be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies Control Board prior to a final decision by the 
Deputy Administrator. 
 
H.  Other movements 
 
The State Veterinarian may, upon request in specific cases, permit the movement of 
livestock not otherwise provided for in these Program Standards to prevent the spread 
of pseudorabies virus.  It is the intention of these Standards that such authority be used 
only in situations and under circumstances that could not have been reasonably 
anticipated in advance.  It is not the intention that such authority be used repeatedly to 
cover the same problem, but that the Program Standards be amended to conform with 
needed changes as they come to light. 
 
 15 
 
I.  Changes to the Program Standards 
 
All proposed changes to Program Standards must first be reviewed and approved by 
the Pseudorabies Program Standards Committee, a subcommittee of the United States 
Animal Health Association (USAHA) Pseudorabies Committee.  Proposed changes 
must then be reviewed and approved by the full USAHA Pseudorabies Committee 
during the annual USAHA meeting.  Proposed changes that are approved by the 
USAHA Pseudorabies Committee and included in the Pseudorabies Committee report 
will be forwarded as a recommendation for final approval to Veterinary Services, 
National Center for Animal Health Programs staff.

pseudorabies virus, no additions of swine may be made to the premises until the 
quarantine is released; (E) unless otherwise determined by the State Veterinarian and 
the pseudorabies epidemiologist, all swine in quarantined herds and all swine in herds 
located within 2 miles of a quarantined herd must be vaccinated for pseudorabies.  
States failing to recertify as required will be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies 
Control Board and may lose their Stage II status. 
 
 
Stage III—Mandatory Herd Cleanup  
 
In this stage, the cleanup of infected herds becomes mandatory.  The State 
pseudorabies committee shall provide time limits for developing and completing official 
pseudorabies herd-cleanup plans in conformity with Section C.  An official pseudorabies 
epidemiologist will consult with the herd owner and his or her veterinary practitioner, 
when applicable, to develop a mutually acceptable official pseudorabies herd-cleanup.  
This plan should be based on the strategies outlined in the Livestock Conservation 
Institute's Swine Pseudorabies Eradication Guidelines.  The attending accredited 
veterinarian should play a major role in selecting and implementing herd-cleanup plans. 
 Pseudorabies prevalence in the affected community must be determined for all groups 
of swine, including swine in feedlots. 
 
A. To qualify for Stage III recognition, the application for Program status shall 
provide documentation as follows:

 accredited 
veterinarian should play a major role in selecting and implementing herd-cleanup plans. 
 Pseudorabies prevalence in the affected community must be determined for all groups 
of swine, including swine in feedlots. 
 
A. To qualify for Stage III recognition, the application for Program status shall 
provide documentation as follows: 
 
1. The standards of Stage II are implem ented and, with the endorsement of the 
State pseudorabies committee, the State animal health official is implementing 
mandatory herd-cleanup procedures. 
 
 
 21 
2. Epidemiology 
 
a. Swine movements into and out of infe cted premises or premises suspected 
of being infected are traced, and the status of receiving and source herds is 
appropriately established by either a test of all breeding swine or an official 
random-sample test. 
 
b. All swine units, including feedlots within a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) radius of 
infected premises, are monitored either by a test of all breeding swine or by 
an official random-sample test. 
 
c. The State prevalence of infected herds is 1 percent or less, based on 
surveillance testing that meets the requirements of section 3, below. 
 
3. Surveillance 
 
a. Surveillance by slaughter or first-point testing: 
 
At least 10 percent of the breeding swine population is surveyed annually 
using an official pseudorabies serologic test with at least 80-percent 
successful traceback of seropositives to the farm of origin, or testing and 
traceback to achieve a surveillance index of 0.08.  Current data from the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA

At least 10 percent of the breeding swine population is surveyed annually 
using an official pseudorabies serologic test with at least 80-percent 
successful traceback of seropositives to the farm of origin, or testing and 
traceback to achieve a surveillance index of 0.08.  Current data from the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, on breeding swine 
populations will be used to calculate surveillance data.  The surveillance 
program must be random and must be representative of all herds in the 
State.  Tests of swine from premises currently known to be infected may not 
be included in totals to meet the requirements of this section. 
 
Only two specific forms of surveillance testing may be included in the 
surveillance index calculation:  (1) samples collected at slaughter, and (2) 
samples collected at markets (first point). 
 
If sows and boars from herds tested for other purposes (e.g., feeder-pig 
monitoring, circle testing, etc.) can be eliminated from the population being 
tested at slaughter or first point, then the number of sows in such herds can 
be deducted from the population to be sampled for surveillance.  
Applications for status for States/Areas taking advantage of this provision 
must explain how this is being accomplished. 
 
b. Surveillance by herd testing: 
 
If an official random sample test (95/10) or a monitored herd test is used, 25 
percent of the herds or 10 percent of the breeding swine in the Stage III 
area must be tested annually. 
 
 
 22 
If an official random-sample test (95/20) is used, 33 percent of the herds in 
the Stage III area must be tested annually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) or a monitored herd test is used, 25 
percent of the herds or 10 percent of the breeding swine in the Stage III 
area must be tested annually. 
 
 
 22 
If an official random-sample test (95/20) is used, 33 percent of the herds in 
the Stage III area must be tested annually. 
 
Herds to be tested must be selected randomly during the surveillance 
period.  Herds are eligible for selection when more than 12 months have 
elapsed since the last herd test.  Quarantined herds are not eligible for 
selection. 
 
4. Vaccination 
 
Vaccination may be permitted by the State animal health official as part of an 
approved herd-cleanup plan and in area control programs. 
 
5. Transmission of pseudorabies virus from wild or feral swine shall be controlled 
as follows: 
 
Regulations to prevent virus transmission from wild or feral to domestic swine 
within the State are implemented.  
 
B. During Stage III:  
 
1. Information and education efforts are intensified. 
 
2. The effectiveness of regulations is monitored, and enforcement is strengthened 
as necessary. 
 
3. Industry commitment for Program advancement is secured. 
 
4. Epidemiologic evaluation of Program activities is utilized. 
 
5. Swine may not be moved from a quar antined herd to any location within a 
Stage III area unless part of the herd was at this location when the original herd 
quarantine was issued or such movement is required as part of an approved 
herd-cleanup plan. 
 
C. Disposition of quarantined herds  
Owners of quarantined herds must complete their cleanup plans and

C. Disposition of quarantined herds  
Owners of quarantined herds must complete their cleanup plans and fulfill the 
requirements for quarantine release as follows: 
 
Quarantines issued before January 1, 1997, must be released by January 1, 
1999. 
 
Quarantines issued during 1997 must be released within 24 months from the 
quarantine date. 
 
 
 23 
Quarantines issued after January 1, 1998, must be released by January 1, 
2000. 
 
These time frames must be included in all herd-cleanup plans. 
 
D. Duration of status  
 
Twelve to 14 months following assignment of Stage III status by Veterinary Services, a 
State/Area must (1) certify that it meets the requirements of a higher program stage, or 
(2) indicate that it continues to meet Stage III requirements, utilizing the same 
certification procedure as followed initially, and demonstrate progress in herd cleanup

pseudorabies virus, no additions of swine may be made to the premises until the 
quarantine is released; (E) unless otherwise determined by the State Veterinarian and 
the pseudorabies epidemiologist, all swine in quarantined herds and all swine in herds 
located within 2 miles of a quarantined herd must be vaccinated for pseudorabies.  
States failing to recertify as required will be reviewed by the National Pseudorabies 
Control Board and may lose their Stage III status. 
 
In the event that the prevalence of infected herds exceeds 1 percent at any time during 
the recertification period, the national coordinator for Veterinary Services shall be 
notified immediately.  Such notification shall be followed by a written explanation for 
review and consideration by the National Pseudorabies Control Board.

(2) That the swine be restricted to the designated feedlot until they are 
sent to slaughter. 
 
F. Intrastate swine movements —no restrictions.  
 
G. Duration of status  
 
 
 26 
Twelve to 14 months following assignment of Stage IV status by Veterinary 
Services, a State/Area must (1) indicate that it continues to meet the Stage IV 
requirements, utilizing the same certification procedures as followed initially, or (2) 
certify that it meets the requirements of another Program Stage.  States/Areas 
failing to recertify as required will automatically lose their Stage IV status. 
 
In the event of a confirmed case of pseudorabies in commercial production swine, 
the national program coordinator for Veterinary Services shall be notified 
immediately, and the county or counties within a 2-mile radius of the new case will 
revert to Stage III status (except as noted below) until 60 days following cleanup 
and quarantine release.  During the 60 days following quarantine release, and 
before Stage IV status is reinstated, all exposed herds and all swine herds within 2 
miles of the new case must be tested with an official random sample test (95/5) and 
be found negative.

and quarantine release.  During the 60 days following quarantine release, and 
before Stage IV status is reinstated, all exposed herds and all swine herds within 2 
miles of the new case must be tested with an official random sample test (95/5) and 
be found negative. 
 
The national pseudorabies coordinator and officials from the State where a 
confirmed case in commercial production swine occurs must notify all 50 states 
within 24 hours.  Such notification is to include the location of the break and the 
circumstances surrounding the case, including herd size, clinical signs, and type of 
herd. 
 
Immediately after a confirmed case is identified in commercial production swine, all 
movement of swine from herds within a five-mile radius of the case and from 
exposed herds must be stopped until such herds are tested and found to be 
negative using an official random sample test (95/5).  Testing must be completed 
within 15 days of identifying the infected herd. 
 
If one or more counties revert to Stage III, animal health officials from the State 
where a confirmed case occurs in commercial production swine must immediately 
notify producers and veterinarians that breeding swine from the affected counties 
must again be tested for pseudorabies within 30 days prior to interstate shipment. 
 
If the newly infected herd is isolated and disposed of within 15 days after test results 
are reported to State animal health officials, and there is no spread to additional 
premises as determined by testing of all exposed herds and all swine herds within 2 
miles of the new case with an official random sample test (95/5), Stage IV status 
may be maintained.  Testing of the above herds must be accomplished, with 
negative results, no

may be maintained.  Testing of the above herds must be accomplished, with 
negative results, no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after cleanup. 
 
 
 
 
Stage V—Free 
 
This is the stage in which a State is declared pseudorabies free. 
 
 27 
 
A. To qualify for this final surveillance stage, the application for Program status 
shall provide evidence that the State is implementing the standards of Stage 
IV. 
 
B. In addition, the State must document that:  
 
1. The State has been free of pseudorabies for 1 year since recognition of Stage 
IV status. 
 
2. Surveillance of breeding herds has been continued at one-half the rate required 
for Stage III and Stage IV.  Once all States have achieved Stage IV or V status, 
surveillance will no longer be required to maintain Stage V status in states that 
have maintained Stage V status for five consecutive years, have had no 
confirmed cases of pseudorabies during the same period, and have 
demonstrated that no feral swine exist in the state. 
 
3. Swine imports are controlled as follows: 
 
a. Slaughter swine —same as Stage IV; 
 
b. Breeding swine —same as Stage IV; 
 
c. Feeder pigs —same as Stage IV.

certain high-risk herds. 
 
5. Intrastate swine movements—no restrictions. 
 
6. States must develop and adopt a m anagement plan that adequately separates 
and addresses controls of the interface of feral and transitional production 
swine with commercial production swine.  The plan is to be reviewed by the 
Control Board and Veterinary Services, National Center for Animal Health 
Programs staff. 
 
C.  Duration of status 
 
Twelve to 14 months following assignment of Stage V status by Veterinary 
Services, a State/Area must indicate that it continues to meet Stage V 
requirements, utilizing the same certification as followed initially.  States/Areas 
failing to recertify as required will automatically lose their Stage V status. 
 
In the event of a confirmed case of pseudorabies in commercial production swine,

Part IV—Participation in Herd Plans and Release of Quarantines 
 
Subpart I—The Qualified Pseudorabies-Negative Herd 
 
A. Establishment of a qualified pse udorabies-negative (QN) breeding herd: 
 
1. For breeding herds, QN status is atta ined by (1) subjecting to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test all swine over 6 months of age plus a number of 
progeny equal to 20 percent of the breeding swine population of the herd, and 
(2) finding that all swine are negative to the test.  Progeny shall be randomly 
selected from swine between 4 and 6 months of age.  The herd must not have 
been a known infected herd within the 30 days prior to the qualifying test.  A 
minimum of 90 percent of the swine in the herd must have been on the 
premises and a part of the herd for at least 60 days prior to the qualifying official 
pseudorabies serologic test or have entered by direct shipment from another 
 
 29 
QN herd. 
 
2. When all swine are shipped directly fr om existing QN herds, a new QN breeding 
herd may be established if, within 30 days of arrival, all swine in the initial 
shipment (up to 50 animals) are tested and found negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test.

QN herd. 
 
2. When all swine are shipped directly fr om existing QN herds, a new QN breeding 
herd may be established if, within 30 days of arrival, all swine in the initial 
shipment (up to 50 animals) are tested and found negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test. 
 
3. Any breeding herd in a Stage IV or V State/Area is recognized as a QN herd. 
 
B. QN breeding herd status may be maintained by monthly or quarterly 
pseudorabies testing as follows: 
 
1. Monthly testing: 
 
a. Every 30 days, conduct an official pseudorabies serologic test of 7 percent 
of all breeding swine 6 months of age or older, and test a number of 
offspring 4 to 6 months of age located on the same premises as the 
breeding herd equal to 2 percent of the breeding animals in the herd, or 
 
b. On approval of the State Veteri narian, herds in Stage III, IV, or V 
States/Areas may maintain status on the basis of a monthly negative official 
random sample test (95/5) in each separate population of breeding swine 
on a premises, and a monthly test of 50 offspring 4 to 6 months of age 
located on the same premises as the breeding herd.  Sampling in the 
population must be random and the testing protocol in the herd must be a 
part of the approval.  Progeny must be selected at random from all groups 
on the premises. 
 
c. Progeny testing on multisite herds is covered in item D. on pages 25 –26 
regarding establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on 
which no adult

part of the approval.  Progeny must be selected at random from all groups 
on the premises. 
 
c. Progeny testing on multisite herds is covered in item D. on pages 25 –26 
regarding establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on 
which no adult breeding swine are maintained. 
 
2. Quarterly testing: 
 
a. Every 80 to 105 days, conduct an official pseudorabies serologic test of 20 
percent of all breeding swine 6 months of age or older, and test a number of 
offspring 4 to 6 months of age located on the same premises as the 
breeding herd equal to 6 percent of the breeding animals in the herd. 
 
b. Progeny testing on multisite herds is covered in item D. on pages 25 –26 
regarding establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on 
which no adult breeding swine are maintained. 
 
3. All swine tested shall be randomly select ed and, in the case of the adult swine, 
representative of all age groups on the premises.

4. All swine intended to be added to a QN herd shall be isolated until they are 
negative to an official pseudorabies serologic test conducted 30 days or more 
following their placement in isolation except: 
 
a. Swine from a herd of unknown status must be negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test not more than 30 days prior to movement, with 
a second test in isolation at least 30 days after movement. 
 
b. Swine intended to augment a QN herd and coming directly from another 
QN herd may be added without isolation or testing
Text Len: 1549
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Swine from a herd of unknown status must be negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test not more than 30 days prior to movement, with 
a second test in isolation at least 30 days after movement. 
 
b. Swine intended to augment a QN herd and coming directly from another 
QN herd may be added without isolation or testing. 
 
c. Swine intended to be added to a QN herd from another QN herd, but with 
interim contact with swine other than those from a QN herd, shall be 
isolated until they have been found negative to an official pseudorabies 
serologic test, conducted 30 days or more after the swine have been placed 
in isolation. 
 
C. Reestablishment of QN breeding herd status following confirmation of 
infection in the herd  
 
1. A QN herd that has been determined to  be infected with pseudorabies virus 
may qualify for reinstatement as a QN herd if: 
 
a. All swine in the herd 6 months of  age and over are negative to an official 
pseudorabies serologic test, and 
 
b. An official random-sample (95/10) test of progeny 2 –6 months of age is 
conducted and all swine tested are negative, and 
 
c. In 30 or more days, the testing described in a and b above is repeated. 
 
2. If on a qualifying official pseudorabies se rologic test or any subsequent official 
pseudorabies test, any swine test positive, QN herd status is suspended until 
the infection status of the herd is determined by an investigation conducted by 
an official pseudorabies epidemiologist. 
 
3. The

 above is repeated. 
 
2. If on a qualifying official pseudorabies se rologic test or any subsequent official 
pseudorabies test, any swine test positive, QN herd status is suspended until 
the infection status of the herd is determined by an investigation conducted by 
an official pseudorabies epidemiologist. 
 
3. The official pseudorabies epidemiologist  will consider the following factors in 
determining the presence or absence of pseudorabies in the herd: 
 
a. The specific titers of titered swine; 
 
b. The percentage and number of titered swine; 
 
c. The vaccination history of titered swine; 
 
 31 
 
d. Proximity and pseudorabies virus infe ction status of  neighboring herds; 
 
e. The possibility of laboratory or  sample identification error; 
 
f. Other pertinent herd history and clinical signs. 
 
4. Based on the above information obtained by the official pseudorabies 
epidemiologist, a final determination of infection status will be made; however, 
before QN herd status may be attained or maintained, all seropositive swine 
must either: 
 
a. Be sold for slaughter, and a complete herd test conducted at least 30 days 
later must be negative; or 
 
b. Be negative to an official pseudorabies serologic test. 
 
D. Establishment and maintenance of QN growout premises on which no adult 
breeding swine are maintained:

except that in all-in/all-out units, 1 test of 50 head is required of each group.  Each 
segregated group of swine on an individual premises must be considered a separate 
herd. 
 
Subpart II—The Qualified-Negative Gene-Altered Vaccinated (QNV) Herd  
 
Qualified-negative gene-altered vaccinated (QNV) herd status is attained and 
maintained under the same guidelines as for qualified pseudorabies-negative (QN) herd 
status, except that swine may be vaccinated with an approved gene-deleted 
pseudorabies virus vaccine, and testing may be completed using an official 
pseudorabies serologic test. 
 
Subpart III—The Pseudorabies-Monitored Feeder-Pig Herd 
 
A. Monitored status in Stage II States or Areas  
 
1. For breeding herds, pseudorabies-monitor ed feeder-pig status is attained when 
the herd has been sampled and was negative to an official pseudorabies 
serologic test during the last 12 months at the following rate: 
 
   10 head—test all  
11–35 head—test 10 
36 or more—test 30 percent or 30, whichever is less 
 
Tested breeding swine are to be selected at random from all age groups, 
including herd boars, and all age groups are to be proportionately represented.

including herd boars, and all age groups are to be proportionately represented. 
 
2. An offsite nursery that is not other wise part of a pseudorabies-monitored herd, 
to which pigs have been moved within 1 week of weaning from pseudorabies-
monitored feeder-pig herds, may be recognized as a pseudorabies-monitored 
feeder-pig herd on the basis of a negative official random sample test (95/10) 
as determined by an official pseudorabies epidemiologist.  The required tests 
must be conducted within 30 days prior to movement out of the offsite nursery. 
 
An official random sample test (95/10) as determined by an official 
pseudorabies epidemiologist must be conducted on each group of pigs moving 
through the offsite nursery.  In the case of a continuous-flow facility, monthly 
tests (95/10) must be conducted. 
 
B. Monitored status in Stage III, IV, or V States or Areas  
 
1. Any breeding herd in a Stage III, IV, or V State or Area not known to be infected 
is recognized as a pseudorabies-monitored feeder-pig herd. 
 
 
 33 
2. Offsite nurseries in Stage III, IV, or V States or Areas shall be recognized as 
pseudorabies-monitored feeder-pig herds if all pigs in the nurseries come from

breeding herds in Stage III, IV, or V States or Areas.  If part of the pigs in the 
offsite nursery originate from a Stage II area, the nursery must be tested as 
outlined in Part A of this section. 
 
C. Monitored status in the vaccinated swine breeding herd is attained and 
maintained as outlined in parts A and B of this section. 
 
Subpart IV—Quarantine Release Procedures  
 
A herd of swine shall no longer be classified as a known infected herd when no livestock 
or other animals on the premises show clinical signs of pseudorabies after removal of 
the positive swine, and at least one of the four following conditions has been met.  
Additionally, if the herd is vaccinated, all vaccinates must be vaccinated with the same 
official gene-altered pseudorabies virus vaccine. 
 
A. All swine were removed from the premises; the premises were cleaned and 
disinfected under official supervision with a disinfectant approved by 
Veterinary Services for such use; and the premises have been maintained free 
of swine for 30 days or a period of time determined adequate by an official 
pseudorabies epidemiologist. 
 
B. All swine positive to an official p seudorabies serologic test or an approved 
differential pseudorabies test have been removed from the premises and all 
remaining swine, except suckling pigs, were subjected to an official (or

or more after removal of all positive swine. 
 
C. All swine positive to an official p seudorabies serologic test or an approved 
differential pseudorabies test have been removed from the premises; all 
breeding swine that remain in the herd and an official random sample (95/10) 
of grower-finishing swine over 2 months of age are subjected to an official (or 
approved differential) pseudorabies serologic test and found negative 30 days 
or more after removal of positive swine.  A second test of grower-finishing 
swine at least 30 days after the first is required if the State is in Stage III or IV 
of the Program. 
 
D. (Stage I, II, and III only)  All swine present on the date the quarantine was 
imposed have been removed, and there have been no clinical signs in the 
herd for at least 6 months.  Two successive official (or approved differential) 
random-sample (95/10) tests of the breeding herd [95/5 for Stage III States], 
conducted at least 90 days apart, have been determined by the official 
pseudorabies epidemiologist to reveal no infection, and two successive
