It affects Prunus spp., including peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums, almonds, cherries, and some ornamental Prunus cultivars. PPV infection weakens trees, severely reducing fruit production and marketability. Aphids and people moving infected nursery stock spread the disease long distances. The disease was first detected in North America in 1999. Twenty years later, APHIS declared PPV eradicated from the United States. What To Look For Severely deformed fruit Rings or spots on fruit skin or leaves Brownish depressions and grooves on the surface of fruit Premature fruit drop Reddish or brownish colored flesh Green peach aphids, small sap-sucking insects that carry the disease It may take several years for symptoms to appear. If you suspect your plants are infected, contact your State department of agriculture or State plant health director . The only way to confirm PPV is to test suspect plant material using a specialized molecular diagnostic test. How to Prevent This Disease PPV prevention measures include early detection field surveys and the use of certified nursery stock. How It Is Treated There is no cure for PPV. Control measures include using resistant varieties (when available), controlling aphids, eliminating infected trees, and enforcing domestic and international quarantine regulations.
