FOR INFORMATION AND ACTION 
DA-2025-12 
March 20, 2025 
 
Subject:  APHIS Reduces Karnal Bunt (Tilletia indica) Regulated Areas in Maricopa 
County in Arizona 
 
To:   State, Tribal, and Territory Agricultural Regulatory Officials 
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is reducing the 
Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica; KB)-regulated areas in Maricopa County, Arizona, in accordance 
with 7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 301.89 et. seq. This action follows a recent review of 
field survey results of KB-regulated areas in Arizona. 
 
Specifically, APHIS is removing one field in Maricopa County from the list of regulated areas  
because this field has met the five-year cumulative tillage requirement included in the criteria for 
deregulation listed in 7 CFR § 301.89-3(e)(2). Release of this field from quarantine, including all 
fields regulated by proximity, will result in the deregulation of 869 field acres (30 fields). None 
of this acreage is on Tribal land. With this change, the new total regulated area in Arizona is 
4,121 field acres (111 fields). The attached Federal Order describes the regulated areas, which 
are also on the APHIS Karnal Bunt webpage. 
 
Accordingly, there are no more restrictions on the interstate movement of KB-regulated  
articles from these areas; however, other portions of Maricopa and Pinal Counties in Arizona 
remain regulated. The Arizona Department of Agriculture (AZDA) has established a parallel 
state quarantine as required by 7 CFR § 301.89-3(b)(1)(i).

KB is a fungal pest that affects wheat quality. APHIS regulates this plant disease because trading 
partners require that U.S. wheat be certified as grown in areas free of KB. APHIS appreciates the 
cooperative relationship with the Ak-Chin Indian Community, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa 
Indian Community, the wheat industry, and AZDA in the effort to limit the spread of KB. 
 
APHIS will publish a notice of this change in the Federal Register. For additional information

 Bunt (Tilletia indica) Regulated Areas

DA-2025-12 
March 20, 2025 
 
Effective immediately, this Federal Order updates the Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica, KB)-regulated 
areas in Arizona. Specifically, it reduces the overall regulated area in Maricopa County by 869 
field acres (30 fields). Accordingly, there are no more restrictions on the interstate movement of 
KB-regulated articles from these areas; however, other portions of Maricopa and Pinal Counties 
remain regulated. None of this acreage is on Tribal land. With this change, the new total 
regulated area in Arizona is 4,121 field acres (111 fields). The Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) will publish a notice of this change in the Federal Register. This 
Federal Order supersedes KB Federal Order DA-2024-41 issued on October 11, 2024. 
 
This Federal Order is issued in accordance with the regulatory authority provided by the Plant 
Protection Act of June 20, 2000, as amended, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act 
authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate 
commerce of any plant, plant part, or article, if the Secretary determines the prohibition or 
restriction is necessary to prevent the dissemination of a plant pest within the United States. The 
regulatory authority provided by 7 U.S.C. 7754 allows the Secretary to issue orders to carry out 
this provision of the Plant Protection Act. This Federal Order is likewise issued pursuant to the 
regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection Act found at 7 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) 301.89 et. seq

7 CFR § 301.89-3(b) allows the designation of less than an entire state as a KB-regulated area 
only when the APHIS Administrator has determined the following: the first being that 7 CFR § 
301.89(b)(1)(i) requires that the state enforce an intrastate KB quarantine that is equivalent to 
Federal KB regulations. As required, the Arizona Department of Agriculture (AZDA) has 
confirmed the establishment of intrastate regulated areas for KB that mirror the Federal 
regulatory requirements. Second, the designation is adequate to prevent the interstate spread of 
KB in accordance with 7 CFR § 301.89-3(b)(1)(ii). 
 
APHIS is reducing the KB-regulated areas in Arizona following a recent review of field survey 
results. Specifically, APHIS determined that one field in Maricopa County has met the five-year

12 and 13 of Township 1 South and Range 5 West. 
Pinal County:  
(1) Maricopa: Sections 11 and 14 of Township 5 South and Range 3 East. 
We appreciate the cooperative relationship with the Ak-Chin Indian Community, the Salt River

spread of KB.
