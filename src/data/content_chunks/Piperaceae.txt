PiperaceaeC. Agardh胡椒科 hu jiao keAuthors:Yung-chien Tseng,Nianhe Xia&Michael G. GilbertHerbs, shrubs, or climbers, rarely trees, usually aromatic. Vascular bundles ±  scattered in transverse section in a monocotyledonlike manner. Tip of stem sometimes enclosed within a stipulelike sheath, the prophyll, sometimes adnate to petiole, absent inPeperomia. Leaves alternate, often opposite or whorled inPeperomia, simple, base often asymmetric, palmately or pinnately veined. Inflorescence a pedunculate spike, rarely grouped into an umbel, rarely a raceme (inZippelia), leaf-opposed or axillary, rarely terminal. Flowers small, bisexual, hermaphroditic, polygamous or dioecious, nearly always sessile; bracts small, usually peltate or cupular, usually without perianth. Stamens 1-10; filaments usually free; anthers 2-locular, distinct or connate, longitudinally dehiscent. Gynoecium 2-5-carpellate, connate; ovary superior, 1-locular, ovule 1, orthotropous; stigmas 1-5, sessile or with very short styles. Fruit a small drupe or nutlet; pericarp fleshy, thin or dry, sometimes with sticky papillae (inPeperomia) or glochidiate spines (inZippelia). Seeds with copious starchy perisperm and a minute embryo embedded in small endosperm.About eight or nine genera and 2000-3000 species: tropical and subtropical regions, mostly in North and South America, rather fewer in Asia
