1. INTRODUCTION
1.1  USDA Mission and Public Access Background
USDA is made up of 29 agencies and staff offices with nearly 100,000 employees who serve the American people at more than 
4,500 locations across the country and abroad. 
The mission of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is to “serve all Americans by providing effective, innovative, 
science-based public policy leadership in agriculture, food and nutrition, natural resource protection and management, rural 
development, and related issues with a commitment to deliver equitable and climate-smart opportunities that inspire and help 
America thrive. ”1 The mission statement highlights the importance of research and science as a basis for decision-making. 
USDA has long embraced its responsibility for making the products of its research more publicly available. In response to the 
February 2013 Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memo entitled “Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded 
Scientific Research, ”2 USDA released its initial Implementation Plan in November 20143 and proceeded to develop infrastructure 
and processes to provide public access to USDA-funded research. The Department also codified requirements for public access in 
USDA Departmental Regulation 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data.4  
This document provides an updated implementation plan to carry out OSTP memorandum entitled, “Ensuring Free, Immediate, 
and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research” from August 2022.

 also codified requirements for public access in 
USDA Departmental Regulation 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data.4  
This document provides an updated implementation plan to carry out OSTP memorandum entitled, “Ensuring Free, Immediate, 
and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research” from August 2022.5 
As noted in the OSTP memorandum, the USDA implementation plan and the subsequent policy will be consistent with federal 
statutes and their implementing regulations regarding information management, including: the Paperwork Reduction Act, 
E-Government Act, Freedom of Information Act, Federal Information Security Management Act, Privacy Act, Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Information Quality Act, Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act,
Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, Federal
Records Act, and other laws and implementing regulations or policies that require federal agencies to protect trade secrets,
confidential commercial information, personally identifiable information, and other information which is protected under law or
policy.
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and circulars will also govern the implementation plan and subsequent USDA 
policy. These include OMB guidance under OMB M-13-13 and subsequent open data policies (e.g., those to be promulgated under 
the OPEN Government Data Act and Pub. L. No. 115-435) and OMB Circular A-130.
This implementation plan will guide the Department and those agencies and staff offices that carry out USDA’s research functions.

 are responsible for USDA’s public access policy. 
The USDA Science Council advises the Secretary and the Chief Scientist on the priorities for USDA’s science agenda, reflecting the 
high priority issues impacting all aspects of United States food, agriculture, natural resources, energy, and communities. The USDA 
Science Council provides advice on issues related to ensuring free, immediate, and equitable access to USDA-funded research. 
OCS works closely with the National Agricultural Library (NAL) to develop and coordinate policy implementation in USDA agencies 
and across the Department. NAL provides day-to-day support and service in implementing public access policies.
OCS and NAL convene a cross-agency group called the Public Access and Open Science Forum that serves as an implementation-
level advisory, communication, and coordination body for public access and related activities at USDA. This group consists of 
representatives from the USDA agencies and staff offices that make up the USDA Science Council. 
NAL represents USDA on the National Science and Technology Council’s Subcommittee on Open Science (SOS) and its working 
groups. This ensures USDA coordinates policy and implementation with other departments and federal agencies across the 
federal government. 
USDA also partners and shares resources with other federal agencies for relevant public access initiatives and services. For 
example, USDA partners with the Department of Energy’s Office of Scientific and Technical Information for digital persistent 
identifier services and actively participates in SOS guidance development. NAL also collaborates with outside stakeholders, 
including scientific societies and partners like CHORUS.

implementation plan to ensure scientific and research integrity in agency public access policies.
2. UPDATING  POLICIES ON PUBLIC ACCESS TO SCHOLARL Y PUBLICATIONS AND
THEIR ASSOCIATED  RESEARCH DATA
Established policy – in the form of a USDA Departmental Regulation and subsequent federal rulemakings – is the backbone for 
all other implementation activities. This section of the implementation plan describes USDA’s policy approach to ensure free, 
immediate, and equitable public access to scholarly publications and their underlying scientific data funded by USDA.
The USDA will develop public access policies that will ensure, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and implementing 
regulations, that:
• All peer-reviewed scholarly publications authored or co-authored by individuals or institutions resulting from federally
funded research are made freely available and publicly accessible by default in agency-designated repositories without
any embargo or

 and their underlying scientific data funded by USDA.
The USDA will develop public access policies that will ensure, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and implementing 
regulations, that:
• All peer-reviewed scholarly publications authored or co-authored by individuals or institutions resulting from federally
funded research are made freely available and publicly accessible by default in agency-designated repositories without
any embargo or delay after publication.
• Scientific data underlying peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from USDA-funded research will be made freely
available and publicly accessible by default at the time of publication.
3
USDA IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO INCREASE PUBLIC ACCESS TO USDA-FUNDED RESEARCH RESULTS
USDA public access policies will align with the August 2022 OSTP memorandum and governing associated federal statutes, 
regulations, and policies.
USDA will implement these new policies by December 31, 2025.
2.1 General Scope
The public access policy will apply to all unclassified scientific research, including intramural research and extramural research, 
that is supported wholly or in part by the USDA, regardless of the USDA funding level or funding mechanism. 
This will include scientific research that is supported by:
• Any direct funding from a USDA grant or cooperative agreement when the new final USDA public access policy is
approved.
• Any direct funding from a USDA contract signed after the final USDA public access policy is implemented.
• Any direct funding or arrangement, including in-kind support, from any USDA Intramural Research.
USDA will review the scope as part of the larger public access policy activity consistent with the latest OSTP memorandum. USDA 
will also solicit feedback on the scope during the implementation process.
There are connections between requirements for digital persistent identifiers (DPIs) for public access policy requirements and 
implementation requirements associated with National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33

will also solicit feedback on the scope during the implementation process.
There are connections between requirements for digital persistent identifiers (DPIs) for public access policy requirements and 
implementation requirements associated with National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33) entitled, “Presidential 
Memorandum on United States Government-Supported Research and Development National Security Policy .”6 
USDA policy will further update policies to ensure alignment between scientific and research integrity and public access policies 
by December 31, 2026, to be effective December 31, 2027.
USDA Departmental Regulation (DR) 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data, 
remains USDA policy while USDA develops new policies consistent with the August 2022 OSTP memorandum.
2.2 Policy for Scholarly Publications 
The public access policy will apply to any manuscript that is peer-reviewed and is accepted for publication in a journal on or after 
the USDA approval of a new final public access policy. 
USDA will consider expansion of the scope to other publication types during the policy consultation and development process. 
The public access policy for scholarly publications will ensure:
• Final peer-reviewed, accepted manuscripts will be made freely accessible to the public in machine-readable form
through the USDA public access system (PubAg, hosted by the NAL). USDA will provide public access through PubAg on
the date on which the publisher makes the article available online. Final versions of record may be submitted if the
author has secured rights to submit them (e.g., by securing open access licensing).
• Scholarly publications will have digital persistent identifiers (DPIs), such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), consistent
with current policy and practice.

• Scholarly publications will have digital persistent identifiers (DPIs), such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), consistent
with current policy and practice.
• Scholarly publications will reference the USDA funding source(s).
• All authors of scholarly publications will have individual DPIs, such as the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID iD),
that are linked to their scholarly publications.
• Digital scientific research data assets connected to a scholarly publication covered by USDA policy will also receive a DPI,
such as a DOI. This will allow a scholarly publication and its catalog metadata to link to the published digital scientific
research data asset from which the publication was developed.
• USDA will encourage authors of scholarly publications to obtain DPIs for other associated scientific research products.

• USDA will clarify the role of publishers (through their various Open Access models), institutional repositories, and other
external entities in ensuring free, immediate, and equitable access to USDA-funded research outputs. USDA will also
discuss intellectual property rights concerns in stakeholder discussions, to inform USDA policy on government purpose
licensing and use and reuse rights for publications.
USDA Departmental Regulation (DR) 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data, 
remains USDA policy while USDA develops new policies consistent with the August 2022 OSTP memorandum.
2.3 Policy for Data Management Planning and Digital Scientific Research Data
The USDA public access policy will apply to any digital scientific research data asset connected to a scholarly publication covered 
by the USDA public access policy. The public access policy will also extend to other digital scientific research data assets as 
currently outlined in DR 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data.
USDA will describe categories of digital scientific research data assets that are exempt from public access requirements by statute 
or regulation and describe processes to review and approve requests for waivers and extensions to public access requirements. 
USDA will require digital scientific research data assets covered by public access requirements be published in a machine-readable 
format by a data repository that is recognized by reputable registries and provides:
• Public access for search, retrieval, and analysis.
• A digital persistent identifier, such as a DOI.
• Long-term preservation of the data asset.
USDA will require that an approved data management plan (DMP) accompany all scientific research that produces digital scientific 
research

-readable 
format by a data repository that is recognized by reputable registries and provides:
• Public access for search, retrieval, and analysis.
• A digital persistent identifier, such as a DOI.
• Long-term preservation of the data asset.
USDA will require that an approved data management plan (DMP) accompany all scientific research that produces digital scientific 
research data assets. The public access policy will prescribe the high-level DMP elements and explain when and how data will be 
publicly accessible.
As noted above in the Policy for Scholarly Publications section, digital scientific research data assets covered by this policy must 
also receive digital persistent identifiers (DPIs).
USDA will make digital scientific research data assets associated with scholarly publications covered by the public access policy 
publicly accessible immediately, simultaneous with the article publication. USDA also will continue to require data not associated 
with scholarly publications to be made available by the end of the period of performance of the award.
USDA will encourage authors of digital scientific research data assets to obtain DPIs for other associated research products such 
as software, workflow documentation, curricular materials, and multi-media materials if these products provide information that 
would help future users of the data asset and are not subject to access restrictions.
USDA will require all authors of digital scientific research data assets (data authors) have individual DPIs (e.g., ORCID iDs) that are 
linked to their data assets and other research products.
The public access policy will require a standardized metadata catalog entry that is machine-readable, references the USDA 
funding source(s), and describes the digital scientific research data asset be submitted to the publicly available USDA scientific 
data catalog system (Ag Data Commons, hosted by the NAL) simultaneous with the publication of the associated scholarly 
publication. USDA will require that the metadata catalog entry include the DP

2.4 Public Input in New Policy Development
USDA will take the following steps to ensure public input in new public access policy development:
• Recharter the USDA Public Access and Open Science Forum through the Office of the Chief Scientist and the USDA
Science Council. The USDA Public Access and Open Science Forum will:
• Provide a platform for USDA agencies to collaborate through meetings, workshops and working groups on
 public access policy issues of agency and Departmental concern.
• Review current USDA public access policies and survey USDA agencies’ scholarly publications and associated
 science data policies, practices, and plans.
• Review policies and strategies of other federal agencies to gain insight into issues and practices that are relevant to
USDA.
• Develop the USDA public access policy for approval by the Secretary through the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist and
USDA Science Council, in consultation with external

• Review policies and strategies of other federal agencies to gain insight into issues and practices that are relevant to
USDA.
• Develop the USDA public access policy for approval by the Secretary through the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist and
USDA Science Council, in consultation with external stakeholders.
• Convene the USDA Science Council specifically to review public access policy development progress to meet the
December 30, 2025, deadline.
• Use formal Tribal Consultation Processes to ensure Tribal sovereignty in public access matters.
• Gather input on potential public access policies from external stakeholders consistent with federal law and regulation,
including through the National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education, and Economics (NAREEE) Advisory Board.
• Follow formal federal rulemaking procedures (i.e., Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Administrative
Procedures Act).
• Ensure implementation activities described elsewhere in this plan are consistent with anticipated USDA public access
policies.
3. UPDATING  PUBLIC ACCESS INFRASTRUCTURE
USDA has established public repositories for both USDA-funded peer reviewed scholarly publications and digital scientific 
research data. These repositories provide the basic infrastructure for providing public access, transparency, and scientific integrity 
using rich metadata, digital persistent identifiers (DPIs), and controlled vocabularies to connect research outputs to make them 
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). 
USDA will improve this infrastructure so that the Department can compound the value of its research investments by increasing 
machine-readability, data storage capacity, process automation, and integration with internal and external sources to bring 
USDA research outputs to the public. In addition to enhancing research outcomes, this improved infrastructure will ensure free, 
immediate, and equitable access to

USDA will improve this infrastructure so that the Department can compound the value of its research investments by increasing 
machine-readability, data storage capacity, process automation, and integration with internal and external sources to bring 
USDA research outputs to the public. In addition to enhancing research outcomes, this improved infrastructure will ensure free, 
immediate, and equitable access to USDA-funded research. 
USDA will also develop an automated reporting framework from existing and planned research management systems to analyze 
public access policy effectiveness and compliance.
3.1 Public repository for USDA-funded Peer Reviewed Scholarly Publications
USDA’s public access system to USDA-funded scholarly publications is PubAg. PubAg utilizes Alma and Primo VE to manage and 
deliver its content. It is available at NAL ’s integrated search service, https://search.nal.usda.gov.
PubAg supports current USDA policy by providing a search and discovery interface to citations and peer-reviewed journal articles 
in the food and agricultural sciences, including access to the best available full-text version of USDA-funded scholarly publications. 
The Department will enhance PubAg to ensure compliance with Departmental public access policies, with an emphasis on 
enhancing submission processes, particularly for extramural researchers, and making full-text articles machine-readable. PubAg 
will ensure USDA-funded scholarly publications are freely, immediately, and equitably accessible.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1  USDA Mission and Public Access Background
USDA is made up of 29 agencies and staff offices with nearly 100,000 employees who serve the American people at more than 
4,500 locations across the country and abroad. 
The mission of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is to “serve all Americans by providing effective, innovative, 
science-based public policy leadership in agriculture, food and nutrition, natural resource protection and management, rural 
development, and related issues with a commitment to deliver equitable and climate-smart opportunities that inspire and help 
America thrive. ”1 The mission statement highlights the importance of research and science as a basis for decision-making. 
USDA has long embraced its responsibility for making the products of its research more publicly available. In response to the 
February 2013 Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memo entitled “Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded 
Scientific Research, ”2 USDA released its initial Implementation Plan in November 20143 and proceeded to develop infrastructure 
and processes to provide public access to USDA-funded research. The Department also codified requirements for public access in 
USDA Departmental Regulation 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data.4  
This document provides an updated implementation plan to carry out OSTP memorandum entitled, “Ensuring Free, Immediate, 
and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research” from August 2022.

 also codified requirements for public access in 
USDA Departmental Regulation 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data.4  
This document provides an updated implementation plan to carry out OSTP memorandum entitled, “Ensuring Free, Immediate, 
and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research” from August 2022.5 
As noted in the OSTP memorandum, the USDA implementation plan and the subsequent policy will be consistent with federal 
statutes and their implementing regulations regarding information management, including: the Paperwork Reduction Act, 
E-Government Act, Freedom of Information Act, Federal Information Security Management Act, Privacy Act, Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Information Quality Act, Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act,
Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, Federal
Records Act, and other laws and implementing regulations or policies that require federal agencies to protect trade secrets,
confidential commercial information, personally identifiable information, and other information which is protected under law or
policy.
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and circulars will also govern the implementation plan and subsequent USDA 
policy. These include OMB guidance under OMB M-13-13 and subsequent open data policies (e.g., those to be promulgated under 
the OPEN Government Data Act and Pub. L. No. 115-435) and OMB Circular A-130.
This implementation plan will guide the Department and those agencies and staff offices that carry out USDA’s research functions.

USDA IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO INCREASE PUBLIC ACCESS TO USDA-FUNDED RESEARCH RESULTS
1.2  Overview of leadership roles and responsibilities 
The USDA Chief Scientist and the staff office that supports the position, the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS), lead science policy 
development for the Department and are responsible for USDA’s public access policy. 
The USDA Science Council advises the Secretary and the Chief Scientist on the priorities for USDA’s science agenda, reflecting the 
high priority issues impacting all aspects of United States food, agriculture, natural resources, energy, and communities. The USDA 
Science Council provides advice on issues related to ensuring free, immediate, and equitable access

 are responsible for USDA’s public access policy. 
The USDA Science Council advises the Secretary and the Chief Scientist on the priorities for USDA’s science agenda, reflecting the 
high priority issues impacting all aspects of United States food, agriculture, natural resources, energy, and communities. The USDA 
Science Council provides advice on issues related to ensuring free, immediate, and equitable access to USDA-funded research. 
OCS works closely with the National Agricultural Library (NAL) to develop and coordinate policy implementation in USDA agencies 
and across the Department. NAL provides day-to-day support and service in implementing public access policies.
OCS and NAL convene a cross-agency group called the Public Access and Open Science Forum that serves as an implementation-
level advisory, communication, and coordination body for public access and related activities at USDA. This group consists of 
representatives from the USDA agencies and staff offices that make up the USDA Science Council. 
NAL represents USDA on the National Science and Technology Council’s Subcommittee on Open Science (SOS) and its working 
groups. This ensures USDA coordinates policy and implementation with other departments and federal agencies across the 
federal government. 
USDA also partners and shares resources with other federal agencies for relevant public access initiatives and services. For 
example, USDA partners with the Department of Energy’s Office of Scientific and Technical Information for digital persistent 
identifier services and actively participates in SOS guidance development. NAL also collaborates with outside stakeholders, 
including scientific societies and partners like CHORUS.

implementation plan to ensure scientific and research integrity in agency public access policies.
2. UPDATING  POLICIES ON PUBLIC ACCESS TO SCHOLARL Y PUBLICATIONS AND
THEIR ASSOCIATED  RESEARCH DATA
Established policy – in the form of a USDA Departmental Regulation and subsequent federal rulemakings – is the backbone for 
all other implementation activities. This section of the implementation plan describes USDA’s policy approach to ensure free, 
immediate, and equitable public access to scholarly publications and their underlying scientific data funded by USDA.
The USDA will develop public access policies that will ensure, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and implementing 
regulations, that:
• All peer-reviewed scholarly publications authored or co-authored by individuals or institutions resulting from federally
funded research are made freely available and publicly accessible by default in agency-designated repositories without
any embargo or

 and their underlying scientific data funded by USDA.
The USDA will develop public access policies that will ensure, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and implementing 
regulations, that:
• All peer-reviewed scholarly publications authored or co-authored by individuals or institutions resulting from federally
funded research are made freely available and publicly accessible by default in agency-designated repositories without
any embargo or delay after publication.
• Scientific data underlying peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from USDA-funded research will be made freely
available and publicly accessible by default at the time of publication.
3
USDA IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO INCREASE PUBLIC ACCESS TO USDA-FUNDED RESEARCH RESULTS
USDA public access policies will align with the August 2022 OSTP memorandum and governing associated federal statutes, 
regulations, and policies.
USDA will implement these new policies by December 31, 2025.
2.1 General Scope
The public access policy will apply to all unclassified scientific research, including intramural research and extramural research, 
that is supported wholly or in part by the USDA, regardless of the USDA funding level or funding mechanism. 
This will include scientific research that is supported by:
• Any direct funding from a USDA grant or cooperative agreement when the new final USDA public access policy is
approved.
• Any direct funding from a USDA contract signed after the final USDA public access policy is implemented.
• Any direct funding or arrangement, including in-kind support, from any USDA Intramural Research.
USDA will review the scope as part of the larger public access policy activity consistent with the latest OSTP memorandum. USDA 
will also solicit feedback on the scope during the implementation process.
There are connections between requirements for digital persistent identifiers (DPIs) for public access policy requirements and 
implementation requirements associated with National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33

will also solicit feedback on the scope during the implementation process.
There are connections between requirements for digital persistent identifiers (DPIs) for public access policy requirements and 
implementation requirements associated with National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33) entitled, “Presidential 
Memorandum on United States Government-Supported Research and Development National Security Policy .”6 
USDA policy will further update policies to ensure alignment between scientific and research integrity and public access policies 
by December 31, 2026, to be effective December 31, 2027.
USDA Departmental Regulation (DR) 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data, 
remains USDA policy while USDA develops new policies consistent with the August 2022 OSTP memorandum.
2.2 Policy for Scholarly Publications 
The public access policy will apply to any manuscript that is peer-reviewed and is accepted for publication in a journal on or after 
the USDA approval of a new final public access policy. 
USDA will consider expansion of the scope to other publication types during the policy consultation and development process. 
The public access policy for scholarly publications will ensure:
• Final peer-reviewed, accepted manuscripts will be made freely accessible to the public in machine-readable form
through the USDA public access system (PubAg, hosted by the NAL). USDA will provide public access through PubAg on
the date on which the publisher makes the article available online. Final versions of record may be submitted if the
author has secured rights to submit them (e.g., by securing open access licensing).
• Scholarly publications will have digital persistent identifiers (DPIs), such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), consistent
with current policy and practice.

• Scholarly publications will have digital persistent identifiers (DPIs), such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), consistent
with current policy and practice.
• Scholarly publications will reference the USDA funding source(s).
• All authors of scholarly publications will have individual DPIs, such as the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID iD),
that are linked to their scholarly publications.
• Digital scientific research data assets connected to a scholarly publication covered by USDA policy will also receive a DPI,
such as a DOI. This will allow a scholarly publication and its catalog metadata to link to the published digital scientific
research data asset from which the publication was developed.
• USDA will encourage authors of scholarly publications to obtain DPIs for other associated scientific research products.

• USDA will clarify the role of publishers (through their various Open Access models), institutional repositories, and other
external entities in ensuring free, immediate, and equitable access to USDA-funded research outputs. USDA will also
discuss intellectual property rights concerns in stakeholder discussions, to inform USDA policy on government purpose
licensing and use and reuse rights for publications.
USDA Departmental Regulation (DR) 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data, 
remains USDA policy while USDA develops new policies consistent with the August 2022 OSTP memorandum.
2.3 Policy for Data Management Planning and Digital Scientific Research Data
The USDA public access policy will apply to any digital scientific research data asset connected to a scholarly publication covered 
by the USDA public access policy. The public access policy will also extend to other digital scientific research data assets as 
currently outlined in DR 1020-006, Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data.
USDA will describe categories of digital scientific research data assets that are exempt from public access requirements by statute 
or regulation and describe processes to review and approve requests for waivers and extensions to public access requirements. 
USDA will require digital scientific research data assets covered by public access requirements be published in a machine-readable 
format by a data repository that is recognized by reputable registries and provides:
• Public access for search, retrieval, and analysis.
• A digital persistent identifier, such as a DOI.
• Long-term preservation of the data asset.
USDA will require that an approved data management plan (DMP) accompany all scientific research that produces digital scientific 
research

-readable 
format by a data repository that is recognized by reputable registries and provides:
• Public access for search, retrieval, and analysis.
• A digital persistent identifier, such as a DOI.
• Long-term preservation of the data asset.
USDA will require that an approved data management plan (DMP) accompany all scientific research that produces digital scientific 
research data assets. The public access policy will prescribe the high-level DMP elements and explain when and how data will be 
publicly accessible.
As noted above in the Policy for Scholarly Publications section, digital scientific research data assets covered by this policy must 
also receive digital persistent identifiers (DPIs).
USDA will make digital scientific research data assets associated with scholarly publications covered by the public access policy 
publicly accessible immediately, simultaneous with the article publication. USDA also will continue to require data not associated 
with scholarly publications to be made available by the end of the period of performance of the award.
USDA will encourage authors of digital scientific research data assets to obtain DPIs for other associated research products such 
as software, workflow documentation, curricular materials, and multi-media materials if these products provide information that 
would help future users of the data asset and are not subject to access restrictions.
USDA will require all authors of digital scientific research data assets (data authors) have individual DPIs (e.g., ORCID iDs) that are 
linked to their data assets and other research products.
The public access policy will require a standardized metadata catalog entry that is machine-readable, references the USDA 
funding source(s), and describes the digital scientific research data asset be submitted to the publicly available USDA scientific 
data catalog system (Ag Data Commons, hosted by the NAL) simultaneous with the publication of the associated scholarly 
publication. USDA will require that the metadata catalog entry include the DP

USDA IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO INCREASE PUBLIC ACCESS TO USDA-FUNDED RESEARCH RESULTS
2.4 Public Input in New Policy Development
USDA will take the following steps to ensure public input in new public access policy development:
• Recharter the USDA Public Access and Open Science Forum through the Office of the Chief Scientist and the USDA
Science Council. The USDA Public Access and Open Science Forum will:
• Provide a platform for USDA agencies to collaborate through meetings, workshops and working groups on
 public access policy issues of agency and Departmental concern.
• Review current USDA public access policies and survey USDA agencies’ scholarly publications and associated
 science data policies, practices, and plans.
• Review policies and strategies of other federal agencies to gain insight into issues and practices that are relevant to
USDA.
• Develop the USDA public access policy for approval by the Secretary through the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist and
USDA Science Council, in consultation with external

• Review policies and strategies of other federal agencies to gain insight into issues and practices that are relevant to
USDA.
• Develop the USDA public access policy for approval by the Secretary through the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist and
USDA Science Council, in consultation with external stakeholders.
• Convene the USDA Science Council specifically to review public access policy development progress to meet the
December 30, 2025, deadline.
• Use formal Tribal Consultation Processes to ensure Tribal sovereignty in public access matters.
• Gather input on potential public access policies from external stakeholders consistent with federal law and regulation,
including through the National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education, and Economics (NAREEE) Advisory Board.
• Follow formal federal rulemaking procedures (i.e., Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Administrative
Procedures Act).
• Ensure implementation activities described elsewhere in this plan are consistent with anticipated USDA public access
policies.
3. UPDATING  PUBLIC ACCESS INFRASTRUCTURE
USDA has established public repositories for both USDA-funded peer reviewed scholarly publications and digital scientific 
research data. These repositories provide the basic infrastructure for providing public access, transparency, and scientific integrity 
using rich metadata, digital persistent identifiers (DPIs), and controlled vocabularies to connect research outputs to make them 
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). 
USDA will improve this infrastructure so that the Department can compound the value of its research investments by increasing 
machine-readability, data storage capacity, process automation, and integration with internal and external sources to bring 
USDA research outputs to the public. In addition to enhancing research outcomes, this improved infrastructure will ensure free, 
immediate, and equitable access to

USDA will improve this infrastructure so that the Department can compound the value of its research investments by increasing 
machine-readability, data storage capacity, process automation, and integration with internal and external sources to bring 
USDA research outputs to the public. In addition to enhancing research outcomes, this improved infrastructure will ensure free, 
immediate, and equitable access to USDA-funded research. 
USDA will also develop an automated reporting framework from existing and planned research management systems to analyze 
public access policy effectiveness and compliance.
3.1 Public repository for USDA-funded Peer Reviewed Scholarly Publications
USDA’s public access system to USDA-funded scholarly publications is PubAg. PubAg utilizes Alma and Primo VE to manage and 
deliver its content. It is available at NAL ’s integrated search service, https://search.nal.usda.gov.
PubAg supports current USDA policy by providing a search and discovery interface to citations and peer-reviewed journal articles 
in the food and agricultural sciences, including access to the best available full-text version of USDA-funded scholarly publications. 
The Department will enhance PubAg to ensure compliance with Departmental public access policies, with an emphasis on 
enhancing submission processes, particularly for extramural researchers, and making full-text articles machine-readable. PubAg 
will ensure USDA-funded scholarly publications are freely, immediately, and equitably accessible.
