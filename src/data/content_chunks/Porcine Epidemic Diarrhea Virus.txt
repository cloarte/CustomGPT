1 Executive Summary 
The United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 
Veterinary Services (VS)  has conducted a literature review on the scientific evidence regarding whether 
non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of 
swine into or within the United States. The purpose of this literature review was to identify, evaluate, 
and summarize the current scientific knowledge published through March 2018 regarding this topic and 
to identify information gaps, thereby, making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers, 
other stakeholders, and the scientific community. The results may support future scientific research 
and/or risk quantifying models for evaluating the risk (or likelihood) of entry of exotic viral pathogens via 
specific feed ingredients

and summarize the current scientific knowledge published through March 2018 regarding this topic and 
to identify information gaps, thereby, making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers, 
other stakeholders, and the scientific community. The results may support future scientific research 
and/or risk quantifying models for evaluating the risk (or likelihood) of entry of exotic viral pathogens via 
specific feed ingredients from source countries and subsequent exposure to United States (U.S.) swine 
populations.  
The methodology of this literature review follows the basic framework of a qualitative systematic review 
and has four main components: 1) identifying and selecting research evidence, 2) data extraction and 
quality assessment, 3) data synthesis, and 4) report writing [1]. Twenty-six published articles were 
included in the literature review. The major findings and information gaps are highlighted below:  
• A subset of the studies reviewed provided experimental evidence that swine viruses can survive 
in non-animal origin feed ingredients under various experimental conditions. Virus survival 
times were variable (range: 7 days to > 180 days) and dependent on the simulated 
environmental conditions applied (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) and the virus-
ingredient combination. Additional research is needed to verify virus survival times (and 
infectivity) in complete feed and feed ingredients, with various virus-ingredient combinations 
under various environmental conditions, including actual field conditions. 
• Several experimental studies provided evidence that feed contaminated with virus can transmit 
disease to naive piglets. However, the experimental methods used in these studies such as 
spiking feed ingredients with a predetermined virus load or inoculating piglets via methods 
other than natural feeding behaviors do not necessarily reflect the field setting and results may 
not be generalizable to field conditions, particularly the large, commercial swine production 
setting.

 can transmit 
disease to naive piglets. However, the experimental methods used in these studies such as 
spiking feed ingredients with a predetermined virus load or inoculating piglets via methods 
other than natural feeding behaviors do not necessarily reflect the field setting and results may 
not be generalizable to field conditions, particularly the large, commercial swine production 
setting. Additional laboratory and field-based studies are needed to determine the extent of 
reproducibility and applicability of these experimental findings to field settings. 
• Several studies have investigated whether some individual feed ingredients are more likely than 
others to support virus survivability. Viable virus (meaning positive by virus isolation test and/or 
bioassay) was detected in the following non-animal origin ingredients that were experimentally 
spiked with virus: organic and conventional soybean meal, dried distillers grain with solubles 
(DDGS), lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choline chloride, and vitamin D. Two experimental studies, 
using different experimental conditions, observed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 
viability in three PEDV-spiked ingredients: conventional soybean meal, lysine, and choline 
chloride. Virus viability (and infectivity) as determined in separate swine bioassays was observed

with choline chloride and two swine viruses: PEDV and Seneca virus A. The implications of these 
findings for field settings are unclear.  
• A major knowledge gap exists with respect to potential source(s) of contamination and where 
feed or feed ingredients may be contaminated, particularly for non-animal origin ingredients 
sourced outside the United States. Current studies have produced little scientific evidence of 
how,

V and Seneca virus A. The implications of these 
findings for field settings are unclear.  
• A major knowledge gap exists with respect to potential source(s) of contamination and where 
feed or feed ingredients may be contaminated, particularly for non-animal origin ingredients 
sourced outside the United States. Current studies have produced little scientific evidence of 
how, or if, non-animal origin feed ingredients could become contaminated with swine viruses in 
regions outside the United States. The critical point(s) of susceptibility to contamination along 
the feed production, processing, and distribution continuum, from harvesting the plant-derived 
feed ingredients in the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine premises, have not been 
identified. Neither the contamination route of exotic swine pathogens into non-animal origin 
feed (ingredients) nor the virus entry route into the United States has been decisively proven. 
• Under laboratory-simulated model conditions, both the formaldehyde-based liquid 
antimicrobial SalCURB® and a medium chain fatty acid blend were concluded to be effective 
chemical mitigants against PEDV. The real-world application of these mitigants for eliminating 
swine viruses or decreasing their level of infectivity under field conditions has yet to be 
determined. Additional mitigation strategies should continue to be explored, including other 
chemical treatments, the application of heat or pressure (pelleting) to feed and of various 
holding times to feed or feed ingredients.   
• When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as potential fomites for swine virus 
transmission, a major knowledge gap exist with how the primary transmission pathways (e.g., 
exposure to infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel, etc.) interface with 
one another, particularly how the production and distribution of feed

 feed or feed ingredients.   
• When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as potential fomites for swine virus 
transmission, a major knowledge gap exist with how the primary transmission pathways (e.g., 
exposure to infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel, etc.) interface with 
one another, particularly how the production and distribution of feed interact with other 
potential sources of virus contamination (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport 
vehicles, personnel, etc.) to contribute, if at all, to disease transmission.   
• Reliable and validated assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting infective virus (i.e., 
to determine the level of contamination is sufficient to transmit disease) in large quantities of 
(bulk) ingredients are not available.  
• The entry of PEDV (and new or emerging swine viruses) onto presumably biosecure commercial 
premises suggests that current biosecurity standards may be insufficient to prevent virus 
incursion. Virus characteristics and the characteristics of the commercial swine industry 
(globalization of trade, intensification and vertical integration of production, and extensive 
movement of pigs and related production components) could contribute to biosecurity 
breaches. Robust biosecurity measures may be the only tool, in the absence of effective 
vaccines or treatments, to prevent the entry and spread of some diseases. Thus, biosecurity 
strategies, particularly the extensive movement of production inputs, need to be re-evaluated 
and adjusted to meet today’s swine industry paradigm. 
While investigators have addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of 
swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, the current body of scientific knowledge has yet to provide

While investigators have addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of 
swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, the current body of scientific knowledge has yet to provide 
conclusive evidence for the source(s) of contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients with swine 
viruses and the epidemiology of virus transmission to swine under field conditions. If the primary

concern of the swine industry and associated stakeholders lies in the importation of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced, 
processed, and transported prior to importation into the United States are needed. However, the lack of 
feed and feed ingredient diagnostic assays capable of detecting virus in large volumes of material limits 
our ability to determine if and at what point non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients may become 
contaminated with viruses and limits our ability to establish critical control points in feed production, 
distribution, and storage to mitigate risk(s). Until these data are available, it is difficult to evaluate the 
biosecurity risk posed by non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. Moving forward, studies designed 
to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and virus mitigation steps in processing and post-
processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.

3 Introduction 
Over the past three decades, the swine industry in the United States has experienced several significant 
disease outbreak events with highly pathogenic viral pathogens, including porcine reproductive and 
respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and, most recently, the swine 
enteric coronaviruses, including porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) and  porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 
(PEDV) [2-5]. These disease events have resulted in significant clinical consequences with increased 
morbidity and mortality, in some cases reaching 100%, as well as economic devastation to the swine 
industry with financial losses estimated in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars [4, 6]. Among 
other shared characteristics, all three causative agents had been previously known to cause mild or non-
pathogenic disease in swine prior to the re-emergence event. Additionally, novel agents, such as PEDV, 
may be present yet remain undetected for some time, contributing to (wide) spread transmission 
amongst the industry and hindering local containment. Thus, once identified, the unforeseen emergence 
of swine diseases with high morbidity and mortality and rapid, transboundary spread brings about 
fundamental questions (how, what, why, when, and

 PEDV, 
may be present yet remain undetected for some time, contributing to (wide) spread transmission 
amongst the industry and hindering local containment. Thus, once identified, the unforeseen emergence 
of swine diseases with high morbidity and mortality and rapid, transboundary spread brings about 
fundamental questions (how, what, why, when, and from where) as well as an immediate need to find 
solutions for both short- and long-term response activities and mitigation strategies to control the 
outbreak and prevent future events [5].   
During the 2013 - 2014 outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in North America, contaminated 
feed and feed ingredients were suspected as a potential introduction and/or transmission route for 
spread as early cases of PED in Canada were linked to a common feed source containing spray-dried 
porcine plasma (SDPP) [7]. Additionally, genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that United States 
(U.S.) strains were closely related to Chinese PEDV strains, particularly the 2012 strain from the Anhui 
Province in China [8], fueling concerns that imported (contaminated) commodities from China may have 
been the route of introduction into the United States. Growing anecdotal evidence and early 
investigative studies [9] have further implicated feed and feed ingredients as the possible transmission 
vehicle for PEDV although a definitive introductory cause remains unknown. Compounded by the recent 
outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in China and the European Union [10], there is rising concern that 
contaminated imported commodities, particularly non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial 
swine feed, could introduce and transmit viral pathogens of significant concern to the United States 
(U.S.) swine industry.

 recent 
outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in China and the European Union [10], there is rising concern that 
contaminated imported commodities, particularly non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial 
swine feed, could introduce and transmit viral pathogens of significant concern to the United States 
(U.S.) swine industry.  
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has conducted two analyses concerning the 
introduction of exotic swine diseases into the United States. The scope of each assessment included 
feed and feed ingredients. In 2014, APHIS completed the Pathways Assessment: Entry Assessment for 
Exotic Viral Pathogens of Swine. This assessment estimated the likelihood of entry of exotic swine 
viruses via several import pathways based on the quantity of the commodity imported, the likelihood 
that a hazard would be associated with the pathway, and the likelihood that a hazard would persist 
under current import mitigation procedures. Several pathways were estimated to pose a non-
negligible risk of introducing exotic viral pathogens of swine into the United States, including animal

feed ingredients derived from unprocessed plants or plant products; however, significant gaps in 
knowledge and available data prohibited a conclusive assessment. In 2015, APHIS completed the Swine 
Enteric Coronavirus Introduction to the United States: Root Cause Investigation Report. This report 
investigated several plausible import pathway scenarios including flexible intermediate bulk containers 
(FIBC or tote bags) used to transport feed ingredients from China as a possible pathway for the 
introduction of PEDV into the United States [11].

introduction of PEDV into the United States [11].   
 
Despite extensive investigative work in the field and the laboratory, the specific mode of introduction of 
exotic viral pathogens such as PEDV, into the United States and, subsequently, into domestic swine 
premises remains unknown. In order for feed or feed ingredients to be a route of disease introduction 
into the United States, it must become contaminated with the causative agent; avoid inactivation 
through (trans-ocean) travel, feed manufacturing, processing, and distribution processes; and be 
ingested at a dose sufficient to cause infection in a susceptible pig (see Figure below).  
 
Figure 1: Simple generic pathway for transmission of pathogens in feed 
The risk of disease transmission via contaminated feed and feed ingredients is non-zero as pathogens 
such as Salmonella are known to be transmitted via swine feed [12, 13]. However, questions regarding 
the true risk level that contaminated feed and feed ingredients pose in the introduction and subsequent 
transmission of PEDV and other exotic swine viruses remain unanswered, particularly in comparison to 
other recognized risk factors such as movement of infected pigs, transport vehicles, personnel, and 
waste feeding of unprocessed or improperly processed animal products. Thus, making sound decisions 
regarding risk mitigation measures in the face of an uncertain risk level is challenging. Additionally, the 
economic costs and downstream impacts of broadly banning certain feed ingredients or applying other 
mitigation measures to feed and feed ingredients without objective data may outweigh the costs of 
direct production losses from a disease event [5].

The emergence of PEDV in North America and growing concerns of introduction of ASF from China, the 
European Union, or other affected regions has put a spotlight on the possible role of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients in the introduction and transmission of viral swine pathogens. The characteristics

movement of pigs and related production components (e.g., transport vehicles, feed, personnel) – and 
the trend of emerging swine pathogens in new geographic ranges (e.g., ASF) and/or with increased 
pathogenicity (e.g., PEDV) suggests that the critical production inputs along with existing biosecurity and 
mitigating measures that have historically delivered an acceptable level of protection may need to be re-
evaluated.

swine industry and other associated stakeholders. The goal of the literature review is to understand the 
current scientific knowledge and to identify information gaps. The results may support future scientific 
research and/or risk quantifying models for evaluating the risk (or likelihood) of entry of exotic viral 
pathogens via specific feed ingredients from source countries and subsequent exposure to U.S. swine 
populations.

4 Methods of the Literature Review 
4.1 Overview 
The methodology of this literature review follows the basic framework of a qualitative systematic review 
[1]. The literature review aims to identify, evaluate, and summarize the findings of relevant research 
studies, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers, other stakeholders, 
and the scientific community. When appropriate, combining the results of several studies gives a more 
reliable and precise estimate of the available knowledge, intervention, or control measure’s 
effectiveness than one study alone. This literature review aims to answer the following research 
question:  
What evidence is available in published scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin 
ingredients of commercial swine feed could transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the 
United States?

effectiveness than one study alone. This literature review aims to answer the following research 
question:  
What evidence is available in published scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin 
ingredients of commercial swine feed could transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the 
United States?  
The methodology of the literature review has four main components: 1) identifying and selecting 
research evidence, 2) data extraction and quality assessment, 3) data synthesis, and 4) report writing 
[1]. 
4.2 Identification of studies and study selection 
A systematic search of the National Library of Medicine/PubMed, National Agricultural Library/PubAg, 
National Agricultural Library/Navigator (including major databases: AGRICOLA, AGRIS, BIOSIS, CABI, 
EBSCO Environment Complete, GEOBASE, GeoRef, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Zoological 
Record) and Google Scholar was conducted to identify published scientific literature pertaining to 
evidence regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could transmit viral 
pathogens of swine into or within the United States. Studies published any time through March 2018 
were identified.  
The study selection process was performed in two stages. In the first stage, an initial screening of search 
results was performed based on title and abstract. In the second stage, the full text of the preliminary 
list of studies was evaluated. Additional articles were obtained through manual review of reference 
citations in the relevant literature. Figure 2 provides an overview of the study selection process. Studies 
were excluded that did not meet the purpose statement of the literature review. Reasons for exclusion 
include:  
 Focus on non-viral pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, toxopl

 was evaluated. Additional articles were obtained through manual review of reference 
citations in the relevant literature. Figure 2 provides an overview of the study selection process. Studies 
were excluded that did not meet the purpose statement of the literature review. Reasons for exclusion 
include:  
 Focus on non-viral pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, toxoplasmosis, etc.) 
 Focus on disease transmission routes other than feed and feed ingredients (e.g., airborne) 
 Animal origin feed ingredients (e.g., swill, SDPP, etc.) 
 Focus on mitigations/treatment/disinfection of equipment or sanitizing feed 
 No English translation available 
 Full text not available (e.g., abstract or conference proceeding only)

The two-stage study selection resulted in retention of 26 included studies. The most common reasons 
for exclusion (in descending order) included: focus on disease transmission routes other than feed or 
feed ingredients; focus on mitigations/treatment/disinfection of equipment or sanitizing feed; subject 
matter outside the scope of the review; and focus on animal origin feed ingredients. 
4.3 Data extraction and quality assessment 
The data extraction component is the process by which research reviewers obtain the necessary 
information about study characteristics, methods, and findings from the included studies. The quality 
assessment component aims to identify internal and external validity of the selected studies. 
Standardized data extraction provides consistency in a literature review, thereby reducing potential bias 
and improving validity and reliability.  
A fillable, pdf data extraction form was created for the purpose of this literature review. Twenty-six 
published articles were included in the data extraction and quality assessment process. Six reviewers 
worked in pairs to perform the data extraction and quality assessment. Each article was reviewed for 
general information, study characteristics, and outcome results. For the quality assessment portion, the 
reviewers reported on potential sources of bias, shortfalls in the statistical and analyses methodology, 
the quality of reporting, and the generalizability of the study to the commercial swine industry in the 
United States. An example of the form is provided in Appendix I.

4.4 Data synthesis and report writing 
A qualitative, narrative approach was used for the data synthesis and report writing. The information 
extracted in the data extraction process was summarized into data synthesis tables. These tables are 
provided in Appendix II. From the data synthesis tables, relevant information from the individual studies 
was collated and summarized in the Literature Review Results section below.

5 Animal-origin Feed Ingredients 
Although outside of the scope of this literature review, the exploration of animal-origin feed ingredients 
as possible vehicles for pathogen transmission, in particular swine-origin ingredients such as SDPP, has 
been on-going. Recent studies have associated SDPP with the transmission of PEDV. Many of the studies 
reviewed in this literature review included swine-origin feed ingredients as part of the experimental 
data and/or the overall study discussion. Some studies more broadly or generically used the term “feed” 
without distinguishing whether animal origin ingredients were excluded. Thus, several recent studies on 
the transmission of PEDV via feed are summarized below to provide context for the discussion of the 
epidemiological role, if any, of contaminated animal-origin feed and feed ingredients in pathogen 
transmission.

 provide context for the discussion of the 
epidemiological role, if any, of contaminated animal-origin feed and feed ingredients in pathogen 
transmission. 
5.1 Spray-dried porcine plasma 
Several experimental studies and epidemiological investigations have been conducted on the role of 
PEDV-contaminated SDPP in the transmission of PED with inconsistent conclusions [7, 14-20]. In 
particular, the first outbreak of PED in Canada in January 2014 focused on imported SDPP from the 
United States as the possible transmission vehicle. Using complete feed and SDPP samples associated 
with the positive case herds in Canada, Pasick et al. (2014) conducted a swine bioassay with PEDV 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive SDPP and feed mixed with PEDV PCR-positive SDPP. The results   
provided evidence that the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP [cycle threshold (Ct)1 value range 36.35 – 36.69] 
was infectious as clinical signs of diarrhea were observed and significant amounts of PEDV were shed in 
the feces of piglets inoculated with the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP. In contrast, the bioassay results from 
the piglets challenged with the feed matrix2 containing PEDV PCR-positive SDPP (Ct value range 37.22 – 
42.88) were inconclusive and, thus, infectivity could not be definitely demonstrated [7]. In a 
retrospective case-control study, Perri et al. (2018) investigated the role of feed and other factors in the

Canadian outbreak. The authors found that the odds of PED occurrence in herds receiving feed from a 
specific feed company that provided potentially contaminated feed was 38.1 times greater than for 
herds that did not receive that feed. The number of live pig movements, semen deliveries, and the 
frequency of dead stock pickups were not identified as risk factors for PED [20]. Similarly, Aubry et al. 
(2017) determined the attack rate for farms with confirmed consumption of feed containing SDPP was 
28.1% while the attack rate of unexposed farms was estimated at 0.17%. The strength of association 
increased with increasing concentration of SDPP in feed [18]. In a separate study, spatiotemporal 
findings included that cases were more likely to neighbor cases than controls, and the pattern of spread 
indicated point source introduction with secondary transmission [17].

Collectively, these studies of the epidemiological investigation of the Canadian PED outbreak concluded 
that a single lot of SDPP imported from the United States was the vehicle of infection and found that the 
proportion of cases exposed to creep and nursery feeds contaminated with this product was 
significantly higher than expected.  The investigation of the initial cases found no association with other 
exposures, such as feed providers, transporters, a rendering company or livestock haulers [7, 17, 18]. 
Despite previous evidence that the spray-drying process is effective at inactivating viruses, including 
PEDV [16, 21-23], the investigations into the Canadian PED cases suggest that a breach of good 
manufacturing practices and/or biosecurity practices led to contamination of the SDPP during 
processing, or post-processing contamination occurred during packaging, storage, and transportation of 
the SDPP and subsequent mixing into the complete swine feed [18]. 
However, independent studies on the same single lot of SDPP (provided directly from the plasma 
manufacturer not affected farms) by the Food and Drug Administration and the North American Spray 
Dried Blood and Plasma Producers Association determined the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP was not 
infectious; pigs remained negative as determined by PCR and serology testing. To account for low

 lot of SDPP (provided directly from the plasma 
manufacturer not affected farms) by the Food and Drug Administration and the North American Spray 
Dried Blood and Plasma Producers Association determined the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP was not 
infectious; pigs remained negative as determined by PCR and serology testing. To account for low 
sensitivity of the bioassay and to mimic commercial feeding practices, two additional bioassay studies 
were performed with longer feeding times (14 and 28 days, respectively); both determined that pigs fed 
a diet with 5% SDPP that was PCR-positive for PEDV (Ct values of 30.1 and 30.0, respectively) did not 
contain infectious PEDV and did not transmit PEDV to pigs [16]. Similarly, Opriessnig et al. (2014) found 
that a commercial feed containing 5% commercial SDPP confirmed positive for PEDV ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) (SDPP diet contained 3.3±0.3 log10 PEDV RNA copies/g) was not infective and not capable of 
transmitting PEDV to pigs [14]. Dee et al. (2015) were also not able to reproduce or support the Pasick et 
al. (2014) findings despite repeat bioassays with high viral load (Ct value of 16.34) [7, 15]. Given the 
varying results, the role, if any, of SDPP and other swine origin feed ingredients in the general 
epidemiology of PEDV requires further investigation, particularly in identifying the critical points in the 
production and distribution processes where contamination may occur and the likely sources for the 
viral contamination.

6 Literature Review Results 
The core studies included in this literature review have been collated into three categories: background 
information on risk factors for transmission and fomite survivability, epidemiology and outbreak 
investigations, and experimental studies with swine bioassays. Studies were grouped into the best-fit 
category. Information extracted from the core studies may overlap into one or more categories and, 
thus, may be discussed in more than one section. Additionally, the study summaries provided in this 
section are not meant to be detailed and fully comprehensive but rather are focused on the information 
pertinent to this literature review, namely, non-animal origin feed ingredients. Studies conducted on 
feed and feed ingredients containing animal-origin ingredients, such as SDPP, are summarized in Section 
5. For additional study details, please see Appendix II or consult the full-text paper (see References).   
6.1 Risk factors for transmission and fomite survivability 
Numerous investigators have reviewed the epidemiology and impact of swine viral pathogens and 
analyzed industry expert opinion and outbreak information to identify risk factors for transmission of 
swine pathogens. Additionally, several studies have looked at the survivability of viruses on various 
fomites related to swine production and husbandry, including feed and feed ingredients. Methods used 
by these investigators include expert elicitation, questionnaire-based post-hoc outbreak investigations, 
and experimental studies of the survival of viruses in contact with fomites

swine pathogens. Additionally, several studies have looked at the survivability of viruses on various 
fomites related to swine production and husbandry, including feed and feed ingredients. Methods used 
by these investigators include expert elicitation, questionnaire-based post-hoc outbreak investigations, 
and experimental studies of the survival of viruses in contact with fomites. Here, we summarize such 
investigations and their findings, focusing on non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. The studies 
are grouped into two categories: risk factors for virus transmission and virus survival in contact with 
fomites. The virus scope of these studies includes African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine high fever 
disease, (highly pathogenic) porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), pseudorabies 
virus (PRV), Aujeszky’s disease virus, and blue eye disease virus. 
6.1.1 Risk factors for virus transmission 
Three studies examined the epidemiology of specific swine pathogen(s) or outbreak events in various 
regions of the world [24-26]. The pathogens covered include porcine high fever disease virus in Vietnam 
and ASFV in Nigeria and Eastern Europe. One study used expert elicitation methods to identify risk 
factors for transmission of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (HP-PRRS) 
into and within Australia [27].  
• A study by Le et al. (2012) examined risk factors that may have contributed to the spread of 
porcine high fever disease (PHFD) from China to Vietnam in 2008. PHFD is considered a PRRS-
related syndrome. A survey was administered to individual households in a southern province of 
Vietnam which included questions regarding observed clinical signs

• A study by Le et al. (2012) examined risk factors that may have contributed to the spread of 
porcine high fever disease (PHFD) from China to Vietnam in 2008. PHFD is considered a PRRS-
related syndrome. A survey was administered to individual households in a southern province of 
Vietnam which included questions regarding observed clinical signs in the owner’s swine herd, 
suggestive of PHFD, as well as various risk factors that could contribute to the spread of this 
virus. Probability incidence of PHFD was estimated based on description of clinical signs but 
presence of the virus was not confirmed with diagnostics. Investigators found that, among other 
things, the presence of ducks and the feeding of water green crops, together, were positively 
 
 
16 
 
 
 
associated with clinical signs consistent with PHFD in swine. Water green crops are fed directly 
to pigs after harvest, without processing. Authors hypothesize that ducks potentially amplify the 
virus, similar to data shown for PRRSV, and contaminate the water green crops fed to pigs. It is 
also believed that PHFD virus can persist in water further contaminating the greens before 
harvest. The findings of this study suggest that unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients 
could be contaminated with virus by other animals and transmitted to swine [25].  
 
• The study by Fasina et al. (2012) sought to identify risk factors associated with ASF outbreaks in 
Nigerian swine herds. Investigators conducted a matched case control investigation of farms 
that experienced ASF outbreaks between 2006 and 2009. Case farms met OIE (World 
Organization for Animal Health) guidelines for confirmation of ASF including clinical signs,

. (2012) sought to identify risk factors associated with ASF outbreaks in 
Nigerian swine herds. Investigators conducted a matched case control investigation of farms 
that experienced ASF outbreaks between 2006 and 2009. Case farms met OIE (World 
Organization for Animal Health) guidelines for confirmation of ASF including clinical signs, 
pathological signs, and laboratory diagnostic confirmation of ASF. Control farms were selected 
based on farm characteristics, similarity in operations and biosecurity measures, and absence of 
ASFV infection. An epidemiological questionnaire was administered to all participating farm 
owners and a number of factors associated with increased risk of ASF were identified. These 
included but were not limited to purchase of untested pigs from neighboring farms, presence of 
an abattoir in the community, wild bird access to pig pens, sharing of equipment between farms, 
and unprotected feed sources (rodent access). The use of commercial feed on farm, instead of 
swill feeding, was negatively associated (protective) with ASF risk. The final logistical regression 
model showed that protecting food and water sources, separation of sick and healthy pigs, and 
washing/disinfecting equipment were negatively associated (protective) with ASF infection. 
These findings indicate that preventing rodent access to feed sources and the use of commercial 
feeds, as opposed to swill feeding, were potentially protective measures in the farms studied. 
The investigators of this study conducted extensive statistical analysis on a wide range of ASF 
risk factors found on small and large swine farms. This study was conducted in a developing 
country; thus, direct application of findings to large scale, industrial swine farms in the United 
States may be limited [24].

States may be limited [24].  
 
• The review by Guinat et al. (2016) summarizes findings of ASFV transmission studies performed 
in Eastern European and Baltic countries. In respect to feed-to-pig transmission pathways, the 
authors referenced a European Commission (2014) epidemiological report in Latvia and 
Lithuania suggesting that fresh grass and seeds may have been contaminated by wild boar feces 
containing ASFV and transmitted the virus to domestic backyard pigs. A similar study focused on 
ASF in Latvia also suggested that feeding potentially contaminated (via wild boar) fresh grass or 
crops was a risk factor for ASF disease in backyard holdings; however, swill feeding could not be 
excluded as a source [28]. A study conducted in Kenya in 1921 demonstrated that ASFV could be 
transmitted to pigs when they consumed infected feces and urine but failed to transmit when 
contaminated sweet potatoes or bananas were consumed [29]. Several references were 
provided for documented transmission of ASFV to domestic pigs through feeding of swine-origin

feed ingredients such as preserved or uncooked meat products; some primary references from 
the review were not accessible to the reviewers, making it difficult to gauge the robustness of 
the referenced studies. However, the studies referenced demonstrated that there is very little 
field data exploring the relationship of ASFV transmission and non-animal origin feed ingredients 
[26].

[26].  
 
• Brookes et al. (2015) elicited industry expert opinions to identify entry and exposure routes with 
the highest probability of occurrence for introduction of HP-PRRS from south-east Asia to 
Australia. Pig industry experts attending the Australian Pig Veterinarians' Annual Conference in 
Melbourne, Australia in June 2013 were given a questionnaire and asked to indicate the 
probability of occurrence of 28 entry routes and 36 exposure routes within fixed probability 
ranges over one year. Agreement between participants was assessed using a chi-squared 
statistical test by comparing the frequency distribution of probability ranges for each route with 
a random distribution of probability ranges. There was statistically significant agreement on 29 
exposure routes; the routes with the highest estimated probability of occurrence all involved 
disposal of waste to feral or backyard pigs. The highest probability exposure route for 
commercial pigs was thought to be contact with a human acting as a fomite or access to animal 
feed/additives from south-east Asia. (Note: the definition of "animal feed/additives" was not 
provided and it is unclear if this term refers to non-animal origin feed, individual ingredients, or 
complete feed.) There was significant agreement on 16 entry routes; however, there were fewer 
consistent agreements or patterns of responses regarding a high proportion of entry routes in 
comparison to the exposure routes. This may be due to the fact that participant knowledge was 
of the pig industry and associated biosecurity practices, not border security or trade policy. The

consistent agreements or patterns of responses regarding a high proportion of entry routes in 
comparison to the exposure routes. This may be due to the fact that participant knowledge was 
of the pig industry and associated biosecurity practices, not border security or trade policy. The 
entry routes with the highest probability of occurrence and statistically significant agreement 
among participants included entry of HP-PRRS by humans or animal feed acting as fomites (and 
traveling or being shipped by air) and raw pork entering through the postal service or by a 
private individual. There was not agreement on the probability of entry of these fomites 
traveling or being shipped by sea. [27].  
6.1.2 Virus survival in contact with fomites 
Three studies examined virus survivability on various swine-related fomites, including feed and feed 
ingredients [30-32]. The viruses covered by these studies were PRV, PRRSV, Aujeszky’s disease virus, and 
blue eye disease virus.  
• Schoenbaum et al. (1991) investigated the survival duration of PRV in contact with various solid 
and liquid fomites commonly found in hog-raising environments. Feed or feed ingredients 
included in the study were green grass, whole corn, pelleted feed, and alfalfa. The authors did 
not report whether the feed included any animal-origin ingredients. The authors mixed stock 
PRV with various diluents, namely saline, swine saliva, or swine nasal washings, and inoculated 
fomites with those mixtures. After incubating the inoculated fomites at 25 °C for up to 14 days,

 feed included any animal-origin ingredients. The authors mixed stock 
PRV with various diluents, namely saline, swine saliva, or swine nasal washings, and inoculated 
fomites with those mixtures. After incubating the inoculated fomites at 25 °C for up to 14 days, 
 
 
18 
 
 
 
the authors tested for virus activity through use of a cell-culture-based assay. They found that, 
in general, the quantity of infectious virus decreased over time. Of the combinations of PRV and 
diluent with feed or non-animal origin feed ingredients, the combination of PRV/saline/whole 
corn remained infectious the longest at 7 days with an estimated half-life of 36.3 hours. The 
durations of infectiousness of the other combinations of PRV/diluent/feed or non-animal origin 
feed ingredients were shorter, ranging from 1 to 4 days with an estimated half-life of 1.0 hour to 
5.1 hours. The conditions of this study do not reliably reproduce field conditions. The fomites 
were inoculated with stock virus at doses that might not reflect contamination levels under field 
conditions. The authors used liquid diluents in all experiments and deliberately avoided field 
conditions (drying and ultraviolet light exposure) deleterious to virus activity. Similarly, the 
authors acknowledged that virus survival time is impacted by temperature, and speculated that 
virus survival times would be longer at lower temperatures and shorter at higher temperatures 
[30].  
 
• Pirtle and Beran (1996) investigated the survival time of PRRSV in contact with various liquid and 
solid fomites. Feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients included in the study were ground 
corn,
Text Len: 1653
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, and speculated that 
virus survival times would be longer at lower temperatures and shorter at higher temperatures 
[30].  
 
• Pirtle and Beran (1996) investigated the survival time of PRRSV in contact with various liquid and 
solid fomites. Feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients included in the study were ground 
corn, pelleted swine starter feed mix, and alfalfa. The authors did not report whether the feed 
included any animal-origin ingredients. The authors mixed stock PRRSV with saline, and 
inoculated fomites with those mixtures. After incubating the inoculated fomites at 25 to 27 °C 
for up to 11 days, the authors tested for virus activity through use of a cell culture based assay. 
In the PRRSV-spiked alfalfa sample, the authors detected PRRSV only on day 0. They did not 
detect any virus in the PRRSV-spiked starter feed mix and ground corn samples. The authors 
speculated that the pH (<7) of the samples tested and/or unknown substances present in the 
samples could have contributed to virus inactivation. The conditions of this study do not reliably 
reproduce field conditions. The addition of saline to each of the samples increased the moisture 
content of the samples and might have impacted the virus survival kinetics. In addition, the feed 
and feed ingredient samples were inoculated with stock virus at doses that might not reflect 
contamination levels under field conditions [31]. 
 
• Martínez-Gamba et al. (2001) examined the persistence of bacterial and viral pathogens in feces

• Martínez-Gamba et al. (2001) examined the persistence of bacterial and viral pathogens in feces 
fermented for use in animal feed (silage). Feces from 30 pigs was collected, inoculated with 
Aujeszky’s disease virus and blue eye disease virus, and mixed with molasses and sorghum for 
fermentation. Flasks of ensilage were incubated at room temperature for 0, 7, 14, 28, and 56 
days. Presence of virus was detected by cytopathic effects on cellular monolayers and indirect 
immunofluorescence. Samples were positive for virus on day 0 but not at any subsequent time 
point. The findings indicate that fermentation is sufficient for the inactivation of the viruses 
tested and could be an acceptable means for eliminating harmful pathogens from feces used for 
animal feed. These results may not be applicable to viruses of other families [32].

6.1.3 Summary of findings 
In summary, most of the reports and studies summarized above were not specifically designed to focus 
on non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients as a potential vehicle for virus transmission; however, 
feed and feed ingredients were included in the study design or discussion. In some cases, the author did 
not clearly state or define whether the feed includes animal-origin ingredients. Similarly, some findings 
in this group of studies may not be generalizable to other virus families or the commercial swine 
industry in the United States. Given these limitations, several key points are highlighted below.

in this group of studies may not be generalizable to other virus families or the commercial swine 
industry in the United States. Given these limitations, several key points are highlighted below.  
Le et al. (2012) identified owning ducks and using water green crop as pig feed (together) as being 
associated with an increased risk of PHFD, speculating that unprocessed non-animal origin feed 
ingredients could be contaminated with virus by other animals and transmitted to swine [25]. Fasina et 
al. (2012) identified food and water control to be significantly associated with decreased risk of ASF 
infection in Nigeria, noting that feed and water biosecurity practices can prevent virus contamination by 
rodents and wild birds [24]. Consistent with these findings, expert opinion conducted in Australia found 
industry representatives believed commercial pigs were most likely to be exposed to HP-PRRS through 
access to contaminated animal feed and feed additives imported from southeast Asia [27]. These studies 
suggest that protecting unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients from contact with animals may 
decrease the likelihood of pathogen contamination. This may be particularly important for ingredients 
that are not processed before being fed to animals.   
Several investigators have examined the persistence of viral activity in the presence of various fomites, 
including non-animal origin feed ingredients. In experiments in which they spiked fomites with stock 
virus, they found, in general, that viral activity did not persist for long periods of time under the 
experimental conditions used. Schoenbaum et al. (1991) found that the combination of 
PRV/saline/whole corn remained infectious the longest at 7 days with an estimated half-life of 36.3

alfalfa sample [31]. Interestingly, Martínez-Gamba et al. (2001) found that fermentation is sufficient for 
the inactivation of Aujeszky’s disease virus and blue eye disease virus [32]. Collectively, these studies 
suggest that, under certain conditions, swine viruses can survive in non-animal origin feed ingredients. 
Among the knowledge gaps identified in these studies are the need for a comprehensive evaluation of 
transmission pathways involving non-animal origin feed ingredients and swine viruses. The scientific 
literature regarding the survival times for various non-animal origin feed ingredient/pathogen 
combinations as well as determination of infectivity is incomplete and warrants further studies along 
with documented replication of studies. Furthermore, the likelihood of non-animal origin feed 
ingredients incurring contamination and documented scenarios in which cross-contamination occurs 
under field conditions is unknown.

6.2 Epidemiology and outbreak investigations – PEDV and PDCoV 
In 2013, swine enteric coronaviruses, such as PEDV and PDCoV, emerged as pathogens of significance 
for the swine industry in the United States and several other countries. Efforts were made to describe 
the epidemiology of the outbreaks which included a focus on the source of virus introduction and 
transmission. Among other things, feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients were suspected as one 
possible route of virus introduction and spread. The following section summarizes reports pertaining 
primarily to PEDV and PDCoV outbreak investigations, findings related to feed and feed ingredients, and 
experimental studies that sought to determine the survivability of swine viruses in feed and feed 
ingredients.  
Studies reviewed in this section have been separated into two major categories: 1) epidemiological 
reports, reviews and surveys and 2) feed and feed ingredient studies. These studies are primarily 
focused on PEDV and PDCoV; however, other swine pathogens are included such as transmissible 
gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), PRRSV, and PCV2. The epidemiological reports collated information from 
literature and descriptive reviews, disease outbreak analyses, as well as information from retrospective 
surveys [5, 11, 33-38].  
Studies focused on virus-contaminated feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients evaluated the ability 
of these materials to serve as fomites for virus introduction and spread. The studies are grouped into 
descriptive and experimental reports. The descriptive studies obtained samples from feed, feed facilities 
and feed transport vehicles linked to disease outbreaks and analyzed them for presence of viral RNA [39, 
40]. Experimental studies included in this

 non-animal origin feed ingredients evaluated the ability 
of these materials to serve as fomites for virus introduction and spread. The studies are grouped into 
descriptive and experimental reports. The descriptive studies obtained samples from feed, feed facilities 
and feed transport vehicles linked to disease outbreaks and analyzed them for presence of viral RNA [39, 
40]. Experimental studies included in this section investigated survivability of swine viruses on feed 
fomites by adding virus to the feed or non-animal origin feed ingredient and examining virus titers over 
time [41, 42].  
6.2.1 Epidemiological reports, reviews and surveys 
Eight epidemiological reports examining the global outbreaks of PED and PDCoV have been reviewed. 
The geographic scope of these reports include Europe, Asia, and North America [5, 11, 33-38]. The 
authors sought to describe the outbreaks and describe associations between risk factors for 
transmission and disease status.  
• In 2014 and 2016, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published two reports pertaining 
to PED and PDCoV [33, 34]. In 2014, EFSA published a scientific opinion on PEDV and PDCoV 
based on a review of the scientific literature published in the preceding 10 years [34]. In regards 
to the global epidemiologic picture of PEDV and PDCoV, the authors found that only limited 
active monitoring is conducted for PED in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Few outbreaks of PED 
have been reported in Europe (Germany and Italy 2014); in Asia, multiple outbreaks have been 
reported in several countries. In the Americas, the first outbreak of PED in the United States was 
reported in May 2013 with rapid spread within the country and reports in North, Central and

 the Americas. Few outbreaks of PED 
have been reported in Europe (Germany and Italy 2014); in Asia, multiple outbreaks have been 
reported in several countries. In the Americas, the first outbreak of PED in the United States was 
reported in May 2013 with rapid spread within the country and reports in North, Central and 
 
 
21 
 
 
 
South America. The authors found no clear evidence that PDCoV is causing significant impacts 
on animal health [34].  
 
When examining the possible geographic differences in PEDV strains and the potential for 
immunologic cross-protection, the authors found a high level of sequence identity between 
PEDV in Germany and Italy and the PEDV in the Americas. Findings of retrospective studies 
suggest that at least two PEDV strains were introduced into the United States at similar times. 
Differences in the nucleotide sequence of PEDV have been identified but their effects on 
virulence, if any, are unknown. Serological cross-reactivity between PEDV in Europe and the 
Americas is reported; no data regarding cross-protection are available. For reasons not well 
understood, outbreaks of PEDV in Asia and the United States seem to be more severe than 
those in Europe. However, it’s difficult to compare impacts in different regions because of 
differences in age group of affected pigs, production systems, biosecurity, farm management, 
herd size, and immune status and sanitary status of the herd population [34]. 
 
In a literature review covering the preceding 10 years (2004 – June 2014), EFSA concluded that 
the scientific literature supports the following statements [34]:

herd size, and immune status and sanitary status of the herd population [34]. 
 
In a literature review covering the preceding 10 years (2004 – June 2014), EFSA concluded that 
the scientific literature supports the following statements [34]: 
 Infected live animals and feces are reported to transmit PEDV.  
 PEDV can survive in slurry but the epidemiologic role of this matrix is unknown.  
 High levels of infectious PEDV are shed in feces, contributing to contamination of various 
fomites, including vehicles, humans, and feed. 
 The transmission of PEDV via feed has been shown but more data are required to assess its 
epidemiologic importance.  
 PEDV RNA has been detected at low levels in serum but the role of this epidemiologic matrix 
is unknown.  
 Fecal cross-contamination of blood during collection at the slaughterhouse cannot be 
excluded.  
 Manufacturing techniques for SDPP can inactivate PEDV; however, different spray-drying 
techniques exist and variations in SDPP manufacturing procedures or breach in quality 
control (e.g., inadequate time and temperature holding times) may result in incomplete 
inactivation of PEDV. For example, infectious SDPP was detected in one study, but the origin 
of the PEDV in the SDPP is unknown (post-processing cross-contamination versus 
inadequate SDPP processing).

In 2016, EFSA published a scientific report of PEDV epidemiology and impact as reported in 
scientific literature in 2014 and 2015, together with an analysis of PED cases in the European 
Union [33]. The goals of the report were to provide guidance on PEDV data to be collected by 
European Union Member States in order to optimize response coordination, and an analysis of 
the epidemiologic data to quantify PED impact on pig production in the European Union. Also, 
an updated literature search was conducted to obtain data from October 2014 to October 2015 
to update information in the EFSA scientific opinion report from 2014. Transmission of PEDV via 
feed or feed ingredients was not directly addressed in this report; thus, a summary of the report 
is not provided. However, the major recommendation(s) relevant to feed and non-animal origin 
feed ingredients included the importance of strict biosecurity, in particular with vehicles, to 
prevent introduction of PEDV onto the farm [33].

• Although PEDV was first identified in Japan in the 1990s, Japan experienced renewed outbreaks 
of the disease in 2013. Scientists determined that the strain of PEDV in Japan was highly similar 
to the viral strain affecting the United States. In a retrospective questionnaire-based case-
control study, Sasaki et al. (2016) focused on risk factors associated with these new outbreaks of 
PEDV in Japan. The investigators tested the hypothesis that epidemiologic factors associated 
with a high risk of PEDV infection at swine farms located within 5 km of at least one other 
infected farm (locally exposed farms) differ from factors associated with high risk of infection at 
farms more distant from other infected farms (non-locally exposed farms). Using logistic 
regression analyses, they found that on locally exposed farms, PED was associated with a larger 
total number of swine, shorter distance to the nearest PEDV-positive farm, and a disinfectant 
contact time of less than 20 min. On non-locally exposed farms, PED was associated with 
increased feed truck visits to the farm, no visit by a veterinarian, and a disinfectant contact time 
of less than 20 min. Feed or non-animal origin feed ingredients were not explicitly included in 
the scope of this study. Feed-related items included on the questionnaire included feed truck 
visits and artificial milk. The authors found neither to be significantly associated with PED on 
either type of farm [36

• In the descriptive report by Davies (2015), the first half of the article discusses the similarities of 
3 major disease epidemics in the swine industry caused by PRRSV, PCV2, and PEDV. All three 
share the following features: highly host specific, rapid rates of mutation, and appear to be 
associated with swine as non-pathogenic (or associated with mild disease) for years before

becoming highly pathogenic. The author suggests that the proximate source of the highly 
pathogenic variants of the 3 viruses was the extant swine virome. The emergence of these 3 
highly pathogenic viruses over 25 years may be considered extremely rare events but the author 
argues that intensive single species food production systems along with globalization, 
intensification, and extensive movements of pigs have contributed to the geographic expansion 
of these viral agents and points to the likelihood that future "new" viruses in swine are likely to 
emerge from already recognized (non-pathogenic or ignored) swine viruses.  
 
The second half of the article discusses the risk of feeding animal products (SDPP) to swine and

The second half of the article discusses the risk of feeding animal products (SDPP) to swine and 
whether or not the true risk warrants excluding animal origin products (or other ingredients) 
from swine diets. The author concludes that the risk of PEDV survival in SDPP is extremely low, 
but non-zero. The challenge lies in how to manage a non-zero risk. The likelihood of transmitting 
PEDV via feed in comparison to transmitting PEDV via infected animals is likely extremely low. 
However, the consequences of a disease outbreak are significant and the trend toward 
increasing herd sizes (and assuming fixed biosecurity practices) in developed countries such as 
the United States along with greater flux of inputs (animals, semen, feed, water, personnel, 
vehicles, etc.) leads to a higher temporal frequency of adverse events. The author argues that a 
blanket ban on certain ingredients in swine feed (of swine origin) may not be the solution. A 
comprehensive evaluation of transmission pathways as well as cost-benefit analyses of 
managing feed-related risks and balancing risks with nutritional value are needed [5].  
 
• In the review by Lowe (2014), the author summarized aspects of the U.S. outbreak of PEDV in 
2013, including factors that were found to be associated with greater risk of PEDV transmission. 
The author concluded that current research supports transmission of PEDV through livestock 
transportation, movement of people, vehicles, and other contaminated fomites as well as 
shared resources and equipment among farms [35]. The author cited reports by the Canadian

shared resources and equipment among farms [35]. The author cited reports by the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency and others that demonstrated the level of PEDV found in SDPP added to 
feed around the time of the outbreak was not sufficient to transmit virus to naïve pigs [7, 14]. It 
is stated that feed was not likely a primary transmission route of PEDV in 2013 [35]; however, 
Lowe cites other clinical studies and epidemiological investigations that provide evidence that 
feed can serve as a fomite for PEDV if contaminated during the manufacturing, storage, and 
transport processes [35].   
 
• In 2014, the United States experienced the emergence of a second novel swine enteric 
coronavirus, PDCoV. McCluskey et al. (2016) administered a retrospective survey to 42 U.S. 
swine breeding herd operations that experienced a confirmed outbreak of PDCoV in order to 
identify factors that may have contributed to the introduction and spread of the virus. Among 
other things, the source and timing of feed delivered to the affected farms in the 10 days prior 
to the outbreak of PDCoV was examined. All farms surveyed had a delivery of complete feed or

feed ingredients in the 10 days prior to the outbreak; 60% of those had a delivery of SDPP while 
40% received blood products or pork fat. One third of the farms received feed components from 
outside of the United States. There was no common source of feed or SDPP for the farms 
surveyed [37].

40% received blood products or pork fat. One third of the farms received feed components from 
outside of the United States. There was no common source of feed or SDPP for the farms 
surveyed [37]. 
 
• In April/May of 2013, PEDV was first identified in the United States. Scott et al. (2016) addressed 
the question of how PEDV entered the United States, through various methods including 
scenario development, post hoc investigations, epidemiologic surveys, a case control study, 
brainstorming, and speculation. They used previously collected epidemiologic data to develop 
scenarios and identify hypothetical routes of PEDV introduction into the United States and 
conducted follow-up studies to gather evidence for the most plausible scenarios. The follow-up 
studies included testing organic soybeans and pet jerky treats imported from China and archived 
serum samples opportunistically collected from feral swine; all results were negative. The 
authors did not identify a proven source or route of PEDV introduction into the United States. 
However, it was suggested that incomplete farm feed/ration records negatively impacted 
investigators’ ability to thoroughly evaluate the potential epidemiologic role of feed or feed 
ingredients.  The authors identified totes used to transport bulk feed as providing “the simplest 
explanation” for the investigation findings [11]. 
 
• A retrospective survey was administered to U.S. swine veterinarians and producers in 2017 to 
collect opinions regarding, among other things, the suspected source of PEDV and PDCoV 
introduction into the United States in 2013-2014. The majority of respondents believed trucks

introduction into the United States in 2013-2014. The majority of respondents believed trucks 
coming onto the farm (26%), feed (29%), and variable biosecurity protocols (18%) were 
responsible for virus introduction. Survey participants were also asked about control measures 
implemented in response to outbreaks. None of the participants noted a change in feed 
practices although 56% implemented enhanced biosecurity protocols. At the time of the survey 
the majority of respondents had either never experienced an outbreak of PEDV or PDCoV 
(28.9%) or reported that the virus had been eliminated from their farms (56.6%) [38]. 
6.2.2 Feed and feed ingredients 
Feed and feed ingredients have been hypothesized to serve as fomites for virus introduction and spread, 
leading several investigators to examine environmental samples (feed, fomites etc.) for the presence of 
virus and/or to conduct assays testing the ability of feed to serve as a fomite for virus. The following 
summarizes the reported findings. 
Descriptive

Environmental samples were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The investigators 
report that PEDV RNA was detected in newly opened bags of pellets on-farm; and in pellets and 
individual ingredients sampled at the source (supplier) facility. No virus isolation (VI) assays were 
performed on these samples. In the bioassay conducted, pigs were observed to be healthy and 
no clinical signs of disease were observed [39].  
 
• A retrospective case study by Greiner (2016) investigating PEDV and PDCoV outbreaks in the 
United States found a positive association between feed truck visits to farms and presence of 
PEDV. To investigate the role of feed and feed mills in these outbreaks, environmental sampling 
was conducted at 24 feed mills, some of which served farms known to be positive for PEDV or 
PDCoV. The investigators swabbed office floors, bulk ingredient pit grates (exterior surfaces), 
mixer/pellet coolers, incoming bagged-ingredient truck trailers, the interior of feed 
compartments on trucks servicing farms, and feed truck foot pedals. None of the samples 
obtained were positive for PEDV RNA, 5% of truck foot pedals and 1% of bulk ingredient pit 
grates were suspect for PDCoV RNA, and 3.4% and 2.2% of truck foot pedals and office floors, 
respectively, were positive for PDCoV. All other samples were negative for PDCoV. There were

or PDCoV RNA [40]. 
Experimental 
• Trudeau et al. (2017a and 2017b) conducted experimental assays to investigate inactivation 
kinetics of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in feed and feed ingredient matrices and on solid surfaces. 
Feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients used in these studies included complete feed, corn, 
soybean meal, corn dried distillers grains with solubles, and vitamin and trace mineral premix. 
The authors mixed stock virus with liquid medium, and then spiked samples of feed and feed 
ingredients with the mixture and incubated the combinations at various temperatures. In one 
study, they incubated the spiked samples at room temperature (approximately 25 °C) for 0 to 56 
days [42]. In another study, they incubated the spiked samples at 60 to 90 °C for up to 30 min 
[41]. The authors used a cell culture based assay and model fitting to estimate a delta value, 
calculated as an indicator of the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For the 
spiked samples incubated at room temperature, the largest delta values were obtained for

spiked samples incubated at room temperature, the largest delta values were obtained for 
PDCoV and TGEV in soybean meal, at approximately 42 days each. Soybean meal at room 
temperature also provided the highest delta value for PEDV, at 7.5 days. Other findings 
indicated that at room temperature, moisture and ether content were important determinants 
of virus survival. The authors found no difference in virus survival in feed or non-animal origin 
feed ingredients incubated at temperatures higher than 70 °C. The maximum level of virus 
inactivation occurred upon heating the spiked samples at 90 °C for 30 minutes [41, 42].

6.2.3 Summary of findings 
Of the retrospective studies, epidemiological investigations and reviews conducted in the aftermath of 
the PEDV and PDCoV outbreaks in 2013-2014, none found definitive evidence linking the transmission of 
PEDV and PDCoV to non-animal origin feed ingredients [11, 34-37]. Scott et al. (2016) proposed 
imported virus-contaminated feed totes as a possible scenario for the source of PEDV introduction into 
the United States in 2013; however, no conclusive data were presented to support this hypothesis [11]. 
The perception by the swine industry, however, that feed could have been the source of virus 
introduction is reflected in the results of the 2017 survey administered to veterinarians and swine 
producers, in which 29 percent of respondents believed feed was linked to virus entry and spread.

The perception by the swine industry, however, that feed could have been the source of virus 
introduction is reflected in the results of the 2017 survey administered to veterinarians and swine 
producers, in which 29 percent of respondents believed feed was linked to virus entry and spread. 
Trucks (26%) and variable biosecurity protocols (18%) were also believed to be linked with PED spread 
[38]. The EFSA 2014 scientific opinion report notes that while transmission of PEDV via feed has been 
experimentally demonstrated [9], more data are needed for reliable assessment of the epidemiologic 
importance of this route in the field [34].   
Lowe (2014) concluded that feed was not a primary transmission route in the spread of PEDV in the 
United States [35]. However, on further investigation, Lowe et al. (2014) found evidence that transport 
vehicles moving in and out of collection points, such as harvest facilities and livestock auction markets, 
served as a source of contamination of other transport vehicles, noting that the cost-saving industry 
practice of consolidating resources such as sharing building maintenance, manure handling equipment, 
personnel, and livestock transportation equipment likely contributed to the spread of the PED outbreak 
across multiple geographic regions in the United States [43]. Similarly, McCluskey et al. (2016) reported 
on findings that movement of feed trucks onto farms was significantly associated with PED status. 
Collectively, these studies suggest that biosecurity measures on the farm and at the feed manufacturing 
plant as well as limiting the movement of animals, people, vehicles, and other shared inputs could serve 
as critical control points to stop the transmission of PEDV between herds [35, 37, 43].

Collectively, these studies suggest that biosecurity measures on the farm and at the feed manufacturing 
plant as well as limiting the movement of animals, people, vehicles, and other shared inputs could serve 
as critical control points to stop the transmission of PEDV between herds [35, 37, 43].  
Two studies conducted environmental sampling of feed, feed facilities, and feed transport vehicles to 
determine whether these items contributed to the cause of the PEDV and PDCoV outbreaks in the 
United States [39, 40]. Collectively, the findings indicate that none of the source ingredients nor the 
outgoing feed at the feed mills sampled were positive for viral RNA, suggesting the non-animal origin 
ingredients and feed were not contaminated with PEDV or PDCoV. However, experimental studies by 
Trudeau et al. (2017a and 2017b) did show that feed ingredients spiked with PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in 
a laboratory setting could maintain live virus for a period of time at room temperature. The authors also 
found that different ingredients produced different virus survival periods which they believe may be due 
to moisture and ether content or pH of each ingredient. These data indicate that, under certain 
conditions, swine enteric coronaviruses are able to survive in feed ingredients [41, 42]. 
In summary, the epidemiologic investigations and outbreak studies did not definitively link (or exclude) 
transmission of PEDV or PDCoV with non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients. Inconsistent findings 
impart uncertainty towards feed or feed ingredients as a transmission pathway [35, 37, 39, 40, 43]. The

transmission of PEDV or PDCoV with non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients. Inconsistent findings 
impart uncertainty towards feed or feed ingredients as a transmission pathway [35, 37, 39, 40, 43]. The 
 
 
27 
 
 
 
most common mechanical fomite implicated in this group of studies was transport vehicles, including a 
positive association between feed truck movements onto farms and disease status [34-38, 40, 43]. Two 
experimental studies reviewed did demonstrate that virus added to feed can survive for a period of time 
under certain conditions [41, 42]. However, these studies did not investigate nor were able to 
demonstrate that virus present in feed could be transmitted to naïve animals through normal feeding 
behavior.  
Among the knowledge gaps identified in these studies are the identification of critical control points for 
pathogen contamination of feed and/or non-animal origin feed ingredients and consensus on the feed-
based transmission pathways for PEDV and PDCoV. The point source(s) for virus contamination of feed 
or non-animal origin feed ingredients are not clearly defined.    
 
6.3 Experimental studies on feed transmission with swine bioassays 
The rapid spread of PED in commercial swine in North America in 2013-2014 prompted several 
experimental (non- randomized) studies with in vivo biological assays (bioassays) to be conducted. The 
bioassays were used to assess the biological activity or potency of the pathogen(s) of interest by 
measuring the magnitude of response such as observed clinical signs consistent with the study 
disease(s) and/or positive findings to diagnostic testing and necropsy examination. Most studies

assays) to be conducted. The 
bioassays were used to assess the biological activity or potency of the pathogen(s) of interest by 
measuring the magnitude of response such as observed clinical signs consistent with the study 
disease(s) and/or positive findings to diagnostic testing and necropsy examination. Most studies 
included in this section of the literature review used swine bioassays to determine the infectivity of the 
pathogen(s) of interest in feed or feed ingredients subsequent to detection by PCR of virus nucleic acid 
in the matrix (feed or feed ingredients) under examination.   
For the purposes of discussion, the experimental studies with swine bioassays have been collated into 
two categories: field-based experimental studies with bioassays [9, 39, 44], and laboratory-controlled 
experimental studies with bioassays [15, 45-48]. In general, the bioassays involved naïve piglets of 
various ages, ranging from four days old to 21 days old [9, 48]; in some studies, pigs were re-used after a 
negative bioassay and the subsequent ages at re-introduction to the bioassay were not easily 
discernable [15, 47]. Piglets were sourced from healthy herds and tested by PCR and serological assays 
to confirm negative status to the respective pathogen(s) prior to the initiation of the bioassay. Exposure 
routes of the challenge matrix to the piglets varied, including ad libitum (natural) feeding [9, 39], oral 
administration via syringe [15, 47, 48], orogastric gavage [44-46], intramuscular injection, and intranasal 
administration [48]. In most studies, the bioassays consisted

routes of the challenge matrix to the piglets varied, including ad libitum (natural) feeding [9, 39], oral 
administration via syringe [15, 47, 48], orogastric gavage [44-46], intramuscular injection, and intranasal 
administration [48]. In most studies, the bioassays consisted of daily diagnostic monitoring, lasting 6-7 
days post-inoculation, culminating with euthanasia and complete necropsy examinations of piglets.   
6.3.1 Experimental studies with swine bioassays using field-sourced challenge virus  
Three experimental studies with swine bioassays exposed piglets to challenge feed samples inoculated 
with field-sourced virus from an index farm or contaminated feed facility. Prior to the bioassay, the virus

material was further processed or prepared in the laboratory before inoculating the challenge matrix. 
The bioassay results yielded mixed findings [9, 39, 44].  
• Pillatzki et al. (2015) used a swine bioassay to investigate whether PEDV PCR-positive samples of 
complete feed, feed pre-mix, and SDPP (Ct values of 33.8, 34.2, and 30.0, respectively) that had 
been retained by feed manufacturers could serve as a source of PEDV transmission to neonatal 
swine. The piglets inoculated with the PEDV-positive feed samples along with the negative-
control piglets remained negative for PEDV by PCR and clinically healthy throughout the study 
period. In contrast, only the positive-control piglets (Ct value = 25.5) developed clinical signs of

period. In contrast, only the positive-control piglets (Ct value = 25.5) developed clinical signs of 
PED; PEDV RNA was detected in fecal swabs; villous atrophy was observed in the ileum; and 
PEDV was detected in the ileum by immunohistochemistry [44].  
 
• Bowman et al. (2015) conducted a swine bioassay on a newly started pelleted diet that was 
implicated as the transmission vehicle of PEDV into an Ohio swine operation. PEDV was 
detected by RT-PCR in the interior of the unopened bags of the new supplier’s pellets, 
suggesting contamination occurred prior to delivery of the feed to the farm. Additionally, the 
source facility (supplier) tested positive for PEDV as well as individual ingredients at the source 
facility. Piglets were provided ad libitum access to the RT-PCR positive mash3 (mean Ct = 36.5) 
along with dry pellets from the same lot for 7 days and observed for clinical signs of PEDV. 
During the bioassay, none of the pigs developed clinical signs of disease. Environmental and 
rectal swabs collected daily during the study were negative for PEDV as determined by RT-PCR. 
Microscopic examination of intestinal tissues collected from the piglets at the end of the study 
revealed no significant morphologic lesions [39].

• Following an outbreak of PED on three breeding herd premises in the United States, Dee et al. 
(2014) used a novel on-farm sampling method to collect remnants of feed samples from empty 
feed bins that previously contained feed consumed by the index populations. Analysis of feed 
material across the 3 affected sites by real-time RT-PCR indicated the presence of PEDV RNA 
with Ct values ranging from 19.50-22.20. For the swine bioassay, piglets were divided into three 
groups: the treatment group was fed 454 g of the challenge feed (natural feeding method) 
(pooled Ct value = 20.65); the positive-control group was challenged with feed spiked with stock 
PEDV (Ct value = 18.23); and the negative-control group was fed a placebo feed. The challenge 
feed for the treatment group was prepared using 30 g of feed material from the PCR-positive bin 
samples from the 3 affected sites and diluted in 30 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline. The 
solution was vortexed and centrifuged. The supernatant was mixed with 454 grams of PEDV-free 
feed. Clinical signs consistent with PED were observed in piglets in the treatment group and the 
positive-control group. At necropsy, rectal swabs and intestinal tract samples from the 
treatment group and the positive-control group were positive for PEDV by PCR and

sequencing of viral RNA obtained from treatment and positive control groups confirmed 
consumption of feed and not cross-contamination as the source of infection [9]. 
6.3.2 Experimental studies with swine bioassays using laboratory-sourced challenge virus  
Five experimental studies with swine bioassays involved laboratory-controlled experimental studies in 
which piglets were exposed to the challenge matrix spiked with a predetermined pathogen dose 
sourced from laboratory stock viruses [15, 45-48]. Goyal (2014) and Schumacher et al. (2016) conducted 
experimental studies with a swine bioassay aimed at determining PEDV survivability in various organic 
materials and minimum infectious dose, respectively.

and wet swine feed, and drinking water and the mixtures were incubated at various humidity 
percentages and temperatures and for up to 14 days. PEDV and TGEV could be detected by PCR 
in fresh feces for 1-7 or 14 days, respectively, depending on temperature and humidity. Both 
viruses could be detected in slurry, non-chlorinated water, and dry and wet feed samples for ≥ 
28 days at room temperature [45].  
 
For the bioassay, a subset of pigs were inoculated via orogastric gavage with virus aliquots 
obtained from 7 day old fresh feces, ≥ 28 day old room temperature slurry samples and wet 
feed samples, 7 day old dry feed samples, and two week old water samples. Bioassay results 
showed that PEDV survives in fresh feces for 1-7 days. Infective virus was recovered from 
inoculated slurry samples stored for ≥ 14 days at various temperatures, suggesting that 
spreading of manure could disseminate virus onto fields. The findings of this study also suggest 
that PEDV inoculated into wet and dry swine feed can remain infective for up to 28 days and 7 
days, respectively [45].

that PEDV inoculated into wet and dry swine feed can remain infective for up to 28 days and 7 
days, respectively [45].  
 
• Schumacher et al. (2016) used a swine bioassay to estimate the minimum infectious dose of 
PEDV in virus-inoculated feed. The authors mixed serial dilutions of stock PEDV with feed, and 
administered the mixtures to 10-day-old piglets by orogastric gavage. The feed used in the study 
was corn- and soybean meal-based and included vitamin and trace mineral premixes and a 
source of phytase. The lowest concentration of virus in feed to cause infection in the piglets was 
5.6 x 101 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)/g which corresponds to a Ct value of 37. 
Based on this infective dose, the authors estimated that 1 g of fecal matter could contaminate 
up to 450,000 kg of feed. The authors noted that there was a 10 unit difference in PCR Ct value 
for PEDV mixed with feed (Ct value of 37) in comparison to an equivalent dose of PEDV mixed 
with tissue culture medium (Ct value of 27). The authors proposed a variety of mechanisms that

might account for this difference, such as differences in the methods of dilution and virus 
extraction, differential RNA degradation, or enhanced viral persistence through binding of virus 
particles or RNA to feed particles [46].

might account for this difference, such as differences in the methods of dilution and virus 
extraction, differential RNA degradation, or enhanced viral persistence through binding of virus 
particles or RNA to feed particles [46].  
Three experimental studies with swine bioassays reported by the same primary author examined the 
infectivity of PEDV in common swine feed ingredients in the presence or absence of a formaldehyde-
based liquid antimicrobial SalCURB® (LA) [15]; the infectivity of PEDV in common swine feed ingredients 
with or without LA and 2% custom medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA) following a simulated trans-
Pacific shipment from China to the United States [47]; and the infectivity of select viral pathogens in 
common swine feed ingredients following two simulated transportation conditions across two different 
regions of the world [48].   
• Dee et al. (2015) examined PEDV viability in various feed ingredients common in swine diets in 
the presence or absence of LA. Eighteen common swine feed ingredients were selected: corn, 
conventional soybean meal (SBM), dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS), SDPP, purified 
plasma, intestinal mucosa, meat and bone meal (MBM), RBC, 3 vitamin/trace mineral (VTM) 
mixes, choice white grease, soy oil, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, threonine, limestone, and dry 
choline chloride. Sixteen 30 g samples of each ingredient were divided into two groups in 
replicate. One group was treated with 0.1 mL of LA (treated group) and the other group was 
treated with saline (non-treated group). The samples were spiked with 2 mL PEDV

choline chloride. Sixteen 30 g samples of each ingredient were divided into two groups in 
replicate. One group was treated with 0.1 mL of LA (treated group) and the other group was 
treated with saline (non-treated group). The samples were spiked with 2 mL PEDV to reach a Ct 
mean of 25 (range 19-30) following mixing. There were 32 control samples of complete feed 
inoculated with PEDV (16 positive controls) or saline (16 negative controls). Also, 8-10 mL 
samples of stock PEDV served as stock virus controls. The samples were stored outside in winter 
conditions in plastic totes. At 1, 7, 14, and 30 days post-inoculation (DPI), samples were 
removed for diagnostic testing. The samples were tested for PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV by RT-PCR. 
The presence of viable virus was determined by VI. Viable PEDV (positive VI) on 30 DPI was 
detected from non-treated SBM, DDGS, RBCs, MBM, lysine HCL, and D/L methionine. Non-
treated choice white grease, threonine, and limestone were positive on VI at varying sampling 
days. Only SBM and MBM remained PCR positive at day 30; all LA-treated ingredients were VI 
negative [15].  
 
The swine bioassay was used for PCR positive but VI negative feed samples. This included the 
non-treated ingredients of corn, 3 VTM mixes, intestinal mucosa, soy oil, choline chloride, SDPP, 
purified plasma, as well as the LA-treated ingredients. Choice white grease

Each pig received 1 mL of the designated inoculum orally via syringe. Pigs were observed for 7 
days for clinical signs and rectal swabs were collected daily. If clinical signs were observed,

• Dee et al. (2016) designed a model to evaluate the transboundary risk of PEDV-contaminated 
swine feed ingredients during a simulated shipment from China to the United States and tested 
the effect of two mitigation strategies on the reduction of PEDV in feed using LA and 2% custom 
MCFA. Fourteen swine feed ingredients commonly imported from China to the United States 
were selected: organic and conventional soybeans and soybean meal (SBM), lysine HCL, D/L 
methionine, tryptophan, vitamins A, D, & E, choline chloride, rice hulls, corn cobs, and feed-
grade tetracycline. The samples were organized into four batches, each representing a specific

 soybeans and soybean meal (SBM), lysine HCL, D/L 
methionine, tryptophan, vitamins A, D, & E, choline chloride, rice hulls, corn cobs, and feed-
grade tetracycline. The samples were organized into four batches, each representing a specific 
segment of the 37 day shipping journey. Each ingredient was allocated into each of the four 
batches in two replicates. Each batch of ingredients had a positive control group (non-treated), a 
negative control group (PEDV-negative ingredients), a LA-treated group (LA and PEDV spiked), 
and a MCFA-treated group (MCFA and PEDV spiked). The samples were housed in a 
programmed environmental chamber based on the temperature and percent relative humidity 
for each segment of the shipping journey. For exposure to ambient air, two holes were drilled 
into each plastic container. At designated DPI, samples were removed and submitted for 
diagnostic testing by RT-PCR and VI. Viable PEDV (positive VI) in batch 4 (representing shipment 
to and storage in Iowa) was found in non-treated organic and conventional SBM, lysine, and 
vitamin D [47].   
 
The swine bioassay was used to test ingredients that were PCR-positive for PEDV but negative

Piglets (n = 24) of 5-7 days old were divided into groups of four. All four piglets in each unit 
received the same ingredient. Samples from batch 4 (to represent ingredients that would travel 
the entire 37-day journey to Iowa) were prepared for the bioassay. Piglets received 1 mL of the 
designated inoculum orally via syringe. Pigs were observed for 7 days for clinical signs and daily 
rectal swabs were taken and, if clinical, swabs were collected from diarrhea and vomit samples 
and tested by PCR. If diagnostic samples were PEDV-positive by PCR, all animals swabbed were 
euthanized and piglets re-stocked. If pigs remained PEDV-negative, the pigs were added to a 
different experimental group and inoculated with a different ingredient (re-used). Positive 
bioassay findings were observed in piglets that were administered non-treated choline chloride. 
None of the piglets fed LA- or MCFA-treated ingredients spiked with PEDV were positive on the 
swine bioassay [47].

Eleven feed ingredients were selected: organic and conventional SBM, soy oil cake, DDGS, lysine 
HCL, vitamin D, choline chloride, moist cat food, moist dog food, dry dog food, and pork sausage 
casings. Two transboundary shipping journeys were modeled: trans-Pacific (per Dee et al., 2016) 
to simulate travel between China and the United States and trans-Atlantic to simulate travel 
between Europe (Poland) and the United States (for ASFV only). The samples were organized 
into four batches, each representing a specific segment of each trans-ocean shipping journey. 
Duplicate samples of each ingredient were organized into the batches. Five gram samples of 
gamma-irradiated ingredients were spiked with 100 µL of minimum essential media containing 1

Duplicate samples of each ingredient were organized into the batches. Five gram samples of 
gamma-irradiated ingredients were spiked with 100 µL of minimum essential media containing 1 
X 105 TCID50/g of each virus. All samples were incubated in a programmed environmental 
chamber regulated for temperature and percent relative humidity. Samples of each 
ingredient/virus combination were removed from each batch at the predetermined DPI and 
tested by RT-PCR and VI. A wide variation in viability was observed across the virus-ingredient 
combinations from batch 4 [48]. 
 
The swine bioassay was used to determine infectivity of feed ingredients that tested positive by 
PCR but negative on VI in cell culture. The bioassay was performed with Seneca virus A (FMDV 
surrogate), PRRSV, porcine sapelovirus (SVDV surrogate), PCV2, ASFV, and IAV-S in selected 
virus-ingredient combinations. Pigs were inoculated by various methods, including orally via 
syringe, intramuscularly, and intranasally. A positive bioassay was observed for the following 
virus-ingredient combinations: PRRSV and conventional SBM; PRRSV and DDGS; Seneca virus A 
and choline; and PCV2 and lysine, choline, and vitamin D. The finding of Senecavirus A in choline

was not detailed in the discussion section [48].  
 
The investigators reported that from the virus-ingredient combinations subjected to various 
simulated environmental conditions, 7 viruses remained in a viable form in 2 or more 
ingredients: Seneca virus A, ASFV, PRRSV, porcine sapelovirus, PCV2, feline calicivirus (surrogate 
to VESV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (surrogate to PRV), and PEDV. The highest degree of stability was 
for Seneca virus A as viable virus was recovered from 10 of 11 ingredients. ASFV stock virus was 
the only virus to survive the simulated 30-day shipping journey in the absence of feed matrix. 
Half-life was calculated for Seneca virus A, porcine sapelovirus, feline calicivirus, bovine 
herpesvirus-1, and ASFV for each virus-ingredient combination. Feline calicivirus and Seneca 
virus A had extended half-lives in conventional SBM, 26.6 days and 9.7 day, respectively, as 
compared to other virus-ingredients combinations. Feline calicivirus had the longest half-life in 
conventional SBM at 26.6 days but much shorter half-life in other ingredients. In contrast, 
Seneca virus A had the least variability of half-life in feed, ranging from 1.7 to 9.7 days across 10 
ingredients. The non-animal origin feed ingredients that supported survival of multiple viruses

duration is variable and dependent on virus properties and feed matrix [48].  
6.3.3 Summary of findings 
For the experimental studies using field-sourced challenge virus, the swine bioassays in the Pillatzki et al. 
(2015) and Bowman et al. (2015) studies failed to demonstrate the infectivity of PEDV PCR-positive feed. 
Pillatzki et al. (2015) provides several plausible explanations, including the nucleic acid detected in the 
feed samples did not represent infectious virus; the feed samples had relatively high Ct values (range: 
30.0 – 36.5); and an extended storage time between collection of the sample and the bioassay may have 
reduced or eliminated the infectivity of the PEDV. Similar explanations were provided by Bowman et al. 
(2015), adding that the small number of piglets used in the bioassay and the short feeding trial period 
lowered the sensitivity of the bioassay and did not realistically reflect the field setting. Despite the 
negative findings, Bowman et al. (2015) maintains that the contaminated feed pellets were the source of 
the outbreak in the Ohio swine operation. Pillatzki et al. (2015

lowered the sensitivity of the bioassay and did not realistically reflect the field setting. Despite the 
negative findings, Bowman et al. (2015) maintains that the contaminated feed pellets were the source of 
the outbreak in the Ohio swine operation. Pillatzki et al. (2015) also concluded that feed contaminated 
with infectious PEDV can serve as a vehicle for disease transmission, citing as evidence that the positive-
control piglets that were administered spiked feed did develop clinical signs of PED and PEDV fecal 
shedding. The findings in Pillatzki et al. (2015) are consistent with the findings of Dee et al. (2014). Both 
studies produced challenge feeds with a low Ct value (range: 18.23 – 25.5) and the bioassay conducted 
with the PEDV-contaminated feeds produced disease.  
For the experimental studies using laboratory-sourced challenge virus, Goyal (2014) produced 
preliminary evidence that under laboratory conditions, PEDV can survive in PEDV-spiked wet and dry 
feed at room temperature and remain infectious for ≥ 28 days and 7 days, respectively [45]. Other 
studies on PEDV survival in individual swine feed ingredients support these findings [15, 41, 42, 47]. 
Schumacher et al. (2016) produced preliminary evidence on the minimum infectious dose of PEDV-
inoculated feed as 5.6 x 101 TCID50/g with Ct values ranging from 27 – 37 [46].  
The findings in three studies, under different experiment conditions, suggest that virus survival is 
ingredient-dependent. Varying physical and chemical characteristics of feed ingredients may enhance or 
protect virus survival [15

 dose of PEDV-
inoculated feed as 5.6 x 101 TCID50/g with Ct values ranging from 27 – 37 [46].  
The findings in three studies, under different experiment conditions, suggest that virus survival is 
ingredient-dependent. Varying physical and chemical characteristics of feed ingredients may enhance or 
protect virus survival [15, 47, 48]. Dee et al. (2015) noted several interesting or novel findings, including 
an extended survival time observed in conventional SBM; recovery of viable PEDV from (all non-treated) 
DDGS, 3 synthetic amino acids, and dry choline chloride; and the inability to recover viable PEDV from 
SDPP [in contrast to Pasick et al. (2014)] or the 3 VTM mixes. Dee et al. (2016) study also found viable 
PEDV in PEDV-spiked conventional SBM, lysine, and choline. Additionally, PEDV did survive and remain 
infectious in vitamin D [47]. Both formaldehyde-based LA and MCFA treatment rendered virus inactive, 
regardless of ingredient type, suggesting these mitigants might be useful as part of a risk management 
strategy for reducing viral load in feed ingredients [15, 47].  
Building upon the shipping model methods developed in the Dee et al. (2016) study, the Dee et al. 
(2018) study expanded the selection of viral pathogens as well as added an additional trans-oceanic

shipping route from Europe (Poland) to the United States for ASFV. Like the two preceding studies, Dee 
et al. (2018) found that certain feed ingredient matrices enhance or protect viral survival. Of interest, 
the authors noted that

shipping route from Europe (Poland) to the United States for ASFV. Like the two preceding studies, Dee 
et al. (2018) found that certain feed ingredient matrices enhance or protect viral survival. Of interest, 
the authors noted that virus viability in organic SBM could not be demonstrated. This finding could 
discount previous speculation that the rise in organic swine farming may have contributed to PEDV 
introduction in to the United States. Additionally, the authors noted that ASFV demonstrated strong 
survivability characteristics, remaining viable under laboratory-simulated conditions with or without the 
feed matrix [48].  
In summary, the infective dose of PEDV is low and, experimentally, infectivity of the feed material is 
dependent on viral load (e.g., Ct value). Additionally, experimental evidence indicates that the duration 
of virus survival in swine feed ingredients is dependent on the ingredient matrix and the virus-ingredient 
combination. The feed ingredients that have shown to support virus survivability and viability include 
conventional soybean meal, lysine, choline chloride, and vitamin D. ASFV demonstrated strong 
survivability characteristics.   
Among the knowledge gaps identified in these studies are the identification of vulnerable (risky) non-
animal origin feed ingredients for viral contamination, ingredient (matrix) characteristics that support or 
hinder virus survival, and identification of the critical point(s) in the transboundary feed production and 
distribution continuum where (fecal) contamination of non-animal origin ingredients could occur. There

distribution continuum where (fecal) contamination of non-animal origin ingredients could occur. There 
is a paucity of field data demonstrating if, how, and when non-animal origin feed ingredients may 
become contaminated with swine viruses.  Further, although some field epidemiological investigations 
have associated contaminated feed (PCR positive) with the source of virus introduction on affected 
farms, to date, experimental studies designed to prove causation of virus transmission via feed and feed 
ingredients have yielded inconsistent data. It is also unknown what characteristics of non-animal origin 
feed ingredients may contribute to virus survival, if present. Additionally, the development of diagnostic 
assays and sampling techniques, capable of testing large volumes of non-animal origin feed ingredients 
to determine whether the level of contamination is sufficient to transmit disease is required to better 
assess the frequency with which these materials are contaminated with virus, which viruses are present, 
and at what concentration. Subsequent assays to determine contamination of the final, processed feed 
product would be useful to determine the likelihood that contaminated non-animal origin feed 
ingredients would transmit virus to swine and to what degree feed should be prioritized as a biosecurity 
risk.

The objective of this literature review was to gather and analyze the evidence in published scientific 
literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce 
and transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The goal was to understand the

The objective of this literature review was to gather and analyze the evidence in published scientific 
literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce 
and transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The goal was to understand the 
current scientific knowledge and to identify information gaps to better inform decision makers, other 
stakeholders, and the scientific community. To achieve this, the basic steps of a systematic review 
methodology were followed [1], resulting in a qualitative summary report of findings.  
The results of the literature review demonstrate that a limited number of studies currently address 
swine viral pathogen transmission through non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. Of the studies 
available, several suffered from limitations that hinder generalizing the findings to real-world 
commercial swine scenarios. For example, studies were limited by small feed sample volumes (as small 
as 5 grams) which does not directly equate to the quantities (tonnage) in actual swine production and 
feed scenarios; small sample sizes (2 replicates) which reduced statistical strength and confidence of 
findings; low sensitivity in swine bioassays; experimental methods which do not mimic natural feeding 
behaviors of swine or large-scale commercial swine production; and environmental scenarios that 
cannot be easily extrapolated to other seasons or geographical regions. Bioassays, including those 
reviewed in this document, often suffer from low sensitivity due to low number of subject animals (n = 4 
in the studies reviewed); health status of subject animals often does not reflect the immune status 
variability observed in the field setting; and subject animals are typically exposed or inoculated once 
(single-hit concept) whereas multiple or on-going exposures occur in the field setting. Thus, results of 
the bioassay may not equate to real

 animals (n = 4 
in the studies reviewed); health status of subject animals often does not reflect the immune status 
variability observed in the field setting; and subject animals are typically exposed or inoculated once 
(single-hit concept) whereas multiple or on-going exposures occur in the field setting. Thus, results of 
the bioassay may not equate to real-life scenarios. Other studies, particularly those with retrospective 
questionnaire or survey components, were limited by inherent sources of internal bias such as selection 
and recall bias. Furthermore, robust replication of studies in independent laboratories and field settings 
to validate or corroborate findings has not occurred. Thus, conclusions drawn from these studies should 
be interpreted with caution until repeatability of the findings can be demonstrated, particularly under 
conditions that mimic the field setting.  
Despite the small number of published studies, several key themes have emerged, many of which 
warrant additional exploration and research:  
• A subset of the studies reviewed provided experimental evidence that swine viruses can survive 
in non-animal origin feed ingredients under various experimental conditions [15, 30, 45, 47, 48]. 
Virus survival times were variable (ranging from 7 days to > 180 days) and dependent on the 
simulated environmental conditions applied (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) and the 
virus-ingredient combination. Others concluded that duration of virus survival (and infectivity) is 
ingredient-dependent and certain feed ingredients provide a more favorable matrix than others 
for extended survival [15, 47, 48]. Additional research is needed to verify virus survival times 
(and infectivity) in complete feed and feed ingredients, with various virus-ingredient 
combinations under various environmental conditions, including actual field conditions.

 and certain feed ingredients provide a more favorable matrix than others 
for extended survival [15, 47, 48]. Additional research is needed to verify virus survival times 
(and infectivity) in complete feed and feed ingredients, with various virus-ingredient 
combinations under various environmental conditions, including actual field conditions.

• Several authors speculated that characteristics of the ingredient such as the physical supportive 
matrix and/or the chemical (bromatological) composition contributed to virus survival [15, 30, 
31, 48]. However, the specific characteristic(s) of the ingredient that contribute to viral 
persistence have not been identified or proven.  
• A subset of experimental studies provided evidence that feed contaminated with virus can 
transmit disease to naive piglets [9, 15, 45-48]. However, the experimental methods used in 
these studies such as spiking ingredients with predetermined virus load or inoculating piglets via 
methods other than natural feeding behaviors, do not reflect the field setting and results may 
not be generalizable to field conditions, particularly large-scale commercial swine facilities. 
Additional laboratory and field-based studies are needed to determine the extent of finding 
reproducibility and applicability to field settings. 
• A subset of studies have attempted to identify individual feed ingredients that may be more 
likely than others to support virus survivability [15, 47, 48]. Viability and infectivity of each virus 
were assessed through VI and/or swine bioassay. The presence of a viable form (meaning a 
positive VI and/or bioassay) of virus (at ≥ 30 days) was confirmed in the following non-animal 
origin ingredients that had been experimentally spiked with virus inoculate: organic and 
conventional SBM,

 infectivity of each virus 
were assessed through VI and/or swine bioassay. The presence of a viable form (meaning a 
positive VI and/or bioassay) of virus (at ≥ 30 days) was confirmed in the following non-animal 
origin ingredients that had been experimentally spiked with virus inoculate: organic and 
conventional SBM, DDGS, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choline chloride, and vitamin D [15, 47, 
48]. Extended survival was observed in virus-spiked conventional SBM [15]. Two experimental 
studies, using different experimental conditions, observed PEDV viability in three PEDV-spiked 
ingredients: conventional SBM, lysine, and choline chloride. [15, 47]. Virus viability (and 
infectivity) as determined in separate swine bioassays was observed with PEDV-contaminated 
choline chloride [15, 47] and Seneca virus A-contaminated choline chloride [48]. 
• A major knowledge gap exists in sources of potential contamination and where feed or feed 
ingredients may be contaminated.  These experimental studies conducted with inoculated non-
animal origin feed ingredients do not address the question of whether these ingredients are 
contaminated with swine viruses under field conditions. The critical point(s) of susceptibility to 
contamination along the feed production, processing, and distribution continuum, from 
harvesting the plant-derived feed ingredients in the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine 
premises, have not been identified.  
• Neither the contamination route of exotic swine pathogens into non-animal origin feed 
(ingredients) nor the virus entry route into the United States has been decisively proven. 
• Under the laboratory-simulated model

premises, have not been identified.  
• Neither the contamination route of exotic swine pathogens into non-animal origin feed 
(ingredients) nor the virus entry route into the United States has been decisively proven. 
• Under the laboratory-simulated model conditions, both LA and MCFA were concluded to be 
effective chemical mitigants against PEDV in individual feed ingredients stored under simulated 
shipping conditions, suggesting they might be useful for reducing viral load in feed ingredients 
[15, 47]. The real-world application of LA and MCFA for eliminating swine viruses or decreasing 
their level of infectivity under field conditions has yet to be determined. If field-contamination 
of non-animal origin ingredients is determined to be a concern for pathogen transmission, 
additional mitigation strategies should continue to be explored, including other chemical

• Some of the outbreak epidemiological investigations provided evidence that the transmission 
route(s) for swine viruses onto the index farm may differ from the transmission route(s) among 
housing units within the index farm and between secondary farms. Similarly, the entry route 
(e.g., for PEDV) into the United States may differ from the transmission route(s) among 
domestic swine farms. Thus, as with other infectious diseases, multi-modal transmission 
mechanisms are likely occurring. When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as a 
potential fomite for swine virus transmission, it’s important to understand how the primary

V) into the United States may differ from the transmission route(s) among 
domestic swine farms. Thus, as with other infectious diseases, multi-modal transmission 
mechanisms are likely occurring. When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as a 
potential fomite for swine virus transmission, it’s important to understand how the primary 
transmission pathways (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel, etc.) 
interface with one another, particularly how the production and distribution of feed interacts 
with other sources of virus contamination (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport 
vehicles, personnel, etc.) to contribute, if at all, to disease transmission.   
• Similarly, it’s important to understand the relative risks of various transmission pathways and 
where feed ingredients fit in among broadly accepted risk pathways such as movement of 
infected pigs and fecal contamination of fomites (e.g., transport vehicles). By understanding the 
magnitude of the risk of feed ingredients, one can better balance the costs of sourcing “safe” 
feed ingredients and the nutritional needs of pigs with the costs of applying various mitigation 
strategies to potentially contaminated feed (e.g., heat or chemical treatment or feed holding 
times).  
• Reliable and validated assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting infective virus (i.e., 
to determine the level of contamination is sufficient to transmit disease) in large quantities of 
(bulk) ingredients are not available.  
• As mentioned above, the critical point(s) of contamination along the feed production, 
processing, and distribution continuum, from harvesting the plant-derived feed ingredients in 
the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine premises, have not been identified. Because of this

• As mentioned above, the critical point(s) of contamination along the feed production, 
processing, and distribution continuum, from harvesting the plant-derived feed ingredients in 
the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine premises, have not been identified. Because of this 
some of the experimental studies reviewed were performed under the assumption that 
ingredients are contaminated in the post-processing stage of feed production. Very little 
information is available on how non-animal origin feed ingredients are produced and sourced 
outside the United States and current studies have produced little scientific evidence of how, or 
if, non-animal origin feed ingredients could become contaminated with swine viruses in regions 
outside the United States. Taking a systematic approach to the entire (transboundary) feed 
production system, similar to the hazard analysis and critical control points process used in food 
safety, may help to identify vulnerabilities in the production process, better inform the 
development and application of mitigation measures to reduce viral contamination risks, and 
help stakeholders allocate resources towards mitigation measures based on the likelihood of 
virus contamination.    
• Over the past several decades, the U.S. commercial swine industry has improved biosecurity 
measures on commercial premises to prevent transmission of economically significant viruses 
such as PCV2, PRRSV, and PEDV. Many commercial swine operations use the absence of PRRS on 
the farm as an indicator of thorough implementation and enforcement of biosecurity measures. 
In the studies reviewed, many favorably described their biosecurity measures and echoed 
sentiments expressed by Bowman et al. (2015) that the “effectiveness of the biosecurity

sentiments expressed by Bowman et al. (2015) that the “effectiveness of the biosecurity

measures in place was evidenced by the absence of PRRS cases”. However, the entry of PEDV 
(and new or emerging swine viruses) onto presumably biosecure commercial premises suggests 
that current biosecurity standards are insufficient to prevent virus incursion. Virus 
characteristics and the characteristics of the commercial swine industry (globalization of trade, 
intensification and vertical integration of production, and extensive movement of pigs and 
related production components) could contribute to biosecurity breaches. Robust biosecurity 
measures may be the only tool, in the absence of effective vaccines or treatments, to prevent 
the entry and spread of some diseases. Thus, biosecurity strategies, particularly the extensive 
movement of production inputs, need to be re-evaluated and adjusted to meet today’s swine 
industry paradigm. 
While investigators have addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of 
swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, the current body of scientific knowledge has yet to provide 
conclusive evidence for the source(s) of contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients with swine 
viruses and the epidemiology of virus transmission to swine under field conditions. If the primary 
concern of the swine industry and associated stakeholders lies in the importation of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced,

 of non-animal origin feed ingredients with swine 
viruses and the epidemiology of virus transmission to swine under field conditions. If the primary 
concern of the swine industry and associated stakeholders lies in the importation of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced, 
processed, and transported prior to importation into the United States are needed. However, the lack of 
feed and feed ingredient diagnostic assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting virus in large 
volumes of material limits our ability to determine if and at what point non-animal origin feed or feed 
ingredients may become contaminated with viruses and limits our ability to establish critical control 
points in feed production, distribution, and storage to mitigate risk(s). Until these data are available, it is 
difficult to evaluate the biosecurity risk posed by non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. Moving 
forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and virus mitigation steps in 
processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.

PEDV Feed, starter 
feed pellets 
Through epidemiological 
investigation of a swine 
operation in Ohio, 
contaminated feed (starter 
feed pellets) was identified 
as the likely source of PEDV 
introduction. The feed and 
feed source was RT-PCR-
positive for PEDV. A 
bioassay was performed 
with samples of 
cryopreserved feed. 
Authors determined 
the starter pellet to 
be the source of PEDV 
introduction. PEDV 
RNA was detected 
inside unopened bags 
of new pellets, at the 
source facility 
(supplier), and in 
individual ingredients 
at the source facility. 
For the bioassay, 
naive pigs fed PCR-
positive feed from the 
supplier remained 
negative for PEDV.  
The results of the 
bioassay were negative 
but experimental 
conditions may not 
reflect field conditions. 
The authors made several 
hefty assumptions 
regarding biosecurity at 
the affected farm and 
ruled out other possible 
transmission routes 
without providing the 
supporting data.

The author suggests 
that "new" viruses in 
swine are likely to 
emerge from already 
recognized (non-
pathogenic or 
ignored) swine 
viruses. The likelihood 
of PEDV survival in 
SDPP is extremely 
low, but not zero. A

solution. A

The discussion focused on 
SDPP; however, key 
points can be generalized 
to non-animal origin 
ingredients. Increasing 
herd sizes (and assuming 
fixed biosecurity 
practices) along with 
greater flux of inputs 
translates to a higher 
temporal frequency of 
adverse events. The 
features of modern swine 
production (global trade, 
intense production, 
extensive movements) 
have contributed to the 
emergence of these 
pathogenic strains and 
we should expect this 
trend to continue.

Research summarized

ASFV was not transmitted 
by contaminated sweet 
potatoes or bananas (1921 
study). It was reported that 
a study in East Africa

PEDV Feed, vehicles,

other fomites 
The article reviews the US 
PED outbreak in 2013. The 
author summarizes clinical 
signs, virus shedding, 
immune responses, 
epidemiology, origin of the 
outbreak and risk factors 
contributing to 
transmission such as 
herd/farm management, 
transportation and fomites. 
In this outbreak, PEDV 
was transmitted by 
livestock transport, 
movement of people, 
vehicles, and other 
contaminated 
fomites, and shared 
resources/equipment. 
The author suggests 
feed contaminated 
with infectious fecal 
material could 
transmit virus and 
that enhanced control 
procedures may 
provide protection 
against outbreaks of 
PED or other novel 
diseases in the future.

with PCR-positive pre-

fecal swabs collected 
from these groups 
were PEDV-negative, 
no histologic lesions 
were, and PEDV was 
not detected by IHC.  
The positive control 
group developed 
clinical signs at 3 DPI, 
and feces was PCR-
positive. No histology 
or IHC results were 
presented for positive 
controls. 
The extended storage of 
the feed samples might 
have impacted virus 
viability. Authors suggest 
that these contaminated 
feed samples might not 
have been representative 
of the overall 
concentration of PEDV in 
the entire batch of feed.

The authors used 
previously collected 
epidemiologic data to 
develop scenarios and 
identify possible routes of 
PEDV introduction into the 
United States, and initiated 
follow-up studies “to 
gather more evidence for 
the most plausible 
scenarios”.  
No PEDV was 
detected in imported 
organic soybeans, pet 
jerky treats, or feral 
swine samples. Source 
of epidemic was not 
identified. Authors 
identified totes used 
to transport bulk feed 
as providing the 
simplest explanation 
for the investigation 
findings.  
Unclear objective(s) and 
reporting. Appears to be 
an emphasis or 
assumption towards 
identifying Asia or China 
as the location of origin 
and towards imported 
organic soybeans as the 
point source feed 
ingredient.

1 Executive Summary 
The United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 
Veterinary Services (VS)  has conducted a literature review on the scientific evidence regarding whether 
non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of 
swine into or within the United States. The purpose of this literature review was to identify, evaluate, 
and summarize the current scientific knowledge published through March 2018 regarding this topic and 
to identify information gaps, thereby, making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers, 
other stakeholders, and the scientific community. The results may support future scientific research 
and/or risk quantifying models for evaluating the risk (or likelihood) of entry of exotic viral pathogens via 
specific feed ingredients

and summarize the current scientific knowledge published through March 2018 regarding this topic and 
to identify information gaps, thereby, making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers, 
other stakeholders, and the scientific community. The results may support future scientific research 
and/or risk quantifying models for evaluating the risk (or likelihood) of entry of exotic viral pathogens via 
specific feed ingredients from source countries and subsequent exposure to United States (U.S.) swine 
populations.  
The methodology of this literature review follows the basic framework of a qualitative systematic review 
and has four main components: 1) identifying and selecting research evidence, 2) data extraction and 
quality assessment, 3) data synthesis, and 4) report writing [1]. Twenty-six published articles were 
included in the literature review. The major findings and information gaps are highlighted below:  
• A subset of the studies reviewed provided experimental evidence that swine viruses can survive 
in non-animal origin feed ingredients under various experimental conditions. Virus survival 
times were variable (range: 7 days to > 180 days) and dependent on the simulated 
environmental conditions applied (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) and the virus-
ingredient combination. Additional research is needed to verify virus survival times (and 
infectivity) in complete feed and feed ingredients, with various virus-ingredient combinations 
under various environmental conditions, including actual field conditions. 
• Several experimental studies provided evidence that feed contaminated with virus can transmit 
disease to naive piglets. However, the experimental methods used in these studies such as 
spiking feed ingredients with a predetermined virus load or inoculating piglets via methods 
other than natural feeding behaviors do not necessarily reflect the field setting and results may 
not be generalizable to field conditions, particularly the large, commercial swine production 
setting.

 can transmit 
disease to naive piglets. However, the experimental methods used in these studies such as 
spiking feed ingredients with a predetermined virus load or inoculating piglets via methods 
other than natural feeding behaviors do not necessarily reflect the field setting and results may 
not be generalizable to field conditions, particularly the large, commercial swine production 
setting. Additional laboratory and field-based studies are needed to determine the extent of 
reproducibility and applicability of these experimental findings to field settings. 
• Several studies have investigated whether some individual feed ingredients are more likely than 
others to support virus survivability. Viable virus (meaning positive by virus isolation test and/or 
bioassay) was detected in the following non-animal origin ingredients that were experimentally 
spiked with virus: organic and conventional soybean meal, dried distillers grain with solubles 
(DDGS), lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choline chloride, and vitamin D. Two experimental studies, 
using different experimental conditions, observed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 
viability in three PEDV-spiked ingredients: conventional soybean meal, lysine, and choline 
chloride. Virus viability (and infectivity) as determined in separate swine bioassays was observed

with choline chloride and two swine viruses: PEDV and Seneca virus A. The implications of these 
findings for field settings are unclear.  
• A major knowledge gap exists with respect to potential source(s) of contamination and where 
feed or feed ingredients may be contaminated, particularly for non-animal origin ingredients 
sourced outside the United States. Current studies have produced little scientific evidence of 
how,

V and Seneca virus A. The implications of these 
findings for field settings are unclear.  
• A major knowledge gap exists with respect to potential source(s) of contamination and where 
feed or feed ingredients may be contaminated, particularly for non-animal origin ingredients 
sourced outside the United States. Current studies have produced little scientific evidence of 
how, or if, non-animal origin feed ingredients could become contaminated with swine viruses in 
regions outside the United States. The critical point(s) of susceptibility to contamination along 
the feed production, processing, and distribution continuum, from harvesting the plant-derived 
feed ingredients in the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine premises, have not been 
identified. Neither the contamination route of exotic swine pathogens into non-animal origin 
feed (ingredients) nor the virus entry route into the United States has been decisively proven. 
• Under laboratory-simulated model conditions, both the formaldehyde-based liquid 
antimicrobial SalCURB® and a medium chain fatty acid blend were concluded to be effective 
chemical mitigants against PEDV. The real-world application of these mitigants for eliminating 
swine viruses or decreasing their level of infectivity under field conditions has yet to be 
determined. Additional mitigation strategies should continue to be explored, including other 
chemical treatments, the application of heat or pressure (pelleting) to feed and of various 
holding times to feed or feed ingredients.   
• When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as potential fomites for swine virus 
transmission, a major knowledge gap exist with how the primary transmission pathways (e.g., 
exposure to infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel, etc.) interface with 
one another, particularly how the production and distribution of feed

 feed or feed ingredients.   
• When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as potential fomites for swine virus 
transmission, a major knowledge gap exist with how the primary transmission pathways (e.g., 
exposure to infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel, etc.) interface with 
one another, particularly how the production and distribution of feed interact with other 
potential sources of virus contamination (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport 
vehicles, personnel, etc.) to contribute, if at all, to disease transmission.   
• Reliable and validated assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting infective virus (i.e., 
to determine the level of contamination is sufficient to transmit disease) in large quantities of 
(bulk) ingredients are not available.  
• The entry of PEDV (and new or emerging swine viruses) onto presumably biosecure commercial 
premises suggests that current biosecurity standards may be insufficient to prevent virus 
incursion. Virus characteristics and the characteristics of the commercial swine industry 
(globalization of trade, intensification and vertical integration of production, and extensive 
movement of pigs and related production components) could contribute to biosecurity 
breaches. Robust biosecurity measures may be the only tool, in the absence of effective 
vaccines or treatments, to prevent the entry and spread of some diseases. Thus, biosecurity 
strategies, particularly the extensive movement of production inputs, need to be re-evaluated 
and adjusted to meet today’s swine industry paradigm. 
While investigators have addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of 
swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, the current body of scientific knowledge has yet to provide

While investigators have addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of 
swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, the current body of scientific knowledge has yet to provide 
conclusive evidence for the source(s) of contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients with swine 
viruses and the epidemiology of virus transmission to swine under field conditions. If the primary

concern of the swine industry and associated stakeholders lies in the importation of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced, 
processed, and transported prior to importation into the United States are needed. However, the lack of 
feed and feed ingredient diagnostic assays capable of detecting virus in large volumes of material limits 
our ability to determine if and at what point non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients may become 
contaminated with viruses and limits our ability to establish critical control points in feed production, 
distribution, and storage to mitigate risk(s). Until these data are available, it is difficult to evaluate the 
biosecurity risk posed by non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. Moving forward, studies designed 
to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and virus mitigation steps in processing and post-
processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.

3 Introduction 
Over the past three decades, the swine industry in the United States has experienced several significant 
disease outbreak events with highly pathogenic viral pathogens, including porcine reproductive and 
respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and, most recently, the swine 
enteric coronaviruses, including porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) and  porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 
(PEDV) [2-5]. These disease events have resulted in significant clinical consequences with increased 
morbidity and mortality, in some cases reaching 100%, as well as economic devastation to the swine 
industry with financial losses estimated in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars [4, 6]. Among 
other shared characteristics, all three causative agents had been previously known to cause mild or non-
pathogenic disease in swine prior to the re-emergence event. Additionally, novel agents, such as PEDV, 
may be present yet remain undetected for some time, contributing to (wide) spread transmission 
amongst the industry and hindering local containment. Thus, once identified, the unforeseen emergence 
of swine diseases with high morbidity and mortality and rapid, transboundary spread brings about 
fundamental questions (how, what, why, when, and

 PEDV, 
may be present yet remain undetected for some time, contributing to (wide) spread transmission 
amongst the industry and hindering local containment. Thus, once identified, the unforeseen emergence 
of swine diseases with high morbidity and mortality and rapid, transboundary spread brings about 
fundamental questions (how, what, why, when, and from where) as well as an immediate need to find 
solutions for both short- and long-term response activities and mitigation strategies to control the 
outbreak and prevent future events [5].   
During the 2013 - 2014 outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in North America, contaminated 
feed and feed ingredients were suspected as a potential introduction and/or transmission route for 
spread as early cases of PED in Canada were linked to a common feed source containing spray-dried 
porcine plasma (SDPP) [7]. Additionally, genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that United States 
(U.S.) strains were closely related to Chinese PEDV strains, particularly the 2012 strain from the Anhui 
Province in China [8], fueling concerns that imported (contaminated) commodities from China may have 
been the route of introduction into the United States. Growing anecdotal evidence and early 
investigative studies [9] have further implicated feed and feed ingredients as the possible transmission 
vehicle for PEDV although a definitive introductory cause remains unknown. Compounded by the recent 
outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in China and the European Union [10], there is rising concern that 
contaminated imported commodities, particularly non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial 
swine feed, could introduce and transmit viral pathogens of significant concern to the United States 
(U.S.) swine industry.

 recent 
outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in China and the European Union [10], there is rising concern that 
contaminated imported commodities, particularly non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial 
swine feed, could introduce and transmit viral pathogens of significant concern to the United States 
(U.S.) swine industry.  
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has conducted two analyses concerning the 
introduction of exotic swine diseases into the United States. The scope of each assessment included 
feed and feed ingredients. In 2014, APHIS completed the Pathways Assessment: Entry Assessment for 
Exotic Viral Pathogens of Swine. This assessment estimated the likelihood of entry of exotic swine 
viruses via several import pathways based on the quantity of the commodity imported, the likelihood 
that a hazard would be associated with the pathway, and the likelihood that a hazard would persist 
under current import mitigation procedures. Several pathways were estimated to pose a non-
negligible risk of introducing exotic viral pathogens of swine into the United States, including animal

feed ingredients derived from unprocessed plants or plant products; however, significant gaps in 
knowledge and available data prohibited a conclusive assessment. In 2015, APHIS completed the Swine 
Enteric Coronavirus Introduction to the United States: Root Cause Investigation Report. This report 
investigated several plausible import pathway scenarios including flexible intermediate bulk containers 
(FIBC or tote bags) used to transport feed ingredients from China as a possible pathway for the 
introduction of PEDV into the United States [11].

(FIBC or tote bags) used to transport feed ingredients from China as a possible pathway for the 
introduction of PEDV into the United States [11].   
 
Despite extensive investigative work in the field and the laboratory, the specific mode of introduction of 
exotic viral pathogens such as PEDV, into the United States and, subsequently, into domestic swine 
premises remains unknown. In order for feed or feed ingredients to be a route of disease introduction 
into the United States, it must become contaminated with the causative agent; avoid inactivation 
through (trans-ocean) travel, feed manufacturing, processing, and distribution processes; and be 
ingested at a dose sufficient to cause infection in a susceptible pig (see Figure below).  
 
Figure 1: Simple generic pathway for transmission of pathogens in feed 
The risk of disease transmission via contaminated feed and feed ingredients is non-zero as pathogens 
such as Salmonella are known to be transmitted via swine feed [12, 13]. However, questions regarding 
the true risk level that contaminated feed and feed ingredients pose in the introduction and subsequent 
transmission of PEDV and other exotic swine viruses remain unanswered, particularly in comparison to 
other recognized risk factors such as movement of infected pigs, transport vehicles, personnel, and 
waste feeding of unprocessed or improperly processed animal products. Thus, making sound decisions 
regarding risk mitigation measures in the face of an uncertain risk level is challenging. Additionally, the 
economic costs and downstream impacts of broadly banning certain feed ingredients or applying other 
mitigation measures to feed and feed ingredients without objective data may outweigh the costs of 
direct production losses from a disease event [5].

The emergence of PEDV in North America and growing concerns of introduction of ASF from China, the 
European Union, or other affected regions has put a spotlight on the possible role of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients in the introduction and transmission of viral swine pathogens. The characteristics

movement of pigs and related production components (e.g., transport vehicles, feed, personnel) – and 
the trend of emerging swine pathogens in new geographic ranges (e.g., ASF) and/or with increased 
pathogenicity (e.g., PEDV) suggests that the critical production inputs along with existing biosecurity and 
mitigating measures that have historically delivered an acceptable level of protection may need to be re-
evaluated.

swine industry and other associated stakeholders. The goal of the literature review is to understand the 
current scientific knowledge and to identify information gaps. The results may support future scientific 
research and/or risk quantifying models for evaluating the risk (or likelihood) of entry of exotic viral 
pathogens via specific feed ingredients from source countries and subsequent exposure to U.S. swine 
populations.

4 Methods of the Literature Review 
4.1 Overview 
The methodology of this literature review follows the basic framework of a qualitative systematic review 
[1]. The literature review aims to identify, evaluate, and summarize the findings of relevant research 
studies, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers, other stakeholders, 
and the scientific community. When appropriate, combining the results of several studies gives a more 
reliable and precise estimate of the available knowledge, intervention, or control measure’s 
effectiveness than one study alone. This literature review aims to answer the following research 
question:  
What evidence is available in published scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin 
ingredients of commercial swine feed could transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the 
United States?

question:  
What evidence is available in published scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin 
ingredients of commercial swine feed could transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the 
United States?  
The methodology of the literature review has four main components: 1) identifying and selecting 
research evidence, 2) data extraction and quality assessment, 3) data synthesis, and 4) report writing 
[1]. 
4.2 Identification of studies and study selection 
A systematic search of the National Library of Medicine/PubMed, National Agricultural Library/PubAg, 
National Agricultural Library/Navigator (including major databases: AGRICOLA, AGRIS, BIOSIS, CABI, 
EBSCO Environment Complete, GEOBASE, GeoRef, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Zoological 
Record) and Google Scholar was conducted to identify published scientific literature pertaining to 
evidence regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could transmit viral 
pathogens of swine into or within the United States. Studies published any time through March 2018 
were identified.  
The study selection process was performed in two stages. In the first stage, an initial screening of search 
results was performed based on title and abstract. In the second stage, the full text of the preliminary 
list of studies was evaluated. Additional articles were obtained through manual review of reference 
citations in the relevant literature. Figure 2 provides an overview of the study selection process. Studies 
were excluded that did not meet the purpose statement of the literature review. Reasons for exclusion 
include:  
 Focus on non-viral pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, toxopl

 was evaluated. Additional articles were obtained through manual review of reference 
citations in the relevant literature. Figure 2 provides an overview of the study selection process. Studies 
were excluded that did not meet the purpose statement of the literature review. Reasons for exclusion 
include:  
 Focus on non-viral pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, toxoplasmosis, etc.) 
 Focus on disease transmission routes other than feed and feed ingredients (e.g., airborne) 
 Animal origin feed ingredients (e.g., swill, SDPP, etc.) 
 Focus on mitigations/treatment/disinfection of equipment or sanitizing feed 
 No English translation available 
 Full text not available (e.g., abstract or conference proceeding only)

The two-stage study selection resulted in retention of 26 included studies. The most common reasons 
for exclusion (in descending order) included: focus on disease transmission routes other than feed or 
feed ingredients; focus on mitigations/treatment/disinfection of equipment or sanitizing feed; subject 
matter outside the scope of the review; and focus on animal origin feed ingredients. 
4.3 Data extraction and quality assessment 
The data extraction component is the process by which research reviewers obtain the necessary 
information about study characteristics, methods, and findings from the included studies. The quality 
assessment component aims to identify internal and external validity of the selected studies. 
Standardized data extraction provides consistency in a literature review, thereby reducing potential bias 
and improving validity and reliability.  
A fillable, pdf data extraction form was created for the purpose of this literature review. Twenty-six 
published articles were included in the data extraction and quality assessment process. Six reviewers 
worked in pairs to perform the data extraction and quality assessment. Each article was reviewed for 
general information, study characteristics, and outcome results. For the quality assessment portion, the 
reviewers reported on potential sources of bias, shortfalls in the statistical and analyses methodology, 
the quality of reporting, and the generalizability of the study to the commercial swine industry in the 
United States. An example of the form is provided in Appendix I.

4.4 Data synthesis and report writing 
A qualitative, narrative approach was used for the data synthesis and report writing. The information 
extracted in the data extraction process was summarized into data synthesis tables. These tables are 
provided in Appendix II. From the data synthesis tables, relevant information from the individual studies 
was collated and summarized in the Literature Review Results section below.

5 Animal-origin Feed Ingredients 
Although outside of the scope of this literature review, the exploration of animal-origin feed ingredients 
as possible vehicles for pathogen transmission, in particular swine-origin ingredients such as SDPP, has 
been on-going. Recent studies have associated SDPP with the transmission of PEDV. Many of the studies 
reviewed in this literature review included swine-origin feed ingredients as part of the experimental 
data and/or the overall study discussion. Some studies more broadly or generically used the term “feed” 
without distinguishing whether animal origin ingredients were excluded. Thus, several recent studies on 
the transmission of PEDV via feed are summarized below to provide context for the discussion of the 
epidemiological role, if any, of contaminated animal-origin feed and feed ingredients in pathogen 
transmission.

 provide context for the discussion of the 
epidemiological role, if any, of contaminated animal-origin feed and feed ingredients in pathogen 
transmission. 
5.1 Spray-dried porcine plasma 
Several experimental studies and epidemiological investigations have been conducted on the role of 
PEDV-contaminated SDPP in the transmission of PED with inconsistent conclusions [7, 14-20]. In 
particular, the first outbreak of PED in Canada in January 2014 focused on imported SDPP from the 
United States as the possible transmission vehicle. Using complete feed and SDPP samples associated 
with the positive case herds in Canada, Pasick et al. (2014) conducted a swine bioassay with PEDV 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive SDPP and feed mixed with PEDV PCR-positive SDPP. The results   
provided evidence that the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP [cycle threshold (Ct)1 value range 36.35 – 36.69] 
was infectious as clinical signs of diarrhea were observed and significant amounts of PEDV were shed in 
the feces of piglets inoculated with the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP. In contrast, the bioassay results from 
the piglets challenged with the feed matrix2 containing PEDV PCR-positive SDPP (Ct value range 37.22 – 
42.88) were inconclusive and, thus, infectivity could not be definitely demonstrated [7]. In a 
retrospective case-control study, Perri et al. (2018) investigated the role of feed and other factors in the 
Canadian outbreak. The authors found that the odds of PED occurrence in herds receiving feed from a 
specific feed company that provided potentially contaminated feed was 38.1 times greater than

 thus, infectivity could not be definitely demonstrated [7]. In a 
retrospective case-control study, Perri et al. (2018) investigated the role of feed and other factors in the 
Canadian outbreak. The authors found that the odds of PED occurrence in herds receiving feed from a 
specific feed company that provided potentially contaminated feed was 38.1 times greater than for 
herds that did not receive that feed. The number of live pig movements, semen deliveries, and the 
frequency of dead stock pickups were not identified as risk factors for PED [20]. Similarly, Aubry et al. 
(2017) determined the attack rate for farms with confirmed consumption of feed containing SDPP was 
28.1% while the attack rate of unexposed farms was estimated at 0.17%. The strength of association 
increased with increasing concentration of SDPP in feed [18]. In a separate study, spatiotemporal 
findings included that cases were more likely to neighbor cases than controls, and the pattern of spread

Collectively, these studies of the epidemiological investigation of the Canadian PED outbreak concluded 
that a single lot of SDPP imported from the United States was the vehicle of infection and found that the 
proportion of cases exposed to creep and nursery feeds contaminated with this product was 
significantly higher than expected.  The investigation of the initial cases found no association with other 
exposures, such as feed providers, transporters, a rendering company or livestock haulers [7, 17, 18]. 
Despite previous evidence that the spray-drying process is effective at inactivating viruses, including 
PEDV [16, 21-23], the investigations into the Canadian PED cases suggest that a breach of good 
manufacturing practices and/or biosecurity practices led to contamination of the SDPP during 
processing, or post-processing contamination occurred during packaging, storage, and transportation of 
the SDPP and subsequent mixing into the complete swine feed [18]. 
However, independent studies on the same single lot of SDPP (provided directly from the plasma 
manufacturer not affected farms) by the Food and Drug Administration and the North American Spray 
Dried Blood and Plasma Producers Association determined the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP was not 
infectious; pigs remained negative as determined by PCR and serology testing. To account for low

 lot of SDPP (provided directly from the plasma 
manufacturer not affected farms) by the Food and Drug Administration and the North American Spray 
Dried Blood and Plasma Producers Association determined the PEDV PCR-positive SDPP was not 
infectious; pigs remained negative as determined by PCR and serology testing. To account for low 
sensitivity of the bioassay and to mimic commercial feeding practices, two additional bioassay studies 
were performed with longer feeding times (14 and 28 days, respectively); both determined that pigs fed 
a diet with 5% SDPP that was PCR-positive for PEDV (Ct values of 30.1 and 30.0, respectively) did not 
contain infectious PEDV and did not transmit PEDV to pigs [16]. Similarly, Opriessnig et al. (2014) found 
that a commercial feed containing 5% commercial SDPP confirmed positive for PEDV ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) (SDPP diet contained 3.3±0.3 log10 PEDV RNA copies/g) was not infective and not capable of 
transmitting PEDV to pigs [14]. Dee et al. (2015) were also not able to reproduce or support the Pasick et 
al. (2014) findings despite repeat bioassays with high viral load (Ct value of 16.34) [7, 15]. Given the 
varying results, the role, if any, of SDPP and other swine origin feed ingredients in the general 
epidemiology of PEDV requires further investigation, particularly in identifying the critical points in the 
production and distribution processes where contamination may occur and the likely sources for the 
viral contamination.

6 Literature Review Results 
The core studies included in this literature review have been collated into three categories: background 
information on risk factors for transmission and fomite survivability, epidemiology and outbreak 
investigations, and experimental studies with swine bioassays. Studies were grouped into the best-fit 
category. Information extracted from the core studies may overlap into one or more categories and, 
thus, may be discussed in more than one section. Additionally, the study summaries provided in this 
section are not meant to be detailed and fully comprehensive but rather are focused on the information 
pertinent to this literature review, namely, non-animal origin feed ingredients. Studies conducted on 
feed and feed ingredients containing animal-origin ingredients, such as SDPP, are summarized in Section 
5. For additional study details, please see Appendix II or consult the full-text paper (see References).   
6.1 Risk factors for transmission and fomite survivability 
Numerous investigators have reviewed the epidemiology and impact of swine viral pathogens and 
analyzed industry expert opinion and outbreak information to identify risk factors for transmission of 
swine pathogens. Additionally, several studies have looked at the survivability of viruses on various 
fomites related to swine production and husbandry, including feed and feed ingredients. Methods used 
by these investigators include expert elicitation, questionnaire-based post-hoc outbreak investigations, 
and experimental studies of the survival of viruses in contact with fomites

swine pathogens. Additionally, several studies have looked at the survivability of viruses on various 
fomites related to swine production and husbandry, including feed and feed ingredients. Methods used 
by these investigators include expert elicitation, questionnaire-based post-hoc outbreak investigations, 
and experimental studies of the survival of viruses in contact with fomites. Here, we summarize such 
investigations and their findings, focusing on non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. The studies 
are grouped into two categories: risk factors for virus transmission and virus survival in contact with 
fomites. The virus scope of these studies includes African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine high fever 
disease, (highly pathogenic) porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), pseudorabies 
virus (PRV), Aujeszky’s disease virus, and blue eye disease virus. 
6.1.1 Risk factors for virus transmission 
Three studies examined the epidemiology of specific swine pathogen(s) or outbreak events in various 
regions of the world [24-26]. The pathogens covered include porcine high fever disease virus in Vietnam 
and ASFV in Nigeria and Eastern Europe. One study used expert elicitation methods to identify risk 
factors for transmission of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (HP-PRRS) 
into and within Australia [27].  
• A study by Le et al. (2012) examined risk factors that may have contributed to the spread of 
porcine high fever disease (PHFD) from China to Vietnam in 2008. PHFD is considered a PRRS-
related syndrome. A survey was administered to individual households in a southern province of 
Vietnam which included questions regarding observed clinical signs

• A study by Le et al. (2012) examined risk factors that may have contributed to the spread of 
porcine high fever disease (PHFD) from China to Vietnam in 2008. PHFD is considered a PRRS-
related syndrome. A survey was administered to individual households in a southern province of 
Vietnam which included questions regarding observed clinical signs in the owner’s swine herd, 
suggestive of PHFD, as well as various risk factors that could contribute to the spread of this 
virus. Probability incidence of PHFD was estimated based on description of clinical signs but 
presence of the virus was not confirmed with diagnostics. Investigators found that, among other 
things, the presence of ducks and the feeding of water green crops, together, were positively 
 
 
16 
 
 
 
associated with clinical signs consistent with PHFD in swine. Water green crops are fed directly 
to pigs after harvest, without processing. Authors hypothesize that ducks potentially amplify the 
virus, similar to data shown for PRRSV, and contaminate the water green crops fed to pigs. It is 
also believed that PHFD virus can persist in water further contaminating the greens before 
harvest. The findings of this study suggest that unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients 
could be contaminated with virus by other animals and transmitted to swine [25].  
 
• The study by Fasina et al. (2012) sought to identify risk factors associated with ASF outbreaks in 
Nigerian swine herds. Investigators conducted a matched case control investigation of farms 
that experienced ASF outbreaks between 2006 and 2009. Case farms met OIE (World 
Organization for Animal Health) guidelines for confirmation of ASF including clinical signs, 
pathological signs, and laboratory diagnostic confirmation

. (2012) sought to identify risk factors associated with ASF outbreaks in 
Nigerian swine herds. Investigators conducted a matched case control investigation of farms 
that experienced ASF outbreaks between 2006 and 2009. Case farms met OIE (World 
Organization for Animal Health) guidelines for confirmation of ASF including clinical signs, 
pathological signs, and laboratory diagnostic confirmation of ASF. Control farms were selected 
based on farm characteristics, similarity in operations and biosecurity measures, and absence of 
ASFV infection. An epidemiological questionnaire was administered to all participating farm 
owners and a number of factors associated with increased risk of ASF were identified. These 
included but were not limited to purchase of untested pigs from neighboring farms, presence of 
an abattoir in the community, wild bird access to pig pens, sharing of equipment between farms, 
and unprotected feed sources (rodent access). The use of commercial feed on farm, instead of 
swill feeding, was negatively associated (protective) with ASF risk. The final logistical regression 
model showed that protecting food and water sources, separation of sick and healthy pigs, and 
washing/disinfecting equipment were negatively associated (protective) with ASF infection. 
These findings indicate that preventing rodent access to feed sources and the use of commercial 
feeds, as opposed to swill feeding, were potentially protective measures in the farms studied. 
The investigators of this study conducted extensive statistical analysis on a wide range of ASF 
risk factors found on small and large swine farms. This study was conducted in a developing 
country; thus, direct application of findings to large scale, industrial swine farms in the United 
States may be limited [24].

States may be limited [24].  
 
• The review by Guinat et al. (2016) summarizes findings of ASFV transmission studies performed 
in Eastern European and Baltic countries. In respect to feed-to-pig transmission pathways, the 
authors referenced a European Commission (2014) epidemiological report in Latvia and 
Lithuania suggesting that fresh grass and seeds may have been contaminated by wild boar feces 
containing ASFV and transmitted the virus to domestic backyard pigs. A similar study focused on 
ASF in Latvia also suggested that feeding potentially contaminated (via wild boar) fresh grass or 
crops was a risk factor for ASF disease in backyard holdings; however, swill feeding could not be 
excluded as a source [28]. A study conducted in Kenya in 1921 demonstrated that ASFV could be 
transmitted to pigs when they consumed infected feces and urine but failed to transmit when 
contaminated sweet potatoes or bananas were consumed [29]. Several references were 
provided for documented transmission of ASFV to domestic pigs through feeding of swine-origin

feed ingredients such as preserved or uncooked meat products; some primary references from 
the review were not accessible to the reviewers, making it difficult to gauge the robustness of 
the referenced studies. However, the studies referenced demonstrated that there is very little 
field data exploring the relationship of ASFV transmission and non-animal origin feed ingredients 
[26].

[26].  
 
• Brookes et al. (2015) elicited industry expert opinions to identify entry and exposure routes with 
the highest probability of occurrence for introduction of HP-PRRS from south-east Asia to 
Australia. Pig industry experts attending the Australian Pig Veterinarians' Annual Conference in 
Melbourne, Australia in June 2013 were given a questionnaire and asked to indicate the 
probability of occurrence of 28 entry routes and 36 exposure routes within fixed probability 
ranges over one year. Agreement between participants was assessed using a chi-squared 
statistical test by comparing the frequency distribution of probability ranges for each route with 
a random distribution of probability ranges. There was statistically significant agreement on 29 
exposure routes; the routes with the highest estimated probability of occurrence all involved 
disposal of waste to feral or backyard pigs. The highest probability exposure route for 
commercial pigs was thought to be contact with a human acting as a fomite or access to animal 
feed/additives from south-east Asia. (Note: the definition of "animal feed/additives" was not 
provided and it is unclear if this term refers to non-animal origin feed, individual ingredients, or 
complete feed.) There was significant agreement on 16 entry routes; however, there were fewer 
consistent agreements or patterns of responses regarding a high proportion of entry routes in 
comparison to the exposure routes. This may be due to the fact that participant knowledge was 
of the pig industry and associated biosecurity practices, not border security or trade policy. The

consistent agreements or patterns of responses regarding a high proportion of entry routes in 
comparison to the exposure routes. This may be due to the fact that participant knowledge was 
of the pig industry and associated biosecurity practices, not border security or trade policy. The 
entry routes with the highest probability of occurrence and statistically significant agreement 
among participants included entry of HP-PRRS by humans or animal feed acting as fomites (and 
traveling or being shipped by air) and raw pork entering through the postal service or by a 
private individual. There was not agreement on the probability of entry of these fomites 
traveling or being shipped by sea. [27].  
6.1.2 Virus survival in contact with fomites 
Three studies examined virus survivability on various swine-related fomites, including feed and feed 
ingredients [30-32]. The viruses covered by these studies were PRV, PRRSV, Aujeszky’s disease virus, and 
blue eye disease virus.  
• Schoenbaum et al. (1991) investigated the survival duration of PRV in contact with various solid 
and liquid fomites commonly found in hog-raising environments. Feed or feed ingredients 
included in the study were green grass, whole corn, pelleted feed, and alfalfa. The authors did 
not report whether the feed included any animal-origin ingredients. The authors mixed stock 
PRV with various diluents, namely saline, swine saliva, or swine nasal washings, and inoculated 
fomites with those mixtures. After incubating the inoculated fomites at 25 °C for up to 14 days,

 feed included any animal-origin ingredients. The authors mixed stock 
PRV with various diluents, namely saline, swine saliva, or swine nasal washings, and inoculated 
fomites with those mixtures. After incubating the inoculated fomites at 25 °C for up to 14 days, 
 
 
18 
 
 
 
the authors tested for virus activity through use of a cell-culture-based assay. They found that, 
in general, the quantity of infectious virus decreased over time. Of the combinations of PRV and 
diluent with feed or non-animal origin feed ingredients, the combination of PRV/saline/whole 
corn remained infectious the longest at 7 days with an estimated half-life of 36.3 hours. The 
durations of infectiousness of the other combinations of PRV/diluent/feed or non-animal origin 
feed ingredients were shorter, ranging from 1 to 4 days with an estimated half-life of 1.0 hour to 
5.1 hours. The conditions of this study do not reliably reproduce field conditions. The fomites 
were inoculated with stock virus at doses that might not reflect contamination levels under field 
conditions. The authors used liquid diluents in all experiments and deliberately avoided field 
conditions (drying and ultraviolet light exposure) deleterious to virus activity. Similarly, the 
authors acknowledged that virus survival time is impacted by temperature, and speculated that 
virus survival times would be longer at lower temperatures and shorter at higher temperatures 
[30].  
 
• Pirtle and Beran (1996) investigated the survival time of PRRSV in contact with various liquid and 
solid fomites. Feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients included in the study were ground 
corn,
Text Len: 1653
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, and speculated that 
virus survival times would be longer at lower temperatures and shorter at higher temperatures 
[30].  
 
• Pirtle and Beran (1996) investigated the survival time of PRRSV in contact with various liquid and 
solid fomites. Feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients included in the study were ground 
corn, pelleted swine starter feed mix, and alfalfa. The authors did not report whether the feed 
included any animal-origin ingredients. The authors mixed stock PRRSV with saline, and 
inoculated fomites with those mixtures. After incubating the inoculated fomites at 25 to 27 °C 
for up to 11 days, the authors tested for virus activity through use of a cell culture based assay. 
In the PRRSV-spiked alfalfa sample, the authors detected PRRSV only on day 0. They did not 
detect any virus in the PRRSV-spiked starter feed mix and ground corn samples. The authors 
speculated that the pH (<7) of the samples tested and/or unknown substances present in the 
samples could have contributed to virus inactivation. The conditions of this study do not reliably 
reproduce field conditions. The addition of saline to each of the samples increased the moisture 
content of the samples and might have impacted the virus survival kinetics. In addition, the feed 
and feed ingredient samples were inoculated with stock virus at doses that might not reflect 
contamination levels under field conditions [31]. 
 
• Martínez-Gamba et al. (2001) examined the persistence of bacterial and viral pathogens in feces

• Martínez-Gamba et al. (2001) examined the persistence of bacterial and viral pathogens in feces 
fermented for use in animal feed (silage). Feces from 30 pigs was collected, inoculated with 
Aujeszky’s disease virus and blue eye disease virus, and mixed with molasses and sorghum for 
fermentation. Flasks of ensilage were incubated at room temperature for 0, 7, 14, 28, and 56 
days. Presence of virus was detected by cytopathic effects on cellular monolayers and indirect 
immunofluorescence. Samples were positive for virus on day 0 but not at any subsequent time 
point. The findings indicate that fermentation is sufficient for the inactivation of the viruses 
tested and could be an acceptable means for eliminating harmful pathogens from feces used for 
animal feed. These results may not be applicable to viruses of other families [32].

6.1.3 Summary of findings 
In summary, most of the reports and studies summarized above were not specifically designed to focus 
on non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients as a potential vehicle for virus transmission; however, 
feed and feed ingredients were included in the study design or discussion. In some cases, the author did 
not clearly state or define whether the feed includes animal-origin ingredients. Similarly, some findings 
in this group of studies may not be generalizable to other virus families or the commercial swine 
industry in the United States. Given these limitations, several key points are highlighted below.

in this group of studies may not be generalizable to other virus families or the commercial swine 
industry in the United States. Given these limitations, several key points are highlighted below.  
Le et al. (2012) identified owning ducks and using water green crop as pig feed (together) as being 
associated with an increased risk of PHFD, speculating that unprocessed non-animal origin feed 
ingredients could be contaminated with virus by other animals and transmitted to swine [25]. Fasina et 
al. (2012) identified food and water control to be significantly associated with decreased risk of ASF 
infection in Nigeria, noting that feed and water biosecurity practices can prevent virus contamination by 
rodents and wild birds [24]. Consistent with these findings, expert opinion conducted in Australia found 
industry representatives believed commercial pigs were most likely to be exposed to HP-PRRS through 
access to contaminated animal feed and feed additives imported from southeast Asia [27]. These studies 
suggest that protecting unprocessed non-animal origin feed ingredients from contact with animals may 
decrease the likelihood of pathogen contamination. This may be particularly important for ingredients 
that are not processed before being fed to animals.   
Several investigators have examined the persistence of viral activity in the presence of various fomites, 
including non-animal origin feed ingredients. In experiments in which they spiked fomites with stock 
virus, they found, in general, that viral activity did not persist for long periods of time under the 
experimental conditions used. Schoenbaum et al. (1991) found that the combination of 
PRV/saline/whole corn remained infectious the longest at 7 days with an estimated half-life of 36.3

alfalfa sample [31]. Interestingly, Martínez-Gamba et al. (2001) found that fermentation is sufficient for 
the inactivation of Aujeszky’s disease virus and blue eye disease virus [32]. Collectively, these studies 
suggest that, under certain conditions, swine viruses can survive in non-animal origin feed ingredients. 
Among the knowledge gaps identified in these studies are the need for a comprehensive evaluation of 
transmission pathways involving non-animal origin feed ingredients and swine viruses. The scientific 
literature regarding the survival times for various non-animal origin feed ingredient/pathogen 
combinations as well as determination of infectivity is incomplete and warrants further studies along 
with documented replication of studies. Furthermore, the likelihood of non-animal origin feed 
ingredients incurring contamination and documented scenarios in which cross-contamination occurs 
under field conditions is unknown.

6.2 Epidemiology and outbreak investigations – PEDV and PDCoV 
In 2013, swine enteric coronaviruses, such as PEDV and PDCoV, emerged as pathogens of significance 
for the swine industry in the United States and several other countries. Efforts were made to describe 
the epidemiology of the outbreaks which included a focus on the source of virus introduction and 
transmission. Among other things, feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients were suspected as one 
possible route of virus introduction and spread. The following section summarizes reports pertaining 
primarily to PEDV and PDCoV outbreak investigations, findings related to feed and feed ingredients, and 
experimental studies that sought to determine the survivability of swine viruses in feed and feed 
ingredients.  
Studies reviewed in this section have been separated into two major categories: 1) epidemiological 
reports, reviews and surveys and 2) feed and feed ingredient studies. These studies are primarily 
focused on PEDV and PDCoV; however, other swine pathogens are included such as transmissible 
gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), PRRSV, and PCV2. The epidemiological reports collated information from 
literature and descriptive reviews, disease outbreak analyses, as well as information from retrospective 
surveys [5, 11, 33-38].  
Studies focused on virus-contaminated feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients evaluated the ability 
of these materials to serve as fomites for virus introduction and spread. The studies are grouped into 
descriptive and experimental reports. The descriptive studies obtained samples from feed, feed facilities 
and feed transport vehicles linked to disease outbreaks and analyzed them for presence of viral RNA [39, 
40]. Experimental studies included in this

 non-animal origin feed ingredients evaluated the ability 
of these materials to serve as fomites for virus introduction and spread. The studies are grouped into 
descriptive and experimental reports. The descriptive studies obtained samples from feed, feed facilities 
and feed transport vehicles linked to disease outbreaks and analyzed them for presence of viral RNA [39, 
40]. Experimental studies included in this section investigated survivability of swine viruses on feed 
fomites by adding virus to the feed or non-animal origin feed ingredient and examining virus titers over 
time [41, 42].  
6.2.1 Epidemiological reports, reviews and surveys 
Eight epidemiological reports examining the global outbreaks of PED and PDCoV have been reviewed. 
The geographic scope of these reports include Europe, Asia, and North America [5, 11, 33-38]. The 
authors sought to describe the outbreaks and describe associations between risk factors for 
transmission and disease status.  
• In 2014 and 2016, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published two reports pertaining 
to PED and PDCoV [33, 34]. In 2014, EFSA published a scientific opinion on PEDV and PDCoV 
based on a review of the scientific literature published in the preceding 10 years [34]. In regards 
to the global epidemiologic picture of PEDV and PDCoV, the authors found that only limited 
active monitoring is conducted for PED in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Few outbreaks of PED 
have been reported in Europe (Germany and Italy 2014); in Asia, multiple outbreaks have been 
reported in several countries. In the Americas, the first outbreak of PED in the United States was 
reported in May 2013 with rapid spread within the country and reports in North, Central and

 the Americas. Few outbreaks of PED 
have been reported in Europe (Germany and Italy 2014); in Asia, multiple outbreaks have been 
reported in several countries. In the Americas, the first outbreak of PED in the United States was 
reported in May 2013 with rapid spread within the country and reports in North, Central and 
 
 
21 
 
 
 
South America. The authors found no clear evidence that PDCoV is causing significant impacts 
on animal health [34].  
 
When examining the possible geographic differences in PEDV strains and the potential for 
immunologic cross-protection, the authors found a high level of sequence identity between 
PEDV in Germany and Italy and the PEDV in the Americas. Findings of retrospective studies 
suggest that at least two PEDV strains were introduced into the United States at similar times. 
Differences in the nucleotide sequence of PEDV have been identified but their effects on 
virulence, if any, are unknown. Serological cross-reactivity between PEDV in Europe and the 
Americas is reported; no data regarding cross-protection are available. For reasons not well 
understood, outbreaks of PEDV in Asia and the United States seem to be more severe than 
those in Europe. However, it’s difficult to compare impacts in different regions because of 
differences in age group of affected pigs, production systems, biosecurity, farm management, 
herd size, and immune status and sanitary status of the herd population [34]. 
 
In a literature review covering the preceding 10 years (2004 – June 2014), EFSA concluded that 
the scientific literature supports the following statements [34]:

In a literature review covering the preceding 10 years (2004 – June 2014), EFSA concluded that 
the scientific literature supports the following statements [34]: 
 Infected live animals and feces are reported to transmit PEDV.  
 PEDV can survive in slurry but the epidemiologic role of this matrix is unknown.  
 High levels of infectious PEDV are shed in feces, contributing to contamination of various 
fomites, including vehicles, humans, and feed. 
 The transmission of PEDV via feed has been shown but more data are required to assess its 
epidemiologic importance.  
 PEDV RNA has been detected at low levels in serum but the role of this epidemiologic matrix 
is unknown.  
 Fecal cross-contamination of blood during collection at the slaughterhouse cannot be 
excluded.  
 Manufacturing techniques for SDPP can inactivate PEDV; however, different spray-drying 
techniques exist and variations in SDPP manufacturing procedures or breach in quality 
control (e.g., inadequate time and temperature holding times) may result in incomplete 
inactivation of PEDV. For example, infectious SDPP was detected in one study, but the origin 
of the PEDV in the SDPP is unknown (post-processing cross-contamination versus 
inadequate SDPP processing). 
 Infectious PEDV has been detected in air under experimental conditions and virus may be 
transmitted via air over short distances.

epidemiologic matrix is unknown.  
 There is no data on the presence of PEDV in embryos, pork meat, or other swine-derived 
feed components such as red blood cells (RBC), hydrolyzed proteins, fat, gelatin and 
collagen.  
In 2016, EFSA published a scientific report of PEDV epidemiology and impact as reported in 
scientific literature in 2014 and 2015, together with an analysis of PED cases in the European 
Union [33]. The goals of the report were to provide guidance on PEDV data to be collected by

• Although PEDV was first identified in Japan in the 1990s, Japan experienced renewed outbreaks 
of the disease in 2013. Scientists determined that the strain of PEDV in Japan was highly similar 
to the viral strain affecting the United States. In a retrospective questionnaire-based case-
control study, Sasaki et al. (2016) focused on risk factors associated with these new outbreaks of 
PEDV in Japan. The investigators tested the hypothesis that epidemiologic factors associated 
with a high risk of PEDV infection at swine farms located within 5 km of at least one other 
infected farm (locally exposed farms) differ from factors associated with high risk of infection at 
farms more distant from other infected farms (non-locally exposed farms). Using logistic 
regression analyses, they found that on locally exposed farms, PED was associated with a larger 
total number of swine, shorter distance to the nearest PEDV-positive farm, and a disinfectant 
contact time of less than 20 min. On non-locally exposed farms, PED was associated with 
increased feed truck visits to the farm, no visit by a veterinarian, and a disinfectant contact time 
of less than 20 min. Feed or non-animal origin feed ingredients were not explicitly included in 
the scope of this study. Feed-related items included on the questionnaire included feed truck 
visits and artificial milk. The authors found neither to be significantly associated with PED on 
either type of farm [36

• In the descriptive report by Davies (2015), the first half of the article discusses the similarities of 
3 major disease epidemics in the swine industry caused by PRRSV, PCV2, and PEDV. All three 
share the following features: highly host specific, rapid rates of mutation, and appear to be 
associated with swine as non-pathogenic (or associated with mild disease) for years before

becoming highly pathogenic. The author suggests that the proximate source of the highly 
pathogenic variants of the 3 viruses was the extant swine virome. The emergence of these 3 
highly pathogenic viruses over 25 years may be considered extremely rare events but the author 
argues that intensive single species food production systems along with globalization, 
intensification, and extensive movements of pigs have contributed to the geographic expansion 
of these viral agents and points to the likelihood that future "new" viruses in swine are likely to 
emerge from already recognized (non-pathogenic or ignored) swine viruses.  
 
The second half of the article discusses the risk of feeding animal products (SDPP) to swine and 
whether or not the true risk warrants excluding animal origin products (or other ingredients)

The second half of the article discusses the risk of feeding animal products (SDPP) to swine and 
whether or not the true risk warrants excluding animal origin products (or other ingredients) 
from swine diets. The author concludes that the risk of PEDV survival in SDPP is extremely low, 
but non-zero. The challenge lies in how to manage a non-zero risk. The likelihood of transmitting 
PEDV via feed in comparison to transmitting PEDV via infected animals is likely extremely low. 
However, the consequences of a disease outbreak are significant and the trend toward 
increasing herd sizes (and assuming fixed biosecurity practices) in developed countries such as 
the United States along with greater flux of inputs (animals, semen, feed, water, personnel, 
vehicles, etc.) leads to a higher temporal frequency of adverse events. The author argues that a 
blanket ban on certain ingredients in swine feed (of swine origin) may not be the solution. A 
comprehensive evaluation of transmission pathways as well as cost-benefit analyses of 
managing feed-related risks and balancing risks with nutritional value are needed [5].  
 
• In the review by Lowe (2014), the author summarized aspects of the U.S. outbreak of PEDV in 
2013, including factors that were found to be associated with greater risk of PEDV transmission. 
The author concluded that current research supports transmission of PEDV through livestock 
transportation, movement of people, vehicles, and other contaminated fomites as well as 
shared resources and equipment among farms [35]. The author cited reports by the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency and others that demonstrated the level of PEDV found in SDPP added to

shared resources and equipment among farms [35]. The author cited reports by the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency and others that demonstrated the level of PEDV found in SDPP added to 
feed around the time of the outbreak was not sufficient to transmit virus to naïve pigs [7, 14]. It 
is stated that feed was not likely a primary transmission route of PEDV in 2013 [35]; however, 
Lowe cites other clinical studies and epidemiological investigations that provide evidence that 
feed can serve as a fomite for PEDV if contaminated during the manufacturing, storage, and 
transport processes [35].   
 
• In 2014, the United States experienced the emergence of a second novel swine enteric 
coronavirus, PDCoV. McCluskey et al. (2016) administered a retrospective survey to 42 U.S. 
swine breeding herd operations that experienced a confirmed outbreak of PDCoV in order to 
identify factors that may have contributed to the introduction and spread of the virus. Among 
other things, the source and timing of feed delivered to the affected farms in the 10 days prior 
to the outbreak of PDCoV was examined. All farms surveyed had a delivery of complete feed or

feed ingredients in the 10 days prior to the outbreak; 60% of those had a delivery of SDPP while 
40% received blood products or pork fat. One third of the farms received feed components from

surveyed [37].

40% received blood products or pork fat. One third of the farms received feed components from 
outside of the United States. There was no common source of feed or SDPP for the farms 
surveyed [37]. 
 
• In April/May of 2013, PEDV was first identified in the United States. Scott et al. (2016) addressed 
the question of how PEDV entered the United States, through various methods including 
scenario development, post hoc investigations, epidemiologic surveys, a case control study, 
brainstorming, and speculation. They used previously collected epidemiologic data to develop 
scenarios and identify hypothetical routes of PEDV introduction into the United States and 
conducted follow-up studies to gather evidence for the most plausible scenarios. The follow-up 
studies included testing organic soybeans and pet jerky treats imported from China and archived 
serum samples opportunistically collected from feral swine; all results were negative. The 
authors did not identify a proven source or route of PEDV introduction into the United States. 
However, it was suggested that incomplete farm feed/ration records negatively impacted 
investigators’ ability to thoroughly evaluate the potential epidemiologic role of feed or feed 
ingredients.  The authors identified totes used to transport bulk feed as providing “the simplest 
explanation” for the investigation findings [11]. 
 
• A retrospective survey was administered to U.S. swine veterinarians and producers in 2017 to 
collect opinions regarding, among other things, the suspected source of PEDV and PDCoV 
introduction into the United States in 2013-2014. The majority of respondents believed trucks

introduction into the United States in 2013-2014. The majority of respondents believed trucks 
coming onto the farm (26%), feed (29%), and variable biosecurity protocols (18%) were 
responsible for virus introduction. Survey participants were also asked about control measures 
implemented in response to outbreaks. None of the participants noted a change in feed 
practices although 56% implemented enhanced biosecurity protocols. At the time of the survey 
the majority of respondents had either never experienced an outbreak of PEDV or PDCoV 
(28.9%) or reported that the virus had been eliminated from their farms (56.6%) [38]. 
6.2.2 Feed and feed ingredients 
Feed and feed ingredients have been hypothesized to serve as fomites for virus introduction and spread, 
leading several investigators to examine environmental samples (feed, fomites etc.) for the presence of 
virus and/or to conduct assays testing the ability of feed to serve as a fomite for virus. The following 
summarizes the reported findings. 
Descriptive

Environmental samples were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The investigators 
report that PEDV RNA was detected in newly opened bags of pellets on-farm; and in pellets and 
individual ingredients sampled at the source (supplier) facility. No virus isolation (VI) assays were 
performed on these samples. In the bioassay conducted, pigs were observed to be healthy and 
no clinical signs of disease were observed [39].  
 
• A retrospective case study by Greiner (2016) investigating PEDV and PDCoV outbreaks in the 
United States found a positive association between feed truck visits to farms and presence of 
PEDV. To investigate the role of feed and feed mills in these outbreaks, environmental sampling 
was conducted at 24 feed mills, some of which served farms known to be positive for PEDV or 
PDCoV. The investigators swabbed office floors, bulk ingredient pit grates (exterior surfaces), 
mixer/pellet coolers, incoming bagged-ingredient truck trailers, the interior of feed 
compartments on trucks servicing farms, and feed truck foot pedals. None of the samples 
obtained were positive for PEDV RNA, 5% of truck foot pedals and 1% of bulk ingredient pit 
grates were suspect for PDCoV RNA, and 3.4% and 2.2% of truck foot pedals and office floors, 
respectively, were positive for PDCoV. All other samples were negative for PDCoV. There were

or PDCoV RNA [40]. 
Experimental 
• Trudeau et al. (2017a and 2017b) conducted experimental assays to investigate inactivation 
kinetics of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in feed and feed ingredient matrices and on solid surfaces. 
Feed and non-animal origin feed ingredients used in these studies included complete feed, corn, 
soybean meal, corn dried distillers grains with solubles, and vitamin and trace mineral premix. 
The authors mixed stock virus with liquid medium, and then spiked samples of feed and feed 
ingredients with the mixture and incubated the combinations at various temperatures. In one 
study, they incubated the spiked samples at room temperature (approximately 25 °C) for 0 to 56 
days [42]. In another study, they incubated the spiked samples at 60 to 90 °C for up to 30 min 
[41]. The authors used a cell culture based assay and model fitting to estimate a delta value, 
calculated as an indicator of the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For the 
spiked samples incubated at room temperature, the largest delta values were obtained for

spiked samples incubated at room temperature, the largest delta values were obtained for 
PDCoV and TGEV in soybean meal, at approximately 42 days each. Soybean meal at room 
temperature also provided the highest delta value for PEDV, at 7.5 days. Other findings 
indicated that at room temperature, moisture and ether content were important determinants 
of virus survival. The authors found no difference in virus survival in feed or non-animal origin 
feed ingredients incubated at temperatures higher than 70 °C. The maximum level of virus 
inactivation occurred upon heating the spiked samples at 90 °C for 30 minutes [41, 42].

6.2.3 Summary of findings 
Of the retrospective studies, epidemiological investigations and reviews conducted in the aftermath of 
the PEDV and PDCoV outbreaks in 2013-2014, none found definitive evidence linking the transmission of 
PEDV and PDCoV to non-animal origin feed ingredients [11, 34-37]. Scott et al. (2016) proposed 
imported virus-contaminated feed totes as a possible scenario for the source of PEDV introduction into 
the United States in 2013; however, no conclusive data were presented to support this hypothesis [11]. 
The perception by the swine industry, however, that feed could have been the source of virus 
introduction is reflected in the results of the 2017 survey administered to veterinarians and swine 
producers, in which 29 percent of respondents believed feed was linked to virus entry and spread.

The perception by the swine industry, however, that feed could have been the source of virus 
introduction is reflected in the results of the 2017 survey administered to veterinarians and swine 
producers, in which 29 percent of respondents believed feed was linked to virus entry and spread. 
Trucks (26%) and variable biosecurity protocols (18%) were also believed to be linked with PED spread 
[38]. The EFSA 2014 scientific opinion report notes that while transmission of PEDV via feed has been 
experimentally demonstrated [9], more data are needed for reliable assessment of the epidemiologic 
importance of this route in the field [34].   
Lowe (2014) concluded that feed was not a primary transmission route in the spread of PEDV in the 
United States [35]. However, on further investigation, Lowe et al. (2014) found evidence that transport 
vehicles moving in and out of collection points, such as harvest facilities and livestock auction markets, 
served as a source of contamination of other transport vehicles, noting that the cost-saving industry 
practice of consolidating resources such as sharing building maintenance, manure handling equipment, 
personnel, and livestock transportation equipment likely contributed to the spread of the PED outbreak 
across multiple geographic regions in the United States [43]. Similarly, McCluskey et al. (2016) reported 
on findings that movement of feed trucks onto farms was significantly associated with PED status. 
Collectively, these studies suggest that biosecurity measures on the farm and at the feed manufacturing 
plant as well as limiting the movement of animals, people, vehicles, and other shared inputs could serve 
as critical control points to stop the transmission of PEDV between herds [35, 37, 43].

Collectively, these studies suggest that biosecurity measures on the farm and at the feed manufacturing 
plant as well as limiting the movement of animals, people, vehicles, and other shared inputs could serve 
as critical control points to stop the transmission of PEDV between herds [35, 37, 43].  
Two studies conducted environmental sampling of feed, feed facilities, and feed transport vehicles to 
determine whether these items contributed to the cause of the PEDV and PDCoV outbreaks in the 
United States [39, 40]. Collectively, the findings indicate that none of the source ingredients nor the 
outgoing feed at the feed mills sampled were positive for viral RNA, suggesting the non-animal origin 
ingredients and feed were not contaminated with PEDV or PDCoV. However, experimental studies by 
Trudeau et al. (2017a and 2017b) did show that feed ingredients spiked with PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in 
a laboratory setting could maintain live virus for a period of time at room temperature. The authors also 
found that different ingredients produced different virus survival periods which they believe may be due 
to moisture and ether content or pH of each ingredient. These data indicate that, under certain 
conditions, swine enteric coronaviruses are able to survive in feed ingredients [41, 42]. 
In summary, the epidemiologic investigations and outbreak studies did not definitively link (or exclude) 
transmission of PEDV or PDCoV with non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients. Inconsistent findings 
impart uncertainty towards feed or feed ingredients as a transmission pathway [35, 37, 39, 40, 43]. The

transmission of PEDV or PDCoV with non-animal origin feed or feed ingredients. Inconsistent findings 
impart uncertainty towards feed or feed ingredients as a transmission pathway [35, 37, 39, 40, 43]. The 
 
 
27 
 
 
 
most common mechanical fomite implicated in this group of studies was transport vehicles, including a 
positive association between feed truck movements onto farms and disease status [34-38, 40, 43]. Two 
experimental studies reviewed did demonstrate that virus added to feed can survive for a period of time 
under certain conditions [41, 42]. However, these studies did not investigate nor were able to 
demonstrate that virus present in feed could be transmitted to naïve animals through normal feeding 
behavior.  
Among the knowledge gaps identified in these studies are the identification of critical control points for 
pathogen contamination of feed and/or non-animal origin feed ingredients and consensus on the feed-
based transmission pathways for PEDV and PDCoV. The point source(s) for virus contamination of feed 
or non-animal origin feed ingredients are not clearly defined.    
 
6.3 Experimental studies on feed transmission with swine bioassays 
The rapid spread of PED in commercial swine in North America in 2013-2014 prompted several 
experimental (non- randomized) studies with in vivo biological assays (bioassays) to be conducted. The 
bioassays were used to assess the biological activity or potency of the pathogen(s) of interest by 
measuring the magnitude of response such as observed clinical signs consistent with the study 
disease(s) and/or positive findings to diagnostic testing and necropsy examination. Most studies

assays) to be conducted. The 
bioassays were used to assess the biological activity or potency of the pathogen(s) of interest by 
measuring the magnitude of response such as observed clinical signs consistent with the study 
disease(s) and/or positive findings to diagnostic testing and necropsy examination. Most studies 
included in this section of the literature review used swine bioassays to determine the infectivity of the 
pathogen(s) of interest in feed or feed ingredients subsequent to detection by PCR of virus nucleic acid 
in the matrix (feed or feed ingredients) under examination.   
For the purposes of discussion, the experimental studies with swine bioassays have been collated into 
two categories: field-based experimental studies with bioassays [9, 39, 44], and laboratory-controlled 
experimental studies with bioassays [15, 45-48]. In general, the bioassays involved naïve piglets of 
various ages, ranging from four days old to 21 days old [9, 48]; in some studies, pigs were re-used after a 
negative bioassay and the subsequent ages at re-introduction to the bioassay were not easily 
discernable [15, 47]. Piglets were sourced from healthy herds and tested by PCR and serological assays 
to confirm negative status to the respective pathogen(s) prior to the initiation of the bioassay. Exposure 
routes of the challenge matrix to the piglets varied, including ad libitum (natural) feeding [9, 39], oral 
administration via syringe [15, 47, 48], orogastric gavage [44-46], intramuscular injection, and intranasal 
administration [48]. In most studies, the bioassays consisted

routes of the challenge matrix to the piglets varied, including ad libitum (natural) feeding [9, 39], oral 
administration via syringe [15, 47, 48], orogastric gavage [44-46], intramuscular injection, and intranasal 
administration [48]. In most studies, the bioassays consisted of daily diagnostic monitoring, lasting 6-7 
days post-inoculation, culminating with euthanasia and complete necropsy examinations of piglets.   
6.3.1 Experimental studies with swine bioassays using field-sourced challenge virus  
Three experimental studies with swine bioassays exposed piglets to challenge feed samples inoculated 
with field-sourced virus from an index farm or contaminated feed facility. Prior to the bioassay, the virus

material was further processed or prepared in the laboratory before inoculating the challenge matrix. 
The bioassay results yielded mixed findings [9, 39, 44].  
• Pillatzki et al. (2015) used a swine bioassay to investigate whether PEDV PCR-positive samples of 
complete feed, feed pre-mix, and SDPP (Ct values of 33.8, 34.2, and 30.0, respectively) that had 
been retained by feed manufacturers could serve as a source of PEDV transmission to neonatal 
swine. The piglets inoculated with the PEDV-positive feed samples along with the negative-
control piglets remained negative for PEDV by PCR and clinically healthy throughout the study 
period. In contrast, only the positive-control piglets (Ct value = 25.5) developed clinical signs of

period. In contrast, only the positive-control piglets (Ct value = 25.5) developed clinical signs of 
PED; PEDV RNA was detected in fecal swabs; villous atrophy was observed in the ileum; and 
PEDV was detected in the ileum by immunohistochemistry [44].  
 
• Bowman et al. (2015) conducted a swine bioassay on a newly started pelleted diet that was 
implicated as the transmission vehicle of PEDV into an Ohio swine operation. PEDV was 
detected by RT-PCR in the interior of the unopened bags of the new supplier’s pellets, 
suggesting contamination occurred prior to delivery of the feed to the farm. Additionally, the 
source facility (supplier) tested positive for PEDV as well as individual ingredients at the source 
facility. Piglets were provided ad libitum access to the RT-PCR positive mash3 (mean Ct = 36.5) 
along with dry pellets from the same lot for 7 days and observed for clinical signs of PEDV. 
During the bioassay, none of the pigs developed clinical signs of disease. Environmental and 
rectal swabs collected daily during the study were negative for PEDV as determined by RT-PCR. 
Microscopic examination of intestinal tissues collected from the piglets at the end of the study 
revealed no significant morphologic lesions [39].

• Following an outbreak of PED on three breeding herd premises in the United States, Dee et al. 
(2014) used a novel on-farm sampling method to collect remnants of feed samples from empty 
feed bins that previously contained feed consumed by the index populations. Analysis of feed 
material across the 3 affected sites by real-time RT-PCR indicated the presence of PEDV RNA 
with Ct values ranging from 19.50-22.20. For the swine bioassay, piglets were divided into three 
groups: the treatment group was fed 454 g of the challenge feed (natural feeding method) 
(pooled Ct value = 20.65); the positive-control group was challenged with feed spiked with stock 
PEDV (Ct value = 18.23); and the negative-control group was fed a placebo feed. The challenge 
feed for the treatment group was prepared using 30 g of feed material from the PCR-positive bin 
samples from the 3 affected sites and diluted in 30 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline. The 
solution was vortexed and centrifuged. The supernatant was mixed with 454 grams of PEDV-free 
feed. Clinical signs consistent with PED were observed in piglets in the treatment group and the 
positive-control group. At necropsy, rectal swabs and intestinal tract samples from the 
treatment group and the positive-control group were positive for PEDV by PCR and

signs, viral shedding, or PEDV-positive intestinal tract samples were not observed. Molecular 
sequencing of viral RNA obtained from treatment and positive control groups confirmed 
consumption of feed and not cross-contamination as the source of infection [9]. 
6.3.2 Experimental studies with swine bioassays using laboratory-sourced challenge virus  
Five experimental studies with swine bioassays involved laboratory-controlled experimental studies in 
which piglets were exposed to the challenge matrix spiked with a predetermined pathogen dose 
sourced from laboratory stock viruses [15, 45-48]. Goyal (2014) and Schumacher et al. (2016) conducted 
experimental studies with a swine bioassay aimed at determining PEDV survivability in various organic 
materials and minimum infectious dose, respectively.

materials and minimum infectious dose, respectively.  
• Goyal (2014) investigated the survival of PEDV and TGEV in fresh feces, manure slurry, animal 
feed, and water. Stock PEDV prepared from pigs infected experimentally with a field strain of 
PEDV and a laboratory strain of TGEV were inoculated into samples of fresh feces, slurry, dry 
and wet swine feed, and drinking water and the mixtures were incubated at various humidity 
percentages and temperatures and for up to 14 days. PEDV and TGEV could be detected by PCR 
in fresh feces for 1-7 or 14 days, respectively, depending on temperature and humidity. Both 
viruses could be detected in slurry, non-chlorinated water, and dry and wet feed samples for ≥ 
28 days at room temperature [45].  
 
For the bioassay, a subset of pigs were inoculated via orogastric gavage with virus aliquots 
obtained from 7 day old fresh feces, ≥ 28 day old room temperature slurry samples and wet 
feed samples, 7 day old dry feed samples, and two week old water samples. Bioassay results 
showed that PEDV survives in fresh feces for 1-7 days. Infective virus was recovered from 
inoculated slurry samples stored for ≥ 14 days at various temperatures, suggesting that 
spreading of manure could disseminate virus onto fields. The findings of this study also suggest 
that PEDV inoculated into wet and dry swine feed can remain infective for up to 28 days and 7 
days, respectively [45].

• Schumacher et al. (2016) used a swine bioassay to estimate the minimum infectious dose of 
PEDV in virus-inoculated feed. The authors mixed serial dilutions of stock PEDV with feed, and 
administered the mixtures to 10-day-old piglets by orogastric gavage. The feed used in the study 
was corn- and soybean meal-based and included vitamin and trace mineral premixes and a 
source of phytase. The lowest concentration of virus in feed to cause infection in the piglets was 
5.6 x 101 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)/g which corresponds to a Ct value of 37. 
Based on this infective dose, the authors estimated that 1 g of fecal matter could contaminate 
up to 450,000 kg of feed. The authors noted that there was a 10 unit difference in PCR Ct value 
for PEDV mixed with feed (Ct value of 37) in comparison to an equivalent dose of PEDV mixed 
with tissue culture medium (Ct value of 27). The authors proposed a variety of mechanisms that

might account for this difference, such as differences in the methods of dilution and virus 
extraction, differential RNA degradation, or enhanced viral persistence through binding of virus 
particles or RNA to feed particles [46].

might account for this difference, such as differences in the methods of dilution and virus 
extraction, differential RNA degradation, or enhanced viral persistence through binding of virus 
particles or RNA to feed particles [46].  
Three experimental studies with swine bioassays reported by the same primary author examined the 
infectivity of PEDV in common swine feed ingredients in the presence or absence of a formaldehyde-
based liquid antimicrobial SalCURB® (LA) [15]; the infectivity of PEDV in common swine feed ingredients 
with or without LA and 2% custom medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA) following a simulated trans-
Pacific shipment from China to the United States [47]; and the infectivity of select viral pathogens in 
common swine feed ingredients following two simulated transportation conditions across two different 
regions of the world [48].   
• Dee et al. (2015) examined PEDV viability in various feed ingredients common in swine diets in 
the presence or absence of LA. Eighteen common swine feed ingredients were selected: corn, 
conventional soybean meal (SBM), dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS), SDPP, purified 
plasma, intestinal mucosa, meat and bone meal (MBM), RBC, 3 vitamin/trace mineral (VTM) 
mixes, choice white grease, soy oil, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, threonine, limestone, and dry 
choline chloride. Sixteen 30 g samples of each ingredient were divided into two groups in 
replicate. One group was treated with 0.1 mL of LA (treated group) and the other group was 
treated with saline (non-treated group). The samples were spiked with 2 mL PEDV

/L methionine, threonine, limestone, and dry 
choline chloride. Sixteen 30 g samples of each ingredient were divided into two groups in 
replicate. One group was treated with 0.1 mL of LA (treated group) and the other group was 
treated with saline (non-treated group). The samples were spiked with 2 mL PEDV to reach a Ct 
mean of 25 (range 19-30) following mixing. There were 32 control samples of complete feed 
inoculated with PEDV (16 positive controls) or saline (16 negative controls). Also, 8-10 mL 
samples of stock PEDV served as stock virus controls. The samples were stored outside in winter 
conditions in plastic totes. At 1, 7, 14, and 30 days post-inoculation (DPI), samples were 
removed for diagnostic testing. The samples were tested for PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV by RT-PCR. 
The presence of viable virus was determined by VI. Viable PEDV (positive VI) on 30 DPI was 
detected from non-treated SBM, DDGS, RBCs, MBM, lysine HCL, and D/L methionine. Non-
treated choice white grease, threonine, and limestone were positive on VI at varying sampling 
days. Only SBM and MBM remained PCR positive at day 30; all LA-treated ingredients were VI 
negative [15].  
 
The swine bioassay was used for PCR positive but VI negative feed samples. This included the 
non-treated ingredients of corn, 3 VTM mixes, intestinal mucosa, soy oil, choline chloride, SDPP, 
purified plasma, as well as the LA-treated ingredients. Choice white grease

Each pig received 1 mL of the designated inoculum orally via syringe. Pigs were observed for 7 
days for clinical signs and rectal swabs were collected daily. If clinical signs were observed, 
swabs were collected from diarrhea and vomit samples and tested by PCR. Following completion 
of the bioassay, viable PEDV was detected only in piglets challenged with non-treated choline 
and choice white grease [15].

• Dee et al. (2016) designed a model to evaluate the transboundary risk of PEDV-contaminated 
swine feed ingredients during a simulated shipment from China to the United States and tested 
the effect of two mitigation strategies on the reduction of PEDV in feed using LA and 2% custom 
MCFA. Fourteen swine feed ingredients commonly imported from China to the United States 
were selected: organic and conventional soybeans and soybean meal (SBM), lysine HCL, D/L 
methionine, tryptophan, vitamins A, D, & E, choline chloride, rice hulls, corn cobs, and feed-
grade tetracycline. The samples were organized into four batches, each representing a specific

 soybeans and soybean meal (SBM), lysine HCL, D/L 
methionine, tryptophan, vitamins A, D, & E, choline chloride, rice hulls, corn cobs, and feed-
grade tetracycline. The samples were organized into four batches, each representing a specific 
segment of the 37 day shipping journey. Each ingredient was allocated into each of the four 
batches in two replicates. Each batch of ingredients had a positive control group (non-treated), a 
negative control group (PEDV-negative ingredients), a LA-treated group (LA and PEDV spiked), 
and a MCFA-treated group (MCFA and PEDV spiked). The samples were housed in a 
programmed environmental chamber based on the temperature and percent relative humidity 
for each segment of the shipping journey. For exposure to ambient air, two holes were drilled 
into each plastic container. At designated DPI, samples were removed and submitted for 
diagnostic testing by RT-PCR and VI. Viable PEDV (positive VI) in batch 4 (representing shipment 
to and storage in Iowa) was found in non-treated organic and conventional SBM, lysine, and 
vitamin D [47].   
 
The swine bioassay was used to test ingredients that were PCR-positive for PEDV but negative 
by VI. This included non-treated ingredients vitamins A and E, tryptophan, D/L methionine,

Piglets (n = 24) of 5-7 days old were divided into groups of four. All four piglets in each unit 
received the same ingredient. Samples from batch 4 (to represent ingredients that would travel 
the entire 37-day journey to Iowa) were prepared for the bioassay. Piglets received 1 mL of the 
designated inoculum orally via syringe. Pigs were observed for 7 days for clinical signs and daily 
rectal swabs were taken and, if clinical, swabs were collected from diarrhea and vomit samples 
and tested by PCR. If diagnostic samples were PEDV-positive by PCR, all animals swabbed were 
euthanized and piglets re-stocked. If pigs remained PEDV-negative, the pigs were added to a 
different experimental group and inoculated with a different ingredient (re-used). Positive 
bioassay findings were observed in piglets that were administered non-treated choline chloride. 
None of the piglets fed LA- or MCFA-treated ingredients spiked with PEDV were positive on the 
swine bioassay [47].

disease virus (SVDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), PCV2, and vesicular exanthema of swine

virus (VESV). Surrogate viruses were used for FMDV, CSFV, PRV, VESV, Nipah virus, and SVDV. 
Eleven feed ingredients were selected: organic and conventional SBM, soy oil cake, DDGS, lysine 
HCL, vitamin D, choline chloride, moist cat food, moist dog food, dry dog food, and pork sausage 
casings. Two transboundary shipping journeys were modeled: trans-Pacific (per Dee et al., 2016) 
to simulate travel between China and the United States and trans-Atlantic to simulate travel 
between Europe (Poland) and the United States (for ASFV only). The samples were organized 
into four batches, each representing a specific segment of each trans-ocean shipping journey. 
Duplicate samples of each ingredient were organized into the batches. Five gram samples of 
gamma-irradiated ingredients were spiked with 100 µL of minimum essential media containing 1

Duplicate samples of each ingredient were organized into the batches. Five gram samples of 
gamma-irradiated ingredients were spiked with 100 µL of minimum essential media containing 1 
X 105 TCID50/g of each virus. All samples were incubated in a programmed environmental 
chamber regulated for temperature and percent relative humidity. Samples of each 
ingredient/virus combination were removed from each batch at the predetermined DPI and 
tested by RT-PCR and VI. A wide variation in viability was observed across the virus-ingredient 
combinations from batch 4 [48]. 
 
The swine bioassay was used to determine infectivity of feed ingredients that tested positive by 
PCR but negative on VI in cell culture. The bioassay was performed with Seneca virus A (FMDV 
surrogate), PRRSV, porcine sapelovirus (SVDV surrogate), PCV2, ASFV, and IAV-S in selected 
virus-ingredient combinations. Pigs were inoculated by various methods, including orally via 
syringe, intramuscularly, and intranasally. A positive bioassay was observed for the following 
virus-ingredient combinations: PRRSV and conventional SBM; PRRSV and DDGS; Seneca virus A 
and choline; and PCV2 and lysine, choline, and vitamin D. The finding of Senecavirus A in choline 
was not detailed in the discussion section [48].

was not detailed in the discussion section [48].  
 
The investigators reported that from the virus-ingredient combinations subjected to various 
simulated environmental conditions, 7 viruses remained in a viable form in 2 or more 
ingredients: Seneca virus A, ASFV, PRRSV, porcine sapelovirus, PCV2, feline calicivirus (surrogate 
to VESV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (surrogate to PRV), and PEDV. The highest degree of stability was 
for Seneca virus A as viable virus was recovered from 10 of 11 ingredients. ASFV stock virus was 
the only virus to survive the simulated 30-day shipping journey in the absence of feed matrix. 
Half-life was calculated for Seneca virus A, porcine sapelovirus, feline calicivirus, bovine 
herpesvirus-1, and ASFV for each virus-ingredient combination. Feline calicivirus and Seneca 
virus A had extended half-lives in conventional SBM, 26.6 days and 9.7 day, respectively, as 
compared to other virus-ingredients combinations. Feline calicivirus had the longest half-life in 
conventional SBM at 26.6 days but much shorter half-life in other ingredients. In contrast, 
Seneca virus A had the least variability of half-life in feed, ranging from 1.7 to 9.7 days across 10 
ingredients. The non-animal origin feed ingredients that supported survival of multiple viruses

SBM (n = 3), and DDGS (n = 2). The findings suggest that viruses can survive in feed but survival 
duration is variable and dependent on virus properties and feed matrix [48].  
6.3.3 Summary of findings 
For the experimental studies using field-sourced challenge virus, the swine bioassays in the Pillatzki et al. 
(2015) and Bowman et al. (2015) studies failed to demonstrate the infectivity of PEDV PCR-positive feed. 
Pillatzki et al. (2015) provides several plausible explanations, including the nucleic acid detected in the 
feed samples did not represent infectious virus; the feed samples had relatively high Ct values (range: 
30.0 – 36.5); and an extended storage time between collection of the sample and the bioassay may have 
reduced or eliminated the infectivity of the PEDV. Similar explanations were provided by Bowman et al. 
(2015), adding that the small number of piglets used in the bioassay and the short feeding trial period 
lowered the sensitivity of the bioassay and did not realistically reflect the field setting. Despite the 
negative findings, Bowman et al. (2015) maintains that the contaminated feed pellets were the source of 
the outbreak in the Ohio swine operation. Pillatzki et al. (2015

 small number of piglets used in the bioassay and the short feeding trial period 
lowered the sensitivity of the bioassay and did not realistically reflect the field setting. Despite the 
negative findings, Bowman et al. (2015) maintains that the contaminated feed pellets were the source of 
the outbreak in the Ohio swine operation. Pillatzki et al. (2015) also concluded that feed contaminated 
with infectious PEDV can serve as a vehicle for disease transmission, citing as evidence that the positive-
control piglets that were administered spiked feed did develop clinical signs of PED and PEDV fecal 
shedding. The findings in Pillatzki et al. (2015) are consistent with the findings of Dee et al. (2014). Both 
studies produced challenge feeds with a low Ct value (range: 18.23 – 25.5) and the bioassay conducted 
with the PEDV-contaminated feeds produced disease.  
For the experimental studies using laboratory-sourced challenge virus, Goyal (2014) produced 
preliminary evidence that under laboratory conditions, PEDV can survive in PEDV-spiked wet and dry 
feed at room temperature and remain infectious for ≥ 28 days and 7 days, respectively [45]. Other 
studies on PEDV survival in individual swine feed ingredients support these findings [15, 41, 42, 47]. 
Schumacher et al. (2016) produced preliminary evidence on the minimum infectious dose of PEDV-
inoculated feed as 5.6 x 101 TCID50/g with Ct values ranging from 27 – 37 [46].  
The findings in three studies, under different experiment conditions, suggest that virus survival is 
ingredient-dependent. Varying physical and chemical characteristics of feed ingredients may enhance or 
protect virus survival [15

 dose of PEDV-
inoculated feed as 5.6 x 101 TCID50/g with Ct values ranging from 27 – 37 [46].  
The findings in three studies, under different experiment conditions, suggest that virus survival is 
ingredient-dependent. Varying physical and chemical characteristics of feed ingredients may enhance or 
protect virus survival [15, 47, 48]. Dee et al. (2015) noted several interesting or novel findings, including 
an extended survival time observed in conventional SBM; recovery of viable PEDV from (all non-treated) 
DDGS, 3 synthetic amino acids, and dry choline chloride; and the inability to recover viable PEDV from 
SDPP [in contrast to Pasick et al. (2014)] or the 3 VTM mixes. Dee et al. (2016) study also found viable 
PEDV in PEDV-spiked conventional SBM, lysine, and choline. Additionally, PEDV did survive and remain 
infectious in vitamin D [47]. Both formaldehyde-based LA and MCFA treatment rendered virus inactive, 
regardless of ingredient type, suggesting these mitigants might be useful as part of a risk management 
strategy for reducing viral load in feed ingredients [15, 47].  
Building upon the shipping model methods developed in the Dee et al. (2016) study, the Dee et al. 
(2018) study expanded the selection of viral pathogens as well as added an additional trans-oceanic

shipping route from Europe (Poland) to the United States for ASFV. Like the two preceding studies, Dee 
et al. (2018) found that certain feed ingredient matrices enhance or protect viral survival. Of interest, 
the authors noted that

shipping route from Europe (Poland) to the United States for ASFV. Like the two preceding studies, Dee 
et al. (2018) found that certain feed ingredient matrices enhance or protect viral survival. Of interest, 
the authors noted that virus viability in organic SBM could not be demonstrated. This finding could 
discount previous speculation that the rise in organic swine farming may have contributed to PEDV 
introduction in to the United States. Additionally, the authors noted that ASFV demonstrated strong 
survivability characteristics, remaining viable under laboratory-simulated conditions with or without the 
feed matrix [48].  
In summary, the infective dose of PEDV is low and, experimentally, infectivity of the feed material is 
dependent on viral load (e.g., Ct value). Additionally, experimental evidence indicates that the duration 
of virus survival in swine feed ingredients is dependent on the ingredient matrix and the virus-ingredient 
combination. The feed ingredients that have shown to support virus survivability and viability include 
conventional soybean meal, lysine, choline chloride, and vitamin D. ASFV demonstrated strong 
survivability characteristics.   
Among the knowledge gaps identified in these studies are the identification of vulnerable (risky) non-
animal origin feed ingredients for viral contamination, ingredient (matrix) characteristics that support or 
hinder virus survival, and identification of the critical point(s) in the transboundary feed production and 
distribution continuum where (fecal) contamination of non-animal origin ingredients could occur. There

distribution continuum where (fecal) contamination of non-animal origin ingredients could occur. There 
is a paucity of field data demonstrating if, how, and when non-animal origin feed ingredients may 
become contaminated with swine viruses.  Further, although some field epidemiological investigations 
have associated contaminated feed (PCR positive) with the source of virus introduction on affected 
farms, to date, experimental studies designed to prove causation of virus transmission via feed and feed 
ingredients have yielded inconsistent data. It is also unknown what characteristics of non-animal origin 
feed ingredients may contribute to virus survival, if present. Additionally, the development of diagnostic 
assays and sampling techniques, capable of testing large volumes of non-animal origin feed ingredients 
to determine whether the level of contamination is sufficient to transmit disease is required to better 
assess the frequency with which these materials are contaminated with virus, which viruses are present, 
and at what concentration. Subsequent assays to determine contamination of the final, processed feed 
product would be useful to determine the likelihood that contaminated non-animal origin feed 
ingredients would transmit virus to swine and to what degree feed should be prioritized as a biosecurity 
risk.

The objective of this literature review was to gather and analyze the evidence in published scientific 
literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce 
and transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The goal was to understand the

The objective of this literature review was to gather and analyze the evidence in published scientific 
literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce 
and transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The goal was to understand the 
current scientific knowledge and to identify information gaps to better inform decision makers, other 
stakeholders, and the scientific community. To achieve this, the basic steps of a systematic review 
methodology were followed [1], resulting in a qualitative summary report of findings.  
The results of the literature review demonstrate that a limited number of studies currently address 
swine viral pathogen transmission through non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. Of the studies 
available, several suffered from limitations that hinder generalizing the findings to real-world 
commercial swine scenarios. For example, studies were limited by small feed sample volumes (as small 
as 5 grams) which does not directly equate to the quantities (tonnage) in actual swine production and 
feed scenarios; small sample sizes (2 replicates) which reduced statistical strength and confidence of 
findings; low sensitivity in swine bioassays; experimental methods which do not mimic natural feeding 
behaviors of swine or large-scale commercial swine production; and environmental scenarios that 
cannot be easily extrapolated to other seasons or geographical regions. Bioassays, including those 
reviewed in this document, often suffer from low sensitivity due to low number of subject animals (n = 4 
in the studies reviewed); health status of subject animals often does not reflect the immune status 
variability observed in the field setting; and subject animals are typically exposed or inoculated once 
(single-hit concept) whereas multiple or on-going exposures occur in the field setting. Thus, results of 
the bioassay may not equate to real

 animals (n = 4 
in the studies reviewed); health status of subject animals often does not reflect the immune status 
variability observed in the field setting; and subject animals are typically exposed or inoculated once 
(single-hit concept) whereas multiple or on-going exposures occur in the field setting. Thus, results of 
the bioassay may not equate to real-life scenarios. Other studies, particularly those with retrospective 
questionnaire or survey components, were limited by inherent sources of internal bias such as selection 
and recall bias. Furthermore, robust replication of studies in independent laboratories and field settings 
to validate or corroborate findings has not occurred. Thus, conclusions drawn from these studies should 
be interpreted with caution until repeatability of the findings can be demonstrated, particularly under 
conditions that mimic the field setting.  
Despite the small number of published studies, several key themes have emerged, many of which 
warrant additional exploration and research:  
• A subset of the studies reviewed provided experimental evidence that swine viruses can survive 
in non-animal origin feed ingredients under various experimental conditions [15, 30, 45, 47, 48]. 
Virus survival times were variable (ranging from 7 days to > 180 days) and dependent on the 
simulated environmental conditions applied (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) and the 
virus-ingredient combination. Others concluded that duration of virus survival (and infectivity) is 
ingredient-dependent and certain feed ingredients provide a more favorable matrix than others 
for extended survival [15, 47, 48]. Additional research is needed to verify virus survival times 
(and infectivity) in complete feed and feed ingredients, with various virus-ingredient 
combinations under various environmental conditions, including actual field conditions.

 and certain feed ingredients provide a more favorable matrix than others 
for extended survival [15, 47, 48]. Additional research is needed to verify virus survival times 
(and infectivity) in complete feed and feed ingredients, with various virus-ingredient 
combinations under various environmental conditions, including actual field conditions. 
 
 
36 
 
 
 
• Several authors speculated that characteristics of the ingredient such as the physical supportive 
matrix and/or the chemical (bromatological) composition contributed to virus survival [15, 30, 
31, 48]. However, the specific characteristic(s) of the ingredient that contribute to viral 
persistence have not been identified or proven.  
• A subset of experimental studies provided evidence that feed contaminated with virus can 
transmit disease to naive piglets [9, 15, 45-48]. However, the experimental methods used in 
these studies such as spiking ingredients with predetermined virus load or inoculating piglets via 
methods other than natural feeding behaviors, do not reflect the field setting and results may 
not be generalizable to field conditions, particularly large-scale commercial swine facilities. 
Additional laboratory and field-based studies are needed to determine the extent of finding 
reproducibility and applicability to field settings. 
• A subset of studies have attempted to identify individual feed ingredients that may be more 
likely than others to support virus survivability [15, 47, 48]. Viability and infectivity of each virus 
were assessed through VI and/or swine bioassay. The presence of a viable form (meaning a 
positive VI and/or bioassay) of virus (at ≥ 30 days) was confirmed in the following non-animal 
origin ingredients that had been experimentally spiked with virus inoculate: organic and 
conventional SBM,

 infectivity of each virus 
were assessed through VI and/or swine bioassay. The presence of a viable form (meaning a 
positive VI and/or bioassay) of virus (at ≥ 30 days) was confirmed in the following non-animal 
origin ingredients that had been experimentally spiked with virus inoculate: organic and 
conventional SBM, DDGS, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choline chloride, and vitamin D [15, 47, 
48]. Extended survival was observed in virus-spiked conventional SBM [15]. Two experimental 
studies, using different experimental conditions, observed PEDV viability in three PEDV-spiked 
ingredients: conventional SBM, lysine, and choline chloride. [15, 47]. Virus viability (and 
infectivity) as determined in separate swine bioassays was observed with PEDV-contaminated 
choline chloride [15, 47] and Seneca virus A-contaminated choline chloride [48]. 
• A major knowledge gap exists in sources of potential contamination and where feed or feed 
ingredients may be contaminated.  These experimental studies conducted with inoculated non-
animal origin feed ingredients do not address the question of whether these ingredients are 
contaminated with swine viruses under field conditions. The critical point(s) of susceptibility to 
contamination along the feed production, processing, and distribution continuum, from 
harvesting the plant-derived feed ingredients in the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine 
premises, have not been identified.  
• Neither the contamination route of exotic swine pathogens into non-animal origin feed 
(ingredients) nor the virus entry route into the United States has been decisively proven. 
• Under the laboratory-simulated model

premises, have not been identified.  
• Neither the contamination route of exotic swine pathogens into non-animal origin feed 
(ingredients) nor the virus entry route into the United States has been decisively proven. 
• Under the laboratory-simulated model conditions, both LA and MCFA were concluded to be 
effective chemical mitigants against PEDV in individual feed ingredients stored under simulated 
shipping conditions, suggesting they might be useful for reducing viral load in feed ingredients 
[15, 47]. The real-world application of LA and MCFA for eliminating swine viruses or decreasing 
their level of infectivity under field conditions has yet to be determined. If field-contamination 
of non-animal origin ingredients is determined to be a concern for pathogen transmission, 
additional mitigation strategies should continue to be explored, including other chemical 
treatments, the application of heat or pressure (pelleting) to feed, and holding times for feed or 
feed ingredients.

• Some of the outbreak epidemiological investigations provided evidence that the transmission 
route(s) for swine viruses onto the index farm may differ from the transmission route(s) among 
housing units within the index farm and between secondary farms. Similarly, the entry route 
(e.g., for PEDV) into the United States may differ from the transmission route(s) among 
domestic swine farms. Thus, as with other infectious diseases, multi-modal transmission 
mechanisms are likely occurring. When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as a 
potential fomite for swine virus transmission, it’s important to understand how the primary

V) into the United States may differ from the transmission route(s) among 
domestic swine farms. Thus, as with other infectious diseases, multi-modal transmission 
mechanisms are likely occurring. When considering non-animal origin feed ingredients as a 
potential fomite for swine virus transmission, it’s important to understand how the primary 
transmission pathways (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport vehicles, personnel, etc.) 
interface with one another, particularly how the production and distribution of feed interacts 
with other sources of virus contamination (e.g., infected live pigs, contaminated transport 
vehicles, personnel, etc.) to contribute, if at all, to disease transmission.   
• Similarly, it’s important to understand the relative risks of various transmission pathways and 
where feed ingredients fit in among broadly accepted risk pathways such as movement of 
infected pigs and fecal contamination of fomites (e.g., transport vehicles). By understanding the 
magnitude of the risk of feed ingredients, one can better balance the costs of sourcing “safe” 
feed ingredients and the nutritional needs of pigs with the costs of applying various mitigation 
strategies to potentially contaminated feed (e.g., heat or chemical treatment or feed holding 
times).  
• Reliable and validated assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting infective virus (i.e., 
to determine the level of contamination is sufficient to transmit disease) in large quantities of 
(bulk) ingredients are not available.

• As mentioned above, the critical point(s) of contamination along the feed production, 
processing, and distribution continuum, from harvesting the plant-derived feed ingredients in 
the field to on-farm delivery of feed to swine premises, have not been identified. Because of this 
some of the experimental studies reviewed were performed under the assumption that 
ingredients are contaminated in the post-processing stage of feed production. Very little 
information is available on how non-animal origin feed ingredients are produced and sourced 
outside the United States and current studies have produced little scientific evidence of how, or 
if, non-animal origin feed ingredients could become contaminated with swine viruses in regions 
outside the United States. Taking a systematic approach to the entire (transboundary) feed 
production system, similar to the hazard analysis and critical control points process used in food 
safety, may help to identify vulnerabilities in the production process, better inform the 
development and application of mitigation measures to reduce viral contamination risks, and 
help stakeholders allocate resources towards mitigation measures based on the likelihood of 
virus contamination.    
• Over the past several decades, the U.S. commercial swine industry has improved biosecurity 
measures on commercial premises to prevent transmission of economically significant viruses 
such as PCV2, PRRSV, and PEDV. Many commercial swine operations use the absence of PRRS on 
the farm as an indicator of thorough implementation and enforcement of biosecurity measures. 
In the studies reviewed, many favorably described their biosecurity measures and echoed 
sentiments expressed by Bowman et al. (2015) that the “effectiveness of the biosecurity

sentiments expressed by Bowman et al. (2015) that the “effectiveness of the biosecurity

measures in place was evidenced by the absence of PRRS cases”. However, the entry of PEDV 
(and new or emerging swine viruses) onto presumably biosecure commercial premises suggests 
that current biosecurity standards are insufficient to prevent virus incursion. Virus 
characteristics and the characteristics of the commercial swine industry (globalization of trade, 
intensification and vertical integration of production, and extensive movement of pigs and 
related production components) could contribute to biosecurity breaches. Robust biosecurity 
measures may be the only tool, in the absence of effective vaccines or treatments, to prevent 
the entry and spread of some diseases. Thus, biosecurity strategies, particularly the extensive 
movement of production inputs, need to be re-evaluated and adjusted to meet today’s swine 
industry paradigm. 
While investigators have addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of 
swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, the current body of scientific knowledge has yet to provide 
conclusive evidence for the source(s) of contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients with swine 
viruses and the epidemiology of virus transmission to swine under field conditions. If the primary 
concern of the swine industry and associated stakeholders lies in the importation of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced,

 of non-animal origin feed ingredients with swine 
viruses and the epidemiology of virus transmission to swine under field conditions. If the primary 
concern of the swine industry and associated stakeholders lies in the importation of contaminated feed 
and feed ingredients, then additional research and investigative studies of how ingredients are sourced, 
processed, and transported prior to importation into the United States are needed. However, the lack of 
feed and feed ingredient diagnostic assays and sampling techniques capable of detecting virus in large 
volumes of material limits our ability to determine if and at what point non-animal origin feed or feed 
ingredients may become contaminated with viruses and limits our ability to establish critical control 
points in feed production, distribution, and storage to mitigate risk(s). Until these data are available, it is 
difficult to evaluate the biosecurity risk posed by non-animal origin feed and feed ingredients. Moving 
forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and virus mitigation steps in 
processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.

PEDV Feed, starter 
feed pellets 
Through epidemiological 
investigation of a swine 
operation in Ohio, 
contaminated feed (starter 
feed pellets) was identified 
as the likely source of PEDV 
introduction. The feed and 
feed source was RT-PCR-
positive for PEDV. A 
bioassay was performed 
with samples of 
cryopreserved feed. 
Authors determined 
the starter pellet to 
be the source of PEDV 
introduction. PEDV 
RNA was detected 
inside unopened bags 
of new pellets, at the 
source facility 
(supplier), and in 
individual ingredients 
at the source facility. 
For the bioassay, 
naive pigs fed PCR-
positive feed from the 
supplier remained 
negative for PEDV.  
The results of the 
bioassay were negative 
but experimental 
conditions may not 
reflect field conditions. 
The authors made several 
hefty assumptions 
regarding biosecurity at 
the affected farm and 
ruled out other possible 
transmission routes 
without providing the 
supporting data.

The author suggests 
that "new" viruses in 
swine are likely to 
emerge from already 
recognized (non-
pathogenic or 
ignored) swine 
viruses. The likelihood 
of PEDV survival in 
SDPP is extremely 
low, but not zero. A

feed may not be the 
solution. A

The discussion focused on 
SDPP; however, key 
points can be generalized 
to non-animal origin 
ingredients. Increasing 
herd sizes (and assuming 
fixed biosecurity 
practices) along with 
greater flux of inputs 
translates to a higher 
temporal frequency of 
adverse events. The 
features of modern swine 
production (global trade, 
intense production, 
extensive movements) 
have contributed to the 
emergence of these 
pathogenic strains and 
we should expect this 
trend to continue.

Research summarized

ASFV was not transmitted 
by contaminated sweet 
potatoes or bananas (1921 
study). It was reported that 
a study in East Africa 
showed that ASFV was not 
transmitted by consuming 
non-animal origin feed 
(review 1969).  
Authors conclude

PEDV Feed, vehicles,

other fomites 
The article reviews the US 
PED outbreak in 2013. The 
author summarizes clinical 
signs, virus shedding, 
immune responses, 
epidemiology, origin of the 
outbreak and risk factors 
contributing to 
transmission such as 
herd/farm management, 
transportation and fomites. 
In this outbreak, PEDV 
was transmitted by 
livestock transport, 
movement of people, 
vehicles, and other 
contaminated 
fomites, and shared 
resources/equipment. 
The author suggests 
feed contaminated 
with infectious fecal 
material could 
transmit virus and 
that enhanced control 
procedures may 
provide protection 
against outbreaks of 
PED or other novel 
diseases in the future.

fecal swabs collected 
from these groups 
were PEDV-negative, 
no histologic lesions

not detected by IHC.  
The positive control 
group developed 
clinical signs at 3 DPI, 
and feces was PCR-

or IHC results were 
presented for positive 
controls. 
The extended storage of 
the feed samples might 
have impacted virus

that these contaminated

have been representative 
of the overall 
concentration of PEDV in 
the entire batch of feed.

The authors used 
previously collected 
epidemiologic data to 
develop scenarios and 
identify possible routes of 
PEDV introduction into the 
United States, and initiated 
follow-up studies “to 
gather more evidence for 
the most plausible 
scenarios”.  
No PEDV was 
detected in imported 
organic soybeans, pet 
jerky treats, or feral 
swine samples. Source 
of epidemic was not 
identified. Authors 
identified totes used 
to transport bulk feed 
as providing the 
simplest explanation 
for the investigation 
findings.  
Unclear objective(s) and 
reporting. Appears to be 
an emphasis or 
assumption towards 
identifying Asia or China 
as the location of origin 
and towards imported 
organic soybeans as the 
point source feed 
ingredient.
