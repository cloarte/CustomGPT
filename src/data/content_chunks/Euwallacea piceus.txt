 Invasion: The following diagnostic notes refer to females only and include only the minimum characters required to differentiate this species from other pest species.Adult FemaleLength 2.1-2.3 mm. Frons convex, shining, finely reticulate, with scattered, large, deep punctures and scattered, long, erect setae. Antennal club with one suture on posterior face. Pronotum about 1.2 times longer than wide; sides weakly arcuate, anterior margin broadly rounded, serrations absent. Elytra about 1.7 times longer than wide, 1.5 times longer than pronotum, apex broadly rounded; striae not impressed, with small, shallow punctures; interstriae slightly wider than striae, each with inconspicuous setae and punctures. Elytral declivity sloping, weakly convex; striae 1-3 weakly impressed, with punctures slightly larger than those on disc; interstriae weakly convex, each with a median row of granules and erect setae.Immature StagesThe immature stages have not been described.

 Reproduccion: The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Ambrosiodmus, Euwallacea, Xyleborinus and Xylosandrus are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. Some species infest small twigs and shoots, others are found in larger branches and poles, while others are found in large timber; others may breed in material of almost any size. In general, most species bore through the bark and into the wood where an enlarged chamber of varying size and shape is constructed. The tunnels into the wood are highly variable in depth and shape, depending on the species involved in the construction. Generally only unhealthy or newly fallen material is infested, but some species are capable of attacking host plants following only a slight set-back, for example, transplanting or temporarily unfavourable conditions such as drought or mechanical injury. A few species have become aggressive under certain conditions, and have thereby attained the status of important pests of crop plants.All species of Xyleborus and the related genera are closely associated with ambrosial fungi. Some of these fungi are phytopathogenic and all species of Xyleborus and related genera should be considered to be possible vectors of plant disease. No studies of the ambrosia fungi associated with E. piceus have been made.E. piceus usually attacks moderate to large diameter hosts ( Browne, 1961 ; Roberts, 1969 ), although smaller stems may sometimes be attacked ( Schedl, 1963 ). It attacks dying, dead and recently felled trees.

No studies of the ambrosia fungi associated with E. piceus have been made.E. piceus usually attacks moderate to large diameter hosts ( Browne, 1961 ; Roberts, 1969 ), although smaller stems may sometimes be attacked ( Schedl, 1963 ). It attacks dying, dead and recently felled trees. It has not been found in living trees, or in unseasoned sawn timber ( Browne, 1961 ). Kalshoven (1959) noted attacks on fire-scorched young trees in a forest plantation, and on diseased teak trees. The gallery system branches extensively within the wood, but in large diameter stems, the branches usually remain within one transverse plane, and do not run up and down the stem. In small diameter stems, the gallery system becomes three-dimensional ( Schedl, 1963 ). The tunnels lack brood chambers. According to Schedl (1963) , oviposition can begin when the galleries are only a few millimetres long. The larvae develop and eventually pupate within the galleries. The young female adults emerge through the original entrance hole.
 Sintomas: Attacked plants may show signs of wilting, branch die-back, shoot breakage, chronic debilitation, sun-scorch or a general decline in vigour.
