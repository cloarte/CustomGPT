In stimulating articles, Noel Vietmeyer (1986, 1990) pointed out thatrelatively few plant species, most of which were domesticated thousands ofyears ago, serve as food for humans and animals, as medicinal plants, and asindustrial crops.  As a result of atmospheric CO
2
increase and global warming,dryer conditions are expected in the future and many existing crop species willunable to survive.  Many undeveloped and neglected species could be the newcrops of the future, which will tolerate these changing climatic conditions.Research and Development on the development of tolerant crops should beinitiated world wide to meet these challenges.  New crops should have thepotential to thrive in marginal, infertile, dry lands where common crops failto provide the diversification required to enable sustainable agriculturalsystems in the future and offer viable commercial opportunities.

) that isself sufficient in agricultural production.  The local market is tiny and issubject to dramatic fluctuations in supply and demand.  When extra few tonnesof fresh fruits and/or vegetables are dumped onto the local markets, pricesplummet and farmers cannot make a living.  In contrast the export market,mainly Europe, with hundreds of millions of consumers is unlimited from anIsraeli point of view.  Thus, Israel is basically an export oriented producer.At its peak, the export volume of fresh agriculture produce (mainly fruits,vegetables, and flowers) from Israel was valued around US$1 billion/year.  Inthe 1960s the fruit export industry (mainly citrus, with the famous `Jaffa'orange being the main product) constituted one of the main sources of foreigncurrency (out of a total export market of US$211 million agricultural producecomprised about US$64 million, i.e., 30.3% of the total!).  Today, Israel is anindustrial exporting country with total annual export value of US$14 billionwhile exports of agricultural fresh produce amount to US$547 million, a mere3.9% of the total (Statistical Abstracts 1994).  It is obvious that a smallcountry such as Israel has to compete in world markets in terms of qualityrather than quantity.  As a result, millions of R&D dollars have beeninvested in the past two decades to enable Israel to compete in the worldmarkets with the best possible products giving the highest possible return tothe growers.  Despite the huge input of R&D in the agricultural sector, theproduction of the citrus is diminishing (

 in the past two decades to enable Israel to compete in the worldmarkets with the best possible products giving the highest possible return tothe growers.  Despite the huge input of R&D in the agricultural sector, theproduction of the citrus is diminishing (
Fig. 1
) due to lack of profitability(
Fig. 2
) and farmers are complaining.  Citrus sales have diminished by 30.6%from 1990 to 1993 and profitability in terms of revenue's buying power hasdeclined to 57.3% when inflation is taken into account (Fig. 2; StatisticalAbstracts 1994; BDO 1995).  The Israeli tomato export industry has stagnated at8,000 t annually for the past few years, despite the enormous R&D effortsthat have produced the world's finest quality (Statistical Abstracts 1994).Israel has additional cost limitations on its competitiveness.  Water is amajor limiting factor and its actual price is very high (US$0.22 perm
3
) and the alternative price is even higher.  Labor is veryexpensive, since farmers are in the upper middle class strata.  More than 90%of the agricultural community in Israel is either a kibbutz (community farm) ora moshav (family farm) with minimum hired labor, where most of the work isperformed by the farm owners and their families.  Gross income below US$100 andeven 150 US$/day is considered very low.  Israel's competitors in the worldmarkets pay to agricultural workers 10% and less of this sum!  Finally, energyis expensive, since almost all the country's energy is imported.
These problems have led many experts in Israel to raise the possibility ofgiving up agricultural production, even for the local markets, and purchasingall the country's agricultural needs abroad, as do Singapore and Hong Kong.

These problems have led many experts in Israel to raise the possibility ofgiving up agricultural production, even for the local markets, and purchasingall the country's agricultural needs abroad, as do Singapore and Hong Kong.  Wesubscribe to a totally different approach.  We believe that supplying the newcrops niche in the world markets will serve as a remedy for the troubledIsraeli agricultural export industry.
PRODUCT PROFIT CYCLE
In a free market every product is  following the profit cycle, as described in
Fig. 3
.  When a totally new crop is first marketed, no profit is expected,since the market has yet to accustom itself to the product.  At this stage, lowprices are set to attract consumers.  In many cases, the market does notrespond to the new product, and it simply vanishes without being noticed bymost consumers.  But if the market likes the new product (perhaps as a resultof good marketing strategy), profits will rise as a result of increasing demandand improved production efficiency (Fletcher et al. 1995).  Maximumprofitability will be achieved by the first producer as long as he is the onlysuplier in the market.  Competition will then start, first with the mostefficient and aware producers and from many others.  As a result, profitabilitywill decline, and as with all common crops, it will fall to a maginal level.At this stage, only the big and efficient producers can survive.  It is thusevident that Israel cannot compete in the market for common crops.  A goodexample of the scenario described above is the "iceberg lettuce episode."  Inthe late 1970s, Marks and Spencer (

 decline, and as with all common crops, it will fall to a maginal level.At this stage, only the big and efficient producers can survive.  It is thusevident that Israel cannot compete in the market for common crops.  A goodexample of the scenario described above is the "iceberg lettuce episode."  Inthe late 1970s, Marks and Spencer (from the UK) approached the Negev R&DOrganization to test the feasibility of growing iceberg lettuce in the IsraeliNegev Desert for their chain.  Farmers in the Arava valley (Moshav Ein Yahavand Hatzeva) produced the best iceberg lettuce that Marks and Spencer had everreceived.  The company, which was ready to pay these farmes higher prices thanthose given their American counterparts in California, was mystified by therefusal of the Israeli farmers to accept the contract.  The buyers from Marks& Spencer simply did not understand that these farmers consisted of verysmall farms (4 ha!), expensive water, and very high energy, and labor costs.In no way, could they compete with the large American producers.
On the other hand, when we start with totally new product, the high profitsobtained for small quantities of exotic fruits and vegetables, creates anatural niche for Israeli farmers.  These farmers, being highly educated, caneasily adopt new crops and new technologies.  Israel is also blessed withresearch institutions and extension services capable of carrying an efficientR&D programs, which are essential for the introduction of new crops.  Inaddition, Israel has a single efficient marketing arm of agricultural products(AGREXCO), which can easily adapt to such programs.
Unfortunately, such a strategy has not yet been adopted by the Israeli R&Dauthorities.  The main objection to such R&D programs is the fact that the

D programs, which are essential for the introduction of new crops.  Inaddition, Israel has a single efficient marketing arm of agricultural products(AGREXCO), which can easily adapt to such programs.
Unfortunately, such a strategy has not yet been adopted by the Israeli R&Dauthorities.  The main objection to such R&D programs is the fact that themarket size and the prices of the new products are unknown.  Our feeling isthat such a niche does exist, and the only way to confirm its existence is totest it.  Even the return from R&D is expected to be higher when dealingwith new crops.  We may ask the question: how much can new R&D increase theprofitability of well-established crop at the edge of their profit cycle?  Weclaim that such an effort can yield much more when new crops areinvestigated.
Unfortunately, in Israel as in most other countries, most agricultural R&Dis conducted with money raised as levies from sales.  Thus apple growers forexample, would like to see their money invested back into R&D on apples.The bigger the crop and the greater the body of knowledge about its biologicaland agricultural aspects, more R&D is applied.  As a result, money isallocated mainly to the "good old crops," while the new crops of the future areneglected.  A change in policy is needed to promote more research in thedirection of new crops.
NEW CROPS INITIATIVE
In the light of the dilemma discussed above, we initiated in 1984 an R&Dproject for the "Introduction and domestication of rare and wild fruit and nuttrees as new crops to the Israeli Negev Desert" (Nerd et al 1990; 1993).  Thisproject includes about 40 different fruit tree species (

 CROPS INITIATIVE
In the light of the dilemma discussed above, we initiated in 1984 an R&Dproject for the "Introduction and domestication of rare and wild fruit and nuttrees as new crops to the Israeli Negev Desert" (Nerd et al 1990; 1993).  Thisproject includes about 40 different fruit tree species (
Table 1
) from all overthe world that are considered to be potential new export crops.  For theproject, four sites were selected in the Negev Desert and one location in theJudean Desert, each site differing from the others in terms of climate, soil,and water (Nerd et al. 1990, 1993).  The first stage, which lasted about 10years, was devoted to assessing the survival, growth, phenology, yields, andquality of seedlings of the investigated species.  For all the species wepreferred to start with seedlings, which provide wide base of geneticbackgrounds, rather than to concentrate on a very narrow base of vegetativelypropagated preselected genotypes.  Many species did not survive, and others arestill at various stages of R&D, far away from any onsiderations of economicpotential.  Four types of fruit have already been moved to the second stage ofthis program, which will enable us to provide economic evaluation, such as thecost of various inputs per unit area and the output during the years up to thetime that the orchards will reach the full production stage.  In this secondstage of the project, vegetatively propagated specimens are also being testedin a cultivar trial.  The expected small quantities that will be produced atthis stage (20-30 t/year/crop) will also enable us to evaluate the marketingand find solutions to post-harvest problems.  The market figures will

 will reach the full production stage.  In this secondstage of the project, vegetatively propagated specimens are also being testedin a cultivar trial.  The expected small quantities that will be produced atthis stage (20-30 t/year/crop) will also enable us to evaluate the marketingand find solutions to post-harvest problems.  The market figures will enablefarmers to take decisions whether or not to enter into the arena of these newcrops.
The species that are currently in the second stage of the project include: (1)climbing trellised cacti growing in net houses--
Selenicereus megalanthus
and three species of
Hylocereus
; (2) the outdoor-grown cactus
Cereusperuvianus
, also known as apple cactus; (3) white sapote (
Casimiroaedulis
); and (4) Ber (
Ziziphus mauritiana
) also known as "desertapple," a species introduced from India.  Two more species are underconsideration for moving to the second R&D stage: (5) marula(
Sclerocarya birrea
subsp.
caffra
), for which 10 clones arecurrently being propagated and will be ready for planting next year, and (6)argan (
Argania spinosa
), a wild oil tree from Morocco, which will bepromoted to the second stage after the selection of the current fruiting year.
Crawling Cacti
These species which are native to Central and north South America, climb ontree trunks in the tropics and may be epiphytic (Gibson and Nobel 1986).  Theirfruits have various sizes, tastes, shapes, and colors.

Crawling Cacti
These species which are native to Central and north South America, climb ontree trunks in the tropics and may be epiphytic (Gibson and Nobel 1986).  Theirfruits have various sizes, tastes, shapes, and colors.  Some have spines thatabscise upon ripening and others have scales of various shapes and colors.  Thepulp also varies in color from white to various hues of red and purple, whilethe abundant seeds may be soft and edible (Mizrahi et al. 1996).  Thereproductive biology of these species is described in a review by Nerd andMizrahi (1996).  Five genotypes are already growing in an area of 2 ha, mainlyin net houses since they require shade (Nerd et al. 1990; Raveh et al. 1993;Mizrahi et al. 1996).  One clone of
Selenicereus megalanthus
, also knownas yellow pitaya, is being cultivated (Weiss et al. 1995).  Yellow pitaya isalready an established crop that is being exported worldwide from Colombia(Arcadio 1986; Cacioppo 1990; Mizrahi et al. 1996).  Other clones include oneof
Hylocereus polyrhizus
, one of
H. undatus
and two of
Hylocereus
sp. (Barbeau 1990), all our selections.  These clones havebeen planted in two plantations, each of 0.5 ha.  Each clone was planted in adifferent row to allow cross pollination from the neighboring rows (Weiss etal. 1994b).  All were planted in the late summer of 1993 as rooted cutt

Each clone was planted in adifferent row to allow cross pollination from the neighboring rows (Weiss etal. 1994b).  All were planted in the late summer of 1993 as rooted cuttingsremoved from the same mother plants, and all started to fruit in 1994.  Inthese plantations two net houses were planted, one with 50% shade in the Aravavalley, having a hot climate and saline water (EC 4 dS/m), and the other withboth 30% and 60% shade sections in the Besor area, which is characterized bygood quality water (EC 1 dS/m) and moderate temperatures with only rare frosts(Nerd et al. 1993).  The second hectare was planted in the Yad Mordekhay area,with sub-freezing temperatures as low as -4deg.C; here, plastic houses wereplanted to accommodate selected and non-selected plants.  All started to fruitone year after planting.
Cactus Apple
Of many columnar cacti tested by us as potential new crops, onespecies--
Cereus peruvianus
--grew the fastest.  It started to flower andfruit four years after seeding (Nerd et al. 1993; Weiss et al. 1993).  Rootedcuttings of seven clones of this cactus, selected  from over 300 seedlings,were planted in the Arava valley and the Besor, with a total area of 2 ha.  Allcuttings were planted as a mixture of clones, since this species demonstratesself-incompatibility (Weiss et al 1994a).  The reproductive biology of thiscactus

The reproductive biology of thiscactus is also described in the review of Nerd and Mizrahi (1996).  All clonesstarted to flower and fruit two years after planting.  Over 1,000 seedlingshave been planted for further selection.
White Sapote
White sapote (
Casimiroa edulis
, Rutaceae) is an evergreen medium-sizetree native to the highlands of Mexico and Central America.  The fruits aregreen-yellow, with a thin skin and a creamy white-yellow sweet flesh (Morton1987).  Selected clones are available, mainly in Southern California (Chambers1984; Morton 1987),  and some effort has been made to introduce the speciesinto New Zealand and Australia (Dawes and Martin 1988; George et al. 1988).  Asmall commercial plantation (16 hectares) with selected cultivars is beinggrown in Carpenteria near Santa Barbara, California and the fruits can be foundas an exotic item in the United States and Australia.  Early tests in theIsraeli Negev Desert demonstrated partial tolerance to salinity (Nerd et al.1992).  In autumn 1992 and spring of 1993, 21 grafted clones were planted inQetura and Besor; 16 were introduced as bud-wood from Fallbrook, SouthernCalifornia (from R.R. Chambers orchard), while the remaining five werepropagated as grafted bud-wood from our own selections.  Nine replications fromeach clone were planted in three blocks at each location.

In 1995 some clonesstarted to flower and set fruits in these two locations.
Desert Apple
Desert apple (
Ziziphus mauritiana
, Rahmnaceae), also known as ber orIndian jujube, is an evergreen, medium-size, thorny tree believed to be ofAfrican origin (Alexander, 1979).  The fruits can reach plum size, turningyellow from green as ripening starts, and becomes sweet and sour in taste, boththe flesh texture and taste being reminiscent of apples.  The fruit has aunique aroma, similar to that of carob, which becomes too strong for "Western"tasters when fully ripe, at which stage the color turns brown.  The fruit canbe consumed dry, similar to its relative the "Chinese date"
Z. jujube
.Ber is grown commercially as a desert crop (hence the name desert apple) inIndia.  Seedlings and introduced cultivars from India developed and yieldedvery well (over 100 kg/tree annually) in all our introduction orchards,including areas with frequent sub-freezing temperatures and highly saline water(Nerd et al. 1990).  Three Indian cultivars were planted at Neot Hakikar, thelowest point on earth -400 m below sea level with 3,960 mm evaporation/year andsaline water (EC 4 dS/m) with Na and Cl as the major ions (Nerd et al. 1993).

Three Indian cultivars were planted at Neot Hakikar, thelowest point on earth -400 m below sea level with 3,960 mm evaporation/year andsaline water (EC 4 dS/m) with Na and Cl as the major ions (Nerd et al. 1993).Most of our introduced fruit tree species did not survive under theseconditions, but ber has fruited heavily from very early ages.  Asemi-commercial plantation was planted by a farmer in 1993, and the first yieldwas sold in 1995 in the local market, mainly to immigrants from India who arefamiliar with the fruit.
Marula
Marula (
Sclerocarya birrea
subsp.
caffra
, Anacardiaceae) is alarge, dioecious, deciduous tree, which grows wild in southern Africa.  Femaletrees bear plum-sized fruits with a thick yellow peel and a translucent, white,highly aromatic sweet-sour fruit, which is eaten fresh, like a small mango, orused to prepare juices, jams, conserves, dry fruit rolls, and alcoholicbeverages.  The seeds, which are eaten as a delicate nut, are highlyappreciated by the locals and hence the name "the kings nut."  The nut has highnutritive value and a high oil content (56%) with very good dietetic ratio ofsaturated to unsaturated fatty acids (Weinert et al. 1990).  Trees wereestablished very well at introduction sites in the Negev Desert and producedabundant fruits from early ages, mainly when grown in a hot area with salinewater (Qetura) (Nerd and Mizrahi 1993).  Trees were badly damaged after a spellof

Trees wereestablished very well at introduction sites in the Negev Desert and producedabundant fruits from early ages, mainly when grown in a hot area with salinewater (Qetura) (Nerd and Mizrahi 1993).  Trees were badly damaged after a spellof sub-freezing temperatures of -6° and -7°C; all recovered but never setfruits, and thus this species is not recommended for areas with such lowtemperatures.  At Qetura, some pistillate trees are bearing well, over 400kg/tree annually, and we have moved the species to the second stage of ourR&D program to test selected clones on a semi-commercial basis.  Tenselected clones are being propagated and will be ready for planting in 1996.
Argan
Argan (
Argania spinosa
, also known as
A. sideroxylon
, Sapotaceae)is a medium, thorny, evergreen tree native to south western Morocco.  The treebears plum-sized fruits, which are eaten by goats which often climb the trees.The fruits have a bitter pericarp around a stone-like structure, containing oneto three kernels with a high oil content (over 50%).  The oil has high dieteticvalue, total unsaturated fatty acids/total saturated fatty acids being around4.5, a ratio similar to that of olive oil (Morton and Voss 1987; Prendergastand Walker 1992).  The oil has a unique aroma and is considered as the bestculinary oil by Moroccans, who are the only people familiar with the oil.

 similar to that of olive oil (Morton and Voss 1987; Prendergastand Walker 1992).  The oil has a unique aroma and is considered as the bestculinary oil by Moroccans, who are the only people familiar with the oil.  InIsrael, where 600,000 immigrants from Morocco reside, imported argan oil issold for US$43/liter in comparison with $4/liter for olive oil.  Attempts todomesticate this wild tree in Israel started about 10 years ago.  The speciesdemonstrated adaptability to the hot hostile environment of the Arava valleywhen irrigated with brackish water; yields of oil per tree at Qetura weredouble those at Ramat Negev, which has much milder environmental conditions(Nerd et al. 1994).  The oil yield of best specimens was around 1 kg/treeannually.  Some seedlings died as a result of infection with
Fusariumoxysporum
.  Until tolerant rootstocks can be found, we decided to plantgrafted trees from the best yielding ones and to plant additional seedlingsfrom various habitats in Morocco.  Even though this species is not in asadvanced stage of introduction as the marula, we consider it to be ahigh-priority species because of its rarity and the high demand in Israel forits oil.
CONCLUSIONS
It is interesting to note that in our earliest publication (Nerd et al. 1990),we mentioned six species as promising, an evaluation based on their earlydevelopment and growth.  These species included white sapote and ber, which arestill considered promising, and marula, which has been moved to the secondstage of the R&D, but they also include yehib (

),we mentioned six species as promising, an evaluation based on their earlydevelopment and growth.  These species included white sapote and ber, which arestill considered promising, and marula, which has been moved to the secondstage of the R&D, but they also include yehib (
Cordeauxia edulis
),mongongo (
Ricinodendron rautanenii
), and pitaya agria (
Stenocereusgummosus
), which did not meet our early optimistic expectations.  Thelatter three species proved to be late yielders (pitaya agria); or exhibitedsensitivity to the desert conditions of our introduction sites, such assalinity or sub-freezing temperatures; or were not as abundant in fruiting asthe promising species described in this presentation.  Other promising speciesemerged, such as
C. peruvianus
, with its adaptability to a spectrum ofconditions, including slight salinity and sub-freezing temperatures.  Thespecies produces early and heavily, giving good-quality, tasty fruits.  Themost surprising successes were the various crawling cacti (
Hylocereus
species
and
S. megalanthus
), which did not survive theoutdoor Negev Desert conditions (Nerd et al. 1990), but once trellised andprotected from high radiation by net houses, started yielding precociously andearly to give some of the most beautiful fruits on earth.
Of the six promising species from the first R&D stage, three were movedinto the second stage (white sapote, ber, and marula), while others, the applecactus and the crawling cacti, emerged as promising and already planted asvegetative clones (moved to second stage).  This evaluation was based

 of the most beautiful fruits on earth.
Of the six promising species from the first R&D stage, three were movedinto the second stage (white sapote, ber, and marula), while others, the applecactus and the crawling cacti, emerged as promising and already planted asvegetative clones (moved to second stage).  This evaluation was based onfruiting (both as yields and fruit quality) and early selection ofgood-performing specimens.
We anticipate that at least some of these newly introduced species will becomeexport items with profit levels that will be sufficiently high to revive thefruit export industry and replace the old "dying-out" export crops.  The highprofitability of new fruit crops was demonstrated for kiwi fruit by New Zealandin the world market and for avocado by Israel in the European market.  There isno reason why such new exotic fruits will not be the commodities of the future.We should not forget that no crop can stay at its peak forever, and low profitsalways loom in the future.  Mr. Dan Rymon (pers. commun.), found that it took17 years from the first sales of flower crops in the European markets untilIsrael was chased out by its competitors.  With fruit trees, it may be muchmuch longer, as was the case with the kiwi fruit from New Zealand (47 years)and the `Shamuti' (`Jaffa') orange from Israel (80 years).
We should conclude with an evaluation of the benefits of our program to theworld as a whole.  Any species that can produce good yields in the Aravavalley--the location of both Qetura and Neot Hakikar--can serve as a futurecrop species that can tolerate extremely high temperatures and salinity.Because of the unique situation in the Negev Desert

Any species that can produce good yields in the Aravavalley--the location of both Qetura and Neot Hakikar--can serve as a futurecrop species that can tolerate extremely high temperatures and salinity.Because of the unique situation in the Negev Desert of short distances betweenagriculturally different ecozones, we recommend that this area be used as aglobal laboratory for the introduction and acclimation of new desert crops.  In1994 the International Program for Arid Land Agricultural Crops (IPALAC) wasinitiated under the auspices of UNESCO.  This program is aimed at R&Dsimilar to that described in this paper, to be executed with all kinds ofagricultural crops in representative desert areas around the globe.

In stimulating articles, Noel Vietmeyer (1986, 1990) pointed out thatrelatively few plant species, most of which were domesticated thousands ofyears ago, serve as food for humans and animals, as medicinal plants, and asindustrial crops.  As a result of atmospheric CO
2
increase and global warming,dryer conditions are expected in the future and many existing crop species willunable to survive.  Many undeveloped and neglected species could be the newcrops of the future, which will tolerate these changing climatic conditions.Research and Development on the development of tolerant crops should beinitiated world wide to meet these challenges.  New crops should have thepotential to thrive in marginal, infertile, dry lands where common crops failto provide the diversification required to enable sustainable agriculturalsystems in the future and offer viable commercial opportunities.

) that isself sufficient in agricultural production.  The local market is tiny and issubject to dramatic fluctuations in supply and demand.  When extra few tonnesof fresh fruits and/or vegetables are dumped onto the local markets, pricesplummet and farmers cannot make a living.  In contrast the export market,mainly Europe, with hundreds of millions of consumers is unlimited from anIsraeli point of view.  Thus, Israel is basically an export oriented producer.At its peak, the export volume of fresh agriculture produce (mainly fruits,vegetables, and flowers) from Israel was valued around US$1 billion/year.  Inthe 1960s the fruit export industry (mainly citrus, with the famous `Jaffa'orange being the main product) constituted one of the main sources of foreigncurrency (out of a total export market of US$211 million agricultural producecomprised about US$64 million, i.e., 30.3% of the total!).  Today, Israel is anindustrial exporting country with total annual export value of US$14 billionwhile exports of agricultural fresh produce amount to US$547 million, a mere3.9% of the total (Statistical Abstracts 1994).  It is obvious that a smallcountry such as Israel has to compete in world markets in terms of qualityrather than quantity.  As a result, millions of R&D dollars have beeninvested in the past two decades to enable Israel to compete in the worldmarkets with the best possible products giving the highest possible return tothe growers.  Despite the huge input of R&D in the agricultural sector, theproduction of the citrus is diminishing (

 in the past two decades to enable Israel to compete in the worldmarkets with the best possible products giving the highest possible return tothe growers.  Despite the huge input of R&D in the agricultural sector, theproduction of the citrus is diminishing (
Fig. 1
) due to lack of profitability(
Fig. 2
) and farmers are complaining.  Citrus sales have diminished by 30.6%from 1990 to 1993 and profitability in terms of revenue's buying power hasdeclined to 57.3% when inflation is taken into account (Fig. 2; StatisticalAbstracts 1994; BDO 1995).  The Israeli tomato export industry has stagnated at8,000 t annually for the past few years, despite the enormous R&D effortsthat have produced the world's finest quality (Statistical Abstracts 1994).Israel has additional cost limitations on its competitiveness.  Water is amajor limiting factor and its actual price is very high (US$0.22 perm
3
) and the alternative price is even higher.  Labor is veryexpensive, since farmers are in the upper middle class strata.  More than 90%of the agricultural community in Israel is either a kibbutz (community farm) ora moshav (family farm) with minimum hired labor, where most of the work isperformed by the farm owners and their families.  Gross income below US$100 andeven 150 US$/day is considered very low.  Israel's competitors in the worldmarkets pay to agricultural workers 10% and less of this sum!  Finally, energyis expensive, since almost all the country's energy is imported.
These problems have led many experts in Israel to raise the possibility ofgiving up agricultural production, even for the local markets, and purchasingall the country's agricultural needs abroad, as do Singapore and Hong Kong.

These problems have led many experts in Israel to raise the possibility ofgiving up agricultural production, even for the local markets, and purchasingall the country's agricultural needs abroad, as do Singapore and Hong Kong.  Wesubscribe to a totally different approach.  We believe that supplying the newcrops niche in the world markets will serve as a remedy for the troubledIsraeli agricultural export industry.
PRODUCT PROFIT CYCLE
In a free market every product is  following the profit cycle, as described in
Fig. 3
.  When a totally new crop is first marketed, no profit is expected,since the market has yet to accustom itself to the product.  At this stage, lowprices are set to attract consumers.  In many cases, the market does notrespond to the new product, and it simply vanishes without being noticed bymost consumers.  But if the market likes the new product (perhaps as a resultof good marketing strategy), profits will rise as a result of increasing demandand improved production efficiency (Fletcher et al. 1995).  Maximumprofitability will be achieved by the first producer as long as he is the onlysuplier in the market.  Competition will then start, first with the mostefficient and aware producers and from many others.  As a result, profitabilitywill decline, and as with all common crops, it will fall to a maginal level.At this stage, only the big and efficient producers can survive.  It is thusevident that Israel cannot compete in the market for common crops.  A goodexample of the scenario described above is the "iceberg lettuce episode."  Inthe late 1970s, Marks and Spencer (

 decline, and as with all common crops, it will fall to a maginal level.At this stage, only the big and efficient producers can survive.  It is thusevident that Israel cannot compete in the market for common crops.  A goodexample of the scenario described above is the "iceberg lettuce episode."  Inthe late 1970s, Marks and Spencer (from the UK) approached the Negev R&DOrganization to test the feasibility of growing iceberg lettuce in the IsraeliNegev Desert for their chain.  Farmers in the Arava valley (Moshav Ein Yahavand Hatzeva) produced the best iceberg lettuce that Marks and Spencer had everreceived.  The company, which was ready to pay these farmes higher prices thanthose given their American counterparts in California, was mystified by therefusal of the Israeli farmers to accept the contract.  The buyers from Marks& Spencer simply did not understand that these farmers consisted of verysmall farms (4 ha!), expensive water, and very high energy, and labor costs.In no way, could they compete with the large American producers.
On the other hand, when we start with totally new product, the high profitsobtained for small quantities of exotic fruits and vegetables, creates anatural niche for Israeli farmers.  These farmers, being highly educated, caneasily adopt new crops and new technologies.  Israel is also blessed withresearch institutions and extension services capable of carrying an efficientR&D programs, which are essential for the introduction of new crops.  Inaddition, Israel has a single efficient marketing arm of agricultural products(AGREXCO), which can easily adapt to such programs.
Unfortunately, such a strategy has not yet been adopted by the Israeli R&Dauthorities.  The main objection to such R&D programs is the fact that the

D programs, which are essential for the introduction of new crops.  Inaddition, Israel has a single efficient marketing arm of agricultural products(AGREXCO), which can easily adapt to such programs.
Unfortunately, such a strategy has not yet been adopted by the Israeli R&Dauthorities.  The main objection to such R&D programs is the fact that themarket size and the prices of the new products are unknown.  Our feeling isthat such a niche does exist, and the only way to confirm its existence is totest it.  Even the return from R&D is expected to be higher when dealingwith new crops.  We may ask the question: how much can new R&D increase theprofitability of well-established crop at the edge of their profit cycle?  Weclaim that such an effort can yield much more when new crops areinvestigated.
Unfortunately, in Israel as in most other countries, most agricultural R&Dis conducted with money raised as levies from sales.  Thus apple growers forexample, would like to see their money invested back into R&D on apples.The bigger the crop and the greater the body of knowledge about its biologicaland agricultural aspects, more R&D is applied.  As a result, money isallocated mainly to the "good old crops," while the new crops of the future areneglected.  A change in policy is needed to promote more research in thedirection of new crops.
NEW CROPS INITIATIVE
In the light of the dilemma discussed above, we initiated in 1984 an R&Dproject for the "Introduction and domestication of rare and wild fruit and nuttrees as new crops to the Israeli Negev Desert" (Nerd et al 1990; 1993).  Thisproject includes about 40 different fruit tree species (
Table 1
)

 CROPS INITIATIVE
In the light of the dilemma discussed above, we initiated in 1984 an R&Dproject for the "Introduction and domestication of rare and wild fruit and nuttrees as new crops to the Israeli Negev Desert" (Nerd et al 1990; 1993).  Thisproject includes about 40 different fruit tree species (
Table 1
) from all overthe world that are considered to be potential new export crops.  For theproject, four sites were selected in the Negev Desert and one location in theJudean Desert, each site differing from the others in terms of climate, soil,and water (Nerd et al. 1990, 1993).  The first stage, which lasted about 10years, was devoted to assessing the survival, growth, phenology, yields, andquality of seedlings of the investigated species.  For all the species wepreferred to start with seedlings, which provide wide base of geneticbackgrounds, rather than to concentrate on a very narrow base of vegetativelypropagated preselected genotypes.  Many species did not survive, and others arestill at various stages of R&D, far away from any onsiderations of economicpotential.  Four types of fruit have already been moved to the second stage ofthis program, which will enable us to provide economic evaluation, such as thecost of various inputs per unit area and the output during the years up to thetime that the orchards will reach the full production stage.  In this secondstage of the project, vegetatively propagated specimens are also being testedin a cultivar trial.  The expected small quantities that will be produced atthis stage (20-30 t/year/crop) will also enable us to evaluate the marketingand find solutions to post-harvest problems.  The market figures will

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 will reach the full production stage.  In this secondstage of the project, vegetatively propagated specimens are also being testedin a cultivar trial.  The expected small quantities that will be produced atthis stage (20-30 t/year/crop) will also enable us to evaluate the marketingand find solutions to post-harvest problems.  The market figures will enablefarmers to take decisions whether or not to enter into the arena of these newcrops.
The species that are currently in the second stage of the project include: (1)climbing trellised cacti growing in net houses--
Selenicereus megalanthus
and three species of
Hylocereus
; (2) the outdoor-grown cactus
Cereusperuvianus
, also known as apple cactus; (3) white sapote (
Casimiroaedulis
); and (4) Ber (
Ziziphus mauritiana
) also known as "desertapple," a species introduced from India.  Two more species are underconsideration for moving to the second R&D stage: (5) marula(
Sclerocarya birrea
subsp.
caffra
), for which 10 clones arecurrently being propagated and will be ready for planting next year, and (6)argan (
Argania spinosa
), a wild oil tree from Morocco, which will bepromoted to the second stage after the selection of the current fruiting year.

Crawling Cacti
These species which are native to Central and north South America, climb ontree trunks in the tropics and may be epiphytic (Gibson and Nobel 1986).  Theirfruits have various sizes, tastes, shapes, and colors.  Some have spines thatabscise upon ripening and others have scales of various shapes and colors.  Thepulp also varies in color from white to various hues of red and purple, whilethe abundant seeds may be soft and edible (Mizrahi et al. 1996).  Thereproductive biology of these species is described in a review by Nerd andMizrahi (1996).  Five genotypes are already growing in an area of 2 ha, mainlyin net houses since they require shade (Nerd et al. 1990; Raveh et al. 1993;Mizrahi et al. 1996).  One clone of
Selenicereus megalanthus
, also knownas yellow pitaya, is being cultivated (Weiss et al. 1995).  Yellow pitaya isalready an established crop that is being exported worldwide from Colombia(Arcadio 1986; Cacioppo 1990; Mizrahi et al. 1996).  Other clones include oneof
Hylocereus polyrhizus
, one of
H. undatus
and two of
Hylocereus
sp. (Barbeau 1990), all our selections.  These clones havebeen planted in two plantations, each of 0.5 ha.  Each clone was planted in adifferent row to allow cross pollination from the neighboring rows (Weiss etal. 1994b).  All were planted in the late summer of 1993 as rooted cutt

Each clone was planted in adifferent row to allow cross pollination from the neighboring rows (Weiss etal. 1994b).  All were planted in the late summer of 1993 as rooted cuttingsremoved from the same mother plants, and all started to fruit in 1994.  Inthese plantations two net houses were planted, one with 50% shade in the Aravavalley, having a hot climate and saline water (EC 4 dS/m), and the other withboth 30% and 60% shade sections in the Besor area, which is characterized bygood quality water (EC 1 dS/m) and moderate temperatures with only rare frosts(Nerd et al. 1993).  The second hectare was planted in the Yad Mordekhay area,with sub-freezing temperatures as low as -4deg.C; here, plastic houses wereplanted to accommodate selected and non-selected plants.  All started to fruitone year after planting.
Cactus Apple
Of many columnar cacti tested by us as potential new crops, onespecies--
Cereus peruvianus
--grew the fastest.  It started to flower andfruit four years after seeding (Nerd et al. 1993; Weiss et al. 1993).  Rootedcuttings of seven clones of this cactus, selected  from over 300 seedlings,were planted in the Arava valley and the Besor, with a total area of 2 ha.  Allcuttings were planted as a mixture of clones, since this species demonstratesself-incompatibility (Weiss et al 1994a).  The reproductive biology of thiscactus

Allcuttings were planted as a mixture of clones, since this species demonstratesself-incompatibility (Weiss et al 1994a).  The reproductive biology of thiscactus is also described in the review of Nerd and Mizrahi (1996).  All clonesstarted to flower and fruit two years after planting.  Over 1,000 seedlingshave been planted for further selection.
White Sapote
White sapote (
Casimiroa edulis
, Rutaceae) is an evergreen medium-sizetree native to the highlands of Mexico and Central America.  The fruits aregreen-yellow, with a thin skin and a creamy white-yellow sweet flesh (Morton1987).  Selected clones are available, mainly in Southern California (Chambers1984; Morton 1987),  and some effort has been made to introduce the speciesinto New Zealand and Australia (Dawes and Martin 1988; George et al. 1988).  Asmall commercial plantation (16 hectares) with selected cultivars is beinggrown in Carpenteria near Santa Barbara, California and the fruits can be foundas an exotic item in the United States and Australia.  Early tests in theIsraeli Negev Desert demonstrated partial tolerance to salinity (Nerd et al.1992).  In autumn 1992 and spring of 1993, 21 grafted clones were planted inQetura and Besor; 16 were introduced as bud-wood from Fallbrook, SouthernCalifornia (from R.R. Chambers orchard), while the remaining five werepropagated as grafted bud-wood from our own selections.  Nine replications fromeach clone were planted in three blocks at each location.

In 1995 some clonesstarted to flower and set fruits in these two locations.
Desert Apple
Desert apple (
Ziziphus mauritiana
, Rahmnaceae), also known as ber orIndian jujube, is an evergreen, medium-size, thorny tree believed to be ofAfrican origin (Alexander, 1979).  The fruits can reach plum size, turningyellow from green as ripening starts, and becomes sweet and sour in taste, boththe flesh texture and taste being reminiscent of apples.  The fruit has aunique aroma, similar to that of carob, which becomes too strong for "Western"tasters when fully ripe, at which stage the color turns brown.  The fruit canbe consumed dry, similar to its relative the "Chinese date"
Z. jujube
.Ber is grown commercially as a desert crop (hence the name desert apple) inIndia.  Seedlings and introduced cultivars from India developed and yieldedvery well (over 100 kg/tree annually) in all our introduction orchards,including areas with frequent sub-freezing temperatures and highly saline water(Nerd et al. 1990).  Three Indian cultivars were planted at Neot Hakikar, thelowest point on earth -400 m below sea level with 3,960 mm evaporation/year andsaline water (EC 4 dS/m) with Na and Cl as the major ions (Nerd et al. 1993).

 temperatures and highly saline water(Nerd et al. 1990).  Three Indian cultivars were planted at Neot Hakikar, thelowest point on earth -400 m below sea level with 3,960 mm evaporation/year andsaline water (EC 4 dS/m) with Na and Cl as the major ions (Nerd et al. 1993).Most of our introduced fruit tree species did not survive under theseconditions, but ber has fruited heavily from very early ages.  Asemi-commercial plantation was planted by a farmer in 1993, and the first yieldwas sold in 1995 in the local market, mainly to immigrants from India who arefamiliar with the fruit.
Marula
Marula (
Sclerocarya birrea
subsp.
caffra
, Anacardiaceae) is alarge, dioecious, deciduous tree, which grows wild in southern Africa.  Femaletrees bear plum-sized fruits with a thick yellow peel and a translucent, white,highly aromatic sweet-sour fruit, which is eaten fresh, like a small mango, orused to prepare juices, jams, conserves, dry fruit rolls, and alcoholicbeverages.  The seeds, which are eaten as a delicate nut, are highlyappreciated by the locals and hence the name "the kings nut."  The nut has highnutritive value and a high oil content (56%) with very good dietetic ratio ofsaturated to unsaturated fatty acids (Weinert et al. 1990).  Trees wereestablished very well at introduction sites in the Negev Desert and producedabundant fruits from early ages, mainly when grown in a hot area with salinewater (Qetura) (Nerd and Mizrahi 1993).  Trees were badly damaged after a spellof

 ofsaturated to unsaturated fatty acids (Weinert et al. 1990).  Trees wereestablished very well at introduction sites in the Negev Desert and producedabundant fruits from early ages, mainly when grown in a hot area with salinewater (Qetura) (Nerd and Mizrahi 1993).  Trees were badly damaged after a spellof sub-freezing temperatures of -6° and -7°C; all recovered but never setfruits, and thus this species is not recommended for areas with such lowtemperatures.  At Qetura, some pistillate trees are bearing well, over 400kg/tree annually, and we have moved the species to the second stage of ourR&D program to test selected clones on a semi-commercial basis.  Tenselected clones are being propagated and will be ready for planting in 1996.
Argan
Argan (
Argania spinosa
, also known as
A. sideroxylon
, Sapotaceae)is a medium, thorny, evergreen tree native to south western Morocco.  The treebears plum-sized fruits, which are eaten by goats which often climb the trees.The fruits have a bitter pericarp around a stone-like structure, containing oneto three kernels with a high oil content (over 50%).  The oil has high dieteticvalue, total unsaturated fatty acids/total saturated fatty acids being around4.5, a ratio similar to that of olive oil (Morton and Voss 1987; Prendergastand Walker 1992).  The oil has a unique aroma and is considered as the bestculinary oil by Moroccans, who are the only people familiar with the oil.

 similar to that of olive oil (Morton and Voss 1987; Prendergastand Walker 1992).  The oil has a unique aroma and is considered as the bestculinary oil by Moroccans, who are the only people familiar with the oil.  InIsrael, where 600,000 immigrants from Morocco reside, imported argan oil issold for US$43/liter in comparison with $4/liter for olive oil.  Attempts todomesticate this wild tree in Israel started about 10 years ago.  The speciesdemonstrated adaptability to the hot hostile environment of the Arava valleywhen irrigated with brackish water; yields of oil per tree at Qetura weredouble those at Ramat Negev, which has much milder environmental conditions(Nerd et al. 1994).  The oil yield of best specimens was around 1 kg/treeannually.  Some seedlings died as a result of infection with
Fusariumoxysporum
.  Until tolerant rootstocks can be found, we decided to plantgrafted trees from the best yielding ones and to plant additional seedlingsfrom various habitats in Morocco.  Even though this species is not in asadvanced stage of introduction as the marula, we consider it to be ahigh-priority species because of its rarity and the high demand in Israel forits oil.
CONCLUSIONS
It is interesting to note that in our earliest publication (Nerd et al. 1990),we mentioned six species as promising, an evaluation based on their earlydevelopment and growth.  These species included white sapote and ber, which arestill considered promising, and marula, which has been moved to the secondstage of the R&D, but they also include yehib (

Cordeauxia edulis
),mongongo (
Ricinodendron rautanenii
), and pitaya agria (
Stenocereusgummosus
), which did not meet our early optimistic expectations.  Thelatter three species proved to be late yielders (pitaya agria); or exhibitedsensitivity to the desert conditions of our introduction sites, such assalinity or sub-freezing temperatures; or were not as abundant in fruiting asthe promising species described in this presentation.  Other promising speciesemerged, such as
C. peruvianus
, with its adaptability to a spectrum ofconditions, including slight salinity and sub-freezing temperatures.  Thespecies produces early and heavily, giving good-quality, tasty fruits.  Themost surprising successes were the various crawling cacti (
Hylocereus
species
and
S. megalanthus
), which did not survive theoutdoor Negev Desert conditions (Nerd et al. 1990), but once trellised andprotected from high radiation by net houses, started yielding precociously andearly to give some of the most beautiful fruits on earth.
Of the six promising species from the first R&D stage, three were movedinto the second stage (white sapote, ber, and marula), while others, the applecactus and the crawling cacti, emerged as promising and already planted asvegetative clones (moved to second stage).  This evaluation was based

 of the most beautiful fruits on earth.
Of the six promising species from the first R&D stage, three were movedinto the second stage (white sapote, ber, and marula), while others, the applecactus and the crawling cacti, emerged as promising and already planted asvegetative clones (moved to second stage).  This evaluation was based onfruiting (both as yields and fruit quality) and early selection ofgood-performing specimens.
We anticipate that at least some of these newly introduced species will becomeexport items with profit levels that will be sufficiently high to revive thefruit export industry and replace the old "dying-out" export crops.  The highprofitability of new fruit crops was demonstrated for kiwi fruit by New Zealandin the world market and for avocado by Israel in the European market.  There isno reason why such new exotic fruits will not be the commodities of the future.We should not forget that no crop can stay at its peak forever, and low profitsalways loom in the future.  Mr. Dan Rymon (pers. commun.), found that it took17 years from the first sales of flower crops in the European markets untilIsrael was chased out by its competitors.  With fruit trees, it may be muchmuch longer, as was the case with the kiwi fruit from New Zealand (47 years)and the `Shamuti' (`Jaffa') orange from Israel (80 years).
We should conclude with an evaluation of the benefits of our program to theworld as a whole.  Any species that can produce good yields in the Aravavalley--the location of both Qetura and Neot Hakikar--can serve as a futurecrop species that can tolerate extremely high temperatures and salinity.Because of the unique situation in the Negev Desert

Any species that can produce good yields in the Aravavalley--the location of both Qetura and Neot Hakikar--can serve as a futurecrop species that can tolerate extremely high temperatures and salinity.Because of the unique situation in the Negev Desert of short distances betweenagriculturally different ecozones, we recommend that this area be used as aglobal laboratory for the introduction and acclimation of new desert crops.  In1994 the International Program for Arid Land Agricultural Crops (IPALAC) wasinitiated under the auspices of UNESCO.  This program is aimed at R&Dsimilar to that described in this paper, to be executed with all kinds ofagricultural crops in representative desert areas around the globe.
