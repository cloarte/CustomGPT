1.  Reagent Name : Clostridium sordellii antitoxin 
 
2.  Strain or Source: Not applicable 
 
3.  Lot Number: IRP 501 (04) 
 
4.  Fill Date: August 5, 2004  
 
5.  Expiration Date : February 28, 2029 
 
6.  Intended Use: IRP 501 (04) serves as the standard antitoxin when conducting  
C. sordellii toxin neutralization tests in mice.  
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent.

.  Instructions for Use: C. sordellii antitoxin IRP 501 (04) contains 170 antitoxin units per 
mL (AU/mL). A dilution of standard antitoxin containing 1.0 AU/mL is used in the toxin 
neutralization test as described in title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.109. 
The dilution is prepared by adding 1.0 mL of well mixed IRP 501 (04) to 9.0 mL of peptone 
diluent (1.0% peptone, 0.25% sodium chloride, pH 7.2). The antitoxin is further diluted by 
adding 1.0 mL of the solution containing 17 au/mL

The dilution is prepared by adding 1.0 mL of well mixed IRP 501 (04) to 9.0 mL of peptone 
diluent (1.0% peptone, 0.25% sodium chloride, pH 7.2). The antitoxin is further diluted by 
adding 1.0 mL of the solution containing 17 au/mL to 16 mL of diluent. The antitoxin diluted 
1:10 is stable if stored at -70°C or lower. 
 
8.  Test of Reagent:   
Determination of antitoxin titer - The antitoxin titer of IRP 501 (04) was determined by injecting 
mice intravenously with 0.2 mL of diluted antitoxin mixed with 1.0 L+ dose of toxin (the 
smallest amount of toxin which, when mixed with 1.0 unit of antitoxin, causes death in at least 
80% of the animals within 72 hours) and 1.0 Lo dose of toxin (the largest amount of toxin which, 
when mixed with 1.0 unit of antitoxin, causes no deaths in animals within 72 hours). The 
antitoxin titer of IRP 501 (04) was confirmed by comparing the results of mice injected with 
toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing 1.0 mL of IRP 501 (04) possessing 1.0 unit of antitoxin to 
the results of mice injected with toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing 1.0 mL of C. sordellii 
International antitoxin possessing 1.0 unit of antitoxin.  
 
Sterility test – IRP 501 (04) was tested for sterility and found to be free of viable bacteria and 
fungi according to procedures outlined in 9 CFR 113.26.

13.  Method of Preparation: Young adult goats with no history of Clostridial vaccinations 
received multiple injections of C. sordellii toxoid and toxin during an 8-month period. Serum 
from the hyper-immunized goats was precipitated with ammonium sulfate; the precipitate 
resuspended in deionized water and dialyzed against 0.015 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 
pH 7.4. The dialyzate was passed through a sterile Millipore filtration unit containing a 0.22-µm 
membrane. Sterile glycerol was added to the antitoxin at a final concentration of 15% v/v. No 
preservative was added
