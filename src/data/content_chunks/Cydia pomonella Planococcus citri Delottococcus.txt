51 st Meeting of the Panel on Efficacy Evaluation of Fungicides and Insecticides Paris, 2022-11-22/24 The Panel continued its main task of developing Standards for conducting field trials to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and insecticides. Revised Standards The following Standards were revised and considered ready to be sent for country consultation: PP 1/007 Cydia pomonella PP 1/072 Planococcus citri, Delottococcus aberiae PP 1/122 Phytophthora nicotianae var . parasitica causing canker on citrus PP 1/131 Diaspididae scales on pome and stone fruits Panel members New Standards The following new Standard was discussed and considered ready to be sent for country consultation: ‘Grapevine mealybugs’. In addition, the new Standard ‘Evaluation of plant defence inducers against Grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma under protected conditions’ and a revision of the Standard PP 1/011 Lobesia botrana, Eupoecilia ambiguella and Cryptoblabes gnidiella were discussed. Following further work by experts after the Panel meeting, these Standards will be circulated to the Panel to decide whether they are ready for country consultation. Other topics The Panel discussed elements of the General Standards relevant for efficacy evaluation of fungicides and insecticides, namely impact of plant protection products on transformation processes, principles of efficacy and crop safety extrapolations for major uses and principles of efficacy evaluation for low-risk plant protection products. In the view of the Panel, some examples focused on efficacy of biological plant protection products may be helpful for the users of the Standard PP 1/296 Principles of efficacy evaluation for low-risk plant protection products. The Panel was updated concerning the status of the EPPO Database for extrapolation possibilities for minor uses and the activities of Minor Uses Coordination Facility were presented to the Panel.
