Overview
Asian nakedwood is a low shrub with climbing branches.  The climbing branches can reach to 30 ft. (9 m) in length.  Leaves are alternate, 1.5-5.5 in. (3.7-13.7 cm) long, shiny, toothed, broadly ovate and accuminate.  Flowers are small, greenish and bloom in clusters in the axils of the leaves.  Blooming occurs in the mid-summer, but can occur year-round.  Fruit are 0.5 in. (1.3 cm) long, berry-like capsules with small, gray seeds.  Seeds float and are salt-tolerant, thus enabling them to be dispersed by ocean currents.  Asian nakedwood occurs in full to partial sun on upland sites and was first collected in Florida in 1937.
