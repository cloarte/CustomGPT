Leaves simple, alternate, entire, exstipulate, with pinnate veins, often pellucid punctate, spirally or distichously arranged. Inflorescences axillary, paniculate, racemose, capitate, or cymose; flowers fascicled, in various racemose arrangements or clusters; bracts caducous; bracteoles inserted on pedicels or at base of perianth. Plants monoecious or dioecious. Flowers small, unisexual. Perianth gamophyllous; lobes (2 or)3-5, valvate. Stamens 2-40 (often 16-18 in China); filaments connate into a column (staminal column) or peltate disk (staminal disk), apex with anthers connivent or connate into disciform, globose, or elongate synandrium; anthers 2-locular, extrorse, dehiscing longitudinally, adnate to column abaxially, or free. Ovary superior, sessile, 1-locular, anatropous ovule 1, inserted near base; style short or lacking; stigma 2-lobed or lobes connate into a disk, with 2 fissures or with lacerate margin.
