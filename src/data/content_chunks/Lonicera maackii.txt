Overview
Appearance
Lonicera maackii
is a woody perennial shrub that can grow up to 16.5 ft. (5 m) in height.
Foliage
The oppositely arranged leaves are ovate to lance-ovate in shape and measure 1.3-3.3 in. (3.5-8.5 cm) long. The tips of the leaves are acuminate. The leaves are dark green above and lighter on the lower surface. The veins of the leaves are pubescent.
Flowers
The white flowers are found in erect pairs that are on peduncles shorter than the petioles. The flowers measure 0.6-0.75 in. (1.5-2 cm) long and are bilabiate. The flowers appear on the plant from late May to early June, which is later than the other honeysuckles.
Fruit
The fruit are dark red in color, spherical in shape and measure 0.25 in. (6 mm) in diameter. The fruit become ripe on the plant in the late fall.
Ecological Threat
Lonicera maackii
can form large stands that prevent native shrubs and herbaceous understory plants from growing. The fruits persist on the branches into the winter, when birds feed on them. In the spring,
Lonicera maackii
is one of the first plants to leaf out, giving it a competitive advantage. This shrub can bear fruit when it is as young as 3 to 5 years old. Though
Lonicera maackii
has not yet become a major problem in New England, it is very troublesome in the southern and midwestern parts of the country.
