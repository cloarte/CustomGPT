Roughstalk bluegrass
Gramineae, Poaceae
Poa trivialis

Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This bluegrass generally resembles
Kentucky blue
but differs in that itdoes not have rhizomes. It is native to Europe and is more important there asa pasture grass than in this country. It is used in thiscountry for pasture on wet soils and for lawns in shaded areas. It is notadapted to droughty conditions. Although highly palatable, its restricted areasof adaptation Iimit its general agricultural importance.
