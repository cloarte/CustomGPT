Hymenophyllum tunbrigense(L.) Smith - Tunbridge Filmy Fern  -Hymenophyllaceae© Graham Day© John Wilde© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This rare fern is a small plant, similar to its commoner relative, Wilson's Filmy-fern. Both superficially resemble tufts of moss, and grow in deep shade in humid conditions. It can be separated from Wilson's Filmy-fern by several features, of which the easiest to see is the fact that theindusiumis toothed (untoothed in Wilson's Filmy-fern). Theindusiumis the two-lipped structure covering the sporangium which are produced at the ends of the lobes of the leaves. Most Northern Ireland sites for this fern are in Co. Fermanagh.All names:Hymenophyllum tunbrigense(L.)
