 and ca. 230 species: widespread in temperate and tropical areas; eight genera (one endemic) and 46 species (23 endemic) in China.Recent research strongly suggests that the subfamily Celtidoideae (Aphananthe,Celtis,Gironniera,Pteroceltis, andTrema) is not the closest relative of the subfamily Ulmoideae (Hemiptelea,Ulmus, andZelkova). It would probably be more accurate to exclude Celtidoideae from Ulmaceae, and move it to Cannabaceae, rather than treating it as a separate family, Celtidaceae. More data are needed before a stable, new classification of the Urticales can be produced. Until these data are available, it is more practical to retain the traditional circumscription of Ulmaceae.Most species of this family yield fine timber, the cortex is a good substitute for hemp, the fruit are edible, and the seed oil is used medicinally and industrially. Many species of Ulmaceae are cultivated, and it is not always certain whether specimens are from wild or cultivated plants.Fu Likuo, Chen Chiajui & Tang Yancheng. 1998.
