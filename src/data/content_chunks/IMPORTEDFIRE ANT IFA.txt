IMPORTEDFIRE ANT (IFA)
Adult
Blisters from IFA 
stings covering a 
victim’s arm
IFAs crawling on wood
Reddish-brown 
or black color
Highly aggressive 
when disturbed
One-eighth to one-quarter 
of an inch long
THE HARM IT CAUSES
IFAs will feed on the buds and fruits of numerous crop 
plants, especially corn, soybean, okra, and citrus.  They 
can also girdle young trees.  Large nests located in 
fields interfere with and damage equipment during 
cultivation and harvesting.  IFAs respond rapidly and 
aggressively to disturbances, and ant attacks inhibit 
field-worker activities.  A single fire ant can sting its 
target repeatedly; young and newborn animals are 
especially susceptible to the stings’ venom.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
•  Find out if you’re in an IFA quarantine area.  Visit 
www.aphis.usda.gov, type "zip code" into the search 
box, and click the "Go" button.
•  Know the restrictions on baled hay, soil, plants, soil-
moving equipment, and other items moving out of IFA 
quarantine areas.  Visit www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_
health/plant_pest_info/fireants for this information.
• Report any sightings of this pest to your local Extension

WHAT TO LOOK FOR
•  Ants that are one-eighth to  
one-quarter of an inch long  
and reddish-brown or black
•  Ants that respond rapidly and 
aggressively when disturbed 
(they clamp onto their victims 
with powerful jaws and sting 
repeatedly while injecting  
painful venom)
•  Hard, mound-shaped nests that can get quite large, 
posing risks to field workers and farm equipment
