Issue 3-Policy Considerations for 
Different Product Types 
 
 
Product--Specific 
Considerations, e.g. Viral Vaccines 
(live, killed, vectored), Bacterins, 
Bacterial Extracts, Toxoids

What is this issue about? 
Should the potency requirements of different 
veterinary biologicals (vaccines and 
therapeutics) be treated the same or 
different based on: 
Category 
Virus or bacterial or parasite 
Live or inactivated 
Toxoids 
Recombinant 
Immunomodulator 
Is it this simple? 
Some factors to consider 
 Species treated 
 Production animal (bovine, porcine, poultry, minor species) 
 Companion animal (canine, feline, equine) 
 Adjuvanted vs none 
 Type of adjuvant 
 Single fraction vs multi-fraction  
 Purpose–Herd immunity versus individual protection 
 Disease agent (e.g. Canine Coronavirus vs Rabies) 
Is it this simple? 
Study design (Experimental clinical vs Field 
efficacy) 
Representative of the disease transmission in the 
field vs artificial but convenient 
Number of animals 
Effectiveness of challenge strain 
Route of challenge 
Primary outcome 
Case definition

What is the Typical Study 
Design? 
Pivotal efficacy studies are conducted with small numbers of 
animals using firm devised/CVB reviewed protocols or the 9CFR 
Standard Requirements.  
Typically 20 treated and 20 controls  
Experimental clinical study 
Usually no dose titrations 
Naïve animals, at youngest age 
Sometimes immunocompromised 
CD/CD 
Steroids 
Challenge/route procedure varies 
Natural vs Convenient 
What is the typical efficacy serial 
and How is it tested? 
Production serial or bench-top in 
R&D or in process development 
One serial or one of many, 
evaluated for potency in a validated 
or un-validated assay 
Maybe the result of a series of 
proof-of-concept studies or not 
Is it this simple? Probably not! 
Current release and throughout dating 
specifications 
Quantal assays e.g. titrations of live virus 
products are set at ≈16X’s (+1.2log10) the 
efficacy serial  and must maintain ≈5X’s 
(+0.7log10) is required throughout dating.

Quantitative counts e.g. live bacteria must 
maintain 2x the CFU of the efficacy serial 
throughout the dating of the product  
Inactivated products the efficacy, release, 
and throughout dating are traditionally the 
same. 
Why are they treated differently?

the light of truth. (Cicero)

The reason for revisiting our potency 
policy and evaluation of stability 
monitoring and the rationale for setting 
expiration dates 
A long term process  
CVB is in the early stages  
Should there be Product-Specific 
considerations for setting release and 
throughout dating potency specifications? 
 Perhaps certain categories could be established based on 
product type, according to some rational criteria. 
 But note that the divisions are complex because of the 
diversity of the products

How do you bring consistency to the 
situation? 
Regardless of possible divisions a common starting point 
is essential: 
 Validated potency assays…… regardless  of the product. 
 Take into account the variation in the potency assay, 
manufacturing process, the vial-to-vial variation and 
the product stability………. regardless of the type of 
product. 
 This is essentially what is proposed by the VSM Draft 
DOC No. 440. 
 A science based approach in line with the plan initiated 
in 2004 as part of CVB’s long term comprehensive 
approach to potency testing.
