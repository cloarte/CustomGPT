 Invasion: A. rufinerveis a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 10-15(-20) m. The mature bark is grey-green with narrow grey-white longitudinal stripes. On older specimens the stripes are intersected by diamond-shaped beige patches. Branches are green and new shoots are glaucous, with a bluish-grey bloom. Leaves are opposite, 8–15 cm long and wide, with either 3 or 5 shallow lobes. Where there are 5 lobes the lower ones are small and indistinct, whereas the main lateral lobes are large, forward pointing and acuminate. The terminal lobe is slightly larger than the main lateral lobes and also acuminate. Leaf bases are weakly rounded to shallowly cordate, the leaf margin is irregularly double-serrate and petioles are (2-)5(-6) cm long. The underside of the leaf is paler than the dark green upper side. Leaf veins are impressed on the upper side, and on the lower side covered with brown to rust-coloured

 and also acuminate. Leaf bases are weakly rounded to shallowly cordate, the leaf margin is irregularly double-serrate and petioles are (2-)5(-6) cm long. The underside of the leaf is paler than the dark green upper side. Leaf veins are impressed on the upper side, and on the lower side covered with brown to rust-coloured hairs, particularly in the axils of the veins, though these disappear with age. Flowering occurs in April and May either at the same time or after leaf emergence. Flowers are in terminal, 5-10 cm racemes with 10-20 flowers. Sexual expression is complex, with some trees changing sex with age, so that in a given population dioecious and monoecious trees can be found. The 5 petals and 5 sepals are pale lime green, held on a short 1-5 mm pedicel. Male flowers have 8 stamens, shorter than the petals and sepals. Samaras are 2-3 cm long with wings spreading at angles of 70-120° (Yamazaki et al., 1993; vanGelderen et al., 1994;Ushimaru and Matsui, 2001;Nanami et al., 2004).

 Reproduccion: The chromosome number for A. rufinerve is 2n = 26 ( Gelderen et al., 1994 ). As in other striped maples like A. pensylvanicum ( Hibbs and Fischer, 1979 ), A. rufinerve is known to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively and to change sex according to growth conditions and plant health ( Matsui, 1995 ; Nanami et al., 2004 ). Flowering starts in April-May, synchronously with leaf emergence. An inflorescence consists of a raceme with approximately 15 flowers. Pollen is dispersed by small bees and dipterans. Samaras ripen in autumn and are dispersed by wind. Three types of sex expression are observed: male, female and bisexual. Sex expression is associated with tree growth rate and mortality; the growth rate was observed to decrease for trees whose sex changed from male to female or bisexual, and increase for trees whose sex changed from female to male or bisexual. Trees usually reproduced as females before they died ( Nanami et al., 2004 ). In Belgium, as in its native range, seed production is usually very high, higher than in other Acer species, and can start early, even on small-sized trees ( Tanaka, 1995 ; Etienne Branquart, pers. obs.). A. rufinerve forms a short-term persistent seed bank, with a dynamic characterized by a rather opportunistic germination pattern, with part of the seed cohort germinating in the first spring and the rest remaining dormant until the next spring. Germination rate of older seeds is very low ( Tanaka, 1995 ; Frisson et al., 2010 ; Verzele, 2010 ). Layering and basal sprouting are other means of increasing population size in this species, especially in light suppression conditions. It readily resprouts from stumps after cutting or death of the main stem ( Sakai, 1987 ; Hiroshi Tanaka, pers. obs.). A. rufinerve

Layering and basal sprouting are other means of increasing population size in this species, especially in light suppression conditions. It readily resprouts from stumps after cutting or death of the main stem ( Sakai, 1987 ; Hiroshi Tanaka, pers. obs.). A. rufinerve is highly adaptable to different environments and light conditions. Plant energy is preferably invested in long shoots, creating large extension growth. Radial growth rate is also very high compared to other Acer species. It has indeterminate growth, enabling suppressed seedlings and saplings to start rapid growth in response to gap formation. When young, growth rate is higher than in most other tree species, both in its native and introduced ranges. It is a rather short-lived species < 100 years) compared to other trees ( Sakai, 1987 ; Etienne Branquart, unpubl. data). A. rufinerve is an early successional species which occupies open habitats, such as forest edge and secondary forest, and diminishes in number as succession proceeds ( Matsui, 1995 ). In its native range, recruitment is rather low in spite of strong seed production and is limited by pre- and post-dispersal seed mortality due to predation by larvae of the weevil Bradybatus limbatus and wood mice, respectively ( Tanaka, 1995 ). However, observed pre-dispersal seed predation rate is very low in Belgium and seedling density may exceed 100 seedlings/m 2 in the vicinity of mother trees, which leads to the hypothesis that it may benefit from enemy release in its introduced range ( Verzele, 2010 ; Etienne Branquart, unpubl. data). In Bon-Secours forest near Mons in western Belgium, where it has colonized over 60 ha, A. rufinerve has been observed to prefer oak ( Quercus

In Bon-Secours forest near Mons in western Belgium, where it has colonized over 60 ha, A. rufinerve has been observed to prefer oak ( Quercus ) over beech ( Fagus ) dominated stands and is often found together with Carpinus betulus and Prunus serotina. Bramble ( Rubus fruticosus ) often co-occurs with it, sometimes at high densities ( Rafalowicz et al., 2009 ). In its native range A. rufinerve is highly plastic and does not display any strong preference for soil or water conditions. It benefits from clear-cutting and readily re-sprouts from stumps (Hiroshi Tanaka, unpubl. data). In Belgium it is invasive in broadleaved forest dominated by light-demanding tree species like Quercus robur growing on moist brown acidic to podzolic soils, although it tends to avoid the most dry and acidic (pH < 4.0) soils. Natural regeneration and invasiveness appear to be much lower under neutral pH soil conditions. A. rufinerve is often found in or near small forest openings and avoids dense canopies dominated by beech trees ( Rafalowicz et al., 2009 ; Branquart et al, 2011).
