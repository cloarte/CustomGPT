Overview
Appearance
Eichhornia azurea
is a rooted perennial aquatic plant. It has long stems which grow to reach the surface of the water. It is native to parts of Central and South America.
Foliage
Leaves are alternate along the stem. Submersed leaves are sessile while emersed leaves are petiolate. The petiole is never inflated as with
Eichhornia crassipes
.
Flowers
Flowers are held on erect stems above the surface of the water. There can be from 7 to as many as 50 flowers per stem. Each flower blooms for only a day. Flowering can occur from summer through fall.
Fruit
Each flower can produce 10 to 13 small winged seeds.
Ecological Threat
Eichhornia azurea
grows rapidly and can very quickly form expansive mats of floating plants, completely covering even large lakes. This complete coverage of the surface of the water blocks sunlight and depletes the oxygen available to the rest of the aquatic community. It can make the body of water uninhabitable by other aquatic organisms.
Eichhornia azurea
is listed as a noxious weed in the United States. It has only been reported in Florida.
