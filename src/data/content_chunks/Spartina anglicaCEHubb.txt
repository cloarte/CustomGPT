Spartina anglicaC.E.Hubb - Common Cord-grass  -Gramineae / Poaceae© Graham Day© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)WhenSpartinaxalterniflora(an American introduction) hybridized with the native EnglishS. maritimait produced a sterile hybrid calledSpartinaxtownsendii(Townsend's cord-grass). As often happens, some individuals spontaneously doubled their chromosome number to produce a fully fertile plant calledSpartina anglicawhich can reproduce and spread by seed. It is possible that this species has originated in many places fromSpartinaxtownsendiiat different times.It was introduced for mud-binding purposes into Belfast Lough and Strangford Lough. It became extinct in Belfast Lough, but is now abundant in Strangford Lough, and has more recently spread into Dundrum Inner Bay and Carlingford Lough. Some of the cord-grass in Lough Foyle is also this species, perhaps derived locally fromSpartinaxtownsendii.The plant is very vigorous and has had a "bad press" from ecologists and conservationists who regard it as a threat to eel-grass beds, which are an important food to migrating brent geese. However, recent research in the Irish Republic has shown that the colonies of this grass can support an unusually rich and diverse marine fauna.All names:Spartina anglicaC.E.Hubb;Spartina x townsendiiauct. non Groves & J.GrovesNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
