 Invasion: T. officinale complex is an almost stemless, lactiferous, perennial herb. The stems are acaulescent, only 1-2.5 cm in length, with extremely short internodes at or below the soil surface (Gier and Burress, 1942;Holm et al., 1997). The leaves form a basal, radial rosette in which every sixth leaf overlaps (Holm et al., 1997). The leaves are highly variable in shape, colour and indumentum; they show developmental and seasonal

 1-2.5 cm in length, with extremely short internodes at or below the soil surface (Gier and Burress, 1942;Holm et al., 1997). The leaves form a basal, radial rosette in which every sixth leaf overlaps (Holm et al., 1997). The leaves are highly variable in shape, colour and indumentum; they show developmental and seasonal heteroblasty; and they are morphologically very responsive to shade, nutrition, moisture, exposure and grazing. In shape, they range from lobeless to toothed edges to highly incised and, when lobed, the lobes point to the leaf base. The runcinate-pinnatifid or lobed oblanceolate leaves have glabrous to sparsely pubescent lower surfaces, are generally 5-40 cm in length and 0.7-15 cm in width, and taper to a winged, petiolar base (Gleason, 1963;Holm et al., 1997). The prominent midrib of the leaves ranges in colour from pale yellow-green to deep red-brown (LL Collins, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, unpublished data). The thick, branched taproot can be up to 2-3 cm in diameter and grow up to 1-2 m in length (vonHofsten, 1954;Solbrig, 1971). The lateral roots are arranged in two rows that wind clockwise downward in a loose spiral around the root and are distributed more or less regularly along its length (Gier and Burress, 1942).The basal rosette gives rise to one to numerous, erect to decumbent, simple, glabrous, hollow, cylindrical scapes (peduncles), 5-50 cm tall, decreasing in diameter along their length from base to tip. Each scape bears a terminal capitulum (inflorescence) of 2-5 cm diameter (Gier and

ress, 1942).The basal rosette gives rise to one to numerous, erect to decumbent, simple, glabrous, hollow, cylindrical scapes (peduncles), 5-50 cm tall, decreasing in diameter along their length from base to tip. Each scape bears a terminal capitulum (inflorescence) of 2-5 cm diameter (Gier and Burress, 1942; Gleason, 1963;Holm et al., 1997). Each capitulum is subtended by an oval-cylindrical involucre with lanceolate-obtuse, green to brownish, herbaceous bracts, in two rows of phyllaries, with the outer phyllaries shorter and wider than the inner phyllaries (Holm et al., 1997). The inner phyllaries are of uniform length and one-serrate, while the outer ones are unequal, one-third to one-half as long as the inner bracts and many-serrate. All bracts are reflexed at maturity, with a convex, minutely pitted receptacle, without paleae (Holm et al., 1997).The capitulum is composed of up to 250 ligulate, perfect, yellow florets (Holm et al., 1997), which usually have coloured stripes below. Each floret has a corolla of five united petals with one side prolonged, strap-shaped, and five-notched at the tip. Each floret contains five stamens fused into a tube with a sagittate base, filiform basal lobes and an obtuse apex (Holm et al., 1997). The warty spherical pollen grains are 30 µm in diameter (Gier and Burress, 1942). In each floret, the inferior ovary contains one basal, inverted ovule with a single integument. A single style branches into two stigmatic arms, which are 1-1.5

, filiform basal lobes and an obtuse apex (Holm et al., 1997). The warty spherical pollen grains are 30 µm in diameter (Gier and Burress, 1942). In each floret, the inferior ovary contains one basal, inverted ovule with a single integument. A single style branches into two stigmatic arms, which are 1-1.5 mm in length and 0.06 mm in diameter, and covered with fine hairs (Gier and Burress, 1942;Sood and Sood, 1992;Holm et al., 1997). Each ovule gives rise to a pale grey-brown to olive-brown, narrowly obovoid-oblong, rough-surfaced cypsela (seed), 3-4 mm in length and 1 mm width. Each cypsela is 5-8 ribbed on each side with upwardly pointed teeth at the beaked apex and with a white pappus composed of numerous hairs, 3-4 mm in length, mostly white, persistent and fused at the base, for efficient wind dispersal (Gleason, 1963;Holm et al., 1997). Thus, each capitulum resembles a 'puffball' or 'clock' when mature.All parts of the plant when broken yield a whitish milky latex that dries to a blackish substance. The latex from another Taraxacum species has been used as a rubber substitute (Krotov, 1945).The genus Taraxacum is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: leaves all basal; scapes simple, hollow; inflorescences with yellow ligulate florets subtended by two rows of involucral bracts. In the remainder of this datasheet, for the sake of simplicity, the following terms will be used: scape to describe a peduncle, inflorescence to describe a capitulum and seed to describe a cypsela.Phenotypic

In the remainder of this datasheet, for the sake of simplicity, the following terms will be used: scape to describe a peduncle, inflorescence to describe a capitulum and seed to describe a cypsela.Phenotypic variability in T. officinale complex increases its ability to colonize a wide range of habitats. In cool or dry weather, or in closely-mown lawns, the leaves usually spread flat against the surface of the ground to form an almost prostrate rosette (Longyear, 1918;Lovell and Rowan, 1991). In warmer weather or in areas where it is crowded by taller vegetation, the leaves stand in more or less erect tufts (Longyear, 1918). The rosette enables it to survive mowing, grazing and competition with grasses (Baker, 1974). The possession of toothed leaves, which resemble those of thistles, and the bitter white latex, are thought to be adaptations to deter grazing animals (Richardson, 1985).T. officinale complex displays a wide range of leaf shapes, from a smooth rounded (juvenile) form to a deeply incised runcinate (adult) form (Sánchez, 1971). The length:breadth ratio decreases as the leaf number increases (Sánchez, 1971) and the ratio and depth of incisions in the runcinate form are influenced by light, mediated by the phytochrome system (Wassink, 1965;Sánchez, 1967). Therefore, leaf shape can be regulated by light intensity and quality, with rounded blades developing at low light energy values and runcinate blades developing at high light energy values (Sánchez, 1967;Slabnik, 1981). An increase in light intensity increases the degree of

 light, mediated by the phytochrome system (Wassink, 1965;Sánchez, 1967). Therefore, leaf shape can be regulated by light intensity and quality, with rounded blades developing at low light energy values and runcinate blades developing at high light energy values (Sánchez, 1967;Slabnik, 1981). An increase in light intensity increases the degree of lobing and decreases the length:breadth ratio (Slabnik, 1981).The complex possesses a deep tap root that can extend below the level of competing grass roots (Loomis, 1938), and make it difficult to remove plants manually (Lovell and Rowan, 1991). The root system can be widely-branched and surmounted by a crown, which can divide to form numerous (up to 22) crown branches, depending on the degree of crowding by other plants and plant age (Roberts, 1936). The roots are also highly regenerative, capable of producing shoots and roots within 1-2 weeks from very small segments (Longyear, 1918;Warmke and Warmke, 1950;Mann and Cavers, 1979). When cut off below the crown, the root usually produces several new shoots so that a cluster of new plants is formed (Longyear, 1918). At the end of the growing season, the root shortens and draws the crown slightly into the soil, where it is better protected from adverse conditions (Longyear, 1918). The ease of regeneration is reportedly related to the ability of the parenchymatous cells of the secondary phloem and xylem in the root to readily dedifferentiate and develop into new shoots and roots (Higashimura, 1986).During the development of the inflorescence, the growth rate and georesponse of the scape varies (Clifford and Oxlade, 1989). The scape elongates to bloom, then bends down close to the ground while the seeds mature,

loem and xylem in the root to readily dedifferentiate and develop into new shoots and roots (Higashimura, 1986).During the development of the inflorescence, the growth rate and georesponse of the scape varies (Clifford and Oxlade, 1989). The scape elongates to bloom, then bends down close to the ground while the seeds mature, where it can escape injury from lawnmowers or grazers (Longyear, 1918;Richardson, 1985). When seeds are nearly mature, the scape elongates again up to 75 cm, maximizing its height for effective dispersal of the wind-blown seeds (Longyear, 1918;Jackson, 1982;Richardson, 1985). Therefore, the scape grows upright (negatively orthgeotropic) when extension growth is rapid, as it is prior to flowering and during formation of the capitulum (Oxlade and Clifford, 1981). However, between these stages, when extension growth is minimal and the inflorescence is closed, the scape can grow parallel to the ground (diageotropic) for some or most of its length (Oxlade and Clifford, 1981). The outer tissue layers of T. officinale complex scapes are held in a state of longitudinal tension by internal stem tissues, which are held in a reciprocal state of compression (Niklas and Paolillo, 1998).Fasciation has been recorded in T. officinale complex in two forms, confined to the reproductive tissues of the plant (Dekker and Dekker, 1987). In plants with multiple scapes, the central scapes can be fused together to form one broad (1-2 cm) scape; or inflorescences (2-4) can be fused at their base to form a longitudinal floral structure (Dekker and Dekker, 1987).

 Reproduccion: GeneticsT. officinale complex ranges in ploidy level from diploid to hexaploid (x=8), possessing 16 to 48 individual chromosomes ( Richards, 1973 ). North American individuals of this complex are generally triploid (x=8, 3x=24), and sexual reproduction is rare or may even be absent ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Lyman and Ellstrand, 1984 ). With more than 2000 reported micro-species of this genus in Europe, approximately 90% are polyploids that reproduce asexually by obligate agamospermy (apomixis). The majority of the remaining 10% are diploid species that reproduce sexually and are obligate outcrossers. However, a small number of more primitive forms are capable of self-fertilization ( Hughes and Richards, 1985 ). In T. officinale apomicts, almost every floret automatically produces a seed which is genetically identical to the mother so that mother-daughter lines form 'seed clones' ( Richards, 1973 ; Hughes and Richards, 1988 ; Richards, 1996 ), also known as 'biotypes', which are usually given specific status (for example

-fertilization ( Hughes and Richards, 1985 ). In T. officinale apomicts, almost every floret automatically produces a seed which is genetically identical to the mother so that mother-daughter lines form 'seed clones' ( Richards, 1973 ; Hughes and Richards, 1988 ; Richards, 1996 ), also known as 'biotypes', which are usually given specific status (for example, Dudman and Richards, 1997 ).As Taraxacum species exhibit extremely variable biology and morphology, the genus is treated as many micro-species in Europe, as previously mentioned; however, it is treated as one species exhibiting considerable phenotypic plasticity in North America ( Richards, 1973 ). This extensive variation may be somewhat unexpected since North American populations are generally considered to be apomictic and so do not exchange genes ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Taylor, 1987 ). There are differences of opinion regarding the extent to which the observed variation is due to phenotypic plasticity versus genotypic differentiation arising from multiple introductions of European microspecies ( Taylor, 1987 ). Janzen (1977) suggested that there is very little genetic variation among populations, while Abbott (1979) argued that this assumption is premature. Taylor (1987) stated that intra-populational morphological variation was as great as or greater than inter-populational variation and, therefore, morphological variation was largely due to phenotypic plasticity. However, Kennison (1978) found that in populations from Washington State, variation among populations was consistently greater than variation within populations. Ford (1981a) observed that agamospecies growing in particular habitats differed from site to site in characters such as population flux, survivorship and fecundity. Furthermore, agamospecies represent ecologically highly specialized population units, relevant to a fine scale of heterogeneity of habitat, and two or more agamospecies can coexist in a broad habitat ( Ford 1981b , 1985).

Furthermore, agamospecies represent ecologically highly specialized population units, relevant to a fine scale of heterogeneity of habitat, and two or more agamospecies can coexist in a broad habitat ( Ford 1981b , 1985). Small and Catling (1999) provide an excellent summary of variation in this complex in Canada. King (1993) used restriction enzyme analysis of ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA to assess the relative contribution of hybridization and mutation as sources of genotypic variation in dandelions of North America. She found that multiple hybridization events in populations (prior to their introduction to North America) were a more important source of genotypic variation than mutation in populations.Although sexual reproduction is rare ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ), natural hybrids have been reported to occur between T. officinale complex and T. platycarpum in Japan ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ). More than 90% of the plants classified as T. officinale complex had alleles introduced from T. platycarpum and were morphologically intermediate between the two species with respect to the number of marginal hairs in the outer involucral bract, the length of corniculate appendages on the outer involucral bract, and the size of the seed ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ).Physiology and PhenologyT. officinale complex leaves are rich in fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A and C, the B vitamins thiamine and riboflavin, and protein ( Schmidt, 1979 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Gail, 1994 ). Gail (1994) reported that they are also nature's richest vegetable source of beta-carotene at 0.84 mg/g tissue compared to carrots

 are rich in fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A and C, the B vitamins thiamine and riboflavin, and protein ( Schmidt, 1979 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Gail, 1994 ). Gail (1994) reported that they are also nature's richest vegetable source of beta-carotene at 0.84 mg/g tissue compared to carrots (Daucus carota) at 0.61 mg/g tissue. They rank above broccoli (Brassica oleracea) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in overall nutritional value ( Haytowitz and Matthews, 1984 ), and Minnich (1983) ranked them out of all vegetables (including grains, seeds and greens) as tied for ninth best, higher than lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Also, the roots of T. officinale complex are rich in iron, copper and other trace elements ( Dwyer, 1977 ). The most prominent therapeutic property of T. officinale complex is the diuretic activity, which is based on the high potassium content of the plant ( Hook et al., 1993 ). It is superior to other diuretics because it reduces the likelihood of hypokalaemia, a common side-effect of many diuretics ( Houghton, 1995 ).The major and trace element content of T. officinale complex alters with growth stage ( Müller and Kirchgessner, 1972 ). In a Finnish study, the vitamin C content was lowest, while dry matter, soluble solids and mineral content were highest in late summer ( Kuusi et al., 1982 ). Dandelion mineral content was investigated by van der Kley (1956) to assess the suitability of this species as feed for livestock. The high amounts of protein and beta-carotene, favourable mineral composition, and low nitrate content throughout the growing season in Poland provided a high value feed ( Falkowski et al., 1990

 in late summer ( Kuusi et al., 1982 ). Dandelion mineral content was investigated by van der Kley (1956) to assess the suitability of this species as feed for livestock. The high amounts of protein and beta-carotene, favourable mineral composition, and low nitrate content throughout the growing season in Poland provided a high value feed ( Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In UK studies, the availability of these elements was equivalent to that in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), a popular forage species ( Wilman and Derrick, 1994 ). T. officinale complex also had a lower proportion of cell walls in dry matter than perennial ryegrass ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). The true dry matter digestibility was as high as that of ryegrass, but the in vivo digestibility was lower ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). T. officinale complex is a C3 species ( Kemp et al., 1977 ). In US studies, plants from different altitudes showed no significant differences in enzyme activity, net photosynthesis, dark respiration, photorespiration, transpiration rates or temperature responses of gas exchange ( Kemp et al., 1977 ; Oulton et al., 1979 ). This is in disagreement with earlier US reports, which indicated that there were differences in the photosynthetic Hill reaction and enzyme activity among the same altitudinally diverse populations ( May and Villarreal, 1974 ; May, 1976 ). Activity of the enzyme invertase, which was only present in the petiole and central midrib of the developing leaf, was correlated with leaf growth rate and its level was controlled by light ( Slabnik, 1981 ). A US study showed that the leaf size of T. officinale complex plants decreased linearly with increasing elevation and a corresponding decline in nocturnal infrared irradiation from the sky ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Differences in plant leaf structure and physiology traditionally

 and central midrib of the developing leaf, was correlated with leaf growth rate and its level was controlled by light ( Slabnik, 1981 ). A US study showed that the leaf size of T. officinale complex plants decreased linearly with increasing elevation and a corresponding decline in nocturnal infrared irradiation from the sky ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Differences in plant leaf structure and physiology traditionally associated with daytime sun exposure may also be influenced by night-time sky exposure and susceptibility to frost ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Red light and far-red light influenced the water exchange of epidermal cells of T. officinale complex and phytochrome appeared to be involved ( Carceller and Sánchez, 1972 ).Various chemicals and cellular structures play roles in the geotropic behaviour of T. officinale complex. UK studies showed that elevated levels of endogenous ethylene were associated with the diageotropic behaviour and reduced extension growth after flowering ( Clifford and Oxlade, 1989 ). There were significant differences in indol-3yl-acetic acid (IAA) levels across the scape after geostimulation, indicating a role for auxin in geotropism ( Clifford et al., 1985 ). In an earlier British study, Clifford and Barclay (1980) showed that amyloplasts (colourless plastids that form starch granules) in the cells of scapes sediment much faster than previously reported and were involved in the initiation of geotropism in T. officinale complex.Plants exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide grew faster, exhibited more deeply incised leaf margins and had relatively more slender leaf laminae than those exposed to ambient levels ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ; Staddon et al., 1999 ). These effects were most pronounced when T. officinale complex plants were grown individually, but detectable differences were also found in plants grown at high density ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). This supports

 faster, exhibited more deeply incised leaf margins and had relatively more slender leaf laminae than those exposed to ambient levels ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ; Staddon et al., 1999 ). These effects were most pronounced when T. officinale complex plants were grown individually, but detectable differences were also found in plants grown at high density ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). This supports the hypothesis that leaf carbohydrate levels play an important role in regulating heteroblastic leaf development, although elevated carbon dioxide may also affect leaf development through direct hormonal interactions or increased leaf water potential ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). However, Teyssonneyre et al. (2002) found that the population of T. officinale complex in a grassland community did not increase in response to elevated CO2.Environmental factors, such as temperature, photoperiod and rainfall, were studied in Finland for their effect on the bitterness of T. officinale complex ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). It was found that increasing temperature and photoperiod and decreasing rainfall were correlated with an increase in bitterness. However, morphological characters such as leaf shape, main nerve breadth and colour of petiole base were not correlated with bitterness ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Growth phase and season had a strong influence on bitterness, with plants being less bitter in spring before flowering than in late summer ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Bitterness in leaves was caused by sesquiterpene lactones, such as taraxinic acid and its glucoside, as well as triterpenoids, such as cycloartenol ( Houghton, 1995 ). Kuusi et al. (1985) identified four bitter compounds: p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, beta-sitosterol, 11,13-dihydrotaraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside
Text Len: 1795
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ide, as well as triterpenoids, such as cycloartenol ( Houghton, 1995 ). Kuusi et al. (1985) identified four bitter compounds: p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, beta-sitosterol, 11,13-dihydrotaraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and taraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (also identified as an allergen (von Hausen, 1982 )). The following triterpene alcohols have been isolated from tissues of T. officinale complex: taraxol, taraxerol, lupeol, taraxasterol, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol. Phenolic acids related to caffeic acid, caffeoyltartaric acids, cinnamic acids, coumarins, flavonoids, beta-fructofuranosidases and the serine proteinase taraxalisin have also been isolated from T. officinale complex tissues ( Burrowes and Simpson, 1938 ; Rutherford and Deacon, 1972 ; Akashi et al., 1994 ; Houghton, 1995 ; Williams et al., 1996 ; Budzianowski, 1997 ; Rudenskaya et al., 1998 ). T. officinale complex is also a valuable source of the essential linolenic acid, apigenin-7-glucoside, lecithin, and cholin ( Houghton, 1995 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1995 ). Unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids such as linolenic acid are important in the chilling-resistant properties of T. officinale complex ( Imai et al., 1995 ).T. officinale complex possesses allelopathic properties that can reduce germination and growth of other plant species ( Dwyer,

olin ( Houghton, 1995 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1995 ). Unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids such as linolenic acid are important in the chilling-resistant properties of T. officinale complex ( Imai et al., 1995 ).T. officinale complex possesses allelopathic properties that can reduce germination and growth of other plant species ( Dwyer, 1977 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In addition, phenolic compounds produced by T. officinale complex are considered responsible for biological control of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in greenhouse tomato plantings in Canadian experiments ( Kasenberg and Traquair, 1988 ). Satisfactory control of this pathogen was achieved when residues of T. officinale complex were incorporated into sterilized greenhouse soil. The mode of action is unknown but it may act directly by secretion of allelochemicals or promotion of antagonistic microflora ( Jarvis, 1989 ). T. officinale complex leaves are capable of producing an anti-fungal toxin called lettucenin A ( Mizutani, 1989 ). It is a stress-induced antifungal sesquiterpenoid that is present in sufficient quantity in dandelion to suppress invasion of a pathogen in vivo ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ). It was found that lettucenin A production started at an early stage of fungal infection, before the appearance of symptoms, and ended soon after the death of the pathogen ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ).Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves in the roots of T. officinale complex fluctuate with the season ( Loomis, 1938 ). The roots remained viable during the winter and acted as a source of nutrients to facilitate the resumption of growth in early spring (Cyr et al., 1990).

awa et al., 1994 ).Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves in the roots of T. officinale complex fluctuate with the season ( Loomis, 1938 ). The roots remained viable during the winter and acted as a source of nutrients to facilitate the resumption of growth in early spring (Cyr et al., 1990). Fructans, storage carbohydrates such as inulin and inulo-n-ose, were synthesized in roots by the enzyme fructan-fructan fructosyl transferase (Lüscher et al., 1993; Ernst et al., 1996 ). This synthesis of inulin was practically unaffected by the height of competing grass vegetation (Molgaard, 1977). High inulin content in roots resulted in high nitrogenase activity ( Vlassek and Jain, 1976 ), which could enrich the soil with nitrogen through asymbiotic nitrogen fixers such as Azotobacter and Clostridium species ( Vlassek and Jain, 1978 ). Fructan hydrolysis occurred during late autumn and provided simple sugars as a readily accessible carbon pool (Cyr et al., 1990). Nitrates, free amino acids and soluble proteins were important vehicles for nitrogen storage (Cyr et al., 1990). Storage reserves remained at peak levels throughout winter and declined prior to the resumption of growth in spring, when inulin was metabolized to provide a high content of mobile fructose and sucrose to enable extensive vegetative growth and flowering (Molgaard, 1977; Cyr et al., 1990). At the time of fruiting, nitrogen reserves were at their lowest concentration ( Loomis, 1938 ). Toward the end of summer, these reserves were restored and the cycle began again ( Rutherford and Deacon, 1974 ). In other studies, it was found that amino acids accumulated in the roots as autumn senescence progressed in the aerial parts of the plant, and declined in spring when regrowth occurred, with large fluctuations in the

 nitrogen reserves were at their lowest concentration ( Loomis, 1938 ). Toward the end of summer, these reserves were restored and the cycle began again ( Rutherford and Deacon, 1974 ). In other studies, it was found that amino acids accumulated in the roots as autumn senescence progressed in the aerial parts of the plant, and declined in spring when regrowth occurred, with large fluctuations in the amides asparagine and glutamine ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990a ). An 18-kDa protein increased in T. officinale complex roots during the autumn months, suggesting that it has a role as a storage compound, possibly in cold protection ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ; Xu et al., 2000 ). The same protein was also found in inflorescences, the vestigial stem and seeds ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ). Interestingly, the protein also possesses properties similar to allergen- and pathogenesis-related proteins ( Xu et al., 2000 ). A UK study showed that leaf compounds of T. officinale complex fluctuated with season, probably due to temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Free 4-demethyl sterols were maximal during the winter months and levels were correlated negatively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Sitosterol ester and cycloartenol ester showed the opposite response, with levels correlating positively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). The scapes contained predominantly beta-sitosterol and beta-amyrin ( Aexel et al., 1967 ).Generally, during the first season of growth, T. officinale complex seedlings produce only leaves, usually in rosettes ( Longyear, 1918 ). In the spring of the second season, and each season thereafter, inflorescences are produced ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, under favourable conditions, some seedlings can bloom in their first year

 ( Aexel et al., 1967 ).Generally, during the first season of growth, T. officinale complex seedlings produce only leaves, usually in rosettes ( Longyear, 1918 ). In the spring of the second season, and each season thereafter, inflorescences are produced ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, under favourable conditions, some seedlings can bloom in their first year (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The first bud may appear at various times and cannot be correlated to leaf index, although the plant has to have formed at least 20 leaves and enlarged its tap root to store the required energy ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ; Solbrig, 1971 ). The time of first flowering is partly dependent on the surrounding plant community and, in undisturbed communities, a plant may not flower until its fourth season ( Gorchakovskii and Abramchuk, 1996 ). In T. officinale complex, flowering occurs over a wide range of photoperiods and light intensities. Studies on seasonal variation in flowering of T. officinale complex showed that plants flowered throughout the year, with most plants flowering in spring when the average daily air temperature was around 16°C and day length was 10-13 h ( Gray et al., 1973 ; AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In the northern hemisphere, this equates to March-May in the UK, April-May in North America, June in Norway and Siberia. A secondary peak occurred in the autumn (September-October), with an average of 21°C and 12-13 h day length ( Gray et al., 1973 ). Therefore, T. officinale complex can be classified as a day-neutral plant ( Listowski and Jackowska 1965 ; Gray et al., 1973 ), although Solbrig (1971) classified it as a short-day plant due to limited flowering during long summer days.

October), with an average of 21°C and 12-13 h day length ( Gray et al., 1973 ). Therefore, T. officinale complex can be classified as a day-neutral plant ( Listowski and Jackowska 1965 ; Gray et al., 1973 ), although Solbrig (1971) classified it as a short-day plant due to limited flowering during long summer days. Individual plants that bloom in spring may also bloom again in autumn ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). Bud formation in these plants occurs during a period of decreasing daylight, when the differentiation of new leaves is limited and existing leaves show symptoms of premature aging ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The time course of the main spring flowering period may vary in different years, partly due to differences in microclimate, such as the amount of sunshine and soil temperature (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Sterk and Luteijn, 1984 ). The number of times the inflorescences open and close, the length of time that the inflorescences remain open each day, and the length of time that the inflorescences remain closed before opening into mature heads, vary with time of year ( Gray et al., 1973 ).The development of buds requires approximately 1 week ( Solbrig, 1971 ). A scape is formed between the base of the bud and the tip of the shoot in about 48 h ( Solbrig, 1971 ). On average, inflorescences open during two or three successive days, after which they remain closed until the seeds mature ( Longyear, 1918 ; Gray et al., 1973 ). The scape and the inflorescence flatten to the ground and, after a couple of days, the scape straightens and the involucral bracts surrounding the closed inflorescence open to reveal seeds ( Solbrig, 1971 ). The time required from the first day of blooming until the seeds ripen and the bracts open to release them, is about 9-

 1973 ). The scape and the inflorescence flatten to the ground and, after a couple of days, the scape straightens and the involucral bracts surrounding the closed inflorescence open to reveal seeds ( Solbrig, 1971 ). The time required from the first day of blooming until the seeds ripen and the bracts open to release them, is about 9-12 d ( Longyear, 1918 ; Beach, 1939 ; Gray et al., 1973 ).A study in Japan showed that at low temperatures, inflorescences opened in response to increasing temperature (thermonasty), while at higher temperatures, they opened in response to light (photonasty) ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). The minimum temperature for photonastic opening was 13°C and inflorescences remained open for 13-14 h ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). At temperatures of 13-18°C, plants were in full bloom and this was most favourable for nectar secretion, pollen production and bee activity ( Kremer, 1950 ). In Michigan, USA, inflorescences were reported to close when the temperature was over 21°C or during adverse weather, and could remain closed for several days and then re-open when climatic conditions were favourable ( Kremer, 1950 ). Once closed, however, they did not open again on the same day ( Kremer, 1950 ).Seeds produced in the spring during the peak flowering period mostly emerged that same spring or did not emerge at all ( Collins, 2000 ). However, seeds produced at other times during the year produced seedlings throughout the year. Seedlings produced in the autumn produced seeds in the spring of the following year. Chepil (1946) and Roberts and Neilson (1981) found that seedlings emerged in most months of the year in Canada and for up to four years after sowing.

 year. Seedlings produced in the autumn produced seeds in the spring of the following year. Chepil (1946) and Roberts and Neilson (1981) found that seedlings emerged in most months of the year in Canada and for up to four years after sowing. Collins (2000) collected ripe, viable seeds from a single population on the University of Western Ontario campus, London, Canada on the following dates in 1999: May 1, 17, 27; June 10; August 20; September 14, 21; October 4, 20; November 5, 22; and December 13. At least 58% of the seeds collected on each date germinated. P Cavers (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal observation) has collected ripe seeds in every month of the year, but not every month in a single year. He concluded that if there is a January or February thaw that lasts for at least a week, then flowering and seed production can occur.The survival and regeneration of root fragments vary seasonally ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Minimum survival of fragments occurred at the time of maximum flowering of the source plants and maximum survival of fragments occurred in the second growing season ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ).Reproductive BiologyAs T. officinale complex is an apomict (the embryo develops without fertilization) and a triploid of hybrid origin, most pollen grains are abortive and sterile, and cannot form pollen tubes ( Solbrig, 1971 ; Jenniskens, 1984 ). Generally, in the Asteraceae, ligulate or ray-florets are sterile, and tubular or disc-florets are fertile. However, in T. officinale complex, there is no distinction between ray- and disc-florets, either in appearance or function, with all florets being ligulate and equally fertile ( Roberts, 1936 ). The ligulate florets are surrounded by inner and outer involuc

 ray-florets are sterile, and tubular or disc-florets are fertile. However, in T. officinale complex, there is no distinction between ray- and disc-florets, either in appearance or function, with all florets being ligulate and equally fertile ( Roberts, 1936 ). The ligulate florets are surrounded by inner and outer involucral bracts that close at night, in overcast weather, when the relative humidity is above 97% or when the temperature is less than 9.4°C. Opening of the inflorescences is inhibited by rain and accelerated by high light intensity ( Percival, 1955 ; Jenniskens et al., 1984 ).In the Peace River region of Alberta, Canada, Szabo (1984) found an average daily production of 59.2 inflorescences/m², which is equivalent to 592,700 inflorescences ha/d and, over a 25-d blooming period, represented a potential production of 14,792,500 inflorescences/ha. On a sunny day, inflorescences opened between 0800 and 0900 h, reached a peak at 1100 to 1200 h and closed gradually from 1500 to 2100 h; but the whole period was shorter on dull days since high light intensity accelerates inflorescence opening ( Percival, 1955 , Szabo, 1984 ). A UK study found that T. officinale complex presented its pollen from 0900 to 1500 h, with the peak period from 1000 to 1100 h ( Percival, 1955 ). Most inflorescences (89%) opened for two consecutive days, some (7%) for 1 d and some (4%) for 3 d ( Szabo, 1984 ). Quantity and concentration of nectar were significantly higher in inflorescences 2 d old than in those 1 d old ( Szabo, 1984 ). Larger inflorescences produced more nectar, and the nectar-sugar concentration and

 inflorescences (89%) opened for two consecutive days, some (7%) for 1 d and some (4%) for 3 d ( Szabo, 1984 ). Quantity and concentration of nectar were significantly higher in inflorescences 2 d old than in those 1 d old ( Szabo, 1984 ). Larger inflorescences produced more nectar, and the nectar-sugar concentration and sugar value increased with increasing temperature ( Szabo, 1984 ). High nectar-foraging activity by honeybees coincided with peak nectar-sugar production ( Szabo, 1984 ), and anthers dehisced over a period of 1-7 d ( Percival, 1955 ).Although stamens and pistils are present and pollen is produced regularly, the seed of T. officinale complex develops without fertilization ( Roberts, 1936 ). Originally, it was thought that seeds were primarily produced by allogamy, and insects such as honeybees and flies were pollinators ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been suggested by UK investigators that insect visitors, attracted by the bright yellow inflorescences, may be needed to trigger seed set ( Williams et al., 1996 ). In a heavily infested area in Canada, the average number of seeds produced by T. officinale complex was 60,000/m², equivalent to about 600,000,000 seeds/ha ( Roberts, 1936 ). Under near optimal conditions, the number of inflorescences/plant ranged from 48 to 146, with an average of 93, while the number of seeds/inflorescence ranged from 130 to 412, with an average of 252 ( Roberts, 1936 ). This provides an average of 23,436 seeds/plant ( Roberts, 1936 ). In UK studies on the reproductive success of T. officinale complex, Bostock and Benton (1979) found that of 185.5 ovules produced/inflorescence, 181.7 seeds were produced, and 178.

 ranged from 130 to 412, with an average of 252 ( Roberts, 1936 ). This provides an average of 23,436 seeds/plant ( Roberts, 1936 ). In UK studies on the reproductive success of T. officinale complex, Bostock and Benton (1979) found that of 185.5 ovules produced/inflorescence, 181.7 seeds were produced, and 178.1 were dispersed. As well, an average of 12.2 inflorescences/plant were observed, resulting in approximately 2,170 seeds/plant being produced during the growing season. Ford (1981b) found that the number of inflorescences/plant, number of seeds/inflorescence and, therefore, the number of seeds/plant varied with the habitat in which Taraxacum agamospecies were found. The number of inflorescences/plant was 7.7 for plants on denuded roadsides, 1.7 for plants on non-denuded roadsides, and only 0.6 for plants in upland sites. Similarly, the number of seeds/inflorescence was 151 for plants growing in denuded roadside sites, as compared to 119 in non-denuded roadside sites, and only 62 in upland sites. Similarly, a US study found that the number of inflorescences/plant and florets/inflorescence depended on the size and vigour of the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ). Small stunted plants growing in dry soil may produce only a single inflorescence with 30 florets/inflorescence; while large clumps of plants along roadsides may produce 50 or more inflorescences at once with more than 200 florets/inflorescence ( Longyear, 1918 ). Collins (2000) found that the mean mass (mg) per seed in the University of Western Ontario, Canada, collection ranged from 0.33 mg in an August collection to 0.68 mg in a late October collection. At

 clumps of plants along roadsides may produce 50 or more inflorescences at once with more than 200 florets/inflorescence ( Longyear, 1918 ). Collins (2000) found that the mean mass (mg) per seed in the University of Western Ontario, Canada, collection ranged from 0.33 mg in an August collection to 0.68 mg in a late October collection. At the peak of flowering in May, it ranged between 0.43 and 0.49 mg. The seeds produced in late October and early November were significantly heavier than those produced at other times of the year. UK reports of seed weights vary, with Salisbury (1961) stating an average weight of 0.8 mg, Bostock (1978) reporting an average seed weight of 0.583 mg, while Sheldon (1974) reported the average seed weighed 0.0549 mg; one tenth as much as in any other report. Also, the average seed was reported as 10.25 mm in length, with a pappus diameter is 6.94 mm ( Sheldon, 1974 ).At least 7 d must elapse after the opening of the inflorescence before most seeds of T. officinale complex are mature enough to germinate ( Longyear, 1918 ). Therefore, if all inflorescences, including those that have closed to ripen the seeds, are removed from the plant (e.g. by mowing), the germination of seeds from the dried inflorescences that have ripened after cutting is only 13% ( Longyear, 1918 ; Roberts, 1936 ). Fully mature seeds of T. officinale complex lack primary dormancy and are able to germinate almost as soon as they leave the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ; Martinková and Honek, 1997). However, the proximity of the seeds to each other influences germination. In a US study, seeds placed singly or in groups of 5, 10 or 25 had ger

 Fully mature seeds of T. officinale complex lack primary dormancy and are able to germinate almost as soon as they leave the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ; Martinková and Honek, 1997). However, the proximity of the seeds to each other influences germination. In a US study, seeds placed singly or in groups of 5, 10 or 25 had germination percentages of 68, 64, 54 and 41%, respectively. This significant decrease in germination with increasing density may be a population-regulating mechanism ( Linhart, 1976 ). Very large populations of T. officinale complex seeds can be found in soil. For example, in the UK, Champness and Morris (1948) found 1,575,000 seeds/ ha in the top 13 cm of soil in a grassland area, and 2,350,000 seeds/ha in the top 18 cm of an arable field, although not all will germinate. The germination capacity of T. officinale complex seeds is generally 80-90% ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ), and Martinková and Honek (1997) reported 94% germination on moist filter paper, 28 d after collection. Most seeds germinate within 1.5 months after dispersal ( Ogawa, 1978 ). However, von Hofsten (quoted by King (1966) ) estimated that, of 10,000-20,000 seeds/m² dispersed into a meadow, only 50-125 would establish successfully. Germination is impaired after passage through the digestive tracts of cattle, with germination of 52%, 31% and 22% after retention in faeces for 5 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively ( Falkowski et al., 1989 , 1990). Germination is also influenced by individual seed weight ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ). There is variation in the weight of seeds produced in a single inflorescence and the heavier

 the digestive tracts of cattle, with germination of 52%, 31% and 22% after retention in faeces for 5 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively ( Falkowski et al., 1989 , 1990). Germination is also influenced by individual seed weight ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ). There is variation in the weight of seeds produced in a single inflorescence and the heavier seeds have a greater probablility of germination ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ).Seeds of T. officinale complex germinate over a wide range of temperatures, from 5 to 35°C ( Mezynski and Cole, 1974 ; Washitani, 1984 ), with less germination at higher temperatures (Martinková and Honek, 1997). Germination does not need vernalization or cold stratification. Most reports indicate that seeds of T. officinale complex germinate best under alternating temperatures and light. Collins (2000) found 85-94% of seeds, from two populations from London, Ontario, Canada, germinated under the following regimes: 15°C/5°C with 9 h light, 25°C/10°C with 14 h light, 35°C/20°C with 15 h light and 25°C/10°C in total darkness. However, other temperature regimes in total darkness led to reduced germination, with only 75% at 35°C/20°C and 43% at 15°C/5°C. Cross (1931) found 75-76% of seeds, collected from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada germinated in alternating temperatures of 30°C/20°C, while only 60-65% germinated at a constant temperature of 18-20°C. Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported maximum germination of fresh seeds, collected from Maryland, USA, at an alternating temperature of 20°C for 16 h and 10°C
Text Len: 1532
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 seeds, collected from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada germinated in alternating temperatures of 30°C/20°C, while only 60-65% germinated at a constant temperature of 18-20°C. Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported maximum germination of fresh seeds, collected from Maryland, USA, at an alternating temperature of 20°C for 16 h and 10°C for 8 h (while seeds stored for 30 d germinated best at 20°C/15°C). Maguire and Overland (1959) found that 92% of seeds, collected from Washington State, USA, germinated at alternating temperatures (30°C/20°C) in alternating light and darkness, but when kept in darkness, there was only 72% germination. Also, at a constant temperature of 15°C in dark, only 4% germination was recorded, but when alternating light and dark was added to the same constant temperature, 96% germination was observed. Two UK studies ( Williams, 1983 ; Thompson, 1989 ) reported similar results. Seed germination was greater, faster and more uniform in light than in dark ( Isselstein, 1992 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ), although dark germination increased with length of storage ( Isselstein, 1992 ). These different findings may reflect variability between biotypes (van Loenhoud and Duyts, 1981 ). In a Swedish study, Noronha et al. (1997) used cold, dark stratification to show that seeds of T. officinale complex have an inducible light requirement for germination. Ecologically, this inducible light requirement is important for preventing the germination of buried seeds in conditions unfavourable to seedling development ( Noronha et al., 1997 ).There are varying reports of the viability of seeds of T. officinale complex after storage. Seeds reportedly germinate best after 3 months dry storage, but

 have an inducible light requirement for germination. Ecologically, this inducible light requirement is important for preventing the germination of buried seeds in conditions unfavourable to seedling development ( Noronha et al., 1997 ).There are varying reports of the viability of seeds of T. officinale complex after storage. Seeds reportedly germinate best after 3 months dry storage, but germination success then decreases with age ( Russwurm and Martin, 1977 ), certainly after 1 year in storage, and rarely germinates after 3 years dry storage at 20°C (AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In another study, following burial of T. officinale complex seeds for varying time periods, a small number of seeds (1%) were still viable for up to 9 yr after burial ( Burnside et al., 1996 ). Typically, 1-6% of T. officinale complex seeds remained viable 4 yr after burial in soil, and soil storage for 5 yr or longer resulted in little detectable viability ( Chepil, 1946 ; Roberts and Neilson, 1981 ). Von Hofsten (1954) found that seeds remained viable longer in the soil (up to 20-30 yr) than when dry-stored indoors. Depth of seed burial was negatively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ), and Russwurm and Martin (1977) found seed can readily germinate under 2 cm of soil. Storage of seeds at room temperature decreased seed viability, compared to storage at 4°C ( Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ). Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported that percentage germination decreased during 30 d storage of seeds at -15°C or 22°C, compared to fresh seeds. Al-Hially (1991) found that the rate of germination increased after 90 d storage. The position of T. officinale complex seeds affects germination, with greatest

 Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ). Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported that percentage germination decreased during 30 d storage of seeds at -15°C or 22°C, compared to fresh seeds. Al-Hially (1991) found that the rate of germination increased after 90 d storage. The position of T. officinale complex seeds affects germination, with greatest germination occurring when there is good contact between the substrate and the scar of attachment of the seed, allowing water uptake ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The hygroscopic pappus can move to alter the seed position as humidity changes and, in high humidity, the pappus closes hygroscopically ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The backward-pointing hairs and teeth of the seed may play a role in firmly anchoring it during seedling establishment ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Increasing soil compaction decreases seed germination, radicle penetration and seedling establishment, partly due to removal of microsites ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Vegetative growth is limited to the formation of multi-rosetted clumps and root fragmentation. The regenerative capacity of T. officinale complex roots has been examined by Naylor (1941) and Khan (1973) . Vegetative propagule weight was positively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ). Root segments that were 1.25 mm in diameter had to be at least 6-10 mm in length to regenerate, and segments as short as 2 mm could regenerate only if they were more than 4 mm in diameter ( Warmke and Warmke, 1950 ). The minimum length for shoot regeneration was 1.5 mm and for root regeneration 2 mm ( Khan, 1969 ). More shoots and roots regenerated from longer root segments than from shorter ones ( Khan, 1969 ). Regenerative capacity decreased as fragment volume decreased (down the length of the root) ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting cuttings in an inverted or

 and Warmke, 1950 ). The minimum length for shoot regeneration was 1.5 mm and for root regeneration 2 mm ( Khan, 1969 ). More shoots and roots regenerated from longer root segments than from shorter ones ( Khan, 1969 ). Regenerative capacity decreased as fragment volume decreased (down the length of the root) ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting cuttings in an inverted or horizontal plane, rather than the normal planting orientation resulted in a decline in regeneration and survival, and an increase in regeneration time ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting depth did not consistently influence regenerative capacity or timing ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Root fragments were highly vigourous and capable of producing new plants even when covered by 5-10 cm of soil ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ; 1990), which may be due to their high sugar content (~11% of dry matter). Therefore, successful physical removal must include the entire root system. T. officinale complex is perennial, but often rather short-lived. Plants can aestivate, overwinter as a reduced basal rosette under snow cover or as seed (Cyr et al., 1990). Colonizers in a seral succession are often killed by later competition.Environmental RequirementsT. officinale complex can tolerate a broad range of climatic conditions ( Simon et al., 1996 ) and is distributed in almost every temperate and subtropical region of the world ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It is tolerant of a very wide range of conditions, from 90 to 2780 mm annual precipitation and 4.3 to 26.6°C average annual temperature. It shows a wide range of adaptability to light, being able to grow vigorously in full sunlight, or in diffused light in the shade of trees or buildings ( Longyear, 1918 ). It can grow in a wide range of soils ( Simon et al., 1996 ) but it flourishes best in moist, good quality loam (

 4.3 to 26.6°C average annual temperature. It shows a wide range of adaptability to light, being able to grow vigorously in full sunlight, or in diffused light in the shade of trees or buildings ( Longyear, 1918 ). It can grow in a wide range of soils ( Simon et al., 1996 ) but it flourishes best in moist, good quality loam ( Jackson, 1982 ). Soil moisture determines its local distribution, with well-watered areas of lawns being especially favourable for its growth ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been recorded pushing up through concrete, hanging from eavestroughs of houses, and growing from cracks in old stone walls ( Jackson 1982 ). Established T. officinale complex plants are very resistant to drought, while young plants are very sensitive and have a limited chance of invading coarse-textured, shallow or rapidly-drying soils (von Hofsten, 1954 ; PB Cavers, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal communication). It grows in soils ranging in pH of 4.2-8.2 ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It can tolerate moderate salinity and can occur in submaritime sites and on the bare verges of salted roadside verges in Europe and the USA. It also shows differential tolerance of heavy metals ( Zhuikova et al., 1999 ). It has been shown to respond positively to K ( Tilman et al., 1999 ), P ( Zaprzalka and Peters, 1982 ) and N ( Lihan and Jezikova, 1991 ) and negatively to Na and Mg ( Panak et al., 1991 ) in the soil. It may grow at sea level or up to an elevation of 6000 m, where it can be found in association with subalpine or alpine native Taraxacum species ( Longyear, 1918 ; Holm et al., 1997 ). In hilly terrain, T. officinale complex

It may grow at sea level or up to an elevation of 6000 m, where it can be found in association with subalpine or alpine native Taraxacum species ( Longyear, 1918 ; Holm et al., 1997 ). In hilly terrain, T. officinale complex occurs more often on ridges than in hollows but this may be due to differential herbivory (e.g. slugs, rodents, grasshoppers) on the gradient, rather than differential effects of competition ( Reader, 1992 ). AssociationsT. officinale complex forms mycorrhizal associations ( Truszkowska, 1951 ; Hawker et al., 1957 ). Three vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Glomus mosseae ( Gange et al., 1994 ), G. intraradices ( Gange, 1999 ) and Pythium ultimum ( Hawker et al., 1957 ), have been reported on T. officinale complex. Infection by G. mosseae and G. intraradices conferred some degree of resistance in T. officinale complex roots to larvae of the black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus ( Gange et al., 1994 ; Gange, 1999 ). Either fungus inoculated alone caused a significant reduction in larval growth and survival, but when both fungi were inoculated together, the effect disappeared, possibly due to competition between the fungi ( Gange, 1999 ). There have been some recent studies on the mycorrhizal interactions of T. officinale complex, including the effect of elevated carbon dioxide levels on mycorrhizal function ( Staddon et al., 1999 ); the effect of non-host and host plants on mycorrhizal colonization ( Fontenla et al., 1999 ); and the effect of

 ( Gange, 1999 ). There have been some recent studies on the mycorrhizal interactions of T. officinale complex, including the effect of elevated carbon dioxide levels on mycorrhizal function ( Staddon et al., 1999 ); the effect of non-host and host plants on mycorrhizal colonization ( Fontenla et al., 1999 ); and the effect of T. officinale complex on mycorrhiza inoculum potential, soil aggregation and yield of maize ( Kabir and Koide, 2000 ).T. officinale complex has an impact on the relationship between the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata and its prey, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in lucerne ( Harmon et al., 2000 ). It is thought that the omnivorous ladybirds are attracted to dandelion as a pollen resource, and the pea aphids suffer greater predation because they are in the same area.T. officinale complex provides an alternative host to several important viruses, so that it can act as a reservoir and contagion for insect- and nematode-borne disease. These include Tomato ring spot virus, spread by Xiphinema americanum ( Mountain et al., 1992 ; Ramsdell et al., 1993 and many earlier reports); Tomato spotted wilt virus and Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus which infect many agricultural, ornamental and greenhouse crops ( Murphy et al., 1999 ; Groves et al., 2002 ); Beet western yellows virus in Brassica napa ( Polák and Májková, 1992 ); Beet pseudo-yellows virus in Cucumis melo ( Soria et al., 1991 ); Lettuce mosaic virus in Iraq ( Shawkat et al., 1982 ); Dandelion yellow mosaic virus in lettuce ( Bos et al., 1983 ); Lettuce pseudoyellows virus, which infect

It may also act as an alternative host for boll weevils ( Haynes and Smith, 1992 ), cabbage looper, yellow-striped armyworm ( Dussourd and Denno, 1994 ), green peach aphid ( Kaakeh and Hogmire, 1991 ), larvae of the apple moth pest Lacanobia subjuncta ( Landolt, 2002 ), Pseudomonas viridiflava, which causes bacterial streak and bulb rot of onion ( Gitaitis et al., 1998 ), and other microorganisms.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology GeneticsT. officinale complex ranges in ploidy level from diploid to hexaploid (x=8), possessing 16 to 48 individual chromosomes ( Richards, 1973 ). North American individuals of this complex are generally triploid (x=8, 3x=24), and sexual reproduction is rare or may even be absent ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Lyman and Ellstrand, 1984 ). With more than 2000 reported micro-species of this genus in Europe, approximately 90% are polyploids that reproduce asexually by obligate agamospermy (apomixis). The majority of

x=8, 3x=24), and sexual reproduction is rare or may even be absent ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Lyman and Ellstrand, 1984 ). With more than 2000 reported micro-species of this genus in Europe, approximately 90% are polyploids that reproduce asexually by obligate agamospermy (apomixis). The majority of the remaining 10% are diploid species that reproduce sexually and are obligate outcrossers. However, a small number of more primitive forms are capable of self-fertilization ( Hughes and Richards, 1985 ). In T. officinale apomicts, almost every floret automatically produces a seed which is genetically identical to the mother so that mother-daughter lines form 'seed clones' ( Richards, 1973 ; Hughes and Richards, 1988 ; Richards, 1996 ), also known as 'biotypes', which are usually given specific status (for example, Dudman and Richards, 1997 ).As Taraxacum species exhibit extremely variable biology and morphology, the genus is treated as many micro-species in Europe, as previously mentioned; however, it is treated as one species exhibiting considerable phenotypic plasticity in North America ( Richards, 1973 ). This extensive variation may be somewhat unexpected since North American populations are generally considered to be apomictic and so do not exchange genes ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Taylor, 1987 ). There are differences of opinion regarding the extent to which the observed variation is due to phenotypic plasticity versus genotypic differentiation arising from multiple introductions of European microspecies ( Taylor, 1987 ). Janzen (1977) suggested that there is very little genetic variation among populations, while Abbott (1979) argued that this assumption is premature. Taylor (1987) stated that intra-populational morphological variation was as great as or greater than inter-populational variation and, therefore, morphological variation was largely due to phenotyp

 multiple introductions of European microspecies ( Taylor, 1987 ). Janzen (1977) suggested that there is very little genetic variation among populations, while Abbott (1979) argued that this assumption is premature. Taylor (1987) stated that intra-populational morphological variation was as great as or greater than inter-populational variation and, therefore, morphological variation was largely due to phenotypic plasticity. However, Kennison (1978) found that in populations from Washington State, variation among populations was consistently greater than variation within populations. Ford (1981a) observed that agamospecies growing in particular habitats differed from site to site in characters such as population flux, survivorship and fecundity. Furthermore, agamospecies represent ecologically highly specialized population units, relevant to a fine scale of heterogeneity of habitat, and two or more agamospecies can coexist in a broad habitat ( Ford 1981b , 1985). Small and Catling (1999) provide an excellent summary of variation in this complex in Canada. King (1993) used restriction enzyme analysis of ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA to assess the relative contribution of hybridization and mutation as sources of genotypic variation in dandelions of North America. She found that multiple hybridization events in populations (prior to their introduction to North America) were a more important source of genotypic variation than mutation in populations.Although sexual reproduction is rare ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ), natural hybrids have been reported to occur between T. officinale complex and T. platycarpum in Japan ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ). More than 90% of the plants classified as T. officinale complex had alleles introduced from T. platycarpum and were morphologically intermediate between the two species with respect to the number of marginal hairs in the outer involucral bract, the length of corniculate appendages on the outer

 platycarpum in Japan ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ). More than 90% of the plants classified as T. officinale complex had alleles introduced from T. platycarpum and were morphologically intermediate between the two species with respect to the number of marginal hairs in the outer involucral bract, the length of corniculate appendages on the outer involucral bract, and the size of the seed ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ).Physiology and PhenologyT. officinale complex leaves are rich in fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A and C, the B vitamins thiamine and riboflavin, and protein ( Schmidt, 1979 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Gail, 1994 ). Gail (1994) reported that they are also nature's richest vegetable source of beta-carotene at 0.84 mg/g tissue compared to carrots (Daucus carota) at 0.61 mg/g tissue. They rank above broccoli (Brassica oleracea) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in overall nutritional value ( Haytowitz and Matthews, 1984 ), and Minnich (1983) ranked them out of all vegetables (including grains, seeds and greens) as tied for ninth best, higher than lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Also, the roots of T. officinale complex are rich in iron, copper and other trace elements ( Dwyer, 1977 ). The most prominent therapeutic property of T. officinale complex is the diuretic activity, which is based on the high potassium content of the plant ( Hook et al., 1993 ). It is superior to other diuretics because it reduces the likelihood of hypokalaemia, a common side-effect of many diuretics ( Houghton, 1995 ).The major and trace element content of T. officinale complex alters with growth stage ( Müller

 the diuretic activity, which is based on the high potassium content of the plant ( Hook et al., 1993 ). It is superior to other diuretics because it reduces the likelihood of hypokalaemia, a common side-effect of many diuretics ( Houghton, 1995 ).The major and trace element content of T. officinale complex alters with growth stage ( Müller and Kirchgessner, 1972 ). In a Finnish study, the vitamin C content was lowest, while dry matter, soluble solids and mineral content were highest in late summer ( Kuusi et al., 1982 ). Dandelion mineral content was investigated by van der Kley (1956) to assess the suitability of this species as feed for livestock. The high amounts of protein and beta-carotene, favourable mineral composition, and low nitrate content throughout the growing season in Poland provided a high value feed ( Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In UK studies, the availability of these elements was equivalent to that in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), a popular forage species ( Wilman and Derrick, 1994 ). T. officinale complex also had a lower proportion of cell walls in dry matter than perennial ryegrass ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). The true dry matter digestibility was as high as that of ryegrass, but the in vivo digestibility was lower ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). T. officinale complex is a C3 species ( Kemp et al., 1977 ). In US studies, plants from different altitudes showed no significant differences in enzyme activity, net photosynthesis, dark respiration, photorespiration, transpiration rates or temperature responses of gas exchange ( Kemp et al., 1977 ; Oulton et al., 1979 ). This is in disagreement with earlier US reports, which indicated that there were differences in the photosynthetic Hill reaction and enzyme activity among the same altitud

, plants from different altitudes showed no significant differences in enzyme activity, net photosynthesis, dark respiration, photorespiration, transpiration rates or temperature responses of gas exchange ( Kemp et al., 1977 ; Oulton et al., 1979 ). This is in disagreement with earlier US reports, which indicated that there were differences in the photosynthetic Hill reaction and enzyme activity among the same altitudinally diverse populations ( May and Villarreal, 1974 ; May, 1976 ). Activity of the enzyme invertase, which was only present in the petiole and central midrib of the developing leaf, was correlated with leaf growth rate and its level was controlled by light ( Slabnik, 1981 ). A US study showed that the leaf size of T. officinale complex plants decreased linearly with increasing elevation and a corresponding decline in nocturnal infrared irradiation from the sky ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Differences in plant leaf structure and physiology traditionally associated with daytime sun exposure may also be influenced by night-time sky exposure and susceptibility to frost ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Red light and far-red light influenced the water exchange of epidermal cells of T. officinale complex and phytochrome appeared to be involved ( Carceller and Sánchez, 1972 ).Various chemicals and cellular structures play roles in the geotropic behaviour of T. officinale complex. UK studies showed that elevated levels of endogenous ethylene were associated with the diageotropic behaviour and reduced extension growth after flowering ( Clifford and Oxlade, 1989 ). There were significant differences in indol-3yl-acetic acid (IAA) levels across the scape after geostimulation, indicating a role for auxin in geotropism ( Clifford et al., 1985 ). In an earlier British study, Clifford and Barclay (1980) showed that amyloplasts (colourless plastids that form starch granules) in the cells of scapes sediment

 in indol-3yl-acetic acid (IAA) levels across the scape after geostimulation, indicating a role for auxin in geotropism ( Clifford et al., 1985 ). In an earlier British study, Clifford and Barclay (1980) showed that amyloplasts (colourless plastids that form starch granules) in the cells of scapes sediment much faster than previously reported and were involved in the initiation of geotropism in T. officinale complex.Plants exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide grew faster, exhibited more deeply incised leaf margins and had relatively more slender leaf laminae than those exposed to ambient levels ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ; Staddon et al., 1999 ). These effects were most pronounced when T. officinale complex plants were grown individually, but detectable differences were also found in plants grown at high density ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). This supports the hypothesis that leaf carbohydrate levels play an important role in regulating heteroblastic leaf development, although elevated carbon dioxide may also affect leaf development through direct hormonal interactions or increased leaf water potential ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). However, Teyssonneyre et al. (2002) found that the population of T. officinale complex in a grassland community did not increase in response to elevated CO2.Environmental factors, such as temperature, photoperiod and rainfall, were studied in Finland for their effect on the bitterness of T. officinale complex ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). It was found that increasing temperature and photoperiod and decreasing rainfall were correlated with an increase in bitterness. However, morphological characters such as leaf shape, main nerve breadth and colour of petiole base were not correlated with bitterness ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Growth phase and season had a strong influence on bitterness, with plants being less bitter in spring before flowering than in late summer ( Kuus

 that increasing temperature and photoperiod and decreasing rainfall were correlated with an increase in bitterness. However, morphological characters such as leaf shape, main nerve breadth and colour of petiole base were not correlated with bitterness ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Growth phase and season had a strong influence on bitterness, with plants being less bitter in spring before flowering than in late summer ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Bitterness in leaves was caused by sesquiterpene lactones, such as taraxinic acid and its glucoside, as well as triterpenoids, such as cycloartenol ( Houghton, 1995 ). Kuusi et al. (1985) identified four bitter compounds: p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, beta-sitosterol, 11,13-dihydrotaraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and taraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (also identified as an allergen (von Hausen, 1982 )). The following triterpene alcohols have been isolated from tissues of T. officinale complex: taraxol, taraxerol, lupeol, taraxasterol, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol. Phenolic acids related to caffeic acid, caffeoyltartaric acids, cinnamic acids, coumarins, flavonoids, beta-fructofuranosidases and the serine proteinase taraxalisin have also been isolated from T. officinale complex tissues ( Burrowes and Simpson, 1938 ; Rutherford and Deacon, 1972 ; Akashi et al., 1994 ; Houghton, 1995 ; Williams et al., 1996 ; Budzianowski, 1997 ; Rudenskaya et al., 1998 ). T. officin
Text Len: 1456
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uranosidases and the serine proteinase taraxalisin have also been isolated from T. officinale complex tissues ( Burrowes and Simpson, 1938 ; Rutherford and Deacon, 1972 ; Akashi et al., 1994 ; Houghton, 1995 ; Williams et al., 1996 ; Budzianowski, 1997 ; Rudenskaya et al., 1998 ). T. officinale complex is also a valuable source of the essential linolenic acid, apigenin-7-glucoside, lecithin, and cholin ( Houghton, 1995 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1995 ). Unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids such as linolenic acid are important in the chilling-resistant properties of T. officinale complex ( Imai et al., 1995 ).T. officinale complex possesses allelopathic properties that can reduce germination and growth of other plant species ( Dwyer, 1977 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In addition, phenolic compounds produced by T. officinale complex are considered responsible for biological control of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in greenhouse tomato plantings in Canadian experiments ( Kasenberg and Traquair, 1988 ). Satisfactory control of this pathogen was achieved when residues of T. officinale complex were incorporated into sterilized greenhouse soil. The mode of action is unknown but it may act directly by secretion of allelochemicals or promotion of antagonistic microflora ( Jarvis, 1989 ). T. officinale complex leaves are capable of producing an anti-fungal toxin called lettucenin A ( Mizutani, 1989 ). It is a stress-induced antifungal sesquiterpenoid that is present in sufficient quantity in dandelion to suppress invasion of a pathogen in vivo ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ). It was found that lett

 ). T. officinale complex leaves are capable of producing an anti-fungal toxin called lettucenin A ( Mizutani, 1989 ). It is a stress-induced antifungal sesquiterpenoid that is present in sufficient quantity in dandelion to suppress invasion of a pathogen in vivo ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ). It was found that lettucenin A production started at an early stage of fungal infection, before the appearance of symptoms, and ended soon after the death of the pathogen ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ).Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves in the roots of T. officinale complex fluctuate with the season ( Loomis, 1938 ). The roots remained viable during the winter and acted as a source of nutrients to facilitate the resumption of growth in early spring (Cyr et al., 1990). Fructans, storage carbohydrates such as inulin and inulo-n-ose, were synthesized in roots by the enzyme fructan-fructan fructosyl transferase (Lüscher et al., 1993; Ernst et al., 1996 ). This synthesis of inulin was practically unaffected by the height of competing grass vegetation (Molgaard, 1977). High inulin content in roots resulted in high nitrogenase activity ( Vlassek and Jain, 1976 ), which could enrich the soil with nitrogen through asymbiotic nitrogen fixers such as Azotobacter and Clostridium species ( Vlassek and Jain, 1978 ). Fructan hydrolysis occurred during late autumn and provided simple sugars as a readily accessible carbon pool (Cyr et al., 1990). Nitrates, free amino acids and soluble proteins were important vehicles for nitrogen storage (Cyr et al., 1990). Storage reserves remained at peak levels throughout winter and declined prior to the resumption of growth in spring, when inulin was metabolized to provide a high content of

 hydrolysis occurred during late autumn and provided simple sugars as a readily accessible carbon pool (Cyr et al., 1990). Nitrates, free amino acids and soluble proteins were important vehicles for nitrogen storage (Cyr et al., 1990). Storage reserves remained at peak levels throughout winter and declined prior to the resumption of growth in spring, when inulin was metabolized to provide a high content of mobile fructose and sucrose to enable extensive vegetative growth and flowering (Molgaard, 1977; Cyr et al., 1990). At the time of fruiting, nitrogen reserves were at their lowest concentration ( Loomis, 1938 ). Toward the end of summer, these reserves were restored and the cycle began again ( Rutherford and Deacon, 1974 ). In other studies, it was found that amino acids accumulated in the roots as autumn senescence progressed in the aerial parts of the plant, and declined in spring when regrowth occurred, with large fluctuations in the amides asparagine and glutamine ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990a ). An 18-kDa protein increased in T. officinale complex roots during the autumn months, suggesting that it has a role as a storage compound, possibly in cold protection ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ; Xu et al., 2000 ). The same protein was also found in inflorescences, the vestigial stem and seeds ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ). Interestingly, the protein also possesses properties similar to allergen- and pathogenesis-related proteins ( Xu et al., 2000 ). A UK study showed that leaf compounds of T. officinale complex fluctuated with season, probably due to temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Free 4-demethyl sterols were maximal during the winter months and levels were correlated negatively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Sitosterol ester and cycloartenol ester showed the opposite response, with levels

 that leaf compounds of T. officinale complex fluctuated with season, probably due to temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Free 4-demethyl sterols were maximal during the winter months and levels were correlated negatively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Sitosterol ester and cycloartenol ester showed the opposite response, with levels correlating positively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). The scapes contained predominantly beta-sitosterol and beta-amyrin ( Aexel et al., 1967 ).Generally, during the first season of growth, T. officinale complex seedlings produce only leaves, usually in rosettes ( Longyear, 1918 ). In the spring of the second season, and each season thereafter, inflorescences are produced ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, under favourable conditions, some seedlings can bloom in their first year (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The first bud may appear at various times and cannot be correlated to leaf index, although the plant has to have formed at least 20 leaves and enlarged its tap root to store the required energy ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ; Solbrig, 1971 ). The time of first flowering is partly dependent on the surrounding plant community and, in undisturbed communities, a plant may not flower until its fourth season ( Gorchakovskii and Abramchuk, 1996 ). In T. officinale complex, flowering occurs over a wide range of photoperiods and light intensities. Studies on seasonal variation in flowering of T. officinale complex showed that plants flowered throughout the year, with most plants flowering in spring when the average daily air temperature was around 16°C and day length was 10-13 h ( Gray et al., 1973 ; AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In the northern hemisphere, this

operiods and light intensities. Studies on seasonal variation in flowering of T. officinale complex showed that plants flowered throughout the year, with most plants flowering in spring when the average daily air temperature was around 16°C and day length was 10-13 h ( Gray et al., 1973 ; AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In the northern hemisphere, this equates to March-May in the UK, April-May in North America, June in Norway and Siberia. A secondary peak occurred in the autumn (September-October), with an average of 21°C and 12-13 h day length ( Gray et al., 1973 ). Therefore, T. officinale complex can be classified as a day-neutral plant ( Listowski and Jackowska 1965 ; Gray et al., 1973 ), although Solbrig (1971) classified it as a short-day plant due to limited flowering during long summer days. Individual plants that bloom in spring may also bloom again in autumn ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). Bud formation in these plants occurs during a period of decreasing daylight, when the differentiation of new leaves is limited and existing leaves show symptoms of premature aging ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The time course of the main spring flowering period may vary in different years, partly due to differences in microclimate, such as the amount of sunshine and soil temperature (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Sterk and Luteijn, 1984 ). The number of times the inflorescences open and close, the length of time that the inflorescences remain open each day, and the length of time that the inflorescences remain closed before opening into mature heads, vary with time of year ( Gray et al., 1973 ).The development of buds requires approximately 1 week ( Solbrig, 1971 ). A scape is formed between the base of the bud and the tip of the shoot in about 48 h ( Solbrig, 1971 ).

orescences remain open each day, and the length of time that the inflorescences remain closed before opening into mature heads, vary with time of year ( Gray et al., 1973 ).The development of buds requires approximately 1 week ( Solbrig, 1971 ). A scape is formed between the base of the bud and the tip of the shoot in about 48 h ( Solbrig, 1971 ). On average, inflorescences open during two or three successive days, after which they remain closed until the seeds mature ( Longyear, 1918 ; Gray et al., 1973 ). The scape and the inflorescence flatten to the ground and, after a couple of days, the scape straightens and the involucral bracts surrounding the closed inflorescence open to reveal seeds ( Solbrig, 1971 ). The time required from the first day of blooming until the seeds ripen and the bracts open to release them, is about 9-12 d ( Longyear, 1918 ; Beach, 1939 ; Gray et al., 1973 ).A study in Japan showed that at low temperatures, inflorescences opened in response to increasing temperature (thermonasty), while at higher temperatures, they opened in response to light (photonasty) ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). The minimum temperature for photonastic opening was 13°C and inflorescences remained open for 13-14 h ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). At temperatures of 13-18°C, plants were in full bloom and this was most favourable for nectar secretion, pollen production and bee activity ( Kremer, 1950 ). In Michigan, USA, inflorescences were reported to close when the temperature was over 21°C or during adverse weather, and could remain closed for several days and then re-open when climatic conditions were favourable ( Kremer, 1950 ). Once closed, however, they did not open again on the same day ( Kremer, 1950 ).Seeds produced in the spring during the peak

 1950 ). In Michigan, USA, inflorescences were reported to close when the temperature was over 21°C or during adverse weather, and could remain closed for several days and then re-open when climatic conditions were favourable ( Kremer, 1950 ). Once closed, however, they did not open again on the same day ( Kremer, 1950 ).Seeds produced in the spring during the peak flowering period mostly emerged that same spring or did not emerge at all ( Collins, 2000 ). However, seeds produced at other times during the year produced seedlings throughout the year. Seedlings produced in the autumn produced seeds in the spring of the following year. Chepil (1946) and Roberts and Neilson (1981) found that seedlings emerged in most months of the year in Canada and for up to four years after sowing. Collins (2000) collected ripe, viable seeds from a single population on the University of Western Ontario campus, London, Canada on the following dates in 1999: May 1, 17, 27; June 10; August 20; September 14, 21; October 4, 20; November 5, 22; and December 13. At least 58% of the seeds collected on each date germinated. P Cavers (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal observation) has collected ripe seeds in every month of the year, but not every month in a single year. He concluded that if there is a January or February thaw that lasts for at least a week, then flowering and seed production can occur.The survival and regeneration of root fragments vary seasonally ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Minimum survival of fragments occurred at the time of maximum flowering of the source plants and maximum survival of fragments occurred in the second growing season ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ).Reproductive BiologyAs T. officinale complex is an apomict (the embryo develops without fertilization) and a triploid of hybrid origin, most pollen grains are

ally ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Minimum survival of fragments occurred at the time of maximum flowering of the source plants and maximum survival of fragments occurred in the second growing season ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ).Reproductive BiologyAs T. officinale complex is an apomict (the embryo develops without fertilization) and a triploid of hybrid origin, most pollen grains are abortive and sterile, and cannot form pollen tubes ( Solbrig, 1971 ; Jenniskens, 1984 ). Generally, in the Asteraceae, ligulate or ray-florets are sterile, and tubular or disc-florets are fertile. However, in T. officinale complex, there is no distinction between ray- and disc-florets, either in appearance or function, with all florets being ligulate and equally fertile ( Roberts, 1936 ). The ligulate florets are surrounded by inner and outer involucral bracts that close at night, in overcast weather, when the relative humidity is above 97% or when the temperature is less than 9.4°C. Opening of the inflorescences is inhibited by rain and accelerated by high light intensity ( Percival, 1955 ; Jenniskens et al., 1984 ).In the Peace River region of Alberta, Canada, Szabo (1984) found an average daily production of 59.2 inflorescences/m², which is equivalent to 592,700 inflorescences ha/d and, over a 25-d blooming period, represented a potential production of 14,792,500 inflorescences/ha. On a sunny day, inflorescences opened between 0800 and 0900 h, reached a peak at 1100 to 1200 h and closed gradually from 1500 to 2100 h; but the whole period was shorter on dull days since high light intensity accelerates inflorescence opening ( Percival, 1955 , Szabo, 1984 ). A UK study found that

 14,792,500 inflorescences/ha. On a sunny day, inflorescences opened between 0800 and 0900 h, reached a peak at 1100 to 1200 h and closed gradually from 1500 to 2100 h; but the whole period was shorter on dull days since high light intensity accelerates inflorescence opening ( Percival, 1955 , Szabo, 1984 ). A UK study found that T. officinale complex presented its pollen from 0900 to 1500 h, with the peak period from 1000 to 1100 h ( Percival, 1955 ). Most inflorescences (89%) opened for two consecutive days, some (7%) for 1 d and some (4%) for 3 d ( Szabo, 1984 ). Quantity and concentration of nectar were significantly higher in inflorescences 2 d old than in those 1 d old ( Szabo, 1984 ). Larger inflorescences produced more nectar, and the nectar-sugar concentration and sugar value increased with increasing temperature ( Szabo, 1984 ). High nectar-foraging activity by honeybees coincided with peak nectar-sugar production ( Szabo, 1984 ), and anthers dehisced over a period of 1-7 d ( Percival, 1955 ).Although stamens and pistils are present and pollen is produced regularly, the seed of T. officinale complex develops without fertilization ( Roberts, 1936 ). Originally, it was thought that seeds were primarily produced by allogamy, and insects such as honeybees and flies were pollinators ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been suggested by UK investigators that insect visitors, attracted by the bright yellow inflorescences, may be needed to trigger seed set ( Williams et al., 1996 ). In a heavily infested area in Canada, the average number of seeds produced by T. officinale complex was 60,000/m², equivalent to about 600,000,000 seeds/ha ( Roberts, 1936 ). Under

 has been suggested by UK investigators that insect visitors, attracted by the bright yellow inflorescences, may be needed to trigger seed set ( Williams et al., 1996 ). In a heavily infested area in Canada, the average number of seeds produced by T. officinale complex was 60,000/m², equivalent to about 600,000,000 seeds/ha ( Roberts, 1936 ). Under near optimal conditions, the number of inflorescences/plant ranged from 48 to 146, with an average of 93, while the number of seeds/inflorescence ranged from 130 to 412, with an average of 252 ( Roberts, 1936 ). This provides an average of 23,436 seeds/plant ( Roberts, 1936 ). In UK studies on the reproductive success of T. officinale complex, Bostock and Benton (1979) found that of 185.5 ovules produced/inflorescence, 181.7 seeds were produced, and 178.1 were dispersed. As well, an average of 12.2 inflorescences/plant were observed, resulting in approximately 2,170 seeds/plant being produced during the growing season. Ford (1981b) found that the number of inflorescences/plant, number of seeds/inflorescence and, therefore, the number of seeds/plant varied with the habitat in which Taraxacum agamospecies were found. The number of inflorescences/plant was 7.7 for plants on denuded roadsides, 1.7 for plants on non-denuded roadsides, and only 0.6 for plants in upland sites. Similarly, the number of seeds/inflorescence was 151 for plants growing in denuded roadside sites, as compared to 119 in non-denuded roadside sites, and only 62 in upland sites. Similarly, a US study found that the number of inflorescences/plant and florets/inflorescence depended on the size and vigour of the plant

 plants in upland sites. Similarly, the number of seeds/inflorescence was 151 for plants growing in denuded roadside sites, as compared to 119 in non-denuded roadside sites, and only 62 in upland sites. Similarly, a US study found that the number of inflorescences/plant and florets/inflorescence depended on the size and vigour of the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ). Small stunted plants growing in dry soil may produce only a single inflorescence with 30 florets/inflorescence; while large clumps of plants along roadsides may produce 50 or more inflorescences at once with more than 200 florets/inflorescence ( Longyear, 1918 ). Collins (2000) found that the mean mass (mg) per seed in the University of Western Ontario, Canada, collection ranged from 0.33 mg in an August collection to 0.68 mg in a late October collection. At the peak of flowering in May, it ranged between 0.43 and 0.49 mg. The seeds produced in late October and early November were significantly heavier than those produced at other times of the year. UK reports of seed weights vary, with Salisbury (1961) stating an average weight of 0.8 mg, Bostock (1978) reporting an average seed weight of 0.583 mg, while Sheldon (1974) reported the average seed weighed 0.0549 mg; one tenth as much as in any other report. Also, the average seed was reported as 10.25 mm in length, with a pappus diameter is 6.94 mm ( Sheldon, 1974 ).At least 7 d must elapse after the opening of the inflorescence before most seeds of T. officinale complex are mature enough to germinate ( Longyear, 1918 ). Therefore, if all inflorescences, including those that have closed to ripen the seeds, are removed from the plant (e.g. by m

us diameter is 6.94 mm ( Sheldon, 1974 ).At least 7 d must elapse after the opening of the inflorescence before most seeds of T. officinale complex are mature enough to germinate ( Longyear, 1918 ). Therefore, if all inflorescences, including those that have closed to ripen the seeds, are removed from the plant (e.g. by mowing), the germination of seeds from the dried inflorescences that have ripened after cutting is only 13% ( Longyear, 1918 ; Roberts, 1936 ). Fully mature seeds of T. officinale complex lack primary dormancy and are able to germinate almost as soon as they leave the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ; Martinková and Honek, 1997). However, the proximity of the seeds to each other influences germination. In a US study, seeds placed singly or in groups of 5, 10 or 25 had germination percentages of 68, 64, 54 and 41%, respectively. This significant decrease in germination with increasing density may be a population-regulating mechanism ( Linhart, 1976 ). Very large populations of T. officinale complex seeds can be found in soil. For example, in the UK, Champness and Morris (1948) found 1,575,000 seeds/ ha in the top 13 cm of soil in a grassland area, and 2,350,000 seeds/ha in the top 18 cm of an arable field, although not all will germinate. The germination capacity of T. officinale complex seeds is generally 80-90% ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ), and Martinková and Honek (1997) reported 94% germination on moist filter paper, 28 d after collection. Most seeds germinate within 1.5 months after dispersal ( Ogawa, 1978 ). However, von Hofsten (quoted by King (1966) ) estimated that,

ale complex seeds is generally 80-90% ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ), and Martinková and Honek (1997) reported 94% germination on moist filter paper, 28 d after collection. Most seeds germinate within 1.5 months after dispersal ( Ogawa, 1978 ). However, von Hofsten (quoted by King (1966) ) estimated that, of 10,000-20,000 seeds/m² dispersed into a meadow, only 50-125 would establish successfully. Germination is impaired after passage through the digestive tracts of cattle, with germination of 52%, 31% and 22% after retention in faeces for 5 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively ( Falkowski et al., 1989 , 1990). Germination is also influenced by individual seed weight ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ). There is variation in the weight of seeds produced in a single inflorescence and the heavier seeds have a greater probablility of germination ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ).Seeds of T. officinale complex germinate over a wide range of temperatures, from 5 to 35°C ( Mezynski and Cole, 1974 ; Washitani, 1984 ), with less germination at higher temperatures (Martinková and Honek, 1997). Germination does not need vernalization or cold stratification. Most reports indicate that seeds of T. officinale complex germinate best under alternating temperatures and light. Collins (2000) found 85-94% of seeds, from two populations from London, Ontario, Canada, germinated under the following regimes: 15°C/5°C with 9 h light, 25°C/10°C with 14 h light, 35°C/20°C with 15 h light and 25°C/10°C in total darkness. However, other temperature regimes in total darkness led to reduced germination, with only

However, other temperature regimes in total darkness led to reduced germination, with only 75% at 35°C/20°C and 43% at 15°C/5°C. Cross (1931) found 75-76% of seeds, collected from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada germinated in alternating temperatures of 30°C/20°C, while only 60-65% germinated at a constant temperature of 18-20°C. Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported maximum germination of fresh seeds, collected from Maryland, USA, at an alternating temperature of 20°C for 16 h and 10°C for 8 h (while seeds stored for 30 d germinated best at 20°C/15°C). Maguire and Overland (1959) found that 92% of seeds, collected from Washington State, USA, germinated at alternating temperatures (30°C/20°C) in alternating light and darkness, but when kept in darkness, there was only 72% germination. Also, at a constant temperature of 15°C in dark, only 4% germination was recorded, but when alternating light and dark was added to the same constant temperature, 96% germination was observed. Two UK studies ( Williams, 1983 ; Thompson, 1989 ) reported similar results. Seed germination was greater, faster and more uniform in light than in dark ( Isselstein, 1992 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ), although dark germination increased with length of storage ( Isselstein, 1992 ). These different findings may reflect variability between biotypes (van Loenhoud and Duyts,

 Williams, 1983 ; Thompson, 1989 ) reported similar results. Seed germination was greater, faster and more uniform in light than in dark ( Isselstein, 1992 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ), although dark germination increased with length of storage ( Isselstein, 1992 ). These different findings may reflect variability between biotypes (van Loenhoud and Duyts, 1981 ). In a Swedish study, Noronha et al. (1997) used cold, dark stratification to show that seeds of T. officinale complex have an inducible light requirement for germination. Ecologically, this inducible light requirement is important for preventing the germination of buried seeds in conditions unfavourable to seedling development ( Noronha et al., 1997 ).There are varying reports of the viability of seeds of T. officinale complex after storage. Seeds reportedly germinate best after 3 months dry storage, but germination success then decreases with age ( Russwurm and Martin, 1977 ), certainly after 1 year in storage, and rarely germinates after 3 years dry storage at 20°C (AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In another study, following burial of T. officinale complex seeds for varying time periods, a small number of seeds (1%) were still viable for up to 9 yr after burial ( Burnside et al., 1996 ). Typically, 1-6% of T. officinale complex seeds remained viable 4 yr after burial in soil, and soil storage for 5 yr or longer resulted in little detectable viability ( Chepil, 1946 ; Roberts and Neilson, 1981 ). Von Hofsten (1954) found that seeds remained viable longer in the soil (up to 20-30 yr) than when dry-stored indoors. Depth of seed burial was negatively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ), and Russwurm and Martin (

 longer resulted in little detectable viability ( Chepil, 1946 ; Roberts and Neilson, 1981 ). Von Hofsten (1954) found that seeds remained viable longer in the soil (up to 20-30 yr) than when dry-stored indoors. Depth of seed burial was negatively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ), and Russwurm and Martin (1977) found seed can readily germinate under 2 cm of soil. Storage of seeds at room temperature decreased seed viability, compared to storage at 4°C ( Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ). Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported that percentage germination decreased during 30 d storage of seeds at -15°C or 22°C, compared to fresh seeds. Al-Hially (1991) found that the rate of germination increased after 90 d storage. The position of T. officinale complex seeds affects germination, with greatest germination occurring when there is good contact between the substrate and the scar of attachment of the seed, allowing water uptake ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The hygroscopic pappus can move to alter the seed position as humidity changes and, in high humidity, the pappus closes hygroscopically ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The backward-pointing hairs and teeth of the seed may play a role in firmly anchoring it during seedling establishment ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Increasing soil compaction decreases seed germination, radicle penetration and seedling establishment, partly due to removal of microsites ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Vegetative growth is limited to the formation of multi-rosetted clumps and root fragmentation. The regenerative capacity of T. officinale complex roots has been examined by Naylor (1941) and Khan (1973) . Vegetative propagule weight was positively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ). Root segments that were 1.25 mm in diameter had to be

 growth is limited to the formation of multi-rosetted clumps and root fragmentation. The regenerative capacity of T. officinale complex roots has been examined by Naylor (1941) and Khan (1973) . Vegetative propagule weight was positively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ). Root segments that were 1.25 mm in diameter had to be at least 6-10 mm in length to regenerate, and segments as short as 2 mm could regenerate only if they were more than 4 mm in diameter ( Warmke and Warmke, 1950 ). The minimum length for shoot regeneration was 1.5 mm and for root regeneration 2 mm ( Khan, 1969 ). More shoots and roots regenerated from longer root segments than from shorter ones ( Khan, 1969 ). Regenerative capacity decreased as fragment volume decreased (down the length of the root) ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting cuttings in an inverted or horizontal plane, rather than the normal planting orientation resulted in a decline in regeneration and survival, and an increase in regeneration time ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting depth did not consistently influence regenerative capacity or timing ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Root fragments were highly vigourous and capable of producing new plants even when covered by 5-10 cm of soil ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ; 1990), which may be due to their high sugar content (~11% of dry matter). Therefore, successful physical removal must include the entire root system. T. officinale complex is perennial, but often rather short-lived. Plants can aestivate, overwinter as a reduced basal rosette under snow cover or as seed (Cyr et al., 1990). Colonizers in a seral succession are often killed by later competition.Environmental RequirementsT. officinale complex can tolerate a broad range of climatic conditions ( Simon et al., 1996 ) and is distributed in almost every temperate and subtrop

Colonizers in a seral succession are often killed by later competition.Environmental RequirementsT. officinale complex can tolerate a broad range of climatic conditions ( Simon et al., 1996 ) and is distributed in almost every temperate and subtropical region of the world ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It is tolerant of a very wide range of conditions, from 90 to 2780 mm annual precipitation and 4.3 to 26.6°C average annual temperature. It shows a wide range of adaptability to light, being able to grow vigorously in full sunlight, or in diffused light in the shade of trees or buildings ( Longyear, 1918 ). It can grow in a wide range of soils ( Simon et al., 1996 ) but it flourishes best in moist, good quality loam ( Jackson, 1982 ). Soil moisture determines its local distribution, with well-watered areas of lawns being especially favourable for its growth ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been recorded pushing up through concrete, hanging from eavestroughs of houses, and growing from cracks in old stone walls ( Jackson 1982 ). Established T. officinale complex plants are very resistant to drought, while young plants are very sensitive and have a limited chance of invading coarse-textured, shallow or rapidly-drying soils (von Hofsten, 1954 ; PB Cavers, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal communication). It grows in soils ranging in pH of 4.2-8.2 ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It can tolerate moderate salinity and can occur in submaritime sites and on the bare verges of salted roadside verges in Europe and the USA. It also shows differential tolerance of heavy metals ( Zhuikova et al., 1999 ). It has been shown to respond positively

It can tolerate moderate salinity and can occur in submaritime sites and on the bare verges of salted roadside verges in Europe and the USA. It also shows differential tolerance of heavy metals ( Zhuikova et al., 1999 ). It has been shown to respond positively to K ( Tilman et al., 1999 ), P ( Zaprzalka and Peters, 1982 ) and N ( Lihan and Jezikova, 1991 ) and negatively to Na and Mg ( Panak et al., 1991 ) in the soil. It may grow at sea level or up to an elevation of 6000 m, where it can be found in association with subalpine or alpine native Taraxacum species ( Longyear, 1918 ; Holm et al., 1997 ). In hilly terrain, T. officinale complex occurs more often on ridges than in hollows but this may be due to differential herbivory (e.g. slugs, rodents, grasshoppers) on the gradient, rather than differential effects of competition ( Reader, 1992 ). AssociationsT. officinale complex forms mycorrhizal associations ( Truszkowska, 1951 ; Hawker et al., 1957 ). Three vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Glomus mosseae ( Gange et al., 1994 ), G. intraradices ( Gange, 1999 ) and Pythium ultimum ( Hawker et al., 1957 ), have been reported on T. officinale complex. Infection by G. mosseae and G. intraradices conferred some degree of resistance in T. officinale complex roots to larvae of the black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus ( Gange et al., 1994 ; Gange, 1999 ).

 ( Hawker et al., 1957 ), have been reported on T. officinale complex. Infection by G. mosseae and G. intraradices conferred some degree of resistance in T. officinale complex roots to larvae of the black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus ( Gange et al., 1994 ; Gange, 1999 ). Either fungus inoculated alone caused a significant reduction in larval growth and survival, but when both fungi were inoculated together, the effect disappeared, possibly due to competition between the fungi ( Gange, 1999 ). There have been some recent studies on the mycorrhizal interactions of T. officinale complex, including the effect of elevated carbon dioxide levels on mycorrhizal function ( Staddon et al., 1999 ); the effect of non-host and host plants on mycorrhizal colonization ( Fontenla et al., 1999 ); and the effect of T. officinale complex on mycorrhiza inoculum potential, soil aggregation and yield of maize ( Kabir and Koide, 2000 ).T. officinale complex has an impact on the relationship between the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata and its prey, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in lucerne ( Harmon et al., 2000 ). It is thought that the omnivorous ladybirds are attracted to dandelion as a pollen resource, and the pea aphids suffer greater predation because they are in the same area.T. officinale complex provides an alternative host to several important viruses, so that it can act as a reservoir and contagion for insect- and nematode-borne disease. These include Tomato ring spot virus, spread by Xiphinema americanum ( Mountain et al., 1992 ; Ramsdell et al., 1993 and many earlier reports); Tomato spotted wilt virus and Cucumber mosaic cuc

The stems are acaulescent, only 1-2.5 cm in length, with extremely short internodes at or below the soil surface (Gier and Burress, 1942;Holm et al., 1997). The leaves form a basal, radial rosette in which every sixth leaf overlaps (Holm et al., 1997). The leaves are highly variable in shape, colour and indumentum; they show developmental and seasonal

 1-2.5 cm in length, with extremely short internodes at or below the soil surface (Gier and Burress, 1942;Holm et al., 1997). The leaves form a basal, radial rosette in which every sixth leaf overlaps (Holm et al., 1997). The leaves are highly variable in shape, colour and indumentum; they show developmental and seasonal heteroblasty; and they are morphologically very responsive to shade, nutrition, moisture, exposure and grazing. In shape, they range from lobeless to toothed edges to highly incised and, when lobed, the lobes point to the leaf base. The runcinate-pinnatifid or lobed oblanceolate leaves have glabrous to sparsely pubescent lower surfaces, are generally 5-40 cm in length and 0.7-15 cm in width, and taper to a winged, petiolar base (Gleason, 1963;Holm et al., 1997). The prominent midrib of the leaves ranges in colour from pale yellow-green to deep red-brown (LL Collins, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, unpublished data). The thick, branched taproot can be up to 2-3 cm in diameter and grow up to 1-2 m in length (vonHofsten, 1954;Solbrig, 1971). The lateral roots are arranged in two rows that wind clockwise downward in a loose spiral around the root and are distributed more or less regularly along its length (Gier and Burress, 1942).The basal rosette gives rise to one to numerous, erect to decumbent, simple, glabrous, hollow, cylindrical scapes (peduncles), 5-50 cm tall, decreasing in diameter along their length from base to tip. Each scape bears a terminal capitulum (inflorescence) of 2-5 cm diameter (Gier and

ress, 1942).The basal rosette gives rise to one to numerous, erect to decumbent, simple, glabrous, hollow, cylindrical scapes (peduncles), 5-50 cm tall, decreasing in diameter along their length from base to tip. Each scape bears a terminal capitulum (inflorescence) of 2-5 cm diameter (Gier and Burress, 1942; Gleason, 1963;Holm et al., 1997). Each capitulum is subtended by an oval-cylindrical involucre with lanceolate-obtuse, green to brownish, herbaceous bracts, in two rows of phyllaries, with the outer phyllaries shorter and wider than the inner phyllaries (Holm et al., 1997). The inner phyllaries are of uniform length and one-serrate, while the outer ones are unequal, one-third to one-half as long as the inner bracts and many-serrate. All bracts are reflexed at maturity, with a convex, minutely pitted receptacle, without paleae (Holm et al., 1997).The capitulum is composed of up to 250 ligulate, perfect, yellow florets (Holm et al., 1997), which usually have coloured stripes below. Each floret has a corolla of five united petals with one side prolonged, strap-shaped, and five-notched at the tip. Each floret contains five stamens fused into a tube with a sagittate base, filiform basal lobes and an obtuse apex (Holm et al., 1997). The warty spherical pollen grains are 30 µm in diameter (Gier and Burress, 1942). In each floret, the inferior ovary contains one basal, inverted ovule with a single integument. A single style branches into two stigmatic arms, which are 1-1.5

, filiform basal lobes and an obtuse apex (Holm et al., 1997). The warty spherical pollen grains are 30 µm in diameter (Gier and Burress, 1942). In each floret, the inferior ovary contains one basal, inverted ovule with a single integument. A single style branches into two stigmatic arms, which are 1-1.5 mm in length and 0.06 mm in diameter, and covered with fine hairs (Gier and Burress, 1942;Sood and Sood, 1992;Holm et al., 1997). Each ovule gives rise to a pale grey-brown to olive-brown, narrowly obovoid-oblong, rough-surfaced cypsela (seed), 3-4 mm in length and 1 mm width. Each cypsela is 5-8 ribbed on each side with upwardly pointed teeth at the beaked apex and with a white pappus composed of numerous hairs, 3-4 mm in length, mostly white, persistent and fused at the base, for efficient wind dispersal (Gleason, 1963;Holm et al., 1997). Thus, each capitulum resembles a 'puffball' or 'clock' when mature.All parts of the plant when broken yield a whitish milky latex that dries to a blackish substance. The latex from another Taraxacum species has been used as a rubber substitute (Krotov, 1945).The genus Taraxacum is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: leaves all basal; scapes simple, hollow; inflorescences with yellow ligulate florets subtended by two rows of involucral bracts.

In the remainder of this datasheet, for the sake of simplicity, the following terms will be used: scape to describe a peduncle, inflorescence to describe a capitulum and seed to describe a cypsela.Phenotypic variability in T. officinale complex increases its ability to colonize a wide range of habitats. In cool or dry weather, or in closely-mown lawns, the leaves usually spread flat against the surface of the ground to form an almost prostrate rosette (Longyear, 1918;Lovell and Rowan, 1991). In warmer weather or in areas where it is crowded by taller vegetation, the leaves stand in more or less erect tufts (Longyear, 1918). The rosette enables it to survive mowing, grazing and competition with grasses (Baker, 1974). The possession of toothed leaves, which resemble those of thistles, and the bitter white latex, are thought to be adaptations to deter grazing animals (Richardson, 1985).T. officinale complex displays a wide range of leaf shapes, from a smooth rounded (juvenile) form to a deeply incised runcinate (adult) form (Sánchez, 1971). The length:breadth ratio decreases as the leaf number increases (Sánchez, 1971) and the ratio and depth of incisions in the runcinate form are influenced by light, mediated by the phytochrome system (Wassink, 1965;Sánchez, 1967). Therefore, leaf shape can be regulated by light intensity and quality, with rounded blades developing at low light energy values and runcinate blades developing at high light energy values (Sánchez, 1967;Slabnik, 1981). An increase in light intensity increases the degree of

 light, mediated by the phytochrome system (Wassink, 1965;Sánchez, 1967). Therefore, leaf shape can be regulated by light intensity and quality, with rounded blades developing at low light energy values and runcinate blades developing at high light energy values (Sánchez, 1967;Slabnik, 1981). An increase in light intensity increases the degree of lobing and decreases the length:breadth ratio (Slabnik, 1981).The complex possesses a deep tap root that can extend below the level of competing grass roots (Loomis, 1938), and make it difficult to remove plants manually (Lovell and Rowan, 1991). The root system can be widely-branched and surmounted by a crown, which can divide to form numerous (up to 22) crown branches, depending on the degree of crowding by other plants and plant age (Roberts, 1936). The roots are also highly regenerative, capable of producing shoots and roots within 1-2 weeks from very small segments (Longyear, 1918;Warmke and Warmke, 1950;Mann and Cavers, 1979). When cut off below the crown, the root usually produces several new shoots so that a cluster of new plants is formed (Longyear, 1918). At the end of the growing season, the root shortens and draws the crown slightly into the soil, where it is better protected from adverse conditions (Longyear, 1918). The ease of regeneration is reportedly related to the ability of the parenchymatous cells of the secondary phloem and xylem in the root to readily dedifferentiate and develop into new shoots and roots (Higashimura, 1986).During the development of the inflorescence, the growth rate and georesponse of the scape varies (Clifford and Oxlade, 1989). The scape elongates to bloom, then bends down close to the ground while the seeds mature,

loem and xylem in the root to readily dedifferentiate and develop into new shoots and roots (Higashimura, 1986).During the development of the inflorescence, the growth rate and georesponse of the scape varies (Clifford and Oxlade, 1989). The scape elongates to bloom, then bends down close to the ground while the seeds mature, where it can escape injury from lawnmowers or grazers (Longyear, 1918;Richardson, 1985). When seeds are nearly mature, the scape elongates again up to 75 cm, maximizing its height for effective dispersal of the wind-blown seeds (Longyear, 1918;Jackson, 1982;Richardson, 1985). Therefore, the scape grows upright (negatively orthgeotropic) when extension growth is rapid, as it is prior to flowering and during formation of the capitulum (Oxlade and Clifford, 1981). However, between these stages, when extension growth is minimal and the inflorescence is closed, the scape can grow parallel to the ground (diageotropic) for some or most of its length (Oxlade and Clifford, 1981). The outer tissue layers of T. officinale complex scapes are held in a state of longitudinal tension by internal stem tissues, which are held in a reciprocal state of compression (Niklas and Paolillo, 1998).Fasciation has been recorded in T. officinale complex in two forms, confined to the reproductive tissues of the plant (Dekker and Dekker, 1987). In plants with multiple scapes, the central scapes can be fused together to form one broad (1-2 cm) scape; or inflorescences (2-4) can be fused at their base to form a longitudinal floral structure (Dekker and Dekker, 1987).

 Reproduccion: GeneticsT. officinale complex ranges in ploidy level from diploid to hexaploid (x=8), possessing 16 to 48 individual chromosomes ( Richards, 1973 ). North American individuals of this complex are generally triploid (x=8, 3x=24), and sexual reproduction is rare or may even be absent ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Lyman and Ellstrand, 1984 ). With more than 2000 reported micro-species of this genus in Europe, approximately 90% are polyploids that reproduce asexually by obligate agamospermy (apomixis). The majority of the remaining 10% are diploid species that reproduce sexually and are obligate outcrossers. However, a small number of more primitive forms are capable of self-fertilization ( Hughes and Richards, 1985 ). In T. officinale apomicts, almost every floret automatically produces a seed which is genetically identical to the mother so that mother-daughter lines form 'seed clones' ( Richards, 1973 ; Hughes and Richards, 1988 ; Richards, 1996 ), also known as 'biotypes', which are usually given specific status (for example

-fertilization ( Hughes and Richards, 1985 ). In T. officinale apomicts, almost every floret automatically produces a seed which is genetically identical to the mother so that mother-daughter lines form 'seed clones' ( Richards, 1973 ; Hughes and Richards, 1988 ; Richards, 1996 ), also known as 'biotypes', which are usually given specific status (for example, Dudman and Richards, 1997 ).As Taraxacum species exhibit extremely variable biology and morphology, the genus is treated as many micro-species in Europe, as previously mentioned; however, it is treated as one species exhibiting considerable phenotypic plasticity in North America ( Richards, 1973 ). This extensive variation may be somewhat unexpected since North American populations are generally considered to be apomictic and so do not exchange genes ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Taylor, 1987 ). There are differences of opinion regarding the extent to which the observed variation is due to phenotypic plasticity versus genotypic differentiation arising from multiple introductions of European microspecies ( Taylor, 1987 ). Janzen (1977) suggested that there is very little genetic variation among populations, while Abbott (1979) argued that this assumption is premature. Taylor (1987) stated that intra-populational morphological variation was as great as or greater than inter-populational variation and, therefore, morphological variation was largely due to phenotypic plasticity. However, Kennison (1978) found that in populations from Washington State, variation among populations was consistently greater than variation within populations. Ford (1981a) observed that agamospecies growing in particular habitats differed from site to site in characters such as population flux, survivorship and fecundity. Furthermore, agamospecies represent ecologically highly specialized population units, relevant to a fine scale of heterogeneity of habitat, and two or more agamospecies can coexist in a broad habitat ( Ford 1981b , 1985).

Furthermore, agamospecies represent ecologically highly specialized population units, relevant to a fine scale of heterogeneity of habitat, and two or more agamospecies can coexist in a broad habitat ( Ford 1981b , 1985). Small and Catling (1999) provide an excellent summary of variation in this complex in Canada. King (1993) used restriction enzyme analysis of ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA to assess the relative contribution of hybridization and mutation as sources of genotypic variation in dandelions of North America. She found that multiple hybridization events in populations (prior to their introduction to North America) were a more important source of genotypic variation than mutation in populations.Although sexual reproduction is rare ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ), natural hybrids have been reported to occur between T. officinale complex and T. platycarpum in Japan ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ). More than 90% of the plants classified as T. officinale complex had alleles introduced from T. platycarpum and were morphologically intermediate between the two species with respect to the number of marginal hairs in the outer involucral bract, the length of corniculate appendages on the outer involucral bract, and the size of the seed ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ).Physiology and PhenologyT. officinale complex leaves are rich in fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A and C, the B vitamins thiamine and riboflavin, and protein ( Schmidt, 1979 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Gail, 1994 ). Gail (1994) reported that they are also nature's richest vegetable source of beta-carotene at 0.84 mg/g tissue compared to carrots

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 are rich in fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A and C, the B vitamins thiamine and riboflavin, and protein ( Schmidt, 1979 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Gail, 1994 ). Gail (1994) reported that they are also nature's richest vegetable source of beta-carotene at 0.84 mg/g tissue compared to carrots (Daucus carota) at 0.61 mg/g tissue. They rank above broccoli (Brassica oleracea) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in overall nutritional value ( Haytowitz and Matthews, 1984 ), and Minnich (1983) ranked them out of all vegetables (including grains, seeds and greens) as tied for ninth best, higher than lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Also, the roots of T. officinale complex are rich in iron, copper and other trace elements ( Dwyer, 1977 ). The most prominent therapeutic property of T. officinale complex is the diuretic activity, which is based on the high potassium content of the plant ( Hook et al., 1993 ). It is superior to other diuretics because it reduces the likelihood of hypokalaemia, a common side-effect of many diuretics ( Houghton, 1995 ).The major and trace element content of T. officinale complex alters with growth stage ( Müller and Kirchgessner, 1972 ). In a Finnish study, the vitamin C content was lowest, while dry matter, soluble solids and mineral content were highest in late summer ( Kuusi et al., 1982 ). Dandelion mineral content was investigated by van der Kley (1956) to assess the suitability of this species as feed for livestock. The high amounts of protein and beta-carotene, favourable mineral composition, and low nitrate content throughout the growing season in Poland provided a high value feed ( Falkowski et al., 1990

 in late summer ( Kuusi et al., 1982 ). Dandelion mineral content was investigated by van der Kley (1956) to assess the suitability of this species as feed for livestock. The high amounts of protein and beta-carotene, favourable mineral composition, and low nitrate content throughout the growing season in Poland provided a high value feed ( Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In UK studies, the availability of these elements was equivalent to that in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), a popular forage species ( Wilman and Derrick, 1994 ). T. officinale complex also had a lower proportion of cell walls in dry matter than perennial ryegrass ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). The true dry matter digestibility was as high as that of ryegrass, but the in vivo digestibility was lower ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). T. officinale complex is a C3 species ( Kemp et al., 1977 ). In US studies, plants from different altitudes showed no significant differences in enzyme activity, net photosynthesis, dark respiration, photorespiration, transpiration rates or temperature responses of gas exchange ( Kemp et al., 1977 ; Oulton et al., 1979 ). This is in disagreement with earlier US reports, which indicated that there were differences in the photosynthetic Hill reaction and enzyme activity among the same altitudinally diverse populations ( May and Villarreal, 1974 ; May, 1976 ). Activity of the enzyme invertase, which was only present in the petiole and central midrib of the developing leaf, was correlated with leaf growth rate and its level was controlled by light ( Slabnik, 1981 ). A US study showed that the leaf size of T. officinale complex plants decreased linearly with increasing elevation and a corresponding decline in nocturnal infrared irradiation from the sky ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Differences in plant leaf structure and physiology traditionally

 and central midrib of the developing leaf, was correlated with leaf growth rate and its level was controlled by light ( Slabnik, 1981 ). A US study showed that the leaf size of T. officinale complex plants decreased linearly with increasing elevation and a corresponding decline in nocturnal infrared irradiation from the sky ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Differences in plant leaf structure and physiology traditionally associated with daytime sun exposure may also be influenced by night-time sky exposure and susceptibility to frost ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Red light and far-red light influenced the water exchange of epidermal cells of T. officinale complex and phytochrome appeared to be involved ( Carceller and Sánchez, 1972 ).Various chemicals and cellular structures play roles in the geotropic behaviour of T. officinale complex. UK studies showed that elevated levels of endogenous ethylene were associated with the diageotropic behaviour and reduced extension growth after flowering ( Clifford and Oxlade, 1989 ). There were significant differences in indol-3yl-acetic acid (IAA) levels across the scape after geostimulation, indicating a role for auxin in geotropism ( Clifford et al., 1985 ). In an earlier British study, Clifford and Barclay (1980) showed that amyloplasts (colourless plastids that form starch granules) in the cells of scapes sediment much faster than previously reported and were involved in the initiation of geotropism in T. officinale complex.Plants exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide grew faster, exhibited more deeply incised leaf margins and had relatively more slender leaf laminae than those exposed to ambient levels ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ; Staddon et al., 1999 ). These effects were most pronounced when T. officinale complex plants were grown individually, but detectable differences were also found in plants grown at high density ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). This supports

 faster, exhibited more deeply incised leaf margins and had relatively more slender leaf laminae than those exposed to ambient levels ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ; Staddon et al., 1999 ). These effects were most pronounced when T. officinale complex plants were grown individually, but detectable differences were also found in plants grown at high density ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). This supports the hypothesis that leaf carbohydrate levels play an important role in regulating heteroblastic leaf development, although elevated carbon dioxide may also affect leaf development through direct hormonal interactions or increased leaf water potential ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). However, Teyssonneyre et al. (2002) found that the population of T. officinale complex in a grassland community did not increase in response to elevated CO2.Environmental factors, such as temperature, photoperiod and rainfall, were studied in Finland for their effect on the bitterness of T. officinale complex ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). It was found that increasing temperature and photoperiod and decreasing rainfall were correlated with an increase in bitterness. However, morphological characters such as leaf shape, main nerve breadth and colour of petiole base were not correlated with bitterness ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Growth phase and season had a strong influence on bitterness, with plants being less bitter in spring before flowering than in late summer ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Bitterness in leaves was caused by sesquiterpene lactones, such as taraxinic acid and its glucoside, as well as triterpenoids, such as cycloartenol ( Houghton, 1995 ). Kuusi et al. (1985) identified four bitter compounds: p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, beta-sitosterol, 11,13-dihydrotaraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside
Text Len: 1795
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ide, as well as triterpenoids, such as cycloartenol ( Houghton, 1995 ). Kuusi et al. (1985) identified four bitter compounds: p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, beta-sitosterol, 11,13-dihydrotaraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and taraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (also identified as an allergen (von Hausen, 1982 )). The following triterpene alcohols have been isolated from tissues of T. officinale complex: taraxol, taraxerol, lupeol, taraxasterol, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol. Phenolic acids related to caffeic acid, caffeoyltartaric acids, cinnamic acids, coumarins, flavonoids, beta-fructofuranosidases and the serine proteinase taraxalisin have also been isolated from T. officinale complex tissues ( Burrowes and Simpson, 1938 ; Rutherford and Deacon, 1972 ; Akashi et al., 1994 ; Houghton, 1995 ; Williams et al., 1996 ; Budzianowski, 1997 ; Rudenskaya et al., 1998 ). T. officinale complex is also a valuable source of the essential linolenic acid, apigenin-7-glucoside, lecithin, and cholin ( Houghton, 1995 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1995 ). Unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids such as linolenic acid are important in the chilling-resistant properties of T. officinale complex ( Imai et al., 1995 ).T. officinale complex possesses allelopathic properties that can reduce germination and growth of other plant species ( Dwyer,

olin ( Houghton, 1995 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1995 ). Unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids such as linolenic acid are important in the chilling-resistant properties of T. officinale complex ( Imai et al., 1995 ).T. officinale complex possesses allelopathic properties that can reduce germination and growth of other plant species ( Dwyer, 1977 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In addition, phenolic compounds produced by T. officinale complex are considered responsible for biological control of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in greenhouse tomato plantings in Canadian experiments ( Kasenberg and Traquair, 1988 ). Satisfactory control of this pathogen was achieved when residues of T. officinale complex were incorporated into sterilized greenhouse soil. The mode of action is unknown but it may act directly by secretion of allelochemicals or promotion of antagonistic microflora ( Jarvis, 1989 ). T. officinale complex leaves are capable of producing an anti-fungal toxin called lettucenin A ( Mizutani, 1989 ). It is a stress-induced antifungal sesquiterpenoid that is present in sufficient quantity in dandelion to suppress invasion of a pathogen in vivo ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ). It was found that lettucenin A production started at an early stage of fungal infection, before the appearance of symptoms, and ended soon after the death of the pathogen ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ).Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves in the roots of T. officinale complex fluctuate with the season ( Loomis, 1938 ). The roots remained viable during the winter and acted as a source of nutrients to facilitate the resumption of growth in early spring (Cyr et al., 1990).

awa et al., 1994 ).Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves in the roots of T. officinale complex fluctuate with the season ( Loomis, 1938 ). The roots remained viable during the winter and acted as a source of nutrients to facilitate the resumption of growth in early spring (Cyr et al., 1990). Fructans, storage carbohydrates such as inulin and inulo-n-ose, were synthesized in roots by the enzyme fructan-fructan fructosyl transferase (Lüscher et al., 1993; Ernst et al., 1996 ). This synthesis of inulin was practically unaffected by the height of competing grass vegetation (Molgaard, 1977). High inulin content in roots resulted in high nitrogenase activity ( Vlassek and Jain, 1976 ), which could enrich the soil with nitrogen through asymbiotic nitrogen fixers such as Azotobacter and Clostridium species ( Vlassek and Jain, 1978 ). Fructan hydrolysis occurred during late autumn and provided simple sugars as a readily accessible carbon pool (Cyr et al., 1990). Nitrates, free amino acids and soluble proteins were important vehicles for nitrogen storage (Cyr et al., 1990). Storage reserves remained at peak levels throughout winter and declined prior to the resumption of growth in spring, when inulin was metabolized to provide a high content of mobile fructose and sucrose to enable extensive vegetative growth and flowering (Molgaard, 1977; Cyr et al., 1990). At the time of fruiting, nitrogen reserves were at their lowest concentration ( Loomis, 1938 ). Toward the end of summer, these reserves were restored and the cycle began again ( Rutherford and Deacon, 1974 ). In other studies, it was found that amino acids accumulated in the roots as autumn senescence progressed in the aerial parts of the plant, and declined in spring when regrowth occurred, with large fluctuations in the

 nitrogen reserves were at their lowest concentration ( Loomis, 1938 ). Toward the end of summer, these reserves were restored and the cycle began again ( Rutherford and Deacon, 1974 ). In other studies, it was found that amino acids accumulated in the roots as autumn senescence progressed in the aerial parts of the plant, and declined in spring when regrowth occurred, with large fluctuations in the amides asparagine and glutamine ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990a ). An 18-kDa protein increased in T. officinale complex roots during the autumn months, suggesting that it has a role as a storage compound, possibly in cold protection ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ; Xu et al., 2000 ). The same protein was also found in inflorescences, the vestigial stem and seeds ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ). Interestingly, the protein also possesses properties similar to allergen- and pathogenesis-related proteins ( Xu et al., 2000 ). A UK study showed that leaf compounds of T. officinale complex fluctuated with season, probably due to temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Free 4-demethyl sterols were maximal during the winter months and levels were correlated negatively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Sitosterol ester and cycloartenol ester showed the opposite response, with levels correlating positively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). The scapes contained predominantly beta-sitosterol and beta-amyrin ( Aexel et al., 1967 ).Generally, during the first season of growth, T. officinale complex seedlings produce only leaves, usually in rosettes ( Longyear, 1918 ). In the spring of the second season, and each season thereafter, inflorescences are produced ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, under favourable conditions, some seedlings can bloom in their first year

 ( Aexel et al., 1967 ).Generally, during the first season of growth, T. officinale complex seedlings produce only leaves, usually in rosettes ( Longyear, 1918 ). In the spring of the second season, and each season thereafter, inflorescences are produced ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, under favourable conditions, some seedlings can bloom in their first year (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The first bud may appear at various times and cannot be correlated to leaf index, although the plant has to have formed at least 20 leaves and enlarged its tap root to store the required energy ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ; Solbrig, 1971 ). The time of first flowering is partly dependent on the surrounding plant community and, in undisturbed communities, a plant may not flower until its fourth season ( Gorchakovskii and Abramchuk, 1996 ). In T. officinale complex, flowering occurs over a wide range of photoperiods and light intensities. Studies on seasonal variation in flowering of T. officinale complex showed that plants flowered throughout the year, with most plants flowering in spring when the average daily air temperature was around 16°C and day length was 10-13 h ( Gray et al., 1973 ; AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In the northern hemisphere, this equates to March-May in the UK, April-May in North America, June in Norway and Siberia. A secondary peak occurred in the autumn (September-October), with an average of 21°C and 12-13 h day length ( Gray et al., 1973 ). Therefore, T. officinale complex can be classified as a day-neutral plant ( Listowski and Jackowska 1965 ; Gray et al., 1973 ), although Solbrig (1971) classified it as a short-day plant due to limited flowering during long summer days.

October), with an average of 21°C and 12-13 h day length ( Gray et al., 1973 ). Therefore, T. officinale complex can be classified as a day-neutral plant ( Listowski and Jackowska 1965 ; Gray et al., 1973 ), although Solbrig (1971) classified it as a short-day plant due to limited flowering during long summer days. Individual plants that bloom in spring may also bloom again in autumn ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). Bud formation in these plants occurs during a period of decreasing daylight, when the differentiation of new leaves is limited and existing leaves show symptoms of premature aging ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The time course of the main spring flowering period may vary in different years, partly due to differences in microclimate, such as the amount of sunshine and soil temperature (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Sterk and Luteijn, 1984 ). The number of times the inflorescences open and close, the length of time that the inflorescences remain open each day, and the length of time that the inflorescences remain closed before opening into mature heads, vary with time of year ( Gray et al., 1973 ).The development of buds requires approximately 1 week ( Solbrig, 1971 ). A scape is formed between the base of the bud and the tip of the shoot in about 48 h ( Solbrig, 1971 ). On average, inflorescences open during two or three successive days, after which they remain closed until the seeds mature ( Longyear, 1918 ; Gray et al., 1973 ). The scape and the inflorescence flatten to the ground and, after a couple of days, the scape straightens and the involucral bracts surrounding the closed inflorescence open to reveal seeds ( Solbrig, 1971 ). The time required from the first day of blooming until the seeds ripen and the bracts open to release them, is about 9-

 1973 ). The scape and the inflorescence flatten to the ground and, after a couple of days, the scape straightens and the involucral bracts surrounding the closed inflorescence open to reveal seeds ( Solbrig, 1971 ). The time required from the first day of blooming until the seeds ripen and the bracts open to release them, is about 9-12 d ( Longyear, 1918 ; Beach, 1939 ; Gray et al., 1973 ).A study in Japan showed that at low temperatures, inflorescences opened in response to increasing temperature (thermonasty), while at higher temperatures, they opened in response to light (photonasty) ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). The minimum temperature for photonastic opening was 13°C and inflorescences remained open for 13-14 h ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). At temperatures of 13-18°C, plants were in full bloom and this was most favourable for nectar secretion, pollen production and bee activity ( Kremer, 1950 ). In Michigan, USA, inflorescences were reported to close when the temperature was over 21°C or during adverse weather, and could remain closed for several days and then re-open when climatic conditions were favourable ( Kremer, 1950 ). Once closed, however, they did not open again on the same day ( Kremer, 1950 ).Seeds produced in the spring during the peak flowering period mostly emerged that same spring or did not emerge at all ( Collins, 2000 ). However, seeds produced at other times during the year produced seedlings throughout the year. Seedlings produced in the autumn produced seeds in the spring of the following year. Chepil (1946) and Roberts and Neilson (1981) found that seedlings emerged in most months of the year in Canada and for up to four years after sowing.

 year. Seedlings produced in the autumn produced seeds in the spring of the following year. Chepil (1946) and Roberts and Neilson (1981) found that seedlings emerged in most months of the year in Canada and for up to four years after sowing. Collins (2000) collected ripe, viable seeds from a single population on the University of Western Ontario campus, London, Canada on the following dates in 1999: May 1, 17, 27; June 10; August 20; September 14, 21; October 4, 20; November 5, 22; and December 13. At least 58% of the seeds collected on each date germinated. P Cavers (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal observation) has collected ripe seeds in every month of the year, but not every month in a single year. He concluded that if there is a January or February thaw that lasts for at least a week, then flowering and seed production can occur.The survival and regeneration of root fragments vary seasonally ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Minimum survival of fragments occurred at the time of maximum flowering of the source plants and maximum survival of fragments occurred in the second growing season ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ).Reproductive BiologyAs T. officinale complex is an apomict (the embryo develops without fertilization) and a triploid of hybrid origin, most pollen grains are abortive and sterile, and cannot form pollen tubes ( Solbrig, 1971 ; Jenniskens, 1984 ). Generally, in the Asteraceae, ligulate or ray-florets are sterile, and tubular or disc-florets are fertile. However, in T. officinale complex, there is no distinction between ray- and disc-florets, either in appearance or function, with all florets being ligulate and equally fertile ( Roberts, 1936 ). The ligulate florets are surrounded by inner and outer involuc

 ray-florets are sterile, and tubular or disc-florets are fertile. However, in T. officinale complex, there is no distinction between ray- and disc-florets, either in appearance or function, with all florets being ligulate and equally fertile ( Roberts, 1936 ). The ligulate florets are surrounded by inner and outer involucral bracts that close at night, in overcast weather, when the relative humidity is above 97% or when the temperature is less than 9.4°C. Opening of the inflorescences is inhibited by rain and accelerated by high light intensity ( Percival, 1955 ; Jenniskens et al., 1984 ).In the Peace River region of Alberta, Canada, Szabo (1984) found an average daily production of 59.2 inflorescences/m², which is equivalent to 592,700 inflorescences ha/d and, over a 25-d blooming period, represented a potential production of 14,792,500 inflorescences/ha. On a sunny day, inflorescences opened between 0800 and 0900 h, reached a peak at 1100 to 1200 h and closed gradually from 1500 to 2100 h; but the whole period was shorter on dull days since high light intensity accelerates inflorescence opening ( Percival, 1955 , Szabo, 1984 ). A UK study found that T. officinale complex presented its pollen from 0900 to 1500 h, with the peak period from 1000 to 1100 h ( Percival, 1955 ). Most inflorescences (89%) opened for two consecutive days, some (7%) for 1 d and some (4%) for 3 d ( Szabo, 1984 ). Quantity and concentration of nectar were significantly higher in inflorescences 2 d old than in those 1 d old ( Szabo, 1984 ). Larger inflorescences produced more nectar, and the nectar-sugar concentration and

 inflorescences (89%) opened for two consecutive days, some (7%) for 1 d and some (4%) for 3 d ( Szabo, 1984 ). Quantity and concentration of nectar were significantly higher in inflorescences 2 d old than in those 1 d old ( Szabo, 1984 ). Larger inflorescences produced more nectar, and the nectar-sugar concentration and sugar value increased with increasing temperature ( Szabo, 1984 ). High nectar-foraging activity by honeybees coincided with peak nectar-sugar production ( Szabo, 1984 ), and anthers dehisced over a period of 1-7 d ( Percival, 1955 ).Although stamens and pistils are present and pollen is produced regularly, the seed of T. officinale complex develops without fertilization ( Roberts, 1936 ). Originally, it was thought that seeds were primarily produced by allogamy, and insects such as honeybees and flies were pollinators ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been suggested by UK investigators that insect visitors, attracted by the bright yellow inflorescences, may be needed to trigger seed set ( Williams et al., 1996 ). In a heavily infested area in Canada, the average number of seeds produced by T. officinale complex was 60,000/m², equivalent to about 600,000,000 seeds/ha ( Roberts, 1936 ). Under near optimal conditions, the number of inflorescences/plant ranged from 48 to 146, with an average of 93, while the number of seeds/inflorescence ranged from 130 to 412, with an average of 252 ( Roberts, 1936 ). This provides an average of 23,436 seeds/plant ( Roberts, 1936 ). In UK studies on the reproductive success of T. officinale complex, Bostock and Benton (1979) found that of 185.5 ovules produced/inflorescence, 181.7 seeds were produced, and 178.

 ranged from 130 to 412, with an average of 252 ( Roberts, 1936 ). This provides an average of 23,436 seeds/plant ( Roberts, 1936 ). In UK studies on the reproductive success of T. officinale complex, Bostock and Benton (1979) found that of 185.5 ovules produced/inflorescence, 181.7 seeds were produced, and 178.1 were dispersed. As well, an average of 12.2 inflorescences/plant were observed, resulting in approximately 2,170 seeds/plant being produced during the growing season. Ford (1981b) found that the number of inflorescences/plant, number of seeds/inflorescence and, therefore, the number of seeds/plant varied with the habitat in which Taraxacum agamospecies were found. The number of inflorescences/plant was 7.7 for plants on denuded roadsides, 1.7 for plants on non-denuded roadsides, and only 0.6 for plants in upland sites. Similarly, the number of seeds/inflorescence was 151 for plants growing in denuded roadside sites, as compared to 119 in non-denuded roadside sites, and only 62 in upland sites. Similarly, a US study found that the number of inflorescences/plant and florets/inflorescence depended on the size and vigour of the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ). Small stunted plants growing in dry soil may produce only a single inflorescence with 30 florets/inflorescence; while large clumps of plants along roadsides may produce 50 or more inflorescences at once with more than 200 florets/inflorescence ( Longyear, 1918 ). Collins (2000) found that the mean mass (mg) per seed in the University of Western Ontario, Canada, collection ranged from 0.33 mg in an August collection to 0.68 mg in a late October collection. At

 clumps of plants along roadsides may produce 50 or more inflorescences at once with more than 200 florets/inflorescence ( Longyear, 1918 ). Collins (2000) found that the mean mass (mg) per seed in the University of Western Ontario, Canada, collection ranged from 0.33 mg in an August collection to 0.68 mg in a late October collection. At the peak of flowering in May, it ranged between 0.43 and 0.49 mg. The seeds produced in late October and early November were significantly heavier than those produced at other times of the year. UK reports of seed weights vary, with Salisbury (1961) stating an average weight of 0.8 mg, Bostock (1978) reporting an average seed weight of 0.583 mg, while Sheldon (1974) reported the average seed weighed 0.0549 mg; one tenth as much as in any other report. Also, the average seed was reported as 10.25 mm in length, with a pappus diameter is 6.94 mm ( Sheldon, 1974 ).At least 7 d must elapse after the opening of the inflorescence before most seeds of T. officinale complex are mature enough to germinate ( Longyear, 1918 ). Therefore, if all inflorescences, including those that have closed to ripen the seeds, are removed from the plant (e.g. by mowing), the germination of seeds from the dried inflorescences that have ripened after cutting is only 13% ( Longyear, 1918 ; Roberts, 1936 ). Fully mature seeds of T. officinale complex lack primary dormancy and are able to germinate almost as soon as they leave the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ; Martinková and Honek, 1997). However, the proximity of the seeds to each other influences germination. In a US study, seeds placed singly or in groups of 5, 10 or 25 had ger

 Fully mature seeds of T. officinale complex lack primary dormancy and are able to germinate almost as soon as they leave the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ; Martinková and Honek, 1997). However, the proximity of the seeds to each other influences germination. In a US study, seeds placed singly or in groups of 5, 10 or 25 had germination percentages of 68, 64, 54 and 41%, respectively. This significant decrease in germination with increasing density may be a population-regulating mechanism ( Linhart, 1976 ). Very large populations of T. officinale complex seeds can be found in soil. For example, in the UK, Champness and Morris (1948) found 1,575,000 seeds/ ha in the top 13 cm of soil in a grassland area, and 2,350,000 seeds/ha in the top 18 cm of an arable field, although not all will germinate. The germination capacity of T. officinale complex seeds is generally 80-90% ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ), and Martinková and Honek (1997) reported 94% germination on moist filter paper, 28 d after collection. Most seeds germinate within 1.5 months after dispersal ( Ogawa, 1978 ). However, von Hofsten (quoted by King (1966) ) estimated that, of 10,000-20,000 seeds/m² dispersed into a meadow, only 50-125 would establish successfully. Germination is impaired after passage through the digestive tracts of cattle, with germination of 52%, 31% and 22% after retention in faeces for 5 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively ( Falkowski et al., 1989 , 1990). Germination is also influenced by individual seed weight ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ). There is variation in the weight of seeds produced in a single inflorescence and the heavier

 the digestive tracts of cattle, with germination of 52%, 31% and 22% after retention in faeces for 5 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively ( Falkowski et al., 1989 , 1990). Germination is also influenced by individual seed weight ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ). There is variation in the weight of seeds produced in a single inflorescence and the heavier seeds have a greater probablility of germination ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ).Seeds of T. officinale complex germinate over a wide range of temperatures, from 5 to 35°C ( Mezynski and Cole, 1974 ; Washitani, 1984 ), with less germination at higher temperatures (Martinková and Honek, 1997). Germination does not need vernalization or cold stratification. Most reports indicate that seeds of T. officinale complex germinate best under alternating temperatures and light. Collins (2000) found 85-94% of seeds, from two populations from London, Ontario, Canada, germinated under the following regimes: 15°C/5°C with 9 h light, 25°C/10°C with 14 h light, 35°C/20°C with 15 h light and 25°C/10°C in total darkness. However, other temperature regimes in total darkness led to reduced germination, with only 75% at 35°C/20°C and 43% at 15°C/5°C. Cross (1931) found 75-76% of seeds, collected from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada germinated in alternating temperatures of 30°C/20°C, while only 60-65% germinated at a constant temperature of 18-20°C. Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported maximum germination of fresh seeds, collected from Maryland, USA, at an alternating temperature of 20°C for 16 h and 10°C
Text Len: 1532
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 seeds, collected from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada germinated in alternating temperatures of 30°C/20°C, while only 60-65% germinated at a constant temperature of 18-20°C. Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported maximum germination of fresh seeds, collected from Maryland, USA, at an alternating temperature of 20°C for 16 h and 10°C for 8 h (while seeds stored for 30 d germinated best at 20°C/15°C). Maguire and Overland (1959) found that 92% of seeds, collected from Washington State, USA, germinated at alternating temperatures (30°C/20°C) in alternating light and darkness, but when kept in darkness, there was only 72% germination. Also, at a constant temperature of 15°C in dark, only 4% germination was recorded, but when alternating light and dark was added to the same constant temperature, 96% germination was observed. Two UK studies ( Williams, 1983 ; Thompson, 1989 ) reported similar results. Seed germination was greater, faster and more uniform in light than in dark ( Isselstein, 1992 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ), although dark germination increased with length of storage ( Isselstein, 1992 ). These different findings may reflect variability between biotypes (van Loenhoud and Duyts, 1981 ). In a Swedish study, Noronha et al. (1997) used cold, dark stratification to show that seeds of T. officinale complex have an inducible light requirement for germination. Ecologically, this inducible light requirement is important for preventing the germination of buried seeds in conditions unfavourable to seedling development ( Noronha et al., 1997 ).There are varying reports of the viability of seeds of T. officinale complex after storage. Seeds reportedly germinate best after 3 months dry storage, but

 have an inducible light requirement for germination. Ecologically, this inducible light requirement is important for preventing the germination of buried seeds in conditions unfavourable to seedling development ( Noronha et al., 1997 ).There are varying reports of the viability of seeds of T. officinale complex after storage. Seeds reportedly germinate best after 3 months dry storage, but germination success then decreases with age ( Russwurm and Martin, 1977 ), certainly after 1 year in storage, and rarely germinates after 3 years dry storage at 20°C (AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In another study, following burial of T. officinale complex seeds for varying time periods, a small number of seeds (1%) were still viable for up to 9 yr after burial ( Burnside et al., 1996 ). Typically, 1-6% of T. officinale complex seeds remained viable 4 yr after burial in soil, and soil storage for 5 yr or longer resulted in little detectable viability ( Chepil, 1946 ; Roberts and Neilson, 1981 ). Von Hofsten (1954) found that seeds remained viable longer in the soil (up to 20-30 yr) than when dry-stored indoors. Depth of seed burial was negatively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ), and Russwurm and Martin (1977) found seed can readily germinate under 2 cm of soil. Storage of seeds at room temperature decreased seed viability, compared to storage at 4°C ( Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ). Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported that percentage germination decreased during 30 d storage of seeds at -15°C or 22°C, compared to fresh seeds. Al-Hially (1991) found that the rate of germination increased after 90 d storage. The position of T. officinale complex seeds affects germination, with greatest

 Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ). Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported that percentage germination decreased during 30 d storage of seeds at -15°C or 22°C, compared to fresh seeds. Al-Hially (1991) found that the rate of germination increased after 90 d storage. The position of T. officinale complex seeds affects germination, with greatest germination occurring when there is good contact between the substrate and the scar of attachment of the seed, allowing water uptake ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The hygroscopic pappus can move to alter the seed position as humidity changes and, in high humidity, the pappus closes hygroscopically ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The backward-pointing hairs and teeth of the seed may play a role in firmly anchoring it during seedling establishment ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Increasing soil compaction decreases seed germination, radicle penetration and seedling establishment, partly due to removal of microsites ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Vegetative growth is limited to the formation of multi-rosetted clumps and root fragmentation. The regenerative capacity of T. officinale complex roots has been examined by Naylor (1941) and Khan (1973) . Vegetative propagule weight was positively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ). Root segments that were 1.25 mm in diameter had to be at least 6-10 mm in length to regenerate, and segments as short as 2 mm could regenerate only if they were more than 4 mm in diameter ( Warmke and Warmke, 1950 ). The minimum length for shoot regeneration was 1.5 mm and for root regeneration 2 mm ( Khan, 1969 ). More shoots and roots regenerated from longer root segments than from shorter ones ( Khan, 1969 ). Regenerative capacity decreased as fragment volume decreased (down the length of the root) ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting cuttings in an inverted or

 and Warmke, 1950 ). The minimum length for shoot regeneration was 1.5 mm and for root regeneration 2 mm ( Khan, 1969 ). More shoots and roots regenerated from longer root segments than from shorter ones ( Khan, 1969 ). Regenerative capacity decreased as fragment volume decreased (down the length of the root) ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting cuttings in an inverted or horizontal plane, rather than the normal planting orientation resulted in a decline in regeneration and survival, and an increase in regeneration time ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting depth did not consistently influence regenerative capacity or timing ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Root fragments were highly vigourous and capable of producing new plants even when covered by 5-10 cm of soil ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ; 1990), which may be due to their high sugar content (~11% of dry matter). Therefore, successful physical removal must include the entire root system. T. officinale complex is perennial, but often rather short-lived. Plants can aestivate, overwinter as a reduced basal rosette under snow cover or as seed (Cyr et al., 1990). Colonizers in a seral succession are often killed by later competition.Environmental RequirementsT. officinale complex can tolerate a broad range of climatic conditions ( Simon et al., 1996 ) and is distributed in almost every temperate and subtropical region of the world ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It is tolerant of a very wide range of conditions, from 90 to 2780 mm annual precipitation and 4.3 to 26.6°C average annual temperature. It shows a wide range of adaptability to light, being able to grow vigorously in full sunlight, or in diffused light in the shade of trees or buildings ( Longyear, 1918 ). It can grow in a wide range of soils ( Simon et al., 1996 ) but it flourishes best in moist, good quality loam (

 4.3 to 26.6°C average annual temperature. It shows a wide range of adaptability to light, being able to grow vigorously in full sunlight, or in diffused light in the shade of trees or buildings ( Longyear, 1918 ). It can grow in a wide range of soils ( Simon et al., 1996 ) but it flourishes best in moist, good quality loam ( Jackson, 1982 ). Soil moisture determines its local distribution, with well-watered areas of lawns being especially favourable for its growth ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been recorded pushing up through concrete, hanging from eavestroughs of houses, and growing from cracks in old stone walls ( Jackson 1982 ). Established T. officinale complex plants are very resistant to drought, while young plants are very sensitive and have a limited chance of invading coarse-textured, shallow or rapidly-drying soils (von Hofsten, 1954 ; PB Cavers, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal communication). It grows in soils ranging in pH of 4.2-8.2 ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It can tolerate moderate salinity and can occur in submaritime sites and on the bare verges of salted roadside verges in Europe and the USA. It also shows differential tolerance of heavy metals ( Zhuikova et al., 1999 ). It has been shown to respond positively to K ( Tilman et al., 1999 ), P ( Zaprzalka and Peters, 1982 ) and N ( Lihan and Jezikova, 1991 ) and negatively to Na and Mg ( Panak et al., 1991 ) in the soil. It may grow at sea level or up to an elevation of 6000 m, where it can be found in association with subalpine or alpine native Taraxacum species ( Longyear, 1918 ; Holm et al., 1997 ). In hilly terrain, T. officinale complex

It may grow at sea level or up to an elevation of 6000 m, where it can be found in association with subalpine or alpine native Taraxacum species ( Longyear, 1918 ; Holm et al., 1997 ). In hilly terrain, T. officinale complex occurs more often on ridges than in hollows but this may be due to differential herbivory (e.g. slugs, rodents, grasshoppers) on the gradient, rather than differential effects of competition ( Reader, 1992 ). AssociationsT. officinale complex forms mycorrhizal associations ( Truszkowska, 1951 ; Hawker et al., 1957 ). Three vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Glomus mosseae ( Gange et al., 1994 ), G. intraradices ( Gange, 1999 ) and Pythium ultimum ( Hawker et al., 1957 ), have been reported on T. officinale complex. Infection by G. mosseae and G. intraradices conferred some degree of resistance in T. officinale complex roots to larvae of the black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus ( Gange et al., 1994 ; Gange, 1999 ). Either fungus inoculated alone caused a significant reduction in larval growth and survival, but when both fungi were inoculated together, the effect disappeared, possibly due to competition between the fungi ( Gange, 1999 ). There have been some recent studies on the mycorrhizal interactions of T. officinale complex, including the effect of elevated carbon dioxide levels on mycorrhizal function ( Staddon et al., 1999 ); the effect of non-host and host plants on mycorrhizal colonization ( Fontenla et al., 1999 ); and the effect of

 ( Gange, 1999 ). There have been some recent studies on the mycorrhizal interactions of T. officinale complex, including the effect of elevated carbon dioxide levels on mycorrhizal function ( Staddon et al., 1999 ); the effect of non-host and host plants on mycorrhizal colonization ( Fontenla et al., 1999 ); and the effect of T. officinale complex on mycorrhiza inoculum potential, soil aggregation and yield of maize ( Kabir and Koide, 2000 ).T. officinale complex has an impact on the relationship between the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata and its prey, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in lucerne ( Harmon et al., 2000 ). It is thought that the omnivorous ladybirds are attracted to dandelion as a pollen resource, and the pea aphids suffer greater predation because they are in the same area.T. officinale complex provides an alternative host to several important viruses, so that it can act as a reservoir and contagion for insect- and nematode-borne disease. These include Tomato ring spot virus, spread by Xiphinema americanum ( Mountain et al., 1992 ; Ramsdell et al., 1993 and many earlier reports); Tomato spotted wilt virus and Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus which infect many agricultural, ornamental and greenhouse crops ( Murphy et al., 1999 ; Groves et al., 2002 ); Beet western yellows virus in Brassica napa ( Polák and Májková, 1992 ); Beet pseudo-yellows virus in Cucumis melo ( Soria et al., 1991 ); Lettuce mosaic virus in Iraq ( Shawkat et al., 1982 ); Dandelion yellow mosaic virus in lettuce ( Bos et al., 1983 ); Lettuce pseudoyellows virus, which infect

It may also act as an alternative host for boll weevils ( Haynes and Smith, 1992 ), cabbage looper, yellow-striped armyworm ( Dussourd and Denno, 1994 ), green peach aphid ( Kaakeh and Hogmire, 1991 ), larvae of the apple moth pest Lacanobia subjuncta ( Landolt, 2002 ), Pseudomonas viridiflava, which causes bacterial streak and bulb rot of onion ( Gitaitis et al., 1998 ), and other microorganisms.

North American individuals of this complex are generally triploid (x=8, 3x=24), and sexual reproduction is rare or may even be absent ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Lyman and Ellstrand, 1984 ). With more than 2000 reported micro-species of this genus in Europe, approximately 90% are polyploids that reproduce asexually by obligate agamospermy (apomixis). The majority of

x=8, 3x=24), and sexual reproduction is rare or may even be absent ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Lyman and Ellstrand, 1984 ). With more than 2000 reported micro-species of this genus in Europe, approximately 90% are polyploids that reproduce asexually by obligate agamospermy (apomixis). The majority of the remaining 10% are diploid species that reproduce sexually and are obligate outcrossers. However, a small number of more primitive forms are capable of self-fertilization ( Hughes and Richards, 1985 ). In T. officinale apomicts, almost every floret automatically produces a seed which is genetically identical to the mother so that mother-daughter lines form 'seed clones' ( Richards, 1973 ; Hughes and Richards, 1988 ; Richards, 1996 ), also known as 'biotypes', which are usually given specific status (for example, Dudman and Richards, 1997 ).As Taraxacum species exhibit extremely variable biology and morphology, the genus is treated as many micro-species in Europe, as previously mentioned; however, it is treated as one species exhibiting considerable phenotypic plasticity in North America ( Richards, 1973 ). This extensive variation may be somewhat unexpected since North American populations are generally considered to be apomictic and so do not exchange genes ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ; Taylor, 1987 ). There are differences of opinion regarding the extent to which the observed variation is due to phenotypic plasticity versus genotypic differentiation arising from multiple introductions of European microspecies ( Taylor, 1987 ). Janzen (1977) suggested that there is very little genetic variation among populations, while Abbott (1979) argued that this assumption is premature. Taylor (1987) stated that intra-populational morphological variation was as great as or greater than inter-populational variation and, therefore, morphological variation was largely due to phenotyp

 multiple introductions of European microspecies ( Taylor, 1987 ). Janzen (1977) suggested that there is very little genetic variation among populations, while Abbott (1979) argued that this assumption is premature. Taylor (1987) stated that intra-populational morphological variation was as great as or greater than inter-populational variation and, therefore, morphological variation was largely due to phenotypic plasticity. However, Kennison (1978) found that in populations from Washington State, variation among populations was consistently greater than variation within populations. Ford (1981a) observed that agamospecies growing in particular habitats differed from site to site in characters such as population flux, survivorship and fecundity. Furthermore, agamospecies represent ecologically highly specialized population units, relevant to a fine scale of heterogeneity of habitat, and two or more agamospecies can coexist in a broad habitat ( Ford 1981b , 1985). Small and Catling (1999) provide an excellent summary of variation in this complex in Canada. King (1993) used restriction enzyme analysis of ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA to assess the relative contribution of hybridization and mutation as sources of genotypic variation in dandelions of North America. She found that multiple hybridization events in populations (prior to their introduction to North America) were a more important source of genotypic variation than mutation in populations.Although sexual reproduction is rare ( Solbrig and Simpson, 1974 ), natural hybrids have been reported to occur between T. officinale complex and T. platycarpum in Japan ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ). More than 90% of the plants classified as T. officinale complex had alleles introduced from T. platycarpum and were morphologically intermediate between the two species with respect to the number of marginal hairs in the outer involucral bract, the length of corniculate appendages on the outer

 platycarpum in Japan ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ). More than 90% of the plants classified as T. officinale complex had alleles introduced from T. platycarpum and were morphologically intermediate between the two species with respect to the number of marginal hairs in the outer involucral bract, the length of corniculate appendages on the outer involucral bract, and the size of the seed ( Watanabe et al., 1997 ).Physiology and PhenologyT. officinale complex leaves are rich in fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A and C, the B vitamins thiamine and riboflavin, and protein ( Schmidt, 1979 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Gail, 1994 ). Gail (1994) reported that they are also nature's richest vegetable source of beta-carotene at 0.84 mg/g tissue compared to carrots (Daucus carota) at 0.61 mg/g tissue. They rank above broccoli (Brassica oleracea) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in overall nutritional value ( Haytowitz and Matthews, 1984 ), and Minnich (1983) ranked them out of all vegetables (including grains, seeds and greens) as tied for ninth best, higher than lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Also, the roots of T. officinale complex are rich in iron, copper and other trace elements ( Dwyer, 1977 ). The most prominent therapeutic property of T. officinale complex is the diuretic activity, which is based on the high potassium content of the plant ( Hook et al., 1993 ). It is superior to other diuretics because it reduces the likelihood of hypokalaemia, a common side-effect of many diuretics ( Houghton, 1995 ).The major and trace element content of T. officinale complex alters with growth stage ( Müller

 the diuretic activity, which is based on the high potassium content of the plant ( Hook et al., 1993 ). It is superior to other diuretics because it reduces the likelihood of hypokalaemia, a common side-effect of many diuretics ( Houghton, 1995 ).The major and trace element content of T. officinale complex alters with growth stage ( Müller and Kirchgessner, 1972 ). In a Finnish study, the vitamin C content was lowest, while dry matter, soluble solids and mineral content were highest in late summer ( Kuusi et al., 1982 ). Dandelion mineral content was investigated by van der Kley (1956) to assess the suitability of this species as feed for livestock. The high amounts of protein and beta-carotene, favourable mineral composition, and low nitrate content throughout the growing season in Poland provided a high value feed ( Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In UK studies, the availability of these elements was equivalent to that in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), a popular forage species ( Wilman and Derrick, 1994 ). T. officinale complex also had a lower proportion of cell walls in dry matter than perennial ryegrass ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). The true dry matter digestibility was as high as that of ryegrass, but the in vivo digestibility was lower ( Derrick et al., 1993 ). T. officinale complex is a C3 species ( Kemp et al., 1977 ). In US studies, plants from different altitudes showed no significant differences in enzyme activity, net photosynthesis, dark respiration, photorespiration, transpiration rates or temperature responses of gas exchange ( Kemp et al., 1977 ; Oulton et al., 1979 ). This is in disagreement with earlier US reports, which indicated that there were differences in the photosynthetic Hill reaction and enzyme activity among the same altitud

, plants from different altitudes showed no significant differences in enzyme activity, net photosynthesis, dark respiration, photorespiration, transpiration rates or temperature responses of gas exchange ( Kemp et al., 1977 ; Oulton et al., 1979 ). This is in disagreement with earlier US reports, which indicated that there were differences in the photosynthetic Hill reaction and enzyme activity among the same altitudinally diverse populations ( May and Villarreal, 1974 ; May, 1976 ). Activity of the enzyme invertase, which was only present in the petiole and central midrib of the developing leaf, was correlated with leaf growth rate and its level was controlled by light ( Slabnik, 1981 ). A US study showed that the leaf size of T. officinale complex plants decreased linearly with increasing elevation and a corresponding decline in nocturnal infrared irradiation from the sky ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Differences in plant leaf structure and physiology traditionally associated with daytime sun exposure may also be influenced by night-time sky exposure and susceptibility to frost ( Jordan and Smith, 1995 ). Red light and far-red light influenced the water exchange of epidermal cells of T. officinale complex and phytochrome appeared to be involved ( Carceller and Sánchez, 1972 ).Various chemicals and cellular structures play roles in the geotropic behaviour of T. officinale complex. UK studies showed that elevated levels of endogenous ethylene were associated with the diageotropic behaviour and reduced extension growth after flowering ( Clifford and Oxlade, 1989 ). There were significant differences in indol-3yl-acetic acid (IAA) levels across the scape after geostimulation, indicating a role for auxin in geotropism ( Clifford et al., 1985 ). In an earlier British study, Clifford and Barclay (1980) showed that amyloplasts (colourless plastids that form starch granules) in the cells of scapes sediment

 in indol-3yl-acetic acid (IAA) levels across the scape after geostimulation, indicating a role for auxin in geotropism ( Clifford et al., 1985 ). In an earlier British study, Clifford and Barclay (1980) showed that amyloplasts (colourless plastids that form starch granules) in the cells of scapes sediment much faster than previously reported and were involved in the initiation of geotropism in T. officinale complex.Plants exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide grew faster, exhibited more deeply incised leaf margins and had relatively more slender leaf laminae than those exposed to ambient levels ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ; Staddon et al., 1999 ). These effects were most pronounced when T. officinale complex plants were grown individually, but detectable differences were also found in plants grown at high density ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). This supports the hypothesis that leaf carbohydrate levels play an important role in regulating heteroblastic leaf development, although elevated carbon dioxide may also affect leaf development through direct hormonal interactions or increased leaf water potential ( Thomas and Bazzaz, 1996 ). However, Teyssonneyre et al. (2002) found that the population of T. officinale complex in a grassland community did not increase in response to elevated CO2.Environmental factors, such as temperature, photoperiod and rainfall, were studied in Finland for their effect on the bitterness of T. officinale complex ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). It was found that increasing temperature and photoperiod and decreasing rainfall were correlated with an increase in bitterness. However, morphological characters such as leaf shape, main nerve breadth and colour of petiole base were not correlated with bitterness ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Growth phase and season had a strong influence on bitterness, with plants being less bitter in spring before flowering than in late summer ( Kuus

 that increasing temperature and photoperiod and decreasing rainfall were correlated with an increase in bitterness. However, morphological characters such as leaf shape, main nerve breadth and colour of petiole base were not correlated with bitterness ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Growth phase and season had a strong influence on bitterness, with plants being less bitter in spring before flowering than in late summer ( Kuusi and Autio, 1985 ). Bitterness in leaves was caused by sesquiterpene lactones, such as taraxinic acid and its glucoside, as well as triterpenoids, such as cycloartenol ( Houghton, 1995 ). Kuusi et al. (1985) identified four bitter compounds: p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, beta-sitosterol, 11,13-dihydrotaraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and taraxine acid 1'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (also identified as an allergen (von Hausen, 1982 )). The following triterpene alcohols have been isolated from tissues of T. officinale complex: taraxol, taraxerol, lupeol, taraxasterol, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol. Phenolic acids related to caffeic acid, caffeoyltartaric acids, cinnamic acids, coumarins, flavonoids, beta-fructofuranosidases and the serine proteinase taraxalisin have also been isolated from T. officinale complex tissues ( Burrowes and Simpson, 1938 ; Rutherford and Deacon, 1972 ; Akashi et al., 1994 ; Houghton, 1995 ; Williams et al., 1996 ; Budzianowski, 1997 ; Rudenskaya et al., 1998 ). T. officin
Text Len: 1456
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uranosidases and the serine proteinase taraxalisin have also been isolated from T. officinale complex tissues ( Burrowes and Simpson, 1938 ; Rutherford and Deacon, 1972 ; Akashi et al., 1994 ; Houghton, 1995 ; Williams et al., 1996 ; Budzianowski, 1997 ; Rudenskaya et al., 1998 ). T. officinale complex is also a valuable source of the essential linolenic acid, apigenin-7-glucoside, lecithin, and cholin ( Houghton, 1995 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1995 ). Unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids such as linolenic acid are important in the chilling-resistant properties of T. officinale complex ( Imai et al., 1995 ).T. officinale complex possesses allelopathic properties that can reduce germination and growth of other plant species ( Dwyer, 1977 ; Jackson, 1982 ; Falkowski et al., 1990 ). In addition, phenolic compounds produced by T. officinale complex are considered responsible for biological control of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in greenhouse tomato plantings in Canadian experiments ( Kasenberg and Traquair, 1988 ). Satisfactory control of this pathogen was achieved when residues of T. officinale complex were incorporated into sterilized greenhouse soil. The mode of action is unknown but it may act directly by secretion of allelochemicals or promotion of antagonistic microflora ( Jarvis, 1989 ). T. officinale complex leaves are capable of producing an anti-fungal toxin called lettucenin A ( Mizutani, 1989 ). It is a stress-induced antifungal sesquiterpenoid that is present in sufficient quantity in dandelion to suppress invasion of a pathogen in vivo ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ). It was found that lett

 ). T. officinale complex leaves are capable of producing an anti-fungal toxin called lettucenin A ( Mizutani, 1989 ). It is a stress-induced antifungal sesquiterpenoid that is present in sufficient quantity in dandelion to suppress invasion of a pathogen in vivo ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ). It was found that lettucenin A production started at an early stage of fungal infection, before the appearance of symptoms, and ended soon after the death of the pathogen ( Hanawa et al., 1994 ).Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves in the roots of T. officinale complex fluctuate with the season ( Loomis, 1938 ). The roots remained viable during the winter and acted as a source of nutrients to facilitate the resumption of growth in early spring (Cyr et al., 1990). Fructans, storage carbohydrates such as inulin and inulo-n-ose, were synthesized in roots by the enzyme fructan-fructan fructosyl transferase (Lüscher et al., 1993; Ernst et al., 1996 ). This synthesis of inulin was practically unaffected by the height of competing grass vegetation (Molgaard, 1977). High inulin content in roots resulted in high nitrogenase activity ( Vlassek and Jain, 1976 ), which could enrich the soil with nitrogen through asymbiotic nitrogen fixers such as Azotobacter and Clostridium species ( Vlassek and Jain, 1978 ). Fructan hydrolysis occurred during late autumn and provided simple sugars as a readily accessible carbon pool (Cyr et al., 1990). Nitrates, free amino acids and soluble proteins were important vehicles for nitrogen storage (Cyr et al., 1990). Storage reserves remained at peak levels throughout winter and declined prior to the resumption of growth in spring, when inulin was metabolized to provide a high content of

 hydrolysis occurred during late autumn and provided simple sugars as a readily accessible carbon pool (Cyr et al., 1990). Nitrates, free amino acids and soluble proteins were important vehicles for nitrogen storage (Cyr et al., 1990). Storage reserves remained at peak levels throughout winter and declined prior to the resumption of growth in spring, when inulin was metabolized to provide a high content of mobile fructose and sucrose to enable extensive vegetative growth and flowering (Molgaard, 1977; Cyr et al., 1990). At the time of fruiting, nitrogen reserves were at their lowest concentration ( Loomis, 1938 ). Toward the end of summer, these reserves were restored and the cycle began again ( Rutherford and Deacon, 1974 ). In other studies, it was found that amino acids accumulated in the roots as autumn senescence progressed in the aerial parts of the plant, and declined in spring when regrowth occurred, with large fluctuations in the amides asparagine and glutamine ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990a ). An 18-kDa protein increased in T. officinale complex roots during the autumn months, suggesting that it has a role as a storage compound, possibly in cold protection ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ; Xu et al., 2000 ). The same protein was also found in inflorescences, the vestigial stem and seeds ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990b ). Interestingly, the protein also possesses properties similar to allergen- and pathogenesis-related proteins ( Xu et al., 2000 ). A UK study showed that leaf compounds of T. officinale complex fluctuated with season, probably due to temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Free 4-demethyl sterols were maximal during the winter months and levels were correlated negatively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Sitosterol ester and cycloartenol ester showed the opposite response, with levels

 that leaf compounds of T. officinale complex fluctuated with season, probably due to temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Free 4-demethyl sterols were maximal during the winter months and levels were correlated negatively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). Sitosterol ester and cycloartenol ester showed the opposite response, with levels correlating positively with sunshine and temperature ( Westerman and Roddick, 1981 ). The scapes contained predominantly beta-sitosterol and beta-amyrin ( Aexel et al., 1967 ).Generally, during the first season of growth, T. officinale complex seedlings produce only leaves, usually in rosettes ( Longyear, 1918 ). In the spring of the second season, and each season thereafter, inflorescences are produced ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, under favourable conditions, some seedlings can bloom in their first year (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The first bud may appear at various times and cannot be correlated to leaf index, although the plant has to have formed at least 20 leaves and enlarged its tap root to store the required energy ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ; Solbrig, 1971 ). The time of first flowering is partly dependent on the surrounding plant community and, in undisturbed communities, a plant may not flower until its fourth season ( Gorchakovskii and Abramchuk, 1996 ). In T. officinale complex, flowering occurs over a wide range of photoperiods and light intensities. Studies on seasonal variation in flowering of T. officinale complex showed that plants flowered throughout the year, with most plants flowering in spring when the average daily air temperature was around 16°C and day length was 10-13 h ( Gray et al., 1973 ; AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In the northern hemisphere, this

operiods and light intensities. Studies on seasonal variation in flowering of T. officinale complex showed that plants flowered throughout the year, with most plants flowering in spring when the average daily air temperature was around 16°C and day length was 10-13 h ( Gray et al., 1973 ; AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In the northern hemisphere, this equates to March-May in the UK, April-May in North America, June in Norway and Siberia. A secondary peak occurred in the autumn (September-October), with an average of 21°C and 12-13 h day length ( Gray et al., 1973 ). Therefore, T. officinale complex can be classified as a day-neutral plant ( Listowski and Jackowska 1965 ; Gray et al., 1973 ), although Solbrig (1971) classified it as a short-day plant due to limited flowering during long summer days. Individual plants that bloom in spring may also bloom again in autumn ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). Bud formation in these plants occurs during a period of decreasing daylight, when the differentiation of new leaves is limited and existing leaves show symptoms of premature aging ( Listowski and Jackowska, 1965 ). The time course of the main spring flowering period may vary in different years, partly due to differences in microclimate, such as the amount of sunshine and soil temperature (von Hofsten, 1954 ; Sterk and Luteijn, 1984 ). The number of times the inflorescences open and close, the length of time that the inflorescences remain open each day, and the length of time that the inflorescences remain closed before opening into mature heads, vary with time of year ( Gray et al., 1973 ).The development of buds requires approximately 1 week ( Solbrig, 1971 ). A scape is formed between the base of the bud and the tip of the shoot in about 48 h ( Solbrig, 1971 ).

orescences remain open each day, and the length of time that the inflorescences remain closed before opening into mature heads, vary with time of year ( Gray et al., 1973 ).The development of buds requires approximately 1 week ( Solbrig, 1971 ). A scape is formed between the base of the bud and the tip of the shoot in about 48 h ( Solbrig, 1971 ). On average, inflorescences open during two or three successive days, after which they remain closed until the seeds mature ( Longyear, 1918 ; Gray et al., 1973 ). The scape and the inflorescence flatten to the ground and, after a couple of days, the scape straightens and the involucral bracts surrounding the closed inflorescence open to reveal seeds ( Solbrig, 1971 ). The time required from the first day of blooming until the seeds ripen and the bracts open to release them, is about 9-12 d ( Longyear, 1918 ; Beach, 1939 ; Gray et al., 1973 ).A study in Japan showed that at low temperatures, inflorescences opened in response to increasing temperature (thermonasty), while at higher temperatures, they opened in response to light (photonasty) ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). The minimum temperature for photonastic opening was 13°C and inflorescences remained open for 13-14 h ( Tanaka et al., 1988 ). At temperatures of 13-18°C, plants were in full bloom and this was most favourable for nectar secretion, pollen production and bee activity ( Kremer, 1950 ). In Michigan, USA, inflorescences were reported to close when the temperature was over 21°C or during adverse weather, and could remain closed for several days and then re-open when climatic conditions were favourable ( Kremer, 1950 ). Once closed, however, they did not open again on the same day ( Kremer, 1950 ).Seeds produced in the spring during the peak

 1950 ). In Michigan, USA, inflorescences were reported to close when the temperature was over 21°C or during adverse weather, and could remain closed for several days and then re-open when climatic conditions were favourable ( Kremer, 1950 ). Once closed, however, they did not open again on the same day ( Kremer, 1950 ).Seeds produced in the spring during the peak flowering period mostly emerged that same spring or did not emerge at all ( Collins, 2000 ). However, seeds produced at other times during the year produced seedlings throughout the year. Seedlings produced in the autumn produced seeds in the spring of the following year. Chepil (1946) and Roberts and Neilson (1981) found that seedlings emerged in most months of the year in Canada and for up to four years after sowing. Collins (2000) collected ripe, viable seeds from a single population on the University of Western Ontario campus, London, Canada on the following dates in 1999: May 1, 17, 27; June 10; August 20; September 14, 21; October 4, 20; November 5, 22; and December 13. At least 58% of the seeds collected on each date germinated. P Cavers (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal observation) has collected ripe seeds in every month of the year, but not every month in a single year. He concluded that if there is a January or February thaw that lasts for at least a week, then flowering and seed production can occur.The survival and regeneration of root fragments vary seasonally ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Minimum survival of fragments occurred at the time of maximum flowering of the source plants and maximum survival of fragments occurred in the second growing season ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ).Reproductive BiologyAs T. officinale complex is an apomict (the embryo develops without fertilization) and a triploid of hybrid origin, most pollen grains are

ally ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Minimum survival of fragments occurred at the time of maximum flowering of the source plants and maximum survival of fragments occurred in the second growing season ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ).Reproductive BiologyAs T. officinale complex is an apomict (the embryo develops without fertilization) and a triploid of hybrid origin, most pollen grains are abortive and sterile, and cannot form pollen tubes ( Solbrig, 1971 ; Jenniskens, 1984 ). Generally, in the Asteraceae, ligulate or ray-florets are sterile, and tubular or disc-florets are fertile. However, in T. officinale complex, there is no distinction between ray- and disc-florets, either in appearance or function, with all florets being ligulate and equally fertile ( Roberts, 1936 ). The ligulate florets are surrounded by inner and outer involucral bracts that close at night, in overcast weather, when the relative humidity is above 97% or when the temperature is less than 9.4°C. Opening of the inflorescences is inhibited by rain and accelerated by high light intensity ( Percival, 1955 ; Jenniskens et al., 1984 ).In the Peace River region of Alberta, Canada, Szabo (1984) found an average daily production of 59.2 inflorescences/m², which is equivalent to 592,700 inflorescences ha/d and, over a 25-d blooming period, represented a potential production of 14,792,500 inflorescences/ha. On a sunny day, inflorescences opened between 0800 and 0900 h, reached a peak at 1100 to 1200 h and closed gradually from 1500 to 2100 h; but the whole period was shorter on dull days since high light intensity accelerates inflorescence opening ( Percival, 1955 , Szabo, 1984 ). A UK study found that

 14,792,500 inflorescences/ha. On a sunny day, inflorescences opened between 0800 and 0900 h, reached a peak at 1100 to 1200 h and closed gradually from 1500 to 2100 h; but the whole period was shorter on dull days since high light intensity accelerates inflorescence opening ( Percival, 1955 , Szabo, 1984 ). A UK study found that T. officinale complex presented its pollen from 0900 to 1500 h, with the peak period from 1000 to 1100 h ( Percival, 1955 ). Most inflorescences (89%) opened for two consecutive days, some (7%) for 1 d and some (4%) for 3 d ( Szabo, 1984 ). Quantity and concentration of nectar were significantly higher in inflorescences 2 d old than in those 1 d old ( Szabo, 1984 ). Larger inflorescences produced more nectar, and the nectar-sugar concentration and sugar value increased with increasing temperature ( Szabo, 1984 ). High nectar-foraging activity by honeybees coincided with peak nectar-sugar production ( Szabo, 1984 ), and anthers dehisced over a period of 1-7 d ( Percival, 1955 ).Although stamens and pistils are present and pollen is produced regularly, the seed of T. officinale complex develops without fertilization ( Roberts, 1936 ). Originally, it was thought that seeds were primarily produced by allogamy, and insects such as honeybees and flies were pollinators ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been suggested by UK investigators that insect visitors, attracted by the bright yellow inflorescences, may be needed to trigger seed set ( Williams et al., 1996 ). In a heavily infested area in Canada, the average number of seeds produced by T. officinale complex was 60,000/m², equivalent to about 600,000,000 seeds/ha ( Roberts, 1936 ). Under

 has been suggested by UK investigators that insect visitors, attracted by the bright yellow inflorescences, may be needed to trigger seed set ( Williams et al., 1996 ). In a heavily infested area in Canada, the average number of seeds produced by T. officinale complex was 60,000/m², equivalent to about 600,000,000 seeds/ha ( Roberts, 1936 ). Under near optimal conditions, the number of inflorescences/plant ranged from 48 to 146, with an average of 93, while the number of seeds/inflorescence ranged from 130 to 412, with an average of 252 ( Roberts, 1936 ). This provides an average of 23,436 seeds/plant ( Roberts, 1936 ). In UK studies on the reproductive success of T. officinale complex, Bostock and Benton (1979) found that of 185.5 ovules produced/inflorescence, 181.7 seeds were produced, and 178.1 were dispersed. As well, an average of 12.2 inflorescences/plant were observed, resulting in approximately 2,170 seeds/plant being produced during the growing season. Ford (1981b) found that the number of inflorescences/plant, number of seeds/inflorescence and, therefore, the number of seeds/plant varied with the habitat in which Taraxacum agamospecies were found. The number of inflorescences/plant was 7.7 for plants on denuded roadsides, 1.7 for plants on non-denuded roadsides, and only 0.6 for plants in upland sites. Similarly, the number of seeds/inflorescence was 151 for plants growing in denuded roadside sites, as compared to 119 in non-denuded roadside sites, and only 62 in upland sites. Similarly, a US study found that the number of inflorescences/plant and florets/inflorescence depended on the size and vigour of the plant

 plants in upland sites. Similarly, the number of seeds/inflorescence was 151 for plants growing in denuded roadside sites, as compared to 119 in non-denuded roadside sites, and only 62 in upland sites. Similarly, a US study found that the number of inflorescences/plant and florets/inflorescence depended on the size and vigour of the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ). Small stunted plants growing in dry soil may produce only a single inflorescence with 30 florets/inflorescence; while large clumps of plants along roadsides may produce 50 or more inflorescences at once with more than 200 florets/inflorescence ( Longyear, 1918 ). Collins (2000) found that the mean mass (mg) per seed in the University of Western Ontario, Canada, collection ranged from 0.33 mg in an August collection to 0.68 mg in a late October collection. At the peak of flowering in May, it ranged between 0.43 and 0.49 mg. The seeds produced in late October and early November were significantly heavier than those produced at other times of the year. UK reports of seed weights vary, with Salisbury (1961) stating an average weight of 0.8 mg, Bostock (1978) reporting an average seed weight of 0.583 mg, while Sheldon (1974) reported the average seed weighed 0.0549 mg; one tenth as much as in any other report. Also, the average seed was reported as 10.25 mm in length, with a pappus diameter is 6.94 mm ( Sheldon, 1974 ).At least 7 d must elapse after the opening of the inflorescence before most seeds of T. officinale complex are mature enough to germinate ( Longyear, 1918 ). Therefore, if all inflorescences, including those that have closed to ripen the seeds, are removed from the plant (e.g. by m

us diameter is 6.94 mm ( Sheldon, 1974 ).At least 7 d must elapse after the opening of the inflorescence before most seeds of T. officinale complex are mature enough to germinate ( Longyear, 1918 ). Therefore, if all inflorescences, including those that have closed to ripen the seeds, are removed from the plant (e.g. by mowing), the germination of seeds from the dried inflorescences that have ripened after cutting is only 13% ( Longyear, 1918 ; Roberts, 1936 ). Fully mature seeds of T. officinale complex lack primary dormancy and are able to germinate almost as soon as they leave the plant ( Longyear, 1918 ; Martinková and Honek, 1997). However, the proximity of the seeds to each other influences germination. In a US study, seeds placed singly or in groups of 5, 10 or 25 had germination percentages of 68, 64, 54 and 41%, respectively. This significant decrease in germination with increasing density may be a population-regulating mechanism ( Linhart, 1976 ). Very large populations of T. officinale complex seeds can be found in soil. For example, in the UK, Champness and Morris (1948) found 1,575,000 seeds/ ha in the top 13 cm of soil in a grassland area, and 2,350,000 seeds/ha in the top 18 cm of an arable field, although not all will germinate. The germination capacity of T. officinale complex seeds is generally 80-90% ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ), and Martinková and Honek (1997) reported 94% germination on moist filter paper, 28 d after collection. Most seeds germinate within 1.5 months after dispersal ( Ogawa, 1978 ). However, von Hofsten (quoted by King (1966) ) estimated that,

ale complex seeds is generally 80-90% ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ), and Martinková and Honek (1997) reported 94% germination on moist filter paper, 28 d after collection. Most seeds germinate within 1.5 months after dispersal ( Ogawa, 1978 ). However, von Hofsten (quoted by King (1966) ) estimated that, of 10,000-20,000 seeds/m² dispersed into a meadow, only 50-125 would establish successfully. Germination is impaired after passage through the digestive tracts of cattle, with germination of 52%, 31% and 22% after retention in faeces for 5 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively ( Falkowski et al., 1989 , 1990). Germination is also influenced by individual seed weight ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ). There is variation in the weight of seeds produced in a single inflorescence and the heavier seeds have a greater probablility of germination ( Tweney and Mogie, 1999 ).Seeds of T. officinale complex germinate over a wide range of temperatures, from 5 to 35°C ( Mezynski and Cole, 1974 ; Washitani, 1984 ), with less germination at higher temperatures (Martinková and Honek, 1997). Germination does not need vernalization or cold stratification. Most reports indicate that seeds of T. officinale complex germinate best under alternating temperatures and light. Collins (2000) found 85-94% of seeds, from two populations from London, Ontario, Canada, germinated under the following regimes: 15°C/5°C with 9 h light, 25°C/10°C with 14 h light, 35°C/20°C with 15 h light and 25°C/10°C in total darkness. However, other temperature regimes in total darkness led to reduced germination, with only

However, other temperature regimes in total darkness led to reduced germination, with only 75% at 35°C/20°C and 43% at 15°C/5°C. Cross (1931) found 75-76% of seeds, collected from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada germinated in alternating temperatures of 30°C/20°C, while only 60-65% germinated at a constant temperature of 18-20°C. Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported maximum germination of fresh seeds, collected from Maryland, USA, at an alternating temperature of 20°C for 16 h and 10°C for 8 h (while seeds stored for 30 d germinated best at 20°C/15°C). Maguire and Overland (1959) found that 92% of seeds, collected from Washington State, USA, germinated at alternating temperatures (30°C/20°C) in alternating light and darkness, but when kept in darkness, there was only 72% germination. Also, at a constant temperature of 15°C in dark, only 4% germination was recorded, but when alternating light and dark was added to the same constant temperature, 96% germination was observed. Two UK studies ( Williams, 1983 ; Thompson, 1989 ) reported similar results. Seed germination was greater, faster and more uniform in light than in dark ( Isselstein, 1992 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ), although dark germination increased with length of storage ( Isselstein, 1992 ). These different findings may reflect variability between biotypes (van Loenhoud and Duyts,

 Williams, 1983 ; Thompson, 1989 ) reported similar results. Seed germination was greater, faster and more uniform in light than in dark ( Isselstein, 1992 ; Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ), although dark germination increased with length of storage ( Isselstein, 1992 ). These different findings may reflect variability between biotypes (van Loenhoud and Duyts, 1981 ). In a Swedish study, Noronha et al. (1997) used cold, dark stratification to show that seeds of T. officinale complex have an inducible light requirement for germination. Ecologically, this inducible light requirement is important for preventing the germination of buried seeds in conditions unfavourable to seedling development ( Noronha et al., 1997 ).There are varying reports of the viability of seeds of T. officinale complex after storage. Seeds reportedly germinate best after 3 months dry storage, but germination success then decreases with age ( Russwurm and Martin, 1977 ), certainly after 1 year in storage, and rarely germinates after 3 years dry storage at 20°C (AJ Richards, University of Newcastle, UK, personal observation). In another study, following burial of T. officinale complex seeds for varying time periods, a small number of seeds (1%) were still viable for up to 9 yr after burial ( Burnside et al., 1996 ). Typically, 1-6% of T. officinale complex seeds remained viable 4 yr after burial in soil, and soil storage for 5 yr or longer resulted in little detectable viability ( Chepil, 1946 ; Roberts and Neilson, 1981 ). Von Hofsten (1954) found that seeds remained viable longer in the soil (up to 20-30 yr) than when dry-stored indoors. Depth of seed burial was negatively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ), and Russwurm and Martin (

 longer resulted in little detectable viability ( Chepil, 1946 ; Roberts and Neilson, 1981 ). Von Hofsten (1954) found that seeds remained viable longer in the soil (up to 20-30 yr) than when dry-stored indoors. Depth of seed burial was negatively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ), and Russwurm and Martin (1977) found seed can readily germinate under 2 cm of soil. Storage of seeds at room temperature decreased seed viability, compared to storage at 4°C ( Letchamo and Gosselin, 1996 ). Mezynski and Cole (1974) reported that percentage germination decreased during 30 d storage of seeds at -15°C or 22°C, compared to fresh seeds. Al-Hially (1991) found that the rate of germination increased after 90 d storage. The position of T. officinale complex seeds affects germination, with greatest germination occurring when there is good contact between the substrate and the scar of attachment of the seed, allowing water uptake ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The hygroscopic pappus can move to alter the seed position as humidity changes and, in high humidity, the pappus closes hygroscopically ( Sheldon, 1974 ). The backward-pointing hairs and teeth of the seed may play a role in firmly anchoring it during seedling establishment ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Increasing soil compaction decreases seed germination, radicle penetration and seedling establishment, partly due to removal of microsites ( Sheldon, 1974 ). Vegetative growth is limited to the formation of multi-rosetted clumps and root fragmentation. The regenerative capacity of T. officinale complex roots has been examined by Naylor (1941) and Khan (1973) . Vegetative propagule weight was positively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ). Root segments that were 1.25 mm in diameter had to be

 growth is limited to the formation of multi-rosetted clumps and root fragmentation. The regenerative capacity of T. officinale complex roots has been examined by Naylor (1941) and Khan (1973) . Vegetative propagule weight was positively correlated to establishment success ( Bostock and Benton, 1983 ). Root segments that were 1.25 mm in diameter had to be at least 6-10 mm in length to regenerate, and segments as short as 2 mm could regenerate only if they were more than 4 mm in diameter ( Warmke and Warmke, 1950 ). The minimum length for shoot regeneration was 1.5 mm and for root regeneration 2 mm ( Khan, 1969 ). More shoots and roots regenerated from longer root segments than from shorter ones ( Khan, 1969 ). Regenerative capacity decreased as fragment volume decreased (down the length of the root) ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting cuttings in an inverted or horizontal plane, rather than the normal planting orientation resulted in a decline in regeneration and survival, and an increase in regeneration time ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Planting depth did not consistently influence regenerative capacity or timing ( Mann and Cavers, 1979 ). Root fragments were highly vigourous and capable of producing new plants even when covered by 5-10 cm of soil ( Falkowski et al., 1989 ; 1990), which may be due to their high sugar content (~11% of dry matter). Therefore, successful physical removal must include the entire root system. T. officinale complex is perennial, but often rather short-lived. Plants can aestivate, overwinter as a reduced basal rosette under snow cover or as seed (Cyr et al., 1990). Colonizers in a seral succession are often killed by later competition.Environmental RequirementsT. officinale complex can tolerate a broad range of climatic conditions ( Simon et al., 1996 ) and is distributed in almost every temperate and subtrop

Colonizers in a seral succession are often killed by later competition.Environmental RequirementsT. officinale complex can tolerate a broad range of climatic conditions ( Simon et al., 1996 ) and is distributed in almost every temperate and subtropical region of the world ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It is tolerant of a very wide range of conditions, from 90 to 2780 mm annual precipitation and 4.3 to 26.6°C average annual temperature. It shows a wide range of adaptability to light, being able to grow vigorously in full sunlight, or in diffused light in the shade of trees or buildings ( Longyear, 1918 ). It can grow in a wide range of soils ( Simon et al., 1996 ) but it flourishes best in moist, good quality loam ( Jackson, 1982 ). Soil moisture determines its local distribution, with well-watered areas of lawns being especially favourable for its growth ( Longyear, 1918 ). However, it has been recorded pushing up through concrete, hanging from eavestroughs of houses, and growing from cracks in old stone walls ( Jackson 1982 ). Established T. officinale complex plants are very resistant to drought, while young plants are very sensitive and have a limited chance of invading coarse-textured, shallow or rapidly-drying soils (von Hofsten, 1954 ; PB Cavers, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, personal communication). It grows in soils ranging in pH of 4.2-8.2 ( Holm et al., 1997 ). It can tolerate moderate salinity and can occur in submaritime sites and on the bare verges of salted roadside verges in Europe and the USA. It also shows differential tolerance of heavy metals ( Zhuikova et al., 1999 ). It has been shown to respond positively

It can tolerate moderate salinity and can occur in submaritime sites and on the bare verges of salted roadside verges in Europe and the USA. It also shows differential tolerance of heavy metals ( Zhuikova et al., 1999 ). It has been shown to respond positively to K ( Tilman et al., 1999 ), P ( Zaprzalka and Peters, 1982 ) and N ( Lihan and Jezikova, 1991 ) and negatively to Na and Mg ( Panak et al., 1991 ) in the soil. It may grow at sea level or up to an elevation of 6000 m, where it can be found in association with subalpine or alpine native Taraxacum species ( Longyear, 1918 ; Holm et al., 1997 ). In hilly terrain, T. officinale complex occurs more often on ridges than in hollows but this may be due to differential herbivory (e.g. slugs, rodents, grasshoppers) on the gradient, rather than differential effects of competition ( Reader, 1992 ). AssociationsT. officinale complex forms mycorrhizal associations ( Truszkowska, 1951 ; Hawker et al., 1957 ). Three vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Glomus mosseae ( Gange et al., 1994 ), G. intraradices ( Gange, 1999 ) and Pythium ultimum ( Hawker et al., 1957 ), have been reported on T. officinale complex. Infection by G. mosseae and G. intraradices conferred some degree of resistance in T. officinale complex roots to larvae of the black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus ( Gange et al., 1994 ; Gange, 1999 ).

 ( Hawker et al., 1957 ), have been reported on T. officinale complex. Infection by G. mosseae and G. intraradices conferred some degree of resistance in T. officinale complex roots to larvae of the black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus ( Gange et al., 1994 ; Gange, 1999 ). Either fungus inoculated alone caused a significant reduction in larval growth and survival, but when both fungi were inoculated together, the effect disappeared, possibly due to competition between the fungi ( Gange, 1999 ). There have been some recent studies on the mycorrhizal interactions of T. officinale complex, including the effect of elevated carbon dioxide levels on mycorrhizal function ( Staddon et al., 1999 ); the effect of non-host and host plants on mycorrhizal colonization ( Fontenla et al., 1999 ); and the effect of T. officinale complex on mycorrhiza inoculum potential, soil aggregation and yield of maize ( Kabir and Koide, 2000 ).T. officinale complex has an impact on the relationship between the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata and its prey, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in lucerne ( Harmon et al., 2000 ). It is thought that the omnivorous ladybirds are attracted to dandelion as a pollen resource, and the pea aphids suffer greater predation because they are in the same area.T. officinale complex provides an alternative host to several important viruses, so that it can act as a reservoir and contagion for insect- and nematode-borne disease. These include Tomato ring spot virus, spread by Xiphinema americanum ( Mountain et al., 1992 ; Ramsdell et al., 1993 and many earlier reports); Tomato spotted wilt virus and Cucumber mosaic cuc

These include Tomato ring spot virus, spread by Xiphinema americanum ( Mountain et al., 1992 ; Ramsdell et al., 1993 and many earlier reports); Tomato spotted wilt virus and Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus which infect many agricultural, ornamental and greenhouse crops ( Murphy et al., 1999 ; Groves et al., 2002 ); Beet western yellows virus in Brassica napa ( Polák and Májková, 1992 ); Beet pseudo-yellows virus in Cucumis melo ( Soria et al., 1991 ); Lettuce mosaic virus in Iraq ( Shawkat et al., 1982 ); Dandelion yellow mosaic virus in lettuce ( Bos et al., 1983 ); Lettuce pseudoyellows virus, which infects Lactuca sativa and Cucumis sativus (van Dorst et al., 1980 ) and Cherry rasp leaf virus ( Hansen et al., 1974 ). It may also act as an alternative host for boll weevils ( Haynes and Smith, 1992 ), cabbage looper, yellow-striped armyworm ( Dussourd and Denno, 1994 ), green peach aphid ( Kaakeh and Hogmire, 1991 ), larvae of the apple moth pest Lacanobia subjuncta ( Landolt, 2002 ), Pseudomonas viridiflava, which causes bacterial streak and bulb rot of onion ( Gitaitis et al., 1998 ), and other microorganisms.
