Uses
Nitrogen-fixing firewood species, the wood of fair quality for use in
unexposed situations.  It is used to a limited extent in carpentry and house
construction and for tea boxes.  The timber is rather durable, easily sawed,
and seasons well (sp. grav. 0.32–0.37).  Locally cultivated by West Java Forest
Service to reforest eroded slopes under everwet climate.  A fast growing
species, suitable for plantation cultivation in tropical uplands (Ramoran and
Panot, 1981).  The tanniniferous bark is used to deepen the color of
Rubia
cordifolia
.
Folk Medicine
The species is cited in the Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(from which I borrowed the Illustration) as a useful diuretic to reduce
swelling of the leg.
Chemistry
Bark reported to contain 7% tannin.
Description
Large tree 8–15 (to 30) m tall, to 1 m DBH with thick silver gray bark.
Twigs glabrescent, ribbed, hardly triangular.  Leaves alternate, ovate to
oblong, acute or short-acuminate, rounded or cuneate at the base, 7–21 x 4–10
cm; nerves 12–16 pairs, puberulous beneath (glabrescent); vein-axils bearded;

Twigs glabrescent, ribbed, hardly triangular.  Leaves alternate, ovate to
oblong, acute or short-acuminate, rounded or cuneate at the base, 7–21 x 4–10
cm; nerves 12–16 pairs, puberulous beneath (glabrescent); vein-axils bearded;
midrib and nerves sulcate and glabrous above; petiole strong, 1.5–2 cm long.
Male catkins to 10 cm by 3–5 mm, in a terminal panicle to 16 cm.  Female
inflorescences short, axillary, bearing 3–8 oblong, catkins 10–17 by 6–7 mm.
peduncles 3–6 mm long.  Nuts obtrapezoid, emarginate, incl. the wing 2 mm
through, crowned by the style base (van Steenis, 1955–1958).
Germplasm
Reported from the Indonesia-Indochina and Hindustani Center of
Diversity, nepalese alder, or cvs' thereof, is reported to tolerate clay,
flooding, fog, gravel, sand, shade, slope, waterlogging, and weeds.  It is not
tolerant of high winds.  (2
n
= 28)
Distribution
Native to southeast Asia (Burmese hills, Himalayas, Subtropical China,
Indochina).  Introduced to Java, India, Hawaii, and the Philippines.  I saw a
large tree near Kunming in Yunnan China.
Ecology
In its native habitat it ranges from 300–3,000 m, in Hawaii from
300–1,800 m, growing well in areas with more than 500 mm annual precipitation.

Ecology
In its native habitat it ranges from 300–3,000 m, in Hawaii from
300–1,800 m, growing well in areas with more than 500 mm annual precipitation.
Van Steenis (1955–1958) suggests it as an afforestation species on eroded
slopes under everwet climatic conditions, growing well between 700–1,800 m.
Grows best in deep well-drained loams or loamy soils of alluvial soils, but
ranges from gravel to sand to clay.  I believe it ranges from Subtropical Dry
to Wet Forest Life Zones, with annual rainfall estimated at 5–25 dm, annual
temperature 19–23°C, and pH 6–8.
Cultivation
Seeds may be sown in nurserys for transplants or direct seeded. In
Burma, seed are broadcast during last years of shifting cultivation.  It is a
fast grower, even capable of outgrowing sugar ratoon crops.  Trees coppice
well, but regrowth seems to be season dependent.  In Hawaii, in aseasonal
situations, the trees coppice year round.
Harvesting
In Himachal Pradesh, India, the trees are lopped every other year for
fuel (NAS, 1980a).
Yields and Economics
Diameters may increase at the rate of ca 2 cm/yr.  In Hawaii, 26 year
old trees were 50 cm in diameter.

Energy
According to the phytomass files (Duke, 1981b), annual productivity of
other
Alnus
species ranges from 5 to 26 MT/ha.  Although used for
nitrogen fixation, slope stabilization (both of which help the energy budget of
a country), the alder is also used for firewood and might be considered for the
generation of electricity.  Heat content of
Alnus rubra
is about 4,600
kcal/kg atid it, a temperate species, may yield 10–21 m
3
/ha/yr.  The wood
dries rapidly and burns evenly (Little, 1983).
Biotic Factors
Leaves are sometimes stripped from the tree by coleopterous larvae.
Trunk occasionally attacked by borers.
