Plant Notes:  Halberd Leaf Rose Mallow is a native herbaceous perennial in the Mallow family (Malvaceae). It can be found throughout much of Alabama. Halberd Leaf Rose Mallow grows on the banks of ponds and lakes, along streams and rivers, in marshes and sloughs, and in wet roadside ditches. It is a perennial with thick, spongy roots. Several stems develop from each root crown. The stems are erect, green in color, 3-6 feet in height, and glabrous. The stems have short side branches in the upper half. Leaves are alternate, petiolate, hastate in shape, glabrous, with serrate margins. The leaves resemble a medieval halberd, hence the common name. Flowers are solitary in the axils of the upper leaves. The flowers have a green balloon-like calyx with 5 lobes and 5 pink petals. The fruit is a capsule with many oval, brown, hairy seed. For many years this plant was known by the name of Hibiscus militaris Cavanilles, and is still listed that way in some places. Halberd Leaf Rose Mallow buds, flowers, and developing fruit are fed upon by caterpillars of the Gray Hairstreak Butterfly (Strymon melinus).

Halberd Leaf Rose Mallow buds, flowers, and developing fruit are fed upon by caterpillars of the Gray Hairstreak Butterfly (Strymon melinus). Caterpillars of the Painted Lady Butterfly (Vanessa cardui) and Common Checkered Skipper (Pyrgus communis) feed on the foliage. Caterpillars of the Pearly Wood Nymph Moth (Eudryas unio), Yellow Scallop Moth (Anomis erosa), and Io Moth (Automeris io) also feed on the foliage of Halberd Leaf Rose Mallow. Halberd Leaf Rose Mallow is available as either plants or seed from native plant nurseries. It prefers an organic rich soil that is constantly wet and full sun. It can be used around ponds or pools, and in rain gardens.--A. Diamond  ;
