Description (afterSeshadri and Dasgupta, 1975) Female Body slender, almost straight to slightly arcuate ventrally when relaxed by application of gentle heat. Cuticle with fine transverse striations; annules about 1 µm wide at mid-body. Lip region unstriated, not distinctly set off from the body, low, flattened, wider than high at lip base. Cephalic framework lightly sclerotized, hexaradiate, en-face view showing six lips of almost equal size. Lateral fields one-fourth of body width or slightly less, with 4 incisures, outer incisures more distinct than inner ones, extending almost to tip of tail. Deirids immediately posterior to the level of excretory pore. Phasmids close behind mid-part of tail, pore-like, difficult to see. Stylet moderately developed, conus attenuated, about 45% of total stylet length; knobs small but distinct, usually with posteriorly sloping anterior surfaces, rather amalgamated with one another, about 2 µm across.

 Reproduccion: D. angustus survives between crops in an anhydrobiotic state in rice stem tissues and in partially or fully enclosed panicles ( Cox and Rahman, 1979 ; Kinh, 1981 ). D. angustus is dependent on environmental conditions to survive dehydration ( Ibrahim and Perry, 1993 ) and successful anhydrobiosis relies on slow drying, which occurs, for example, in dry soil ( Cuc, 1982 ) or within plant tissues. Butler (1913) recovered nematodes after 7-15 months from plant material. D. angustus can be present in freshly harvested mature true seed and in sterile spikelets ( Butler, 1919 ; Hashioka, 1963 ; Cuc and Giang, 1982 ; Ibrahim and Perry, 1993 ) and although transmission in seed can occur ( Sein, 1977a ), the risk of such transmission is minimal, particularly after thorough sun drying ( Seshadri and Dasgupta, 1975 ). The anhydrobiotic population is predominantly fourth-stage juveniles ( Ibrahim and Perry, 1993 ): this stage has the greatest infective and reproductive potential ( Plowright and Gill, 1994 ). Nematodes are spread in water or by leaf contact at high relative humidities (>75% RH) ( Rahman and Evans, 1987 ); long-distance spread in water is possible ( Bridge et

The anhydrobiotic population is predominantly fourth-stage juveniles ( Ibrahim and Perry, 1993 ): this stage has the greatest infective and reproductive potential ( Plowright and Gill, 1994 ). Nematodes are spread in water or by leaf contact at high relative humidities (>75% RH) ( Rahman and Evans, 1987 ); long-distance spread in water is possible ( Bridge et al., 1990 ). D. angustus invades rice plants at the water surface ( Plowright and Gill, 1994 ) and rapidly enters the innermost leaf interstices, where it feeds on meristematic tissues and on young leaves within the leaf sheath. Young plants are more easily invaded than old ( Rahman and Evans, 1987 ). It has a short life cycle, 10-20 days at 30°C, and populations tend to have a stable demographic equilibrium in which fourth-stage juveniles predominate ( Plowright and Gill, 1994 ).
 Sintomas: During vegetative growth from seedling to flag leaf, the principal symptom of infection is leaf chlorosis. In light infections, the chlorosis will be discrete white spots, less than 1 mm in diameter. As nematode numbers increase, these spots become more numerous, intensify and coalesce towards the base of the penultimate leaf and lower part of the emerging leaf. D. angustus does feed on the inner surface of the leaf sheaths, but these rarely show obvious symptoms. In time the chlorotic areas will show some localized browning. Depending on the severity of infection, chlorotic leaf areas, tillers or whole plants will wither and die, attaining a light-brown appearance. In severe infections, the entire crop takes on this appearance. If infected tillers survive to flowering then the panicles remain partially or completely enclosed within the leaf sheath. Partially emerged panicles bear few, if any, true seed and the empty spikelets are distorted and discoloured.
