What is infectious hypodermal and 
hematopoietic necrosis virus? 
 Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic 
necrosis virus (IHHNV) is a virus that affects 
some farmed and wild shrimp species. 
  
 Signs of IHHNV include sluggish swimming and 
motionless or sinking shrimp. Shrimp farms with 
infected shrimp may experience mass die-offs 
and an increase in shrimp with cuticular 
deformations.  
 
 IHHNV may cause infection in yellowleg shrimp, 
giant tiger prawn, northern white shrimp, blue 
shrimp, and white leg prawn. The virus is not 
known to affect other crustaceans.  
 
 A diagnostic test is required to confirm the 
presence of the virus in a facility or population. 
There is currently no treatment or vaccine 
available for IHHNV. 
 
  IHHNV is not a threat to human health. 
 
 
 
Distribution of IHHNV 
 In 2019, shrimp farms in Texas, New Mexico, 
and Florida and a research facility in California 
were quarantined due to the detection of IHHNV 
in shrimp. The virus has previously been 
confirmed in several regions of Africa, Asia, and 
Central and South America, Europe, and 
Australia.  
 
Transmission and prevention 
 Transmission can occur through cannibalization, 
contaminated water

confirmed in several regions of Africa, Asia, and 
Central and South America, Europe, and 
Australia.  
 
Transmission and prevention 
 Transmission can occur through cannibalization, 
contaminated water, and infected eggs. Those 
purchasing live shrimp or breeding shrimp on a 
shrimp farm should review their biosecurity 
practices and take steps to address potential 
gaps as listed below.  
 
Recommended biosecurity practices 
 Purchase live shrimp and germplasm from 
sources tested negative for the virus. 
 
 Quarantine and monitor all new shrimp stocks 
upon arrival to a farm, disinfect and properly 
dispose of water used to transport live shrimp, 
and note any unusual rise in mortality, followed 
by appropriate diagnostic testing. 
 
 Implement measures to control virus spread 
such as pretreating all water sources and 
minimizing or eliminating water exchange 
between populations. 
 
 Routinely sanitize equipment with appropriate 
disinfectants. 
 
Report Suspicious Cases 
Suspect cases should be reported to your 
State Animal Health Official.
