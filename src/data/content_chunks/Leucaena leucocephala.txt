 Invasion: Leucaena leucocephalais a small to medium-sized tree, up to 15 m tall and if having a single trunk, this being up to 35 cm in diameter, with older trees in favourable sites reaching 20 m tall and 50 cm in diameter. Form varies from shrubby and highly branched in subsp.leucocephalato arborescent with a short clear bole to 5 m, upright angular branching and an open, rounded crown in subsp.glabrata. Bark is mid grey-brown with shallow rusty orange-brown vertical fissures; slash reddish. Leaves bipinnate with 4-9 pairs of pinnae per leaf and 13-21 pairs of leaflets per pinna. The leaflets are small, 9-21 mm long, 2-4.5 mm wide, linear-oblong or weakly elliptic, acute at the tip, rounded to obtuse at the base and glabrous except on margins, with a concave, cup-shaped, elliptic petiole gland. Flowers arranged on compact globose heads, the flower heads in groups of 2-6 in leaf axils arising on actively growing young shoots, the leaves developing simultaneously with the flowers, the heads 12-21 mm in diameter with 100-180 flowers per head, the flowers white.

 Reproduccion: Leucaena leucocephala is a self-compatible tetraploid of probable hybrid origin. Harris et al. (1994a) showed that the most likely maternal parent species is L. pulverulenta but the paternal parent remains uncertain. Lack of natural populations of L. leucocephala , along with increasing realization of the extent and importance of indigenous domestication of Leucaena as a minor food in Mexico, led Hughes and Harris (1995) and Hughes (1998b) to speculate that L. leucocephala might have arisen in cultivation in pre-Columbian times, possibly in Veracruz, Mexico. Isoenzyme studies ( Harris et al., 1994b ) have revealed only limited genetic diversity within L. leucocephala . Brewbaker and Sun (1996) found that all 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' type subsp. leucocephala material of the Pacific and indeed of the world outside Mexico, are of a single genotype. It is widely acknowledged that the varieties of subsp. glabrata used in cultivation are also derived from an extremely narrow genetic base ( Brewbaker, 1980 , 1985; Hughes, 1989 , 1998b). High yield has been a major factor prompting the promotion and adoption of L. leucocephala , following the discovery and distribution of the so-called 'Giant' or 'Salvador' arborescent varieties, now assigned to subsp. glabrata (National Research Council, 1984; Brewbaker, 1987 ).

 discovery and distribution of the so-called 'Giant' or 'Salvador' arborescent varieties, now assigned to subsp. glabrata (National Research Council, 1984; Brewbaker, 1987 ). The 'Giant' varieties have consistently out-yielded the pantropically naturalized shrubby 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' varieties belonging to subsp. leucocephala by 20-100% in leaf production and up to 250% in wood production (e.g. Bray et al., 1988 ; Brewbaker et al., 1972 ; Brewbaker, 1980 ; Gray, 1967 ). On the basis of trials in Hawaii ( Brewbaker et al., 1972 ) and Australia ( Gray, 1967 ), one of the then newly tested 'Giant' or 'Salvador' accessions, designated with the name 'K8', was formally released by the University of Hawaii ( Brewbaker, 1975 ). This accession has dominated planting alongside a handful of others (e.g. K28, K67 and K72). The so called 'Peru' type, which is fast-growing with large leaves like the 'Giant' type, but also branchy like the shrubby 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' type was also used in some areas. The first bred line, cv. 'Cunningham', is an artificial hybrid between the 'Salvador' and 'Peru' types. It was developed in Australia specifically for fodder production and combines the vigour of the 'Salvador' type with the greater branchiness of the 'Peru' type. These accessions (K8, K67, Peru, Cunningham) have subsequently been widely promoted and used throughout the tropics for reforestation ( Pound and Martínez-Cairo, 1983 ; National Research Council, 1984), despite concerns over the genetic vulnerability of only a handful of self-f

These accessions (K8, K67, Peru, Cunningham) have subsequently been widely promoted and used throughout the tropics for reforestation ( Pound and Martínez-Cairo, 1983 ; National Research Council, 1984), despite concerns over the genetic vulnerability of only a handful of self-fertile lines, several of which originate from cultivated material, in single 'variety' plantations ( Brewbaker, 1980 , 1985; Hughes, 1989 ). Considerable efforts have been devoted to identifying and field testing additional accessions of subsp. glabrata , however, very little variation in yield or resistance to the Leucaena psyllid pest has been detected ( Brewbaker et al., 1972 ; Wheeler et al., 1987 ). One accession, K636, sometimes referred to as cv. 'Tarramba', shows greater psyllid tolerance and yield than the widely used K8, K28, K67 and K72 varieties. Three organizations, the University of Hawaii (UH), USA; CSIRO, Australia; and, the Oxford Forestry Institute (OFI, now the Department of Plant Sciences, Oxford University), UK, house important Leucaena germplasm collections (Hughes et al., 1995) including large numbers of accessions of L. leucocephala . A Leucaena germplasm catalogue has been compiled, cross-referencing all collections ( Bray et al., 1997 ).

 the main thrust of breeding efforts to overcome the limitations of L. leucocephala and its inherent lack of genetic and useful diversity ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1990 ). L. leucocephala has been the most important parent in hybrid programmes. Useful hybrids between L. leucocephala and other tetraploid species such as L. diversifolia (hybrid KX3) and L. pallida (hybrid KX2) have been produced and are now being used ( Sorensson, 1995 ). L. leucocephala has also been crossed with different diploid species such as L. esculenta , L. pulverulenta and L. trichandra to produce a series of impressive seedless triploid hybrids, but wider use of these hybrids is limited by lack of efficient seed production or vegetative propagation techniques ( Sorensson, 1995 ; Hughes, 1998b ). High crossability within other species of Leucaena ( Sorensson and Brewbaker, 1994 ) means that L. leucocephala can also form spontaneous interspecific hybrids when grown closely with other species of Leucaena . Two such hybrids are relatively common, L. leucocephala X L. esculenta ( L. X mixtec ), documented and named by Hughes and Harris (1994) and L. leucocephala X L. diversifolia ( L. X spontanea ) identified by Hughes and Harris (1995) . Leucaena leucocephala is self-fertile and produces prodigious quantities of seed from the first year, more or less continuously throughout the year as moisture permits, across a wide range of environments ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks and are dehiscent, opening when ripe and shedding seeds.

ena leucocephala is self-fertile and produces prodigious quantities of seed from the first year, more or less continuously throughout the year as moisture permits, across a wide range of environments ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks and are dehiscent, opening when ripe and shedding seeds. It is slightly or completely deciduous depending on the length and severity of the dry season. If the plant is damaged by burning, then regeneration is possible from basal shoots ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). Foliage is extremely palatable to livestock and other browsing mammals. Generalist pollinators may pollinate this species ( Hughes, 1998a , b). L. leucocephala is self-fertile and produces seed from the first year, ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). There are between 15,000 and 20,000 seeds per kilogram. Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks. Seeds are dispersed mainly by gravity and in moving water, and though some are moved by insects and rodents this is a relatively minor process ( Hughes, 1998a , b). The hard coats of seeds allow a persistent seedbank to develop ( Hughes, 1998a , b). Leucaena leucocephala is essentially a tropical species requiring warm temperatures of 25-30°C for optimum growth, tolerating temperatures as high as 48°C ( Hocking, 1993 ), and with poor cold tolerance and significantly reduced growth during cool winter months in subtropical areas ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1987 ; Williams, 1987 ). Therefore, it grows best in areas below about 1500 m altitude and up to 15-25° north or south of the equator, although it can survive over a much wider range to about 2000 m and up to 40° north or south of the equator.

Therefore, it grows best in areas below about 1500 m altitude and up to 15-25° north or south of the equator, although it can survive over a much wider range to about 2000 m and up to 40° north or south of the equator. L. leucocephala sheds its leaves even after light frosts and heavy frosts kill all above-ground growth, although trees can resprout after dieback, depending on the severity and longevity of frosts. Similarly, L. leucocephala grows well only in sub-humid or humid climates (650-3000 mm) with moderate dry seasons of up to 6-7 months. Although it can survive in climates with as little as 300-500 mm rainfall, growth is slow and seedling mortality is high. It grows better in areas with a well-defined dry season ( Lascano et al., 1995 ). A modified description of climatic requirements was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Leucaena leucocephala grows well only on freely-drained, neutral, or slightly alkaline soils and is well adapted to soils derived from calcareous parent material including coral. It is known to be intolerant of soils with low pH (below pH 5), low phosphorus, low calcium, high salinity, high aluminium saturation or waterlogging and has often failed under such conditions ( Brewbaker, 1987 ; Shelton and Brewbaker, 1994 ; Blamey and Hutton, 1995 ).

Leucaena leucocephala has the ability to form a symbiotic association with Rhizobium root nodule bacteria, which are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Effective nodulation has been lacking in certain environments due to lack of suitable strains of Rhizobium in the soil and inoculation may be required ( Halliday and Somasegaran, 1983 ). Rhizobium strain TAL1145, developed by NifTAL (Nitrogen Fixation by Tropical Agricultural Legumes) has been shown to be an elite strain for L. leucocephala ( Somasegaran and Martin, 1986 ). For other plant and animal associations, refer to Hughes (1998b) .

Whilst it performs best on calcareous soils, it can be found on saline and alkaline soils up to pH 8 ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, it is not tolerant of acid soils or waterlogged conditions ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). Also it is known to be intolerant of soils with low phosphorus, low calcium, high salinity, high aluminium saturation and waterlogging ( Brewbaker, 1987 ) and has often failed under such conditions ( Brewbaker, 1987 ; Shelton and Brewbaker, 1994 ; Blamey and Hutton, 1995 ).

cocephala X L. diversifolia ( L. X spontanea ) identified by Hughes and Harris (1995) . Physiology and Phenology Leucaena leucocephala is self-fertile and produces prodigious quantities of seed from the first year, more or less continuously throughout the year as moisture permits, across a wide range of environments ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks and are dehiscent, opening when ripe and shedding seeds. It is slightly or completely deciduous depending on the length and severity of the dry season. If the plant is damaged by burning, then regeneration is possible from basal shoots ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). Foliage is extremely palatable to livestock and other browsing mammals. Reproductive Biology Generalist pollinators may pollinate this species ( Hughes, 1998a , b). L. leucocephala is self-fertile and produces seed from the first year, ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). There are between 15,000 and 20,000 seeds per kilogram. Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks. Seeds are dispersed mainly by gravity and in moving water, and though some are moved by insects and rodents this is a relatively minor process ( Hughes, 1998a , b). The hard coats of seeds allow a persistent seedbank to develop ( Hughes, 1998a , b). Environmental Requirements Leucaena leucocephala is essentially a tropical species requiring warm temperatures of 25-30°C for optimum growth, tolerating temperatures as high as 48°C ( Hocking, 1993 ), and with poor cold tolerance and significantly reduced growth during cool winter months in subtropical areas ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1987 ; Williams, 1987 ).

Therefore, it grows best in areas below about 1500 m altitude and up to 15-25° north or south of the equator, although it can survive over a much wider range to about 2000 m and up to 40° north or south of the equator. L. leucocephala sheds its leaves even after light frosts and heavy frosts kill all above-ground growth, although trees can resprout after dieback, depending on the severity and longevity of frosts. Similarly, L. leucocephala grows well only in sub-humid or humid climates (650-3000 mm) with moderate dry seasons of up to 6-7 months. Although it can survive in climates with as little as 300-500 mm rainfall, growth is slow and seedling mortality is high. It grows better in areas with a well-defined dry season ( Lascano et al., 1995 ). A modified description of climatic requirements was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Leucaena leucocephala grows well only on freely-drained, neutral, or slightly alkaline soils and is well adapted to soils derived from calcareous parent material including coral. It is known to be intolerant of soils with low pH (below pH 5), low phosphorus, low calcium, high salinity, high aluminium saturation or waterlogging and has often failed under such conditions ( Brewbaker, 1987 ; Shelton and Brewbaker, 1994 ; Blamey and Hutton, 1995 ).

Associations Leucaena leucocephala has the ability to form a symbiotic association with Rhizobium root nodule bacteria, which are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Effective nodulation has been lacking in certain environments due to lack of suitable strains of Rhizobium in the soil and inoculation may be required ( Halliday and Somasegaran, 1983 ). Rhizobium strain TAL1145, developed by NifTAL (Nitrogen Fixation by Tropical Agricultural Legumes) has been shown to be an elite strain for L. leucocephala ( Somasegaran and Martin, 1986 ).

Whilst it performs best on calcareous soils, it can be found on saline and alkaline soils up to pH 8 ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, it is not tolerant of acid soils or waterlogged conditions ( Orwa et al., 2009 ).

Overview
Appearance
Leucaena leucocephala
is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 16 ft. (5 m) in height.
Foliage
The bipinnate leaves are about 10 in. (25 cm) long. There are approximately 12 pairs of lanceolate shaped leaflets each about 0.35-0.47 in. (9-12 mm) long, 0.08-0.14 in. (2-3.5 mm) wide. Leaflets are oppositely arranged.
Flowers
Flowers grow clustered on the end of branches. Individual flowers are white, turning brown with maturity.
Fruit
Leucaena leucocephala
is a prolific seed producer. The dark brown seed pods are flat, roughly 4-6 in. (10-15 cm) long, with about 20 seeds. Seeds are glossy brown, oval, flat, 0.24 in. (6 mm) long.
Ecological Threat
In areas where
Leucaena leucocephala
is considered an invasive weed, it will form dense thickets and displace the native vegetation. Disturbed, cleared areas, coastal strands, outskirts of forests and canopy gaps are some locations regularly invaded by
Leucaena leucocephala.

 Reproduccion: Leucaena leucocephala is a self-compatible tetraploid of probable hybrid origin. Harris et al. (1994a) showed that the most likely maternal parent species is L. pulverulenta but the paternal parent remains uncertain. Lack of natural populations of L. leucocephala , along with increasing realization of the extent and importance of indigenous domestication of Leucaena as a minor food in Mexico, led Hughes and Harris (1995) and Hughes (1998b) to speculate that L. leucocephala might have arisen in cultivation in pre-Columbian times, possibly in Veracruz, Mexico. Isoenzyme studies ( Harris et al., 1994b ) have revealed only limited genetic diversity within L. leucocephala . Brewbaker and Sun (1996) found that all 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' type subsp. leucocephala material of the Pacific and indeed of the world outside Mexico, are of a single genotype. It is widely acknowledged that the varieties of subsp. glabrata used in cultivation are also derived from an extremely narrow genetic base ( Brewbaker, 1980 , 1985; Hughes, 1989 , 1998b). High yield has been a major factor prompting the promotion and adoption of L. leucocephala , following the discovery and distribution of the so-called 'Giant' or 'Salvador' arborescent varieties, now assigned to subsp. glabrata (National Research Council, 1984; Brewbaker, 1987 ). The 'Giant' varieties have consistently out-yielded the pantropically naturalized shrubby 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' varieties belonging to sub

 discovery and distribution of the so-called 'Giant' or 'Salvador' arborescent varieties, now assigned to subsp. glabrata (National Research Council, 1984; Brewbaker, 1987 ). The 'Giant' varieties have consistently out-yielded the pantropically naturalized shrubby 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' varieties belonging to subsp. leucocephala by 20-100% in leaf production and up to 250% in wood production (e.g. Bray et al., 1988 ; Brewbaker et al., 1972 ; Brewbaker, 1980 ; Gray, 1967 ). On the basis of trials in Hawaii ( Brewbaker et al., 1972 ) and Australia ( Gray, 1967 ), one of the then newly tested 'Giant' or 'Salvador' accessions, designated with the name 'K8', was formally released by the University of Hawaii ( Brewbaker, 1975 ). This accession has dominated planting alongside a handful of others (e.g. K28, K67 and K72). The so called 'Peru' type, which is fast-growing with large leaves like the 'Giant' type, but also branchy like the shrubby 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' type was also used in some areas. The first bred line, cv. 'Cunningham', is an artificial hybrid between the 'Salvador' and 'Peru' types. It was developed in Australia specifically for fodder production and combines the vigour of the 'Salvador' type with the greater branchiness of the 'Peru' type. These accessions (K8, K67, Peru, Cunningham) have subsequently been widely promoted and used throughout the tropics for reforestation ( Pound and Martínez-Cairo, 1983 ; National Research Council, 1984), despite concerns over the genetic vulnerability of only a handful of self-f

These accessions (K8, K67, Peru, Cunningham) have subsequently been widely promoted and used throughout the tropics for reforestation ( Pound and Martínez-Cairo, 1983 ; National Research Council, 1984), despite concerns over the genetic vulnerability of only a handful of self-fertile lines, several of which originate from cultivated material, in single 'variety' plantations ( Brewbaker, 1980 , 1985; Hughes, 1989 ). Considerable efforts have been devoted to identifying and field testing additional accessions of subsp. glabrata , however, very little variation in yield or resistance to the Leucaena psyllid pest has been detected ( Brewbaker et al., 1972 ; Wheeler et al., 1987 ). One accession, K636, sometimes referred to as cv. 'Tarramba', shows greater psyllid tolerance and yield than the widely used K8, K28, K67 and K72 varieties. Three organizations, the University of Hawaii (UH), USA; CSIRO, Australia; and, the Oxford Forestry Institute (OFI, now the Department of Plant Sciences, Oxford University), UK, house important Leucaena germplasm collections (Hughes et al., 1995) including large numbers of accessions of L. leucocephala . A Leucaena germplasm catalogue has been compiled, cross-referencing all collections ( Bray et al., 1997 ). Artificial hybridization has been the main thrust of breeding efforts to overcome the limitations of L. leucocephala and its inherent lack of genetic and useful diversity ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1990 ).

 the main thrust of breeding efforts to overcome the limitations of L. leucocephala and its inherent lack of genetic and useful diversity ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1990 ). L. leucocephala has been the most important parent in hybrid programmes. Useful hybrids between L. leucocephala and other tetraploid species such as L. diversifolia (hybrid KX3) and L. pallida (hybrid KX2) have been produced and are now being used ( Sorensson, 1995 ). L. leucocephala has also been crossed with different diploid species such as L. esculenta , L. pulverulenta and L. trichandra to produce a series of impressive seedless triploid hybrids, but wider use of these hybrids is limited by lack of efficient seed production or vegetative propagation techniques ( Sorensson, 1995 ; Hughes, 1998b ). High crossability within other species of Leucaena ( Sorensson and Brewbaker, 1994 ) means that L. leucocephala can also form spontaneous interspecific hybrids when grown closely with other species of Leucaena . Two such hybrids are relatively common, L. leucocephala X L. esculenta ( L. X mixtec ), documented and named by Hughes and Harris (1994) and L. leucocephala X L. diversifolia ( L. X spontanea ) identified by Hughes and Harris (1995) . Leucaena leucocephala is self-fertile and produces prodigious quantities of seed from the first year, more or less continuously throughout the year as moisture permits, across a wide range of environments ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ).

Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks and are dehiscent, opening when ripe and shedding seeds. It is slightly or completely deciduous depending on the length and severity of the dry season. If the plant is damaged by burning, then regeneration is possible from basal shoots ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). Foliage is extremely palatable to livestock and other browsing mammals. Generalist pollinators may pollinate this species ( Hughes, 1998a , b). L. leucocephala is self-fertile and produces seed from the first year, ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). There are between 15,000 and 20,000 seeds per kilogram. Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks. Seeds are dispersed mainly by gravity and in moving water, and though some are moved by insects and rodents this is a relatively minor process ( Hughes, 1998a , b). The hard coats of seeds allow a persistent seedbank to develop ( Hughes, 1998a , b). Leucaena leucocephala is essentially a tropical species requiring warm temperatures of 25-30°C for optimum growth, tolerating temperatures as high as 48°C ( Hocking, 1993 ), and with poor cold tolerance and significantly reduced growth during cool winter months in subtropical areas ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1987 ; Williams, 1987 ). Therefore, it grows best in areas below about 1500 m altitude and up to 15-25° north or south of the equator, although it can survive over a much wider range to about 2000 m and up to 40° north or south of the equator.

Therefore, it grows best in areas below about 1500 m altitude and up to 15-25° north or south of the equator, although it can survive over a much wider range to about 2000 m and up to 40° north or south of the equator. L. leucocephala sheds its leaves even after light frosts and heavy frosts kill all above-ground growth, although trees can resprout after dieback, depending on the severity and longevity of frosts. Similarly, L. leucocephala grows well only in sub-humid or humid climates (650-3000 mm) with moderate dry seasons of up to 6-7 months. Although it can survive in climates with as little as 300-500 mm rainfall, growth is slow and seedling mortality is high. It grows better in areas with a well-defined dry season ( Lascano et al., 1995 ). A modified description of climatic requirements was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Leucaena leucocephala grows well only on freely-drained, neutral, or slightly alkaline soils and is well adapted to soils derived from calcareous parent material including coral. It is known to be intolerant of soils with low pH (below pH 5), low phosphorus, low calcium, high salinity, high aluminium saturation or waterlogging and has often failed under such conditions ( Brewbaker, 1987 ; Shelton and Brewbaker, 1994 ; Blamey and Hutton, 1995 ).

For other plant and animal associations, refer to Hughes (1998b) . Leucaena leucocephala is essentially a tropical species, requiring warm temperatures of 25-30°C for optimum growth, tolerating temperatures as high as 48°C ( Hocking, 1993 ), and with poor cold tolerance and significantly reduced growth during cool winter months in subtropical areas ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1987 ; Williams, 1987 ). Therefore, it grows best in areas below about 1500 m altitude and 15-25° north or south of the equator, although it can survive over a much wider range to about 2000 m and to 30° north or south of the equator. L. leucocephala sheds its leaves even after light frosts; heavy frosts kill all above-ground growth, although trees often resprout after dieback. Similarly, L. leucocephala grows well only in sub-humid or humid climates (650-3000 mm) with moderate dry seasons of up to 6-7 months, although it can survive in climates with as little as 300-500 mm rainfall.

A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Leucaena leucocephala grows well only on freely-drained, neutral, or slightly alkaline (pH>5) soils and is well adapted to soils derived from calcareous parent material including coral. It is known to be intolerant of soils with low pH, low phosphorus, low calcium, high salinity, high aluminium saturation and waterlogging ( Brewbaker, 1987 ) and has often failed under such conditions ( Brewbaker, 1987 ; Shelton and Brewbaker, 1994 ; Blamey and Hutton, 1995 ).

Whilst it performs best on calcareous soils, it can be found on saline and alkaline soils up to pH 8 ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, it is not tolerant of acid soils or waterlogged conditions ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). Also it is known to be intolerant of soils with low phosphorus, low calcium, high salinity, high aluminium saturation and waterlogging ( Brewbaker, 1987 ) and has often failed under such conditions ( Brewbaker, 1987 ; Shelton and Brewbaker, 1994 ; Blamey and Hutton, 1995 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics Leucaena leucocephala is a self-compatible tetraploid of probable hybrid origin. Harris et al. (1994a) showed that the most likely maternal parent species is L. pulverulenta but the paternal parent remains uncertain. Lack of natural populations of L. leucocephala , along with increasing realization of the extent and importance of indigenous domestication of Leucaena as a minor food in Mexico, led Hughes and Harris (1995) and Hughes (1998b) to speculate that L. leucocephala might have arisen in cultivation in pre-Columbian times, possibly in Veracruz, Mexico. Isoenzyme studies ( Harris et al., 1994b ) have revealed only limited genetic diversity within L. leucocephala . Brewbaker and Sun (1996) found that all 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' type subsp. leucocephala material of the Pacific and indeed of the world outside Mexico, are of a single genotype. It is widely acknowledged that the varieties of subsp. glabrata used in cultivation are also derived from an extremely narrow genetic base ( Brewbaker, 1980 , 1985; Hughes, 1989 , 1998b). High yield has been a major factor prompting the promotion and adoption of L. leucocephala , following the discovery and distribution of the so-called 'Giant' or 'Salvador' arborescent varieties, now assigned to subsp. glabrata (National Research Council, 1984; Brewbaker, 1987 ).

 1989 , 1998b). High yield has been a major factor prompting the promotion and adoption of L. leucocephala , following the discovery and distribution of the so-called 'Giant' or 'Salvador' arborescent varieties, now assigned to subsp. glabrata (National Research Council, 1984; Brewbaker, 1987 ). The 'Giant' varieties have consistently out-yielded the pantropically naturalized shrubby 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' varieties belonging to subsp. leucocephala by 20-100% in leaf production and up to 250% in wood production (e.g. Bray et al., 1988 ; Brewbaker et al., 1972 ; Brewbaker, 1980 ; Gray, 1967 ). On the basis of trials in Hawaii ( Brewbaker et al., 1972 ) and Australia ( Gray, 1967 ), one of the then newly tested 'Giant' or 'Salvador' accessions, designated with the name 'K8', was formally released by the University of Hawaii ( Brewbaker, 1975 ). This accession has dominated planting alongside a handful of others (e.g. K28, K67 and K72). The so called 'Peru' type, which is fast-growing with large leaves like the 'Giant' type, but also branchy like the shrubby 'Common' or 'Hawaiian' type was also used in some areas. The first bred line, cv. 'Cunningham', is an artificial hybrid between the 'Salvador' and 'Peru' types. It was developed in Australia specifically for fodder production and combines the vigour of the 'Salvador' type with the greater branchiness of the 'Peru' type. These accessions (K8, K67, Peru, Cunningham) have subsequently been widely promoted and used throughout the tropics for reforestation ( Pound and Mart

 the 'Salvador' and 'Peru' types. It was developed in Australia specifically for fodder production and combines the vigour of the 'Salvador' type with the greater branchiness of the 'Peru' type. These accessions (K8, K67, Peru, Cunningham) have subsequently been widely promoted and used throughout the tropics for reforestation ( Pound and Martínez-Cairo, 1983 ; National Research Council, 1984), despite concerns over the genetic vulnerability of only a handful of self-fertile lines, several of which originate from cultivated material, in single 'variety' plantations ( Brewbaker, 1980 , 1985; Hughes, 1989 ). Considerable efforts have been devoted to identifying and field testing additional accessions of subsp. glabrata , however, very little variation in yield or resistance to the Leucaena psyllid pest has been detected ( Brewbaker et al., 1972 ; Wheeler et al., 1987 ). One accession, K636, sometimes referred to as cv. 'Tarramba', shows greater psyllid tolerance and yield than the widely used K8, K28, K67 and K72 varieties. Three organizations, the University of Hawaii (UH), USA; CSIRO, Australia; and, the Oxford Forestry Institute (OFI, now the Department of Plant Sciences, Oxford University), UK, house important Leucaena germplasm collections (Hughes et al., 1995) including large numbers of accessions of L. leucocephala . A Leucaena germplasm catalogue has been compiled, cross-referencing all collections ( Bray et al., 1997 ). Artificial hybridization has been the main thrust of breeding efforts to overcome the limitations of L. leucocephala and its inherent lack of genetic and useful diversity ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1990 ).

Artificial hybridization has been the main thrust of breeding efforts to overcome the limitations of L. leucocephala and its inherent lack of genetic and useful diversity ( Brewbaker and Sorensson, 1990 ). L. leucocephala has been the most important parent in hybrid programmes. Useful hybrids between L. leucocephala and other tetraploid species such as L. diversifolia (hybrid KX3) and L. pallida (hybrid KX2) have been produced and are now being used ( Sorensson, 1995 ). L. leucocephala has also been crossed with different diploid species such as L. esculenta , L. pulverulenta and L. trichandra to produce a series of impressive seedless triploid hybrids, but wider use of these hybrids is limited by lack of efficient seed production or vegetative propagation techniques ( Sorensson, 1995 ; Hughes, 1998b ). High crossability within other species of Leucaena ( Sorensson and Brewbaker, 1994 ) means that L. leucocephala can also form spontaneous interspecific hybrids when grown closely with other species of Leucaena . Two such hybrids are relatively common, L. leucocephala X L. esculenta ( L. X mixtec ), documented and named by Hughes and Harris (1994) and L. leucocephala X L. diversifolia ( L. X spontanea ) identified by Hughes and Harris (1995) . Physiology and Phenology Leucaena leucocephala is self-fertile and produces prodigious quantities of seed from the first year, more or less continuously throughout the year as moisture permits, across a wide range of environments ( Gonzalez et al

Physiology and Phenology Leucaena leucocephala is self-fertile and produces prodigious quantities of seed from the first year, more or less continuously throughout the year as moisture permits, across a wide range of environments ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks and are dehiscent, opening when ripe and shedding seeds. It is slightly or completely deciduous depending on the length and severity of the dry season. If the plant is damaged by burning, then regeneration is possible from basal shoots ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). Foliage is extremely palatable to livestock and other browsing mammals. Reproductive Biology Generalist pollinators may pollinate this species ( Hughes, 1998a , b). L. leucocephala is self-fertile and produces seed from the first year, ( Gonzalez et al., 1967 ; Pan, 1988 ; Hughes, 1998b ). There are between 15,000 and 20,000 seeds per kilogram. Fruits ripen in 10-15 weeks. Seeds are dispersed mainly by gravity and in moving water, and though some are moved by insects and rodents this is a relatively minor process ( Hughes, 1998a , b). The hard coats of seeds allow a persistent seedbank to develop ( Hughes, 1998a , b).

Therefore, it grows best in areas below about 1500 m altitude and up to 15-25° north or south of the equator, although it can survive over a much wider range to about 2000 m and up to 40° north or south of the equator.

Similarly, L. leucocephala grows well only in sub-humid or humid climates (650-3000 mm) with moderate dry seasons of up to 6-7 months. Although it can survive in climates with as little as 300-500 mm rainfall, growth is slow and seedling mortality is high.

Overview
Appearance
Leucaena leucocephala
is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 16 ft. (5 m) in height.
Foliage
The bipinnate leaves are about 10 in. (25 cm) long. There are approximately 12 pairs of lanceolate shaped leaflets each about 0.35-0.47 in. (9-12 mm) long, 0.08-0.14 in. (2-3.5 mm) wide. Leaflets are oppositely arranged.
Flowers
Flowers grow clustered on the end of branches. Individual flowers are white, turning brown with maturity.
Fruit
Leucaena leucocephala
is a prolific seed producer. The dark brown seed pods are flat, roughly 4-6 in. (10-15 cm) long, with about 20 seeds. Seeds are glossy brown, oval, flat, 0.24 in. (6 mm) long.
Ecological Threat
In areas where
Leucaena leucocephala
is considered an invasive weed, it will form dense thickets and displace the native vegetation. Disturbed, cleared areas, coastal strands, outskirts of forests and canopy gaps are some locations regularly invaded by
Leucaena leucocephala.
