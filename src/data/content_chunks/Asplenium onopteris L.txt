Asplenium onopterisL. - Irish Spleenwort  -Aspleniaceae© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This is an extremely rare fern which may be extinct now in Northern Ireland. It is closely related toAsplenium adiantum-nigrumbut differs from that very common species by having smaller spores and narrower segments to the leaf, so that it looks more delicate. It is only known from one site near Newtownards where it has not been seen since 1946. Similar-looking plants grow on the cliffs of Binevenagh but are in fact forms ofAsplenium adiantum-nigrum.All names:Asplenium onopterisL.;Asplenium adiantum-nigrum ssp. onopteris(L.)
