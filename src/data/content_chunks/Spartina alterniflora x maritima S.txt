Spartina alterniflora x maritima (S. x townsendii)Groves & J.Groves - Townsend's Cord-grass  -Gramineae / Poaceae(Map updated: March 2008)WhenSpartinaxalterniflora(an American introduction) hybridized with the native EnglishS. maritimait produced a sterile hybrid calledSpartinaxtownsendii. It is sterile and cannot produce seed, but is a vigorous colonizer of estuarine mudflats and was deliberately introduced into Lough Foyle by the LMS railway company to protect their coastal line to Londonderry from erosion by the sea. The Lough Foyle population seems to be the only one of this hybrid in Northern Ireland.The derivativeSpartinaxanglica(Common cord-grass) occurs mixed up with theSpartinaxtownsendiiin Lough Foyle in some places.All names:Spartina alterniflora x maritima (S. x townsendii)Groves & J.Groves;Spartina x townsendiiGroves & J.Groves;Spartina alterniflora x maritima;Spartina alternifolia x maritimaNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
