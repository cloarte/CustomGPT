 base, striate, glabrous or sparsely haired (hairs simple or branched) and pale green. The root is a thin taproot which is sometimes branched. The basal leaves are petioled, oblanceolate with a blunt tip and are commonly deeply lobed. They are 15 cm long, 4 cm wide and spread in a rosette form (Holm et al., 1977). The upper stem leaves are smaller (8 cm long, 1.5 cm wide), alternate, sessile and clasping the stem with ear-like projections.The flowers are white in long terminal racemes with a pinkish or green calyx, a white corolla and four obovate petals of 2 mm length. The pod (silique) is flattened, triangular, notched at the apex and stalked. Each pod contains about 20 seeds attached to a thin membranous septa. The seed is about 1 mm long, oblong, orange-yellow with a dull and punctured surface.

A brief description on the biology, morphology, distribution, habitat, history and uses of Capsella bursa-pastoris have been recently published by Defelice (2001).C. bursa-pastoris is an annual or biennial herb which grows up to 80 cm tall. It is a partially self-pollinating, autogamous plant and behaves as a quantitative long-day plant ( Hurka et al., 1976 ). The ovule and seed morphogenesis has been studied in detail by Shamrov (2002). C. bursa-pastoris propagates by seed, producing 5000-90,000 seeds per plant ( Hurka and Haase, 1982 ). Norris et al. (1996) reported the production of 30,000 to 150,000 seeds by C. bursa-pastoris in the absence of competition. C. bursa-pastoris shows a high production of small and nutritive (oily) seeds of great longevity ( Holzner and Numata, 1982 ). A description of the complexity of germination in C. bursella-pastoris were made by Popay and Roberts (1970a, b). Most of the seeds are dormant after shedding and the dormancy is normally broken by low temperatures during the first winter. For optimal germination seeds need humidity, temperatures of about 10°C and full-spectrum sunlight. Light filtered by a plant canopy inhibits germination, as well as high carbon dioxide concentrations and darkness. Dormancy regulation ensures that some seeds are always

 (1970a, b). Most of the seeds are dormant after shedding and the dormancy is normally broken by low temperatures during the first winter. For optimal germination seeds need humidity, temperatures of about 10°C and full-spectrum sunlight. Light filtered by a plant canopy inhibits germination, as well as high carbon dioxide concentrations and darkness. Dormancy regulation ensures that some seeds are always ready to germinate if conditions become favourable and a high percentage of the seed bank stay dormant as a reserve ( Holzner and Numata, 1982 ). This results in germination occurring throughout the year ( Markov, 1976 ). Tillage of the soil under humid conditions exposes more seeds to light, which may lead to germination of buried seeds.Muniz (2000) studied the influence of temperature and photoperiod on seed germination of C. bursa-pastoris and other common weeds of Spain. The author found that the optimum emergence of C. bursa-pastoris was obtained when seeds were previously subjected to -10°C for three days and then maintained in a climatic chamber under a 12-h photoperiod and constant 25°C.The annual rate of decrease of the soil seed bank is low. Barralis et al. (1988) measured about 40% per year. Lawson et al. (1993) reported that a 99% decline of the seed bank takes between 4.3 and 6.5 years for the species C. bursa-pastoris, Poa annua, Chenopodium album and Polygonum aviculare.The influence of germination temperature, pre-cooling, light, nitrate and water stress on the germination of 10 undesirable weeds and grasses was investigated in Germany by Ziron and Opitz von Boberfeld (2001).

Among other species, C. bursa-pastoris, light and nitrate were the most important variables, except for B. hordeaceus which germinated mainly in vegetation gaps.The morphological characteristics of seeds and the effects of environmental factors on seed emergence was investigated in C. bursa-pastoris in Japan by Shibayama and Ogawa (2000). The number of seeds per fruit varied with the ripening or harvesting period, but not with the position of the fruits. The highest germination percentage of seeds was obtained at 25°C (day)-10°C (night). The emergence pattern of seeds stored under low temperature conditions did not vary with the seed harvesting period. The germination percentage seeds was slightly higher under conditions of soil disturbance, compared to control conditions, authors report.The lipid composition of the aerial part of C. bursa-pastoris, collected during flowering in Uzbekistan, was studied by Bekker et al., (2002). The benzene extract comprised 34.7% polar lipids, pheophytins a and b and monoacylglycerols, 12.4% diacylglycerols, sterols and chlorophylls a and b, 25.8% free fatty acids and triterpenols, 6.7% triacylglycerols, 12.8% waxy esters, 3.5% hydrocarbons, and 4.1% unidentified compounds.

The CHCl3 extract was also separated by PTLC and comprised 65% polar lipids (73% glycolipids and 27% phospholipids).C. bursa-pastoris is frost tolerant ( Bonfils et al., 1991 ) and it shows a high phenotypic plasticity and is split up into several races ( Korsmo, 1954 ; Holzner and Numata, 1982 ). According the Milberg and Andersson (1997) , the seeds of C. bursa-pastoris germinate mainly in the autumn. Light is a requirement for germination and in many cases a short light exposure (1050 µmol/m²) was enough to fulfill this requirement. Changes in seasonal dormancy were detected using this short light treatment indicating that light is not a simple, dichotomous factor in its effect on germination.Kim Young Jin et al. (1998) studied the effect of soil chemical properties on weed development and plant coverage in pasture at 567 sites in the Korea Republic. Coverage of C. bursa-pastoris increased with rising soil pH (maximum coverage at pH >6.0) and as the exchangeable cation (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) content increased in the soil.Grundy and Mead (2000) have consistently advanced in the modelling weed emergence as a function of meteorological records. Results indicated that temperature was the dominant factor in predicting emergence in five weed species among them C. bursa-pastoris. Soil moisture, while also important, was a secondary factor only becoming important once the species-specific temperature requirement had been satisfied Significant differences in some reproductive parameters of biotypes of Bemisia tabaci with regard to four species of winter weeds were determined by Muniz (2000): the

Results suggest that it is important to suppress the growth of weeds such as shepherd's purse to avoid increased populations of the pest.Please also see section on Natural Enemies.

Shepherd’s purse has erect stems that grow 4 – 26 inches in height.  Stems can be simple to branched and have short star-shaped hairs.  Basal rosette leaves are 1-2.5 inches long, lance-shaped, broadest toward the tip, and can be entire or pinnately lobed.  Stem leaves smaller, clasp the stems, and are oblong often with shallow teeth.  Flowers are small, obovate to spoon shaped and white to pink in color and develop on slender spreading stalks.  Seeds pods are triangular to heart shaped and flattened.  Each pod contains approximately 20 minute dull orange seeds.HabitatsShepherd’s purse can be found in disturbed areas, gardens, farmland, fallow lands, roadsides, and cultivated fields.ImpactsShepherd’s purse may inhibit the establishment of native and desired species.

.HabitatsShepherd’s purse can be found in disturbed areas, gardens, farmland, fallow lands, roadsides, and cultivated fields.ImpactsShepherd’s purse may inhibit the establishment of native and desired species.  Shepherd’s purse is also a host for nematode species and viruses.Biology and EcologyShepherd’s purse reproduces entirely by seed. Seeds require open soil to germinate. Flowers appear from May to July.  Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals, and mud on vehicles.Management ApproachesManagement practices that prevent seed set can control shepherd’s purse.Biological ControlThere are no biological controls available for shepherd’s purse.Mechanical and Cultural ControlPlanting competitive grasses or other cover crops can help prevent infestations of Shepherd’s purse.  Tilling and mowing can be effective if done prior to flowering.Chemical ControlShepherd’s purse populations in Poland have been reported to be resistant to photosystem II inhibitors, but there have been no reports of herbicide resistance in the United States.

The basal leaves are petioled, oblanceolate with a blunt tip and are commonly deeply lobed. They are 15 cm long, 4 cm wide and spread in a rosette form (Holm et al., 1977). The upper stem leaves are smaller (8 cm long, 1.5 cm wide), alternate, sessile and clasping the stem with ear-like projections.The flowers are white in long terminal racemes with a pinkish or green calyx, a white corolla and four obovate petals of 2 mm length. The pod (silique) is flattened, triangular, notched at the apex and stalked. Each pod contains about 20 seeds attached to a thin membranous septa. The seed is about 1 mm long, oblong, orange-yellow with a dull and punctured surface.

A brief description on the biology, morphology, distribution, habitat, history and uses of Capsella bursa-pastoris have been recently published by Defelice (2001).C. bursa-pastoris is an annual or biennial herb which grows up to 80 cm tall. It is a partially self-pollinating, autogamous plant and behaves as a quantitative long-day plant ( Hurka et al., 1976 ). The ovule and seed morphogenesis has been studied in detail by Shamrov (2002). C. bursa-pastoris propagates by seed, producing 5000-90,000 seeds per plant ( Hurka and Haase, 1982 ). Norris et al. (1996) reported the production of 30,000 to 150,000 seeds by C. bursa-pastoris in the absence of competition. C. bursa-pastoris shows a high production of small and nutritive (oily) seeds of great longevity ( Holzner and Numata, 1982 ). A description of the complexity of germination in C. bursella-pastoris were made by Popay and Roberts (1970a, b). Most of the seeds are dormant after shedding and the dormancy is normally broken by low temperatures during the first winter. For optimal germination seeds need humidity, temperatures of about 10°C and full-spectrum sunlight.

 (1970a, b). Most of the seeds are dormant after shedding and the dormancy is normally broken by low temperatures during the first winter. For optimal germination seeds need humidity, temperatures of about 10°C and full-spectrum sunlight. Light filtered by a plant canopy inhibits germination, as well as high carbon dioxide concentrations and darkness. Dormancy regulation ensures that some seeds are always ready to germinate if conditions become favourable and a high percentage of the seed bank stay dormant as a reserve ( Holzner and Numata, 1982 ). This results in germination occurring throughout the year ( Markov, 1976 ). Tillage of the soil under humid conditions exposes more seeds to light, which may lead to germination of buried seeds.Muniz (2000) studied the influence of temperature and photoperiod on seed germination of C. bursa-pastoris and other common weeds of Spain. The author found that the optimum emergence of C. bursa-pastoris was obtained when seeds were previously subjected to -10°C for three days and then maintained in a climatic chamber under a 12-h photoperiod and constant 25°C.The annual rate of decrease of the soil seed bank is low. Barralis et al. (1988) measured about 40% per year. Lawson et al. (1993) reported that a 99% decline of the seed bank takes between 4.3 and 6.5 years for the species C. bursa-pastoris, Poa annua, Chenopodium album and Polygonum aviculare.The influence of germination temperature, pre-cooling, light, nitrate and water stress on the germination of 10 undesirable weeds and grasses was investigated in Germany by Ziron and Opitz von Boberfeld (2001).

Among other species, C. bursa-pastoris, light and nitrate were the most important variables, except for B. hordeaceus which germinated mainly in vegetation gaps.The morphological characteristics of seeds and the effects of environmental factors on seed emergence was investigated in C. bursa-pastoris in Japan by Shibayama and Ogawa (2000). The number of seeds per fruit varied with the ripening or harvesting period, but not with the position of the fruits. The highest germination percentage of seeds was obtained at 25°C (day)-10°C (night). The emergence pattern of seeds stored under low temperature conditions did not vary with the seed harvesting period. The germination percentage seeds was slightly higher under conditions of soil disturbance, compared to control conditions, authors report.The lipid composition of the aerial part of C. bursa-pastoris, collected during flowering in Uzbekistan, was studied by Bekker et al., (2002). The benzene extract comprised 34.7% polar lipids, pheophytins a and b and monoacylglycerols, 12.4% diacylglycerols, sterols and chlorophylls a and b, 25.8% free fatty acids and triterpenols, 6.7% triacylglycerols, 12.8% waxy esters, 3.5% hydrocarbons, and 4.1% unidentified compounds.

The CHCl3 extract was also separated by PTLC and comprised 65% polar lipids (73% glycolipids and 27% phospholipids).C. bursa-pastoris is frost tolerant ( Bonfils et al., 1991 ) and it shows a high phenotypic plasticity and is split up into several races ( Korsmo, 1954 ; Holzner and Numata, 1982 ). According the Milberg and Andersson (1997) , the seeds of C. bursa-pastoris germinate mainly in the autumn. Light is a requirement for germination and in many cases a short light exposure (1050 µmol/m²) was enough to fulfill this requirement. Changes in seasonal dormancy were detected using this short light treatment indicating that light is not a simple, dichotomous factor in its effect on germination.Kim Young Jin et al. (1998) studied the effect of soil chemical properties on weed development and plant coverage in pasture at 567 sites in the Korea Republic. Coverage of C. bursa-pastoris increased with rising soil pH (maximum coverage at pH >6.0) and as the exchangeable cation (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) content increased in the soil.Grundy and Mead (2000) have consistently advanced in the modelling weed emergence as a function of meteorological records. Results indicated that temperature was the dominant factor in predicting emergence in five weed species among them C. bursa-pastoris. Soil moisture, while also important, was a secondary factor only becoming important once the species-specific temperature requirement had been satisfied Significant differences in some reproductive parameters of biotypes of Bemisia tabaci with regard to four species of winter weeds were determined by Muniz (2000): the

Shepherd’s purse has erect stems that grow 4 – 26 inches in height.  Stems can be simple to branched and have short star-shaped hairs.  Basal rosette leaves are 1-2.5 inches long, lance-shaped, broadest toward the tip, and can be entire or pinnately lobed.  Stem leaves smaller, clasp the stems, and are oblong often with shallow teeth.  Flowers are small, obovate to spoon shaped and white to pink in color and develop on slender spreading stalks.  Seeds pods are triangular to heart shaped and flattened.  Each pod contains approximately 20 minute dull orange seeds.HabitatsShepherd’s purse can be found in disturbed areas, gardens, farmland, fallow lands, roadsides, and cultivated fields.ImpactsShepherd’s purse may inhibit the establishment of native and desired species.

.HabitatsShepherd’s purse can be found in disturbed areas, gardens, farmland, fallow lands, roadsides, and cultivated fields.ImpactsShepherd’s purse may inhibit the establishment of native and desired species.  Shepherd’s purse is also a host for nematode species and viruses.Biology and EcologyShepherd’s purse reproduces entirely by seed. Seeds require open soil to germinate. Flowers appear from May to July.  Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals, and mud on vehicles.Management ApproachesManagement practices that prevent seed set can control shepherd’s purse.Biological ControlThere are no biological controls available for shepherd’s purse.Mechanical and Cultural ControlPlanting competitive grasses or other cover crops can help prevent infestations of Shepherd’s purse.  Tilling and mowing can be effective if done prior to flowering.Chemical ControlShepherd’s purse populations in Poland have been reported to be resistant to photosystem II inhibitors, but there have been no reports of herbicide resistance in the United States.  For more information on herbicide resistance please see:http://www.weedscience.org/Summary/USpeciesCountry.asp?lstWeedID=41&FmCommonName=GoFor herbicide recommendations for specific grain rotations and weeds in Montana, please see the MSUHerbicide Chooser Tool.Examples of herbicides that can be used to manage Shepherd's purseConsult herbicide labels for additional rate, application, and safety information.
