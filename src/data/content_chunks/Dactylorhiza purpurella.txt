Dactylorhiza purpurella(Stephenson & T.A.Stephenson) Soo - Northern Marsh-Orchid  -Orchidaceae© Paul Hackney© Fiona McCrory© Robert Thompson(Map updated: March 2008)© Robert ThompsonNorthern Marsh-Orchid (Dactylorhiza purpurella). A plant of wet ground in dune-slacks, marshes and fens where the water is not too acidic.The dunes of the north coast are an excellent place to view this species, and its hybrid with the Common Spotted-Orchid (D. fuchsii).It is a handsome plant (the hybrid is even more so) with deep purple flowers whose flat lower lip is marked with darker lines and blotches. The lip is broadly diamond-shaped, not 3-lobed (unlike its close relative the Western Marsh-Orchid (D. majalis)), although it sometimes has a small point or lobe which sticks out slightly from the middle.All names:Dactylorhiza purpurella(Stephenson & T.A.Stephenson) Soo;Dactylorhiza majalis ssp. purpurella(Stephenson & T.A.Stephenson) David Moore & Soo;Dactylorchis purpurella(Stephenson & T.A.Stephenson) Vermuelen;Orchis purpurellaT. & T.A.StephensonNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
