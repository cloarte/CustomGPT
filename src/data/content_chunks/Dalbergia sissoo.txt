 Invasion: Dalbergia sissoois a medium to large, deciduous, long-lived tree with a spreading crown and thick branches. Young branches are pubescent (Flora of Pakistan Editorial Committee, 2023). It attains a height of up to 30 m and a girth of 2.4 m; the bole is often crooked. In the Rawalpindi district, Pakistan, it occurs in the form of a straggling bush at an altitude of 1500 m, clinging to crevices in the sides of sandstone cliffs (Troup, 1921). The bark is thick, rough and grey, and has shallow, broad, longitudinal fissures exfoliating in irregular woody strips and scales (Luna, 1996).D. sissoodevelops a long taproot from an early age and has numerous lateral ramifying roots (Hocking, 1993).

 Reproduccion: Considerable variation occurs in stem form and growth even in one-year-old D. sissoo seedlings, as shown by a high coefficient of variation for 23 one-year-old open-pollinated progenies ( Vidakovic and Siddiqui, 1968 ). Poor stem form, crooked bole and forking are major drawbacks in this species, and these traits appear to be under a high degree of genetic control ( Vidakovic and Ahsan, 1970 ). In Pakistan, half-sib progenies of D. sissoo showed significant differences among three geographical sources in a six-year-old experimental plantation ( Rehman and Hussain, 1986 ). A trial of 27 provenances established at New Forest, Dehra Dun, India, has shown highly significant differences in growth between provenances ( Tewari, 1994 ), and ten seed and seedling characteristics showed significant differences in trait means and variances over the entire natural range in India (Vakshasya, 1992). Seed weight was found to be an important variable for the selection of suitable seed sources, and it was also shown that there may be dry and wet zone populations in this species ( Luna, 1996 ).

Seed weight was found to be an important variable for the selection of suitable seed sources, and it was also shown that there may be dry and wet zone populations in this species ( Luna, 1996 ). This species reproduces mostly by seed, by it is also able to root sucker, and it can thus form dense thickets. At 9 months, D. sissoo starts producing flowers profusely, these are small bisexual flowers borne on small branches from the leaf axis. It is not known with any degree of certainty if D. sissoo is insect- or wind-pollinated, or if both vectors play a role. It is also uncertain whether it is a self-pollinating or outcrossing species, or both, or when pollination and fertilization occur ( Vidakovic and Ahsan, 1970 ), but it appears to be insect pollinated and trees can apparently be both self- and out-crossing to varying degrees depending on local conditions ( ICRAF, 2007 ). There are 40,000-50,000 seeds per kilogram, but the number of viable seed is about 25,000. Normally, every year is a good seed year ( Troup, 1921 ). Fresh seed has 7.5% moisture and 95-100% germination. The seed, when stored dry or at 5°C in a cold store, retains its viability for 1 year with 70-90% germination ( Pakistan Forest Institute, 1997 ). In its natural range, the leaves begin to fall in November, turning brown prior to abscission. In colder climates, the tree may be leafless by the beginning of December, while in some areas the leaves persist until the end of January. In very moist situations and warmer areas, some leaves may persist, while new leaves start appearing in the first half of February with flushing completed by the first of week of March ( Haq, 1985 ).

In very moist situations and warmer areas, some leaves may persist, while new leaves start appearing in the first half of February with flushing completed by the first of week of March ( Haq, 1985 ). Young flower buds appear with the new leaves and open in March-April. The pods are prominent by April and full-sized by July. They turn brown and the seed ripens by December or early January ( Haq, 1985 ). Mature pods can remain attached to the tree for 7-8 months ( ICRAF, 2007 ). Dalbergia sissoo is a strong light demander from the seedling stage onwards. Only vigorous trees attain large size in dense stands and these tend to suppress and kill weaker trees ( Troup, 1921 ). D. sissoo coppices and throws root suckers vigorously and profusely, often sending up masses of shoots. It has the ability to withstand frequent lopping for fuelwood for many years. D. sissoo is not fire-resistant. The roots are dimorphous, comprising nutrition roots without buds which penetrate downwards into the soil and long horizontal roots with buds, from which suckers are produced. The seedlings produce a long taproot at an early age, which becomes thick during the sapling stage. In trees, the taproot is sometimes thicker than the bole itself; it may consist of several branches with numerous subsidiary fibrous nutrition roots. The lateral roots may also attain considerable size; these remain near the ground surface. The tree is generally wind-firm due to the root system, but windthrow is not uncommon in irrigated plantations in Pakistan.

The tree is generally wind-firm due to the root system, but windthrow is not uncommon in irrigated plantations in Pakistan. Weed competition adversely affects D. sissoo regeneration and growth ( Bokhari, 1973 ). Dalbergia sissoo is a nitrogen-fixing species in symbiosis with Rhizobium . Dalbergia sissoo grows naturally under subtropical climatic conditions ( Singh, 1989 ) characterized by a mean annual temperature of 18-24°C and mean January temperature of 10-15°C, with a pronounced winter and occasional frost ( Siddiqui, 1997 ). However, in its natural habitat and in areas of its introduction in the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, the absolute maximum temperature of the hottest month may be as high as 50°C and the minimum -4°C (Hocking, 1993). In its natural range, the annual rainfall varies from 750 to 4500 mm, most of it falling in June to September ( Gupta, 1993 ; Luna, 1996 ); however, it is considered mainly for planting in areas with an annual rainfall of <1700 mm ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Its best growth is achieved with more than 1000 mm annual rainfall; however, D. sissoo can survive with only 400 mm rainfall and can withstand up to a nine-month dry season (where rainfall is <40 mm per month) ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Dalbergia sissoo is most typically found on seasonally inundated alluvium and on eroded/gullied areas in the sub-Himalayan tract.

Dalbergia sissoo is most typically found on seasonally inundated alluvium and on eroded/gullied areas in the sub-Himalayan tract. It prefers porous soils with adequate moisture, light/medium texture and neutral to acidic reaction; soils may be composed of sand, pebbles and boulder alluvium ( Luna, 1996 ). D. sissoo does not grow well on badly-drained stiff clayey soils, or moderately or highly saline soils. Its growth is also poor on rocky outcrops and hilly cliffs, where heavy mortality is observed.

Poor stem form, crooked bole and forking are major drawbacks in this species, and these traits appear to be under a high degree of genetic control ( Vidakovic and Ahsan, 1970 ). In Pakistan, half-sib progenies of D. sissoo showed significant differences among three geographical sources in a six-year-old experimental plantation ( Rehman and Hussain, 1986 ). A trial of 27 provenances established at New Forest, Dehra Dun, India, has shown highly significant differences in growth between provenances ( Tewari, 1994 ), and ten seed and seedling characteristics showed significant differences in trait means and variances over the entire natural range in India (Vakshasya, 1992). Seed weight was found to be an important variable for the selection

 1986 ). A trial of 27 provenances established at New Forest, Dehra Dun, India, has shown highly significant differences in growth between provenances ( Tewari, 1994 ), and ten seed and seedling characteristics showed significant differences in trait means and variances over the entire natural range in India (Vakshasya, 1992). Seed weight was found to be an important variable for the selection of suitable seed sources, and it was also shown that there may be dry and wet zone populations in this species ( Luna, 1996 ). Reproductive Biology This species reproduces mostly by seed, by it is also able to root sucker, and it can thus form dense thickets. At 9 months, D. sissoo starts producing flowers profusely, these are small bisexual flowers borne on small branches from the leaf axis. It is not known with any degree of certainty if D. sissoo is insect- or wind-pollinated, or if both vectors play a role. It is also uncertain whether it is a self-pollinating or outcrossing species, or both, or when pollination and fertilization occur ( Vidakovic and Ahsan, 1970 ), but it appears to be insect pollinated and trees can apparently be both self- and out-crossing to varying degrees depending on local conditions ( ICRAF, 2007 ). There are 40,000-50,000 seeds per kilogram, but the number of viable seed is about 25,000. Normally, every year is a good seed year ( Troup, 1921 ). Fresh seed has 7.5% moisture and 95-100% germination. The seed, when stored dry or at 5°C in a cold store, retains its viability for 1 year with 70-90% germination ( Pakistan Forest Institute, 1997 ). Physiology and Phenology In its natural range, the leaves begin to fall in November, turning brown prior to abscission. In colder climates, the tree may

5% moisture and 95-100% germination. The seed, when stored dry or at 5°C in a cold store, retains its viability for 1 year with 70-90% germination ( Pakistan Forest Institute, 1997 ). Physiology and Phenology In its natural range, the leaves begin to fall in November, turning brown prior to abscission. In colder climates, the tree may be leafless by the beginning of December, while in some areas the leaves persist until the end of January. In very moist situations and warmer areas, some leaves may persist, while new leaves start appearing in the first half of February with flushing completed by the first of week of March ( Haq, 1985 ). Young flower buds appear with the new leaves and open in March-April. The pods are prominent by April and full-sized by July. They turn brown and the seed ripens by December or early January ( Haq, 1985 ). Mature pods can remain attached to the tree for 7-8 months ( ICRAF, 2007 ). Dalbergia sissoo is a strong light demander from the seedling stage onwards. Only vigorous trees attain large size in dense stands and these tend to suppress and kill weaker trees ( Troup, 1921 ). D. sissoo coppices and throws root suckers vigorously and profusely, often sending up masses of shoots. It has the ability to withstand frequent lopping for fuelwood for many years. D. sissoo is not fire-resistant. The roots are dimorphous, comprising nutrition roots without buds which penetrate downwards into the soil and long horizontal roots with buds, from which suckers are produced. The seedlings produce a long taproot at an early age, which becomes thick during the sapling stage. In trees, the taproot is sometimes thicker than the bole itself; it may consist of several branches with numerous subsidiary fibrous nutrition roots. The lateral roots may also attain considerable

 without buds which penetrate downwards into the soil and long horizontal roots with buds, from which suckers are produced. The seedlings produce a long taproot at an early age, which becomes thick during the sapling stage. In trees, the taproot is sometimes thicker than the bole itself; it may consist of several branches with numerous subsidiary fibrous nutrition roots. The lateral roots may also attain considerable size; these remain near the ground surface. The tree is generally wind-firm due to the root system, but windthrow is not uncommon in irrigated plantations in Pakistan. Weed competition adversely affects D. sissoo regeneration and growth ( Bokhari, 1973 ). Associations Dalbergia sissoo is a nitrogen-fixing species in symbiosis with Rhizobium . Climate Dalbergia sissoo grows naturally under subtropical climatic conditions ( Singh, 1989 ) characterized by a mean annual temperature of 18-24°C and mean January temperature of 10-15°C, with a pronounced winter and occasional frost ( Siddiqui, 1997 ). However, in its natural habitat and in areas of its introduction in the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, the absolute maximum temperature of the hottest month may be as high as 50°C and the minimum -4°C (Hocking, 1993). In its natural range, the annual rainfall varies from 750 to 4500 mm, most of it falling in June to September ( Gupta, 1993 ; Luna, 1996 ); however, it is considered mainly for planting in areas with an annual rainfall of <1700 mm ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Its best growth is achieved with more than 1000 mm annual rainfall; however, D. sissoo can survive with only 400 mm rainfall and can withstand up to a nine-month dry season (where rainfall is <40 mm per month) ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ).

 mm ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Its best growth is achieved with more than 1000 mm annual rainfall; however, D. sissoo can survive with only 400 mm rainfall and can withstand up to a nine-month dry season (where rainfall is <40 mm per month) ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Soil and Physiography Dalbergia sissoo is most typically found on seasonally inundated alluvium and on eroded/gullied areas in the sub-Himalayan tract. It prefers porous soils with adequate moisture, light/medium texture and neutral to acidic reaction; soils may be composed of sand, pebbles and boulder alluvium ( Luna, 1996 ). D. sissoo does not grow well on badly-drained stiff clayey soils, or moderately or highly saline soils. Its growth is also poor on rocky outcrops and hilly cliffs, where heavy mortality is observed.
