 Invasion: The following description is fromBerni et al. (1979)and Sistema Nacional Argentino de Vigilancia y Monitoreo dePlagas (2020); for a comprehensive description seeRodríguez et al. (1983):
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: Cultivated / agricultural land, Urban / peri-urban areas, Riverbanks, Wetlands, Rivers / streams
 Reproduccion: A chromosome number of 2 n = 38 has been reported for S. humboldtiana . Eighteen polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci have been identified in this species which can be used in further studies of genetic diversity and differentiation ( Bozzi et al., 2015 ). The genetic differentiation observed recently in S. humboldtiana is strongly correlated with its distribution ( Hernandez-Leal et al. (2019) . Salix humboldtiana flowers in September and October, with pollination through small insects and fruiting occurring from February to April ( Lorenzi, 2002 ). Seeds are dispersed by wind. Vegetative reproduction is common in the Salicaceae family, from branches that root when in contact with the ground. This species only reproduces vegetatively in Australia as female plants are not present ( Spencer, 1997 ) and flowering rarely occurs; when present, the male catkins are 3-10 cm long and 6-10 mm wide ( Baker, 2009 ). Physiology and Phenology Salix humboldtiana is semi-deciduous, retaining some of its leaves all year round ( Baker, 2009 ). Salix humboldtiana tolerates minimum temperatures of -3.2°C to 9.9°C and maximum temperatures of 16.5°C to 31.3

Salix humboldtiana tolerates minimum temperatures of -3.2°C to 9.9°C and maximum temperatures of 16.5°C to 31.3°C, with a wide range of rainfall ( Rodríguez et al., 1983 ); it is susceptible to frost ( Newsholme, 1992 ). This species is found in the Colombian Amazon, at altitudes of about 100 m ( Bernal et al., 2015 ) to 2600 m ( Standley, 1937 ; Bairstow, 2018 ) and in Chile from near sea level to 600 m ( Rodríguez et al., 1983 ). It is found mainly in humid soils ( Lorenzi, 2002 ) with sandy textures ( Rodríguez et al., 1983 ). Willows are described in general as intolerant of shade ( Haines, 2004 ).
