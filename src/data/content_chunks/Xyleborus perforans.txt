 Invasion: The following diagnostic notes refer to females only and include only the minimum characters required to differentiate this species from other pest species.Adult FemaleLength 2.1-2.5 mm. Frons convex, entire surface minutely reticulate, with faint, shallow punctures. Antennal club solid on posterior face. Pronotum 1.2 times longer than wide; sides moderately arcuate; anterior margin broadly rounded, without serrations. Elytra 1.7 times longer than wide; apex narrowly rounded. Elytral declivity steep, convex, commencing on posterior third of elytra; face of each elytron with a row of 4 to 5 small, acute granules in interspaces 1 and 3; several smaller granules are present in interspaces 4, 5 and 6; interspace 7 rounded, with small, acute granules.Immature StagesThe immature stages have not been described.

 Reproduccion: The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Ambrosiodmus, Euwallacea, Xyleborinus and Xylosandrus, are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. The biology of X. perforans has been studied by Beeson (1930) , Browne (1961) , Schedl (1963) and Kalshoven (1964) . The species is particularly common in disturbed areas. It flies mainly around dusk, and may be attracted to light in large numbers. It normally attacks stressed or recently felled trees, but also readily attacks newly sawn timber ( Browne, 1961 ). It also attacks fire-damaged trees, and salvaged logs ( Wylie and Shanahan, 1976 ; Wylie et al., 1999 ). Living trees are normally only attacked through injuries or diseased areas ( Browne, 1961 ). It is not very size-selective, and attacks stems from about 5 cm diameter to the largest logs, but is not found in small shoots and twigs ( Browne, 1961 ). The gallery system consists of branching tunnels, without enlargements, and penetrate deeply into the wood. When there are dense attacks, the tunnels from different broods may intersect ( Beeson, 1930 ). The tunnels are usually in one transverse plane, but Kalshoven (1964) notes that some galleries have more than one transverse level, the levels connected by vertical galleries, and that side branches may connect to the outside, forming additional openings to the exterior. Sometimes there

 into the wood. When there are dense attacks, the tunnels from different broods may intersect ( Beeson, 1930 ). The tunnels are usually in one transverse plane, but Kalshoven (1964) notes that some galleries have more than one transverse level, the levels connected by vertical galleries, and that side branches may connect to the outside, forming additional openings to the exterior. Sometimes there may be a surface gallery, at the cambial level, before the beetle penetrates the wood ( Browne, 1961 ). The first eggs appear when the tunnel length is from 3-8 cm ( Kalshoven, 1964 ), and the larvae develop and pupate within the gallery system. The parent female and the larvae feed on the ambrosia fungus growing on the walls of the galleries. Kalshoven (1964, quoting Zehnter, 1900 ) gives the duration of the egg stage as 4 days, the larval stage as 7-9 days, and the pupal stage as 4 days, giving a total of only 16-18 days from egg to teneral adult. These are likely to be optimal figures, and in most conditions a generation would be expected to take 4-6 weeks. The total brood size is difficult to estimate because of the intricacies of the tunnel system. Kalshoven (1964) gives figures of 56 to 112 for advanced gallery systems, and total broods may be even higher in favourable conditions. After mating with their brother(s), the new generation of females emerges through the original entrance hole (or presumably also through any additional openings from the gallery system to the exterior). Kalshoven (1964, quoting Zehnter, 1900 ) suggests that the first females of the new generation extend the gallery system, and begin to lay eggs before the parental female has died, so that there may be overlapping generations within a single cane stem. In most countries where it occurs, breeding is continuous throughout the year ( Browne, 1968 ), although
