Background 
 
• In the summer of 2020, a new exotic tick 
species was identified in the United 
States, Haemaphysalis punctata, the red 
sheep tick.  
 
• On August 7, 2020, the National 
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) 
received eight tick samples from the 
Columbia University Ecology, Evolution, 
and Environmental Biology Department. 
The ticks were collected from vegetation 
on Block Island in Washington County, 
Rhode Island from 2013 through 2020. 
NVSL confirmed that the ticks collected 
in Rhode Island were the red sheep tick. 
 
• There are more than 100 different 
species of Haemphysalis worldwide and 
now four species within the United States 
with the recent introduction of 
Haemaphysalis longicornis, the Asian 
longhorned tick (ALHT) and 
Haemaphysalis punctata, the red sheep 
tick.2, 15 
 
  
 
 
Distribution 
• The red sheep tick species is native to 
eastern Asia, Africa, Europe, southern 
Scandinavia, United Kingdom, Russia, and 
Mediterranean countries3, 5, 9, 13 
 
• It has been collected from cold, humid 
regions; coastal regions; warm regions with 
mild winters; and semi-desert regions.1, 12, 
13,14 
 
• This species is generally found

• It has been collected from cold, humid 
regions; coastal regions; warm regions with 
mild winters; and semi-desert regions.1, 12, 
13,14 
 
• This species is generally found associated 
with open grazed grassland, trails, along 
forest edges, primary growth areas with 
overgrown shrubs, forest-steppe, oak 
grazing woods, and salt marshes/forested 
dune areas grazed by livestock.1, 9, 12, 13 
 
Host Associations 
 
• The primary hosts for the red sheep tick are 
cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, donkeys, 
dogs, camels, buffalo, red fox, deer, 
weasel, badger, squirrels, voles, field mice, 
rabbits, hedgehogs, rodents, lizards, and 
humans.1, 10, 12 
 
• It has been collected from more than 16 
different bird species. 1, 4, 5, 6 
 
• Immature ticks (larvae, nymphs) are 
frequently collected from birds and small 
mammals. Migrating birds may play a role 
in the introduction of this species to new 
areas.  
 
• Adult ticks prefer large mammals, 
especially grazing domestic mammals. 12, 
13  
Seasonal Activity 
 
• The red sheep tick is a three-host tick with 
a 1- to 3-year life cycle. 14 
 
• Larvae are active between May and 
October, nymphs between March

Tick-Borne Diseases 
 
• The red sheep tick transmits a variety of 
tick-borne diseases to cattle, equines, 
and dogs, including Babesia major, 
Babesia bigemina, Babesia bovis, 
Babesia caballi, Theileria mutans, 
Theileria buffeli/orientalis group, Theileria 
equi, Theileria annae, Theileria mutans, 
Theileria recondita, Anaplasma 
marginale, Anaplasma centrale, 
Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma 
bovis,, Hepatozoon canis, and Rickettsia 
spp.1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 17 
 
• This tick species also transmits several 
diseases to sheep, including Anaplasma 
ovis, Babesia motasi, Ehrlichia ovina, 
Theileria luwenshuni, and Theileria ovis.1

virus, Tribec virus, Bhanja virus, 
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever 
virus, Coxiella burnettii, and Francisella 
tularensis that affect both ruminants and 
humans have also been associated with 
this tick species.17 
 
Pasture Management and Tick Control 
 
• Use habitat modification practices such 
as keeping grasses cut short and 
removing weeds and brush to reduce 
habitat for ticks to thrive in.16 
 
• Restrict cattle, sheep, and goats from grazing 
in wooded areas or heavily tick-infested 
pastures to reduce tick exposure.16 
 
• Regularly use acaricide treatment (products 
that kill ticks) on vegetation and equipment.16 
 
• Regularly inspect cattle, goats, and sheep for 
ticks, especially in the ears, under the tail 
area, between the hind legs, and in udder 
skin folds. 
 
• Thoroughly clean and sanitize tools and 
devices before and after use on each animal. 
 
 
• Contact your local veterinarian for approved 
acaricide use on livestock and pets. 
 
• If you suspect red sheep tick infestations on 
livestock, equines, and companion animals,
