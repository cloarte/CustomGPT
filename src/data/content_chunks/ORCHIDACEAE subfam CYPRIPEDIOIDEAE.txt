2.ORCHIDACEAEsubfam.CYPRIPEDIOIDEAE杓兰亚科 shao lan ya keAuthors:Xinqi Chen,Zhongjian Liu&Phillip J. CribbSmall to large terrestrial, lithophytic, or rarely epiphytic herbs. Roots elongate, fibrous; rhizome short to elongate. Stems unbranched, obscure to long, erect, leafy. Leaves distichous, 1 to many, plicate or conduplicate, spreading or suberect, green, rarely checkered or tessellated with dark and lighter green or spotted with blackish maroon adaxially, thinly textured, fleshy, or leathery, glabrous or variously pubescent, entire. Inflorescence terminal, 1- to several flowered; rachis hairy, glandular, or glabrous; bracts conduplicate. Flowers usually showy; pedicel obscure to short; ovary 1-locular or 3-locular, glabrous or hairy, lacking an abscission layer. Dorsal sepal erect or hooded over lip, ovate, obovate, or elliptic, obtuse, acute, or acuminate, glabrous or pubescent on outer surface, sometimes pubescent within at base; lateral sepals usually fused to form a concave synsepal ± similar to dorsal sepal, rarely free to base (inCypripedium plectrochilum). Petals free, spreading or pendulous, spiraling or not, elliptic, ovate, linear, or oblanceolate, glabrous or rarely pubescent on outer surface, usually ciliate on margins, sometimes warty on margins; lip deeply pouched, slipper-shaped or urn-shaped, with or more rarely without
