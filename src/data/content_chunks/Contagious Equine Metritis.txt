Contagious Equine Metritis
Contagious equine metritis (CEM) is a highly infectious venereal 
disease of horses. It is caused by the bacteria Taylorella 
equigenitalis. CEM spreads during breeding or through genital 
contact with contaminated objects. It does not affect other 
livestock or people.  This disease could cause considerable 
economic losses to the equine industry if it became established 
in this country. That’s why the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) works with State partners to protect our country’s 
horses against CEM. As a horse owner, breeder, or large animal 
veterinarian, you should learn the signs of this disease and put in 
place measures to protect your horses or horses under your care.
History and Distribution of CEM
The first cases of CEM were diagnosed in England in the 1970s.  
Since then, CEM has been diagnosed in horses in many countries 
around the world.  The United States is currently considered 
free of CEM. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
maintains a list of CEM-affected countries on its website (www.
aphis.usda.gov, search “animal health status of regions”). The 
list includes Japan, South Africa, Korea, all European Union 
countries, and many other countries in Europe, including Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland. For more information on CEM 
reporting around the world, visit the World Animal Health 
Information System at wahis.woah.org.

Controlling CEM in the United States
To help keep this disease out of the United States, USDA 
requires stallions and mares imported from CEM-affected 
countries to quarantine and test negative for CEM before they 
can enter the country. 
If a case of CEM is detected in this country, animal health officials 
identify, test, and treat all infected or exposed horses with 
disinfectant scrubs and antimicrobials to eliminate the bacteria 
T. equigenitalis.  While the United States has had sporadic cases 
of CEM over the years due to the inadvertent importation of 
infected horses, we have successfully eradicated the disease 
from our equine population.  The most widespread U.S. outbreak 
of CEM occurred in 2008.  It took 2 years to eliminate the disease. 
After expensive and time-consuming testing of more than 1,000 
horses, USDA was able to regain the country’s CEM-free status.  
Signs of Infection
Horses infected with CEM can be difficult to identify. Stallions 
carry the bacteria without showing any signs at all and appear 
unable to clear infection without treatment. Carrier stallions can 
silently spread the disease to many other horses at a breeding 
facility, including other stallions, before CEM infection is 
suspected or diagnosed.  Infection in mares may also be difficult 
to detect but is usually more noticeable.  Mares may exhibit the 
following signs of infection:   
	 A thick, milky,

 spread the disease to many other horses at a breeding 
facility, including other stallions, before CEM infection is 
suspected or diagnosed.  Infection in mares may also be difficult 
to detect but is usually more noticeable.  Mares may exhibit the 
following signs of infection:   
	 A thick, milky, mucoid discharge 10 to 14 days after breeding 
to an infected stallion
	 Returning to heat (estrus) prematurely
	 Short-term infertility after breeding to an infected stallion and 
failing to conceive on the first or second estrus after exposure  
Unlike stallions, most affected mares will clear the infection 
without treatment within a few months. However, some mares 
will remain chronically infected, with or without clinical signs. 
These mares are capable of infecting other horses even while 
successfully carrying pregnancies. 
How CEM Spreads
T. equigenitalis, the bacteria that causes CEM, spreads in the 
following ways:    
	 During live cover breeding
	 Through artificial insemination with contaminated semen 
(chilled or frozen)
	 Via contact with contaminated objects, including on hands  
or sheath cleaning and semen collection equipment 
Infected mares able to successfully carry a pregnancy may rarely 
transmit the disease to their foals.

Testing for CEM
Private veterinarians should work with State or Federal animal 
health officials to test horses suspected of having CEM or that 
were exposed to a CEM-positive animal. CEM testing may also be 
necessary to meet requirements for exporting horses, semen, 
or embryos to another country, or as part of a routine breeding 
soundness examination.  There are three types of official tests: 
bacterial culture, blood test, and test breeding.
Bacterial cultures test for growth of T. equigenitalis , the  
bacteria that cause CEM, in swab samples. Veterinarians  
collect swabs and send them to a USDA-approved laboratory. 
(www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/lab_info_services/
downloads/ApprovedLabs_CEM.pdf). The samples require 
special handling and must be processed within 48 hours of 
collection. It takes 7 days to complete the culture process.  
Typically, veterinarians will collect three sets of swabs for 
culturing during a 7- to 12-day period.
Blood testing by complement fixation test (CFT) detects an 
immune response to T. equigenitalis infection. It can help to 
determine if a horse has recently been exposed to the disease. 
This test can only be used in mares because stallions do not 
develop an immune response to infection.
Test breeding is required for stallions under certain 
circumstances in the United States, such as known exposure to 
T. equigenitalis or importation from CEM-affected countries. It

 horse has recently been exposed to the disease. 
This test can only be used in mares because stallions do not 
develop an immune response to infection.
Test breeding is required for stallions under certain 
circumstances in the United States, such as known exposure to 
T. equigenitalis or importation from CEM-affected countries. It 
is more sensitive than direct sampling and culture of the stallion.  
To test breed, a stallion is bred to two mares known to be CEM-
free. Those mares are then tested for CEM. It takes five weeks and 
multiple tests on the mares to declare the stallion negative. Test 
breeding is not normally required to export stallions or semen to 
another country.
Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing for T. equigenitalis is 
not currently recognized in the United States as an official test for 
CEM. USDA is currently evaluating this testing method. 
 
Treatment and Recovery
Infected mares and stallions can be treated using disinfectant 
scrubs and antimicrobials in a specific 5-day treatment protocol. 
Fertility appears to return to normal in recovered horses.
Prevention
You can prevent the spread of CEM by: 
	 Conducting bacterial culture tests on breeding stallions prior 
to each breeding season 
	 Testing any mares that exhibit clinical signs consistent with 
CEM 
	 Using proper biosecurity measures, such as cleaning and dis-
infecting semen collection equipment between stallions 
	 Keeping records on horse movements and semen shipments 
so they can be traced if a case of CEM is detected
