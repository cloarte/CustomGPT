 
The Occurrence of Another Highly Pathogenic Avian Inﬂuenza (HPAI) Spillover 
from Wild Birds into Dairy Cattle 
Background  
In March 2024, the USDA conﬁrmed the ﬁrst case of highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza (HPAI) 
spreading between dairy cattle herds in the United States. This followed reports from dairy 
producers of an unusual illness in their lactating cows over the preceding 2-3 months. Virus 
whole genome sequencing and modeling performed by USDA suggested a single spillover of 
HPAI H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 from wild birds into dairy cattle likely occurred 
between October 2023 and January 2024 (1). Since then, federal, state, and industry partners 
have collaborated to address the HPAI threat in dairy cattle, resulting in two federal orders and 
the implementation of the National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS). 
States began enrolling in the NMTS in December 2024, in which they are continuing to conduct 
or now implementing state-wide bulk tank surveillance and/or milk processing plant silo 
monitoring. Nevada was among the ﬁrst to participate in the National Silo Monitoring Program, 
which includes testing milk samples from processing plant silos for HPAI. This sampling scheme 
coincides with the FDA's existing regulatory program, which requires all raw milk Grade A silos 
to be sampled four times within 6 months. 
The Detection 
In Nevada, 3 of 11 silo samples collected on January 6 and 7, 2025 tested positive for HPAI via 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) on 
January 10.

 regulatory program, which requires all raw milk Grade A silos 
to be sampled four times within 6 months. 
The Detection 
In Nevada, 3 of 11 silo samples collected on January 6 and 7, 2025 tested positive for HPAI via 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) on 
January 10. The state was notiﬁed, triggering an investigation to trace the source, as up to  
12 dairies (in the same geographic region) could have contributed milk to the aﬀected silos. On 
January 17, regulatory oﬃcials collected on-farm bulk milk samples from suspected dairy farms 
and submitted them to the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL), a 
member of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN). HPAI was conﬁrmed via 
PCR at NVSL on Friday, January 24, in samples from two of those dairies. NVSL completed whole 
genome sequencing on January 31 and identiﬁed HPAI H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.1 in 
samples from four diﬀerent bulk tanks from one herd. A second herd also showed a partial 
sequence consistent with D1.1. Clinical signs were not observed in the cattle prior to the 
detection, but have been reported since, and the aﬀected dairy producers reported large wild 
bird die-oﬀs near the dairies. 
While genotype D1.1 has been the dominant strain circulating in migratory wild birds across all 
four North American ﬂyways during the winter of 2024-2025, these Nevada cases represent the

While genotype D1.1 has been the dominant strain circulating in migratory wild birds across all 
four North American ﬂyways during the winter of 2024-2025, these Nevada cases represent the 

ﬁrst detection of a genotype other than B3.13 in U.S. dairy cattle and the second known 
spillover from wild birds into lactating dairy cattle. 
Virus Epidemiology and Origin 
Since late 2021, six separate introductions of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b have been 
documented into the migratory wild birds in the North American ﬂyways (genotypes A1 through 
A6). Genotype D1.1 is a reassortant of A3. Genotype A3 ﬁrst appeared in the Paciﬁc ﬂyway in 
April of 2022 with detections only in the Paciﬁc ﬂyway until the fall of 2024. Since this fall, 
genotype A3 has been sporadically reported in migratory wild birds across all four ﬂyways 
through wild bird surveillance, making up 3.3% of the overall detections to date. Genotype D1.1 
retains four genes from the original A3 genotype; hemagglutinin (HA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), 
matrix (M) and nonstructural (NS), with other genes originating from other North American 
lineage viruses found in migratory wild birds. This genotype was ﬁrst detected in September 
2024 and has quickly expanded to all North

 original A3 genotype; hemagglutinin (HA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), 
matrix (M) and nonstructural (NS), with other genes originating from other North American 
lineage viruses found in migratory wild birds. This genotype was ﬁrst detected in September 
2024 and has quickly expanded to all North American ﬂyways. D1.1 is the current predominant 
genotype in migratory wild birds, making up 6.07% of the total detections since 2022 despite 
ﬁrst occurring late 2024. 
The D1.1 viruses identiﬁed in dairy cattle in Nevada were found to be closely related to other 
D1.1 viruses recently detected in migratory wild birds across multiple North American Flyways. 
Analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the Nevada dairy cattle viruses did not identify changes 
predicted to impact infectivity or adaptation to mammalian hosts. However, a change of PB2 
D701N commonly associated with mammalian adaptation of HPAI virus was identiﬁed in viruses 
sequenced from four separate dairy cattle. To date, this change has not been observed in D1.1 
viruses found in wild birds or poultry and is not found in B3.13 genotype viruses detected in 
dairy cattle. PB2 D701N has previously been associated with mammalian adaptation because it 
improves RNA polymerase activity and replication eﬃciency in mammalian cells and has the 
potential to impact pathogenesis in infected mammals (2,3,4,5,6). The change has previously 
been identiﬁed in human cases of HPAI H5 but with no evidence of onward transmission among 
humans (7,8). No other changes associated with

 activity and replication eﬃciency in mammalian cells and has the 
potential to impact pathogenesis in infected mammals (2,3,4,5,6). The change has previously 
been identiﬁed in human cases of HPAI H5 but with no evidence of onward transmission among 
humans (7,8). No other changes associated with mammalian adaptation were identiﬁed in the 
sequences. Of note, these D1.1 viruses sequenced from dairy cattle do not contain the PB2 -
631L marker that appeared to be ﬁxed in dairy cattle B3.13 sequences. Following the existing 
public sharing process, NVSL immediately provided the D1.1 sequence information the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and will post sequence ﬁles to the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) within 7 days of analysis, adding 
metadata as sequences are interpreted and quality checked in light of epidemiological 
information.   
 
Summary 
This detection indicates that this HPAI virus, genotype D1.1, is the second spillover event from 
migratory wild birds to dairy cattle following the B3.13 event in late 2023/early 2024. 
Investigations are ongoing to fully characterize this event. The Nevada Department of 
Agriculture acted quickly, by ﬁrst rapidly enrolling in the NMTS to initiate active surveillance, 
and then to identify and quarantine the aﬀected dairies before cattle movements could further 
transmit this virus beyond the local area. This is the ﬁrst instance where sampling of milk at
