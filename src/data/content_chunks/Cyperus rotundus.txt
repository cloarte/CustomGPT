perus, Cyperus rotundus
 Invasion: C. rotundusis a highly variable perennial sedge. Flowering stems are erect, up to 60 cm tall, 3-sided, smooth with swollen bases (basal bulbs). The leaves have a distinct midrib, are linear, usually shorter than the flowering stem, up to 7 mm wide and emerge from a sheath around the shoot base. The inflorescence is a terminal, open umbel subtended by several leafy bracts. Several unequal rays, 2-6 cm long, support 3-8 reddish-brown to purplish-brown, flattened spikelets, 1-2 cm long and 2 mm wide, each with up to 30 glumes, 3.5-4 mm long. Roots are fibrous. Rhizomes are wiry, dark and persistent, connecting a network of daughter shoots and tubers. The tubers are dark brown to black, irregularly shaped and 1-2 cm long when fully grown. Each tuber has an apical bud and several lateral buds. The fruit (often, but erroneously, known as the seed) is a 3-angled achene, 1.5 mm long, dark brown or black.

 Reproduccion: Descriptions of the biology and ecology of C. rotundus can be found in Ranade and Burns (1925) , Holm et al. (1977) , Mercado (1979) , Jha and Sen (1985) and Parsons and Cuthbertson (1992) . The typical life cycle of C. rotundus starts with growth of the apical bud of a tuber. As the tuber shoot extends, it swells to form a basal bulb (sometimes called a corm), usually near the soil surface, from which an aerial shoot and roots are produced. Up to three, or slightly more, rhizomes grow out of the basal bulb and produce tubers or new basal bulbs and daughter shoots. Rhizomes from the daughter shoots produce tubers from which new rhizomes and tubers develop. Eventually, branched chains of rhizomes and tubers become an extensive, underground network. Meanwhile, the new shoots grow and produce flowers within 3-8 weeks of emergence if stimulated by short photoperiods of 6-8 hours. Most seeds of C. rotundus are not viable; germination seldom averages more than 1-5 % ( Holm et al., 1977 ) though this may be significant when seed production can exceed 100 million/ha in a single year. Tuber dormancy is high on undisturbed sites and may last for at least 7 years ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ).

Tuber dormancy is high on undisturbed sites and may last for at least 7 years ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). Fragmentation of the rhizome/tuber network by cultivation breaks the dormancy imposed by a growing tuber on others in the same chain. Hence, cultivation stimulates the growth of C. rotundus . Large populations of shoots and tubers can develop from a single tuber; as many as 600 plants have been produced in a single year. Horowitz (1972) has reported that 2-3 million tubers per hectare per week can be produced during active growing periods, yielding 30-40 million tubers/ha. Forty tonnes of underground organs have been produced on 1 hectare in a year, giving C. rotundus a phenomenal capacity for vegetative reproduction. Most tubers are found in the upper 15 cm of soil but they can grow down to 30 cm or more in favourable conditions. Neeser et al. (1997) found that a tuber population has a half-life of 16 months and a predicted longevity (99% mortality) of 42 months. C. rotundus has C4 metabolism which supposedly makes it increasingly competitive when temperatures and light intensity rise ( Black et al., 1969 ). It has low tolerance of shade, a property that can be exploited in controlling this weed by crops with dense canopies ( Rambakudzibga, 1999 ). Temperature has a marked effect on the germination of tubers. Sprouting has been reported at temperatures of 13-43°C but the range varies with biotype. Desiccation kills tubers but the duration and temperature of the drying period affects this process. The critical moisture level for tuber germination seems to be in the region of 11.5-15% ( Jha and Sen, 1985 ).

The critical moisture level for tuber germination seems to be in the region of 11.5-15% ( Jha and Sen, 1985 ). Dispersal of C. rotundus occurs when tubers are moved by tillage equipment or other farm machinery. Flood waters may also carry the tubers. Contaminated soil in nursery stock is an avoidable but common method of dispersal. Under natural conditions, a population of C. rotundus extends its boundary by a few metres in a year. Spread by seed is generally regarded as being unimportant.

Leaves are flat or folded, 3-12 cm long, 2-6 mm wide usually hairy on the basal margins, sheaths loose, keeled, finely hairy towards the top and ligule 0.75-1.25 mm long. This weed has 2 (rarely 1 or 3) terminal erect to spreading spike-like racemes, up to 7.5 cm long, each bearing usually solitary greenish to yellowish spikelets in 2 rows along one side. The spikelets are appressed, elliptical and the upper glume hairy. The fruit is a brownish caryopsis. It propagates mainly by creeping stolons and to some extent, by seeds. This weed is found in damp or wet situations, in wetland rice, and in dryland field crops and vegetables planted in bunded fields. P. distichum is difficult to control because the detached stolon fragments regenerate easily and are tolerant of many herbicides. Stolons left on the soil surface for a while may be dessicated under the action of sun and air. Countries: Iran , Nepal , Congo (Democratic) PASPALUM SCROMICULATUM Family: Poaceae Perennial; tufted stems 15-100 cm tall; rooting at the lower nodes; leaves 5-30 cm long; ligule white membrane.

Family: Poaceae Perennial with creeping stems, 30-60 cm tall, stoloniferous; leaves stiff, ascending, 2.5-15 cm long. Inflorescence usually paired racemes, each about 1.5-7.5 cm long; spikelets ovate, flattened, 3-4.5 mm across. P. vaginatum grows well in mangrove rice, coastal swamps and river deltas. Countries: Sierra Leone POTAMOGETON DISTINCTUS A. Benn Family: Potamogetonaceae A fleshy, broadleaf perennial weed, with a glabrous, shiny appearance. An aquatic perennial that grows in rice paddies, ditches, canals, marshes and ponds. It grows from May to October and flowers in July to August. Deep and/or prolonged flooding promote growth. It competes strongly with rice lowering yields and impeding water flow. Floating leaves are long petioled, alternate, lance-oblong to lance-elliptic. Submerged leaves are short-petioled, alternate, pellucid and thin, linear-lanceolate. Elongated flower stalks bear densely flowered spikes borne axillary from the stipules of floating leaves It propagates by rhizomes and seed, but it spreads mainly by fast growing rhizomes and multiplies mainly by excised stems and overwintering scale-buds, formed several per rhizome. Flooded rice is the most suitable environment for the growth of this weed. It is common throughout Korea. It is rather difficult to control due to deep distribution of rhizomes in the soil and

Flooded rice is the most suitable environment for the growth of this weed. It is common throughout Korea. It is rather difficult to control due to deep distribution of rhizomes in the soil and strong ability for regrowth. Stems are simple or short-branched. Countries: China , Egypt PHALARIS MINOR. Retz. Family: Poaceae Stem purplish; leaves dark green at the early stage. The length of internodes is more than wheat thus making it taller than wheat at maturity. P. minor has both tillering and branching which gives it a rosette shape.. A large number of seeds are shattered before harvest. Each ear head produces 400-600 seeds. The caryopsis is elliptic (oval) with a lateral embryo and soft endosperm. Seed colour varies from green (immature) to light yellow and glossy dark brown with hard seed coat. After harvest seed remains dormant for 6 months. Panicle is ovate-oblong , spikelets narrower not so conspicuously striped. The glumes are of 4-6 mm in length, the wing of the keel narrower; fertile lemma lance-ovate about 3 mm long, acute and sterile lemma solitary about 1 mm long. Propagation is by seed. P. minor grows well in cultivated and waste places. It is a weed of many winter season crops, including wheat and barley. P. minor is common in Eurasia, South and North America, East and Southern Africa, and Australia. It is controlled by several herbicides, the application rates of whom varies according to soil and growing conditions.

perus, Cyperus rotundus
 Invasion: C. rotundusis a highly variable perennial sedge. Flowering stems are erect, up to 60 cm tall, 3-sided, smooth with swollen bases (basal bulbs). The leaves have a distinct midrib, are linear, usually shorter than the flowering stem, up to 7 mm wide and emerge from a sheath around the shoot base. The inflorescence is a terminal, open umbel subtended by several leafy bracts. Several unequal rays, 2-6 cm long, support 3-8 reddish-brown to purplish-brown, flattened spikelets, 1-2 cm long and 2 mm wide, each with up to 30 glumes, 3.5-4 mm long. Roots are fibrous. Rhizomes are wiry, dark and persistent, connecting a network of daughter shoots and tubers. The tubers are dark brown to black, irregularly shaped and 1-2 cm long when fully grown. Each tuber has an apical bud and several lateral buds. The fruit (often, but erroneously, known as the seed) is a 3-angled achene, 1.5 mm long, dark brown or black.

 Reproduccion: Descriptions of the biology and ecology of C. rotundus can be found in Ranade and Burns (1925) , Holm et al. (1977) , Mercado (1979) , Jha and Sen (1985) and Parsons and Cuthbertson (1992) . The typical life cycle of C. rotundus starts with growth of the apical bud of a tuber. As the tuber shoot extends, it swells to form a basal bulb (sometimes called a corm), usually near the soil surface, from which an aerial shoot and roots are produced. Up to three, or slightly more, rhizomes grow out of the basal bulb and produce tubers or new basal bulbs and daughter shoots. Rhizomes from the daughter shoots produce tubers from which new rhizomes and tubers develop. Eventually, branched chains of rhizomes and tubers become an extensive, underground network. Meanwhile, the new shoots grow and produce flowers within 3-8 weeks of emergence if stimulated by short photoperiods of 6-8 hours. Most seeds of C. rotundus are not viable; germination seldom averages more than 1-5 % ( Holm et al., 1977 ) though this may be significant when seed production can exceed 100 million/ha in a single year. Tuber dormancy is high on undisturbed sites and may last for at least 7 years ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ).

Tuber dormancy is high on undisturbed sites and may last for at least 7 years ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). Fragmentation of the rhizome/tuber network by cultivation breaks the dormancy imposed by a growing tuber on others in the same chain. Hence, cultivation stimulates the growth of C. rotundus . Large populations of shoots and tubers can develop from a single tuber; as many as 600 plants have been produced in a single year. Horowitz (1972) has reported that 2-3 million tubers per hectare per week can be produced during active growing periods, yielding 30-40 million tubers/ha. Forty tonnes of underground organs have been produced on 1 hectare in a year, giving C. rotundus a phenomenal capacity for vegetative reproduction. Most tubers are found in the upper 15 cm of soil but they can grow down to 30 cm or more in favourable conditions. Neeser et al. (1997) found that a tuber population has a half-life of 16 months and a predicted longevity (99% mortality) of 42 months. C. rotundus has C4 metabolism which supposedly makes it increasingly competitive when temperatures and light intensity rise ( Black et al., 1969 ). It has low tolerance of shade, a property that can be exploited in controlling this weed by crops with dense canopies ( Rambakudzibga, 1999 ). Temperature has a marked effect on the germination of tubers. Sprouting has been reported at temperatures of 13-43°C but the range varies with biotype. Desiccation kills tubers but the duration and temperature of the drying period affects this process. The critical moisture level for tuber germination seems to be in the region of 11.5-15% ( Jha and Sen, 1985 ).

The critical moisture level for tuber germination seems to be in the region of 11.5-15% ( Jha and Sen, 1985 ). Dispersal of C. rotundus occurs when tubers are moved by tillage equipment or other farm machinery. Flood waters may also carry the tubers. Contaminated soil in nursery stock is an avoidable but common method of dispersal. Under natural conditions, a population of C. rotundus extends its boundary by a few metres in a year. Spread by seed is generally regarded as being unimportant.

 or ascending perennial grass, with slender rhizomes and extensive stolons forming thick mats. The stem is much-branched, horizontal, giving rise to secondary roots. Leaves are flat or folded, 3-12 cm long, 2-6 mm wide usually hairy on the basal margins, sheaths loose, keeled, finely hairy towards the top and ligule 0.75-1.25 mm long. This weed has 2 (rarely 1 or 3) terminal erect to spreading spike-like racemes, up to 7.5 cm long, each bearing usually solitary greenish to yellowish spikelets in 2 rows along one side. The spikelets are appressed, elliptical and the upper glume hairy. The fruit is a brownish caryopsis. It propagates mainly by creeping stolons and to some extent, by seeds. This weed is found in damp or wet situations, in wetland rice, and in dryland field crops and vegetables planted in bunded fields. P. distichum is difficult to control because the detached stolon fragments regenerate easily and are tolerant of many herbicides. Stolons left on the soil surface for a while may be dessicated under the action of sun and air.

Family: Poaceae Perennial with creeping stems, 30-60 cm tall, stoloniferous; leaves stiff, ascending, 2.5-15 cm long. Inflorescence usually paired racemes, each about 1.5-7.5 cm long; spikelets ovate, flattened, 3-4.5 mm across. P. vaginatum grows well in mangrove rice, coastal swamps and river deltas. Countries: Sierra Leone POTAMOGETON DISTINCTUS A. Benn Family: Potamogetonaceae A fleshy, broadleaf perennial weed, with a glabrous, shiny appearance. An aquatic perennial that grows in rice paddies, ditches, canals, marshes and ponds. It grows from May to October and flowers in July to August. Deep and/or prolonged flooding promote growth. It competes strongly with rice lowering yields and impeding water flow. Floating leaves are long petioled, alternate, lance-oblong to lance-elliptic. Submerged leaves are short-petioled, alternate, pellucid and thin, linear-lanceolate. Elongated flower stalks bear densely flowered spikes borne axillary from the stipules of floating leaves It propagates by rhizomes and seed, but it spreads mainly by fast growing rhizomes and multiplies mainly by excised stems and overwintering scale-buds, formed several per rhizome. Flooded rice is the most suitable environment for the growth of this weed. It is common throughout Korea. It is rather difficult to control due to deep distribution of rhizomes in the soil and

Flooded rice is the most suitable environment for the growth of this weed. It is common throughout Korea. It is rather difficult to control due to deep distribution of rhizomes in the soil and strong ability for regrowth. Stems are simple or short-branched. Countries: China , Egypt PHALARIS MINOR. Retz. Family: Poaceae Stem purplish; leaves dark green at the early stage. The length of internodes is more than wheat thus making it taller than wheat at maturity. P. minor has both tillering and branching which gives it a rosette shape.. A large number of seeds are shattered before harvest. Each ear head produces 400-600 seeds. The caryopsis is elliptic (oval) with a lateral embryo and soft endosperm. Seed colour varies from green (immature) to light yellow and glossy dark brown with hard seed coat. After harvest seed remains dormant for 6 months. Panicle is ovate-oblong , spikelets narrower not so conspicuously striped. The glumes are of 4-6 mm in length, the wing of the keel narrower; fertile lemma lance-ovate about 3 mm long, acute and sterile lemma solitary about 1 mm long. Propagation is by seed. P. minor grows well in cultivated and waste places. It is a weed of many winter season crops, including wheat and barley. P. minor is common in Eurasia, South and North America, East and Southern Africa, and Australia. It is controlled by several herbicides, the application rates of whom varies according to soil and growing conditions. Of the newer herbicides, P. minor is sensitive to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, sulfosulfuron and
