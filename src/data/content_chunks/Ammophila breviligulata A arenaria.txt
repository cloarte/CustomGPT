These grasses are tough, coarse perennials with extensively creepingrhizomes. They produce good growth on sands of low fertility, and are usedprimarily for erosion control in sandy areas. For this purpose, dividing andtransplanting clumps of the grasses is the most effective method ofestablishing stands. If planted not more than 3 feet apart, spaces betweenplants are rapidly filled in. These grasses are resistant to the cutting effectof blowing sand. They are of little value except for stabilization of sandysoils.
