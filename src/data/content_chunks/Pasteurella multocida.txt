1. Reagent Name: Pasteurella multocida, 169 (Swine) Challenge Culture 
2. Strain or Source: NVSL strain 169 
3. Lot Number: IRP 490 
4. Fill Date: November 21, 2002 
5. Expiration Date: Not Applicable. 
Precautions: This reagent is an opportunistic human pathogen. It is suggested that this reagent be 
handled under a biological safety hood while wearing gloves. 
6. Intended Use: Challenge material for mouse potency test for porcine P. multocida 
bacterins according to title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR), part 113.121. 
7. Instructions for Use: Reconstitute each vial with 1 mL of tryptose broth. Inoculate 
bovine blood agar plates with a loopful of the reconstituted culture and incubate at 35°- 37ºC for 
16-18 hr. Harvest several colonies from plates with pure growth (as determined by 
stereomicroscopic examination) and suspend in tryptose broth. Adjust culture to 76-80% 
transmittance at 630 nm using a Spec20 spectrophotometer. The recommended mouse dose is 0.2 
mL of a 10-4 dilution of this standardized culture, administered intraperitoneally. 
8. Test of Reagent: Gram stain and biochemical evaluation of the culture confirmed purity 
and identity. Standardized culture (70%± 2%T at 630 nm, Spec70 spectrophotometer) contains 
approximately 2x108 CFU/mL. Challenge inoculum contains approximately 35

8. Test of Reagent: Gram stain and biochemical evaluation of the culture confirmed purity 
and identity. Standardized culture (70%± 2%T at 630 nm, Spec70 spectrophotometer) contains 
approximately 2x108 CFU/mL. Challenge inoculum contains approximately 3500 LD50. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 3.5-mL glass serum vials contain 1.0 mL of 
lyophilized culture. 
10. Storage Conditions: 4°C or less.

12. Origin and Passage History: Porcine liver isolate, NVSL. Passage history unknown. 
Note: Although this challenge culture was originally isolated from a porcine liver, it is intended 
for use in the mouse potency test described in 9 CFR 113.121. No guarantee is made of this 
culture’s suitability as a challenge culture to induce clinical pasteurellosis in swine. 
13. Method of Preparation: Seed culture was rehydrated with tryptose broth; contents was 
transferred to fresh tryptose broth and incubated overnight on a rotary shaker. The culture was 
plated to Dextrose Starch Agar and allowed to grow overnight. Bacterial growth was harvested 
from the plates by washing with double strength skim milk. The culture suspension was 
dispensed into vials in 1 mL aliquots and lyophilized.

Restrictions: For use in potency testing of swine biologicals containing P. multocida.
