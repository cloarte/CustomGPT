I.  Background and Introduction 
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) and Forest Service (FS) are proposing to 
release three insect parasitoid1 species for the biological control 
(biocontrol) of the nonindigenous emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus 
planipennis).  This environmental assessment2 (EA) has been prepared, 
consistent with USDA, APHIS' National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) implementing procedures (Title 7 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), part 372).  It examines the potential effects on the 
quality of the human environment that may be associated with the release 
of these biocontrol agents to control infestations of EAB within the 
continental United States.  This EA considers the potential effects of the 
proposed action and its alternatives, including no action. 
 
The EAB is an invasive wood-boring beetle from Asia threatening North 
America’s ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  It was introduced into the Detroit, 
Michigan area, probably sometime in the 1990s, and was identified as the 
cause of ash mortality in the area in 2002 (Haack et al., 2002).  EAB 
larvae feed on ash phloem, cutting off the movement of resources within 
the tree and killing the tree in 4-5 years.  EAB is now considered 
established in natural ecosystems throughout the lower peninsula of 
Michigan and contiguous areas of Ohio, Indiana, and Ontario, Canada.

ack et al., 2002).  EAB 
larvae feed on ash phloem, cutting off the movement of resources within 
the tree and killing the tree in 4-5 years.  EAB is now considered 
established in natural ecosystems throughout the lower peninsula of 
Michigan and contiguous areas of Ohio, Indiana, and Ontario, Canada.  
Separate infestations have been found in the upper peninsula of Michigan, 
in Illinois, and in Maryland.  EAB appears well suited for climatic 
conditions in North America and destroys entire stands of ash.  It is 
predicted that EAB will continue to disperse along various continuous 
corridors of ash now present in natural and urban environments due to the 
widespread use of ash as a landscape tree. 
 
 
II.  Purpose and Need for the Proposed 
Action 
 
APHIS and FS propose to release three parasitoids into the environment of 
the continental United States for the purpose of reducing EAB 
populations.  These parasitoids are known to attack EAB consistently in its

host individual, eventually killing that individual. 
2 Regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42   
United States Code 4321 et seq.) provide that an environmental assessment “[shall include brief 
discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E), of the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons 
consulted.”  40 CFR § 1508.9.

native range in China.  The biocontrol agents include one larval 
ectoparasitoid, Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (Yang et al., 
2005), one species of egg parasitoid, Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: 
Encyrtidae) (Zhang et al., 2005), and one species of larval endoparasitoid, 
Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (Liu et al., 2003; 
Yang et al., 2006).  Initial releases of each parasitoid are planned for the 
summer of 2007.  Post-release monitoring, including impacts on EAB and 
non-target wood-boring beetles and spread and establishment of each 
parasitoid species, will be conducted. 
 
There is a need to control EAB, an invasive wood-boring beetle that is 
spreading rapidly and poses a serious threat to ash trees in the United 
States if not controlled.  Despite state and federal quarantines designed to 
contain EAB, the lack of effective methods to detect EAB-infested trees 
and the large size of the infestation has resulted in a shift by regulatory 
agencies from a strategy of area-wide eradication to one focused on 
eradication in outlying areas and containment in the core infestation area 
(GAO, 2006).  In the United States, EAB

 the lack of effective methods to detect EAB-infested trees 
and the large size of the infestation has resulted in a shift by regulatory 
agencies from a strategy of area-wide eradication to one focused on 
eradication in outlying areas and containment in the core infestation area 
(GAO, 2006).  In the United States, EAB eradication efforts involved the 
removal of all ash trees within a circle of specified radius around known 
infestations (typically ½ mile).  By the time an infestation was discovered 
and treated, however, EAB had usually already dispersed outside the 
eradication zone.  The bronze birch borer, A. anxius Gory, a native species 
closely related to EAB, is known to spread at a rate of 10 to 20 miles per 
year, and this has been proposed as an estimate for EAB’s natural 
dispersal rate.  Besides natural dispersal, the spread of EAB has been 
accelerated through human-assisted movement of infested ash firewood, 
timber, solid-wood packing materials, and nursery stock.  This resulted in 
the spread of EAB from Michigan to Maryland and Virginia in 2003.  As 
EAB spreads throughout North America, regulatory agencies, land 
managers, and the public are seeking sustainable management tools such 
as biological control to reduce EAB population densities and to slow its 
spread (Cappaert et al., 2005; GAO, 2006; Poland and McCullough, 
2006). 
 
APHIS has responsibility for taking actions to exclude, eradicate, and/or 
control plant pests, including EAB, under the Plant Protection Act (7 
United States Code (U.S.C.) 7701 et seq.).  APH

spread (Cappaert et al., 2005; GAO, 2006; Poland and McCullough, 
2006). 
 
APHIS has responsibility for taking actions to exclude, eradicate, and/or 
control plant pests, including EAB, under the Plant Protection Act (7 
United States Code (U.S.C.) 7701 et seq.).  APHIS has been delegated the 
authority to administer these statutes and has promulgated Quarantines 
and Regulations (7 CFR 319) which regulate the importation of 
commodities and means of conveyance to help protect against the 
introduction and spread of harmful pests.  The underlying strategy of the 
proposed program is to reduce EAB population densities in infested areas 
and slow its spread into new areas.

III.  Alternatives 
 
APHIS considered two alternatives in response to the need to control EAB 
and contain infestations:  (1) no action and (2) biological control by the 
release of the three parasitoids, O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. agrili (the 
preferred action).  Both alternatives are described briefly in this section 
and the potential impacts of each are considered in the following section.  
 
A.  No Action  
 
Under the no action alternative, APHIS and FS would not release the three 
parasitoids, O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. agrili, for the management of 
EAB.  APHIS, in cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of 
Agriculture, would continue the current program that includes survey, 
quarantine, and eradication of EAB in outlying areas and containment
Text Len: 1481
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
parasitoids, O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. agrili, for the management of 
EAB.  APHIS, in cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of 
Agriculture, would continue the current program that includes survey, 
quarantine, and eradication of EAB in outlying areas and containment in 
the core infestation area.  Some control measures could be taken by other 
Federal or non-Federal entities; those actions would not be under APHIS’ 
control or funded by APHIS.  Local business owners and area residents 
could attempt to control damage from EAB infestations by removing the 
infested trees from their properties.  The lack of effective measures to 
prevent the spread of EAB from infested areas (occurring via natural 
dispersal or artificial spread from movement of infested ash products) will 
likely lead to an increase in EAB populations, increase its range of 
distribution within the United States, and further economic and 
environmental damage. 
 
B.  Biological Control Action (Preferred Alternative)  
 
Under this alternative, APHIS and FS would release three parasitoids for 
biocontrol of EAB.  The biocontrol agents include one species of egg 
parasitoid, Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) (Zhang et al., 2005), 
one species of larval endoparasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi 
(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (Liu et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2006), and one 
larval ectoparasitoid, Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera
Text Len: 1433
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zhang et al., 2005), 
one species of larval endoparasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi 
(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (Liu et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2006), and one 
larval ectoparasitoid, Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (Yang et 
al., 2005).  Initial releases of each parasitoid are planned for the summer 
of 2007.  Releases of these EAB parasitoids are expected to reduce the 
population of EAB and slow the spread rate in the United States.  This 
alternative would reduce but not eradicate EAB in the United States.  
Measures that are occurring under the “no action” alternative would likely 
continue even if the three parasitoids are released into the environment; 
however, these biocontrol agents would serve as another tool to assist in 
the protection of ash trees in North America.

1)  Spathius agrili: 
 
Spathius agrili is a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid; adult wasps lay 
multiple eggs on the surface of an EAB larva.  Oviposition (egg laying) by 
S. agrili paralyzes the EAB larva, stopping its development beyond the 
larval stage. 
 
Taxonomy: Spathius agrili Yang (Hymenoptera: Braconidae).  No 
synonymy or common names.

Natural geographic range, other areas of introduction, and expected

climatic requirements of S. agrili).  Spathius agrili has been collected 
from Tianjin, China and Changchun, Jilin Province, China.  This species is 
much easier to collect in Tianjin, which would be the likely source of 
insects released in the United States.  The climatic conditions that are most 
conducive to population growth of S. agrili are not explicitly known; 
therefore a climate matching analysis was conducted to determine how 
similar Tianjin is to the upper Midwest.  The climate matching feature of 
the climate analysis software CLIMEX (Herne Scientific Software Pty. 
Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) was used.  The model calculated a Climate 
Match Index (CMI) that is a composite of six variables:

therefore a climate matching analysis was conducted to determine how 
similar Tianjin is to the upper Midwest.  The climate matching feature of 
the climate analysis software CLIMEX (Herne Scientific Software Pty. 
Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) was used.  The model calculated a Climate 
Match Index (CMI) that is a composite of six variables: maximum 
temperature, minimum temperature, total rainfall, rainfall pattern, relative 
humidity, and soil moisture.  A CMI of 1 indicates an exact climate match.  
Because these insects do not live in the soil, soil moisture was not 
included in the model.  Adult Spathius are only present in the summer, so 
the model was run for the adult stage only for June through September, 
and because adults are free living outside of the tree, relative humidity was 
included as a factor.  For larvae, which live under bark, relative humidity 
was not included in the model, and the entire year was included. 
 
For larvae, the CMI for Lansing MI, which is representative of locations in 
the upper Midwest, was 0.63 (Figure 1) when comparisons were made 
with Tianjin, China.  CMI values were similar throughout the central part 
of the United States (Figure 1).  The CMI for adults was 0.60.  Although 
the CMI for adults was higher for Changchun (0.74) the value for larvae 
was similar (0.66).  This indicates that there is not a great advantage to 
attempting to collect S. agrili from Changchun rather than Tianjin, where 
collections are much easier to make.  Although the climate in Tianjin does 
not perfectly match that in the upper Midwest, it is sufficiently similar that

not perfectly match that in the upper Midwest, it is sufficiently similar that 
S. agrili could establish successfully.

The cold hardiness of EAB and S. agrili were tested in the laboratory.  The 
super-cooling point of EAB was -22.36ºC, while that of S. agrili was 
-26.28 (Wu et al., in press), indicating that S. agrili should be able to 
withstand cold temperatures in the more northerly range of EAB.

Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  Spathius agrili is well synchronized with its host, emerging in the 
spring over 1½ months after adult EAB when third- and fourth- instar 
EAB larvae are present.  Females search the trunks of infested trees, 
ovipositing on the EAB larvae through the bark.  The EAB larva is 
paralyzed and from 2-18 eggs are laid per larva.  In the laboratory, a 
female lays an average of 23 eggs during her lifetime, which averages 29 
days.  Because S. agrili females only seem to attack EAB larvae that are 
feeding and close to the surface of the tree, fecundity in the lab may be 
 7

lower than in the field because of rearing methods.  Sample percentage 
parasitism in the field in China increases from August to October from an 
average of 12% to an average of 42% (Yang et al., in press).  Although 
data are not available on the dispersal capability of S. agrili, they fly 
strongly and are long lived, indicating that dispersal capabilities may be 
high.

Pathogens, parasites, hyperparasitoids of S. agrili and how to 
eliminate them from a culture of the agent.  No pathogens, parasitoids, 
or hyperparasitoids have been observed attacking S. agrili, either in China 
or in specimens shipped to the United States.  A small subset of the 
parasitoids collected in China will be reared and identified by Dr. Yang 
Zhong-qi, an expert on braconid parasitoids.  This will ensure that the 
established colony contains only S. agrili and no other braconids or 
hyperparasitoids.  Further observations will be made on parasitoids 
emerging in quarantine in the United States.  Only healthy S. agrili will be 
used to establish a colony.  Any diseased organisms will be sent to insect 
pathologists for identification and hyperparasitoids will be eliminated 
from the colony.  Insects that are subsequently reared in the United States 
will be maintained in pure culture and monitored for disease. 
 
Other closely related genera, sibling species or closely-similar species 
in North America.  The “Nomina Insecta Nearctica; a check list of the 
insects of North America” (Poole, 1997) lists 25 species in the genus

2)  Oobius agrili: 
 
Oobius agrili is an egg parasitoid.  Adult wasps lay an egg inside EAB 
eggs, that are laid between bark layers and crevices on ash trunks and 
branches.  Larval wasps consume and kill host eggs to complete their 
development.

Methods used to identify Oobius agrili.  Oobius agrili is distinguished 
from the other Oobius spp. according to morphological characteristics 
described by Zhang et al. (2005).  Although no egg parasitoids are known 
from EAB in Michigan (Bauer et al., 2005), encyrtid parasitoids are 
reported from eggs of Agrilus anxius (bronze birch borer) including 
Ablerus sp., Avetianella sp., Ooencyrtus sp., and Thysanus sp. (Nash et al., 
1951; Barter, 1957; Loerch and Cameron, 1983).

Natural geographic range, other areas of introduction, and expected

2004 in the vicinity of Changchun in Jilin Province, China.  This species 
may have a wider distribution in China, however, no further exploration 
for EAB egg parasitoids has been conducted in China due to limited 
funding and the difficulty in finding EAB eggs.  To estimate climatic 
conditions conducive to establishment of O. agrili in North America, Jilin 
Province was compared to North America using the climate matching 
feature of the climate analysis software CLIMEX (Herne Scientific 
Software Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia).  Because these insects do not 
live in the soil, soil moisture was not included in the model.  Adult O.

quarantine laboratory in East Lansing, Michigan.  The eggs were held for 
up to 8 months until emergence of O. agrili was complete.  
 
Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  Based on data from field-collected eggs from China, O. agrili 
spends the winter as mature larvae in EAB eggs and peak emergence 
occurs when EAB begin ovipositing in mid-June, although some adults 
remain in diapause3 until July and August.  The sex ratio of O. agrili 
reared from field-collected EAB eggs in China is 14.5:1 (female:male).  O. 
agrili is thelytokous parthenogenic (females produce females without 
mating).  Much of the knowledge of this parasitoid’s biology is based on 
laboratory studies performed at 25ºC with females held in a plastic cup 
with a streak of honey, moist cotton ball, and EAB eggs laid on a small 
ash twig.  Oobius agrili females prefer to oviposit in 0- to 6-day-old EAB 
eggs and live an average of 22.5 days.  Their average lifetime fecundity is 
approximately 24 progeny per female, and each generation requires about 
three weeks (Table 1).

 eggs laid on a small 
ash twig.  Oobius agrili females prefer to oviposit in 0- to 6-day-old EAB 
eggs and live an average of 22.5 days.  Their average lifetime fecundity is 
approximately 24 progeny per female, and each generation requires about 
three weeks (Table 1).  Based on monthly field collections in China during 
2005, it was confirmed that O. agrili completes at least two generations 
per year with parasitism reaching almost 62% in August.  These attributes 
of O. agrili, including female-biased sex ratio, parthenogenesis, short 
generation time, and high rates of parasitism and fecundity, are 
characteristics of successful biocontrol agents (Kimberling, 2004).  No 
data are available on the dispersal capability of O. agrili, but despite their 
small size (about 0.9 mm) they are relatively long-lived (approximately 
three weeks) and are active jumpers and fliers in the laboratory.  Dispersal, 
however, may be facilitated by selecting release sites with connecting 
corridors of ash.  Moreover, since O. agrili reproduces through 
parthenogenesis, dispersal is facilitated because females do not need to 
find a male and mate before parasitism of EAB can occur.

Natural geographic range, other areas of introduction, and expected 
attainable range in North America (also habitat preference and 
climatic requirements of T. planipennisi).  Tetrastichus planipennisi was 
discovered in 2003 in Jilin and Liaoning Provinces of China (Liu et al., 
2003) and later in Heilongjiang Province (Yang et al., 2006).  This species 
may have wider distribution in China, however, no further exploration for 
EAB egg parasitoids has been done in China due to limited funding for 
foreign exploration.  To estimate climatic conditions conducive to 
establishment of T. planipennisi in North America, Jilin Province was 
compared to North America using the climate matching feature of the 
climate analysis software CLIMEX (Herne Scientific Software Pty. Ltd., 
Melbourne, Australia).  Because these insects do not live in the soil, soil 
moisture was not included in the model.  Adult T. planipennisi are only 
present in the summer; for adults, the model was run only for June through 
September, and because adults are free living outside of the tree, relative 
humidity was included as a factor. 
 
For larvae, the CMI for Lansing MI, which is representative of all the

Source of the culture/agent in nature (name of collector, name of 
identifier).  EAB larvae parasitized by T. planipennisi were collected near 
Changchun City (43º54'N, 125º12'E), Jilin Province, China by Dr. 
Tonghai Zhao, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing and shipped to a 
quarantine laboratory in E. Lansing, Michigan.  Mature parasitoid larvae 
can be held in a cooler at 4ºC for up to 4 months; T. planipennisi pupate 
and emerge as adults after approximately two weeks at 25ºC.

Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  T. planipennisi is a gregarious larval endoparasitoid; host EAB 
larvae continue feeding after parasitoid oviposition until external 
symptoms of parasitism appear.  Symptoms include bulges on the surface 
of the host integument (outer covering of the body), causing the host 
cadaver to look like a small braided rope.  The larval parasitoids are then 
mature and ready to exit the host cadaver during their wandering phase 
just prior to pupation.  Parasitized host EAB larvae produce a range of 5 to 
122 parasitoids, with an average of 35.2 parasitoid larvae per host.  
Tetrastichus planipennisi attacks both third- and fourth-instar EAB larvae, 
and overwinters as mature larvae in EAB galleries (Liu et al., 2007).  In 
the spring, the parasitoid larvae form pupae, emerge as adults, and chew a 
1-mm diameter hole through the bark from which the wasp brood exits the 
host gallery and tree. 
 
 14
In the laboratory, the egg-larval period for T. planipennisi is about 11 days 
and its pupal period is about 10 days (Table 2).  Adult longevity of 
females is around 24 days, almost twice that of males, and one generation 
requires approximately three weeks.  Their sex ratio is 3.5:1 
(female:male), and average fecundity is 42 progeny/female.  Adult 
parasitoids are maintained with a streak of honey and moist cotton ball

(female:male), and average fecundity is 42 progeny/female.  Adult 
parasitoids are maintained with a streak of honey and moist cotton ball 
during exposure to host larvae.  Female parasitoids will not oviposit unless 
host larvae are inserted in ash branches.

The biological attributes of T. planipennisi, including female-biased sex 
ratio, short generation time, and high rates of parasitism and reproduction, 
are characteristics of successful biocontrol agents (Kimberling, 2004).  No 
data are available on the dispersal capability of T. planipennisi, but despite 
their small size adult females live more than three weeks; both sexes are 
active jumpers and fliers in the laboratory.  Dispersal, however, may be 
facilitated by selecting release sites with connecting corridors of ash, such 
as along riparian areas.

IV. Affected Environment 
 
A.  North American Agrilus species 
 
The “Nomina Insecta Nearctica; a check list of the insects of North 
America” (Poole, 1997) lists 164 species of Agrilus in North America (see 
appendix 1).  Most are not considered pests; however, Solomon (1995) 
considers 24 Agrilus species to cause injury to trees and shrubs under 
certain circumstances.  Most species of Agrilus are unable to colonize 
healthy trees; in fact, EAB is not considered a pest throughout its native 
range.  Agrilus species typically attack trees stressed by factors such as 
drought, damage from other insects, or poor silvicultural practices.  
Species such as A. anxius (bronze birch borer) and A. bilineatus (Weber) 
(two-lined chestnut borer) are often considered major pest species in forest 
and landscape situations, but they are typically acting as secondary pests 
on already stressed trees or trees not native to the United States.  Agrilus 
species in North America could potentially be at risk from attack by the 
three parasitoids proposed for environmental release. 
 
B.  Ash Resources of North America 
 
Hosts of EAB:  The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash 
trees (Fraxinus spp.) including F. americana (white ash), F. nigra (black 
ash), F. pennsylvanica (green ash), and some varieties of horticultural ash.  
Twenty-two species of ash grow in the United States, of which

:  The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash 
trees (Fraxinus spp.) including F. americana (white ash), F. nigra (black 
ash), F. pennsylvanica (green ash), and some varieties of horticultural ash.  
Twenty-two species of ash grow in the United States, of which sixteen are 
native (USDA, NRCS, 2006).  See appendix 2 for distribution maps of 
native Fraxinus species in the United States.  There is increasing evidence 
that EAB will attack all Fraxinus spp., although innate susceptibility 
varies by species and variety (Liu et al., 2003; Wie et al., 2004; Rebek et 
al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007).  The FS estimates that 7,553,000,000 ash trees 
in United States timberlands are potentially susceptible to EAB (USDA, 
FS, 2004). 
Ash trees are present as ornamentals, street trees, or timber trees in all of 
the lower 48 states.  Each Fraxinus sp. is adapted to slightly different 
habitats within forest ecosystems.  Several species are tolerant of poorly-
drained sites and wet soils, protecting environmentally-sensitive riparian 
areas; e.g. pure stands of black ash grow in bogs and swamps in northern 
areas where they provide browse, thermal cover, and protection for 
wildlife such as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash 
provides vital shelter for livestock; e.g. about 25% of all trees in North

wildlife such as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash 
provides vital shelter for livestock; e.g. about 25% of all trees in North 
 16
Dakota are Fraxinus spp.  Bark of young ash trees is a favored food of 
mammals including beaver, rabbit, and porcupines; older trees provide 
habitat for cavity-nesting birds such as wood ducks, woodpeckers, 
chickadees, and nuthatches; seeds are consumed by ducks, song and game 
birds, small mammals, and insects. 
Ash timber is valued for applications requiring strong, hardwood, but with 
less rigidity than maple.  In the Eastern United States, a net volume of 114 
billion board feet of ash sawtimber is harvested, comprising 7.5% of the 
volume of all hardwood species (FR, 2003).  The impact varies by state, 
but in Michigan alone an estimated 7.7 billion board feet of ash timber is 
harvested annually.  In 2001, ash accounted for over 149 million board 
feet of timber products produced in the United States.  White ash is the 
primary commercial hardwood used in production of tool handles, 
baseball bats, furniture, flooring, containers, railroad cars and ties, canoe 
paddles, snowshoes, boats, doors, and cabinets; green ash is used for both 
solid wood applications such as crating, boxes, handles, and for fiber in 
the manufacture of high grade paper; black ash is typically used for 
interior furniture, cabinets (FR, 2003), and Northeastern Native Americans 
require ash for the art of basketry.

require ash for the art of basketry. 
 
Beyond manufacturing, ash trees play an important role in the urban 
landscape due to their historical resistance to pests and tolerance of 
adverse growing conditions, such as soil compaction and drought.  Many 
of the ash trees that now serve as street, shade, and landscape trees were 
planted to replace elm trees destroyed by Dutch elm disease; ash trees now 
comprise 5-20% of all street trees throughout North America.  In the 
United States, urban areas cover about 3.5% of the total land area, contain 
more than 75% of the population, and support about 3.8 billion trees.  The 
City of Chicago has approximately 603,000 ash trees that provide 14.4% 
of leaf area (FR, 2003).  Trees are considered vital to the health of cities 
because they sequester gaseous air pollutants and particulate matter, help 
people conserve energy through the shade they provide, assist in the 
dispersal of storm water, provide shelter belts for urban fauna, and 
contribute aesthetic pleasure to the lives of city-dwellers and tourists.  Ash 
is a vital component of the urban forest.

V.  Environmental Consequences 
 
A.  No Action Alternative 
 
EAB is an invasive wood-boring beetle that is spreading rapidly and poses 
a serious threat to ash trees in the United States if not controlled.  Despite 
state and federal quarantines designed to contain EAB, the lack of 
effective methods to detect EAB-infested trees and the large size of the 
infestation has resulted in a shift by regulatory agencies from a strategy of 
area-wide eradication to one focused on eradication in outlying areas and 
containment in the core infestation area (GAO, 2006).  In the United 
States, EAB eradication efforts involved the removal of all ash trees 
within a circle of specified radius around known infestations (typically ½ 
mile).  By the time an infestation was discovered and treated, however, 
EAB had usually already dispersed outside the eradication zone.  The 
bronze birch borer, A. anxius Gory, a native species closely related to 
EAB, is known to spread at a rate of 10 to 20 miles per year, and this has 
been proposed as an estimate for EAB’s natural dispersal rate (FR, 2003).  
Besides natural dispersal, the spread of EAB has been accelerated through 
human-assisted movement of infested ash firewood, timber, solid-wood 
packing materials, and nursery stock.  This resulted in the spread of EAB 
from Michigan to Maryland and Virginia in 2003.  As EAB spreads 
throughout North America, regulatory agencies, land managers, and the 
public are seeking sustainable management tools to reduce EAB 
population densities and to slow its spread (Cappaert et al., 2005

packing materials, and nursery stock.  This resulted in the spread of EAB 
from Michigan to Maryland and Virginia in 2003.  As EAB spreads 
throughout North America, regulatory agencies, land managers, and the 
public are seeking sustainable management tools to reduce EAB 
population densities and to slow its spread (Cappaert et al., 2005; GAO, 
2006; Poland and McCullough, 2006).  Since its discovery, EAB has 
killed more than 20 million ash trees in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana 
(MSU, 2007). 
The potential path of expansion of the EAB infestation is through Ohio 
and Indiana into the hardwood forests of the Northeast through 
Pennsylvania and New York and into the Appalachian Mountain States 
through Kentucky.  In addition, spread of the pest through the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan to Wisconsin and through Ontario to New York is 
possible.  The economic impact would be severe if EAB spread from 
currently infested areas into the forests of the northeastern United States 
where nursery, landscaping, timber, recreation, and tourism industries are 
economically critical. 
Michigan implemented a moratorium on importing and selling ash nursery 
stock in the Lower Peninsula of the State, impacting at least 9,519 
nurseries (McPartlan et al., 2006).  The State’s 1,847 logging companies 
and sawmills were also affected by their inability to receive ash logs from 
the quarantined area (McPartlan et al., 2006).  Additionally, more than 
2,500 private campgrounds in the tri-state area have been impacted; many 
are losing business when campers are told that they cannot bring firewood

from quarantined areas (McPartlan et al., 2006).

 to receive ash logs from 
the quarantined area (McPartlan et al., 2006).  Additionally, more than 
2,500 private campgrounds in the tri-state area have been impacted; many 
are losing business when campers are told that they cannot bring firewood 
 18
from quarantined areas (McPartlan et al., 2006).  The area also supports 
industries that utilize ash for tool handles, rail road ties and pallet 
production.   
The continued spread of this pest would threaten these resources and 
permanently alter the Midwest’s forest ecosystem that in some areas is 
made up of 20 to 40 percent ash (McPartlan et al., 2006).  In addition to its 
value in forest ecosystems and for the timber industry, ash has become an 
extremely popular urban/suburban landscape tree because of its tolerance 
of less than ideal planting conditions and resistance to gypsy moth and 
other pests.  It is currently the most commonly planted tree in new 
residential and commercial developments.  Ash was planted widely in 
Midwestern States to replace elms lost to Dutch elm disease, and it is 
common in parks, public spaces, and neighborhoods across the United 
States.  The potential national impact of EAB on the urban environment 
alone is 0.5 to 2 percent loss of total leaf area, or 30-90 million trees with 
a loss of $20-60 billion dollars (McPartlan et al., 2006). 
The spread of EAB infestations could potentially have an enormous 
impact on the U.S. nursery industry, municipal governments, and 
individual home owners.  As many as 300 million landscape ash trees 
have been planted in Michigan alone.  Removal and replacement costs 
would be staggering.  In an initial economic

The spread of EAB infestations could potentially have an enormous 
impact on the U.S. nursery industry, municipal governments, and 
individual home owners.  As many as 300 million landscape ash trees 
have been planted in Michigan alone.  Removal and replacement costs 
would be staggering.  In an initial economic analysis of EAB, the USDA, 
FS estimated that EAB, if not contained and eradicated, could cause 
approximately $7 billion in additional costs to state and local governments 
and landowners to remove and replace dead and dying ash trees in urban 
and suburban areas over the next 25 years (McPartlan et al., 2006).  One 
city in Michigan reported substantially higher water and electrical use 
because of the loss of ash as shade trees (Victor Mastro, USDA-APHIS, 
personal communication). 
 
B.  Biological control alternative (preferred 
alternative) 
 
1.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of S. agrili 
 
Known impact on vertebrates including humans:   Spathius agrili is an 
obligate parasitoid of wood boring larvae, specifically the EAB.  As such, 
it will rarely come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it 
does, it is incapable of stinging or biting.  Braconid wasps have no known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of S. agrili (e.g. intended effects on EAB, direct effects 
on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism of EAB by S. agrili in China can 
reach 30-50%, and in a few stands 85-90% of

 known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of S. agrili (e.g. intended effects on EAB, direct effects 
on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism of EAB by S. agrili in China can 
reach 30-50%, and in a few stands 85-90% of the EAB are parasitized 
 19
(Yang et al., 2005).  Because S. agrili has three generations per year 
compared with just one for EAB, generational percentage parasitism will 
be greater than that measured during a single collection.  Spathius agrili 
clearly has the potential to cause considerable mortality to EAB 
populations.  In China, it is probable that EAB is not typically a pest 
because of the interaction between host plant resistance and natural 
enemies.  While it is clear that American ash species are not resistant to 
EAB per se, they can withstand some attack as evidenced by callusing of 
EAB galleries (Gould, 2007).  In China, where F. pennsylvanica (native to 
North America) was attacked by EAB, parasitism by O. agrili and T. 
planipennisi reduced EAB populations by 74% and the trees continued to 
produce fruit.  Spathius agrili will not have to cause 100% mortality of 
EAB to impact the health of ash stands, because ash can successfully 
withstand some attack (Gould, 2007). 
 
To evaluate the effects of S. agrili on non-target insect species, no-choice 
host specificity tests were conducted in China and the United States to 
determine the physiological host range of S. agrili and possible direct 
effects

 health of ash stands, because ash can successfully 
withstand some attack (Gould, 2007). 
 
To evaluate the effects of S. agrili on non-target insect species, no-choice 
host specificity tests were conducted in China and the United States to 
determine the physiological host range of S. agrili and possible direct 
effects on non-target species.  In 2003-2005, potential host larvae were 
collected in the ash forest where S. agrili was attacking EAB in Tianjin, 
China to determine whether S. agrili would attack other species in the 
same forest habitat.  All species tested were boring insects, including some 
that were closely related to EAB and others that were not. 
 
Spathius agrili finds hosts to parasitize by hearing sounds or feeling 
vibrations produced by feeding larvae.  Studies have shown that they do 
not attack prepupae or molting larvae that are not feeding (Gould, 2007).  
All test larvae, therefore, had to be feeding inside their natural hosts 
during testing.  To accomplish this, 1-1.5 cm diameter twigs were split 
longitudinally and a 3 cm long groove was cut through to the bark on one 
side.  The test larvae were placed in these chambers, and the twigs were 
reassembled and secured with rubber bands.  The ends of the twigs were 
sealed with paraffin wax to prevent desiccation.  The twigs were placed 
into 11.5 by 2.8 cm diameter glass vials that contained a newly-emerged, 
mated S. agrili female.  The parasitoids were fed honey streaked on the 
side of the vial.  In tests in the United

into 11.5 by 2.8 cm diameter glass vials that contained a newly-emerged, 
mated S. agrili female.  The parasitoids were fed honey streaked on the 
side of the vial.  In tests in the United States, the larvae were checked 
weekly for the presence of S. agrili eggs or larvae until the parasitoid 
females died.  In China the twigs were only checked after the female died.  
All parasitized larvae were held to determine if S. agrili could develop to 
the adult stage. 
 
In the early host specificity tests, S. agrili did not parasitize wood-boring 
lepidopterans, a longhorned beetle (Cerambycidae), or the one Agrilus 
species tested (Table 3).  Of the three species whose larvae attack ash, 
only EAB was parasitized.  Further testing was, therefore, confined to 
members of the genus Agrilus, which might be at risk because they are 
closely related to EAB.  In the United States, the two-lined chestnut borer, 
A. bilineatus, in oak, and the bronze birch borer, A. anxius, in birch were 
tested.  These species were chosen because oak and birch can be found in 
close proximity to ash, they could be collected in reasonable numbers for 
testing, and they are two Agrilus species that sometimes occur in outbreak 
situations.

In tests in the United States, S. agrili attacked some species of Agrilus 
other than EAB in the no-choice tests, but attack rates were significantly 
lower than for its primary host, the EAB (Table 4).  Two out of thirty A. 
bilineatus were attacked and both attacks resulted in cocoons but only two 
adult males were reared from one egg cluster, and the other egg cluster 
produced cocoons, but no adults emerged.  However, this indicates that A. 
bilineatus could serve as a potential host of S. agrili.  No S. agrili larvae 
survived on the single parasitized A. anxius. 
 
In tests in China, S. agrili attacked A. zanthoxylumi, A. mali, and A. 
inamoenus, but at rates that were lower than attack on EAB (Table 4).

No-choice tests determine the physiological host range of a parasitoid by 
giving them no other option but to oviposit on a non-target host.  To 
determine the ecological host range of S. agrili, olfactometer tests were 
conducted in China to investigate whether S. agrili is attracted to plant 
species harboring the larvae tested in no-choice tests.  Naïve mated S.

 but to oviposit on a non-target host.  To 
determine the ecological host range of S. agrili, olfactometer tests were 
conducted in China to investigate whether S. agrili is attracted to plant 
species harboring the larvae tested in no-choice tests.  Naïve mated S. 
agrili females were placed in vertical y-tube olfactometers and given a 
choice of leaves and twigs of various host plants or clean air.  Spathius 
agrili was only attracted to F. pennsylvanica, F. velutina, and Salix 
babylonica (willow) (Table 5).  The two Fraxinus species are native to the 
United States.  Even though some attack occurred on larvae found in 
Citrus reticulata, Malus micromalus, and Zanthoxylum bungeanum in no-
choice tests, S. agrili females were not attracted to these tree species.  In 
 21
 22
nature, if parasitoids are not attracted to the host tree they are unlikely to 
encounter and parasitize the non-target larvae.  Spathius agrili was 
attracted to willow leaves, and at least two Agrilus species attack willow 
in the United States:  Agrilus politus (adults 5.0-8.5 mm long) and A. 
quadriguttatus (size could not be found in literature).  These insects are 
quite small compared with adult EAB, which are 8.5-13.5 mm long.  
Spathius agrili only attacks large EAB larvae, and A. politus is 
undoubtedly too small to be at risk of attack.  Even

 A. 
quadriguttatus (size could not be found in literature).  These insects are 
quite small compared with adult EAB, which are 8.5-13.5 mm long.  
Spathius agrili only attacks large EAB larvae, and A. politus is 
undoubtedly too small to be at risk of attack.  Even if S. agrili is attracted 
to willow in the United States, it is unlikely to encounter suitable non-
target hosts. 
 
That some attack by S. agrili on non-target species occurred is not totally 
surprising given that the native S. floridanus does attack EAB in the 
United States.  However, parasitism of EAB by this native Spathius is 
extremely low, well below 0.5%, despite an abundance of EAB.  This low 
level of parasitism is certainly not sufficient to affect EAB population 
growth or dynamics and it is not expected that S. agrili will significantly 
impact populations of native Agrilus. 
 
A fourth piece of evidence concerning host specificity was gathered in 
China by collecting larvae of six Agrilus species and rearing them to 
determine their parasitoid fauna.  A total of 2,074 Agrilus larvae of six 
species were collected and not a single S. agrili was recovered (Table 6). 
 
Given the combination of evidence from no-choice tests (lower parasitism 
rates or no attack on non-target species), olfactometer tests (only attracted 
to ash and willow), the lack of S. agrili reared from other Agrilus spp. in 
China, and the fact that the U.S. native species S. floridanus

China, and the fact that the U.S. native species S. floridanus rarely attacks 
EAB, the release of S. agrili is not expected to have adverse direct effects 
on non-target species.

2.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of O. agrili 
 
Known impact on vertebrates including humans:  Oobius agrili is a 
very small (about 0.9 mm) obligate egg parasitoid of EAB.  As such, it 
will rarely come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it 
does, it is incapable of stinging or biting.  Encyrtid wasps have no known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of Oobius agrili (e.g. intended effects on targets, direct 
effects on non-targets).  After discovery of O. agrili in China in 2004, its 
effects on EAB populations were quantified by sampling EAB eggs 
monthly from April through August in an infested ash plantation in Jilin 
Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to determine its 
overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  Based on the number of O

 of O. agrili in China in 2004, its 
effects on EAB populations were quantified by sampling EAB eggs 
monthly from April through August in an infested ash plantation in Jilin 
Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to determine its 
overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  Based on the number of O. agrili 
adults successfully emerging from EAB eggs after arrival in the FS 
quarantine laboratory in Michigan, parasitism rates reached 56.3% 
parasitism in July and 61.5% in August (Figure 4).  The number of 
parasitoids reared from November collections vs. numbers reared from 
spring collections suggests that overwintering mortality does occur.  Year-
to-year variations in parasitism rates can be observed by comparing 
parasitism rates from samples taken in June 2004 and those taken June 
2005.  This variation may be caused by differences in the overwintering 
survival of O. agrili, developmental rates of EAB populations, and other 
environmental factors.

To evaluate the direct effects of O. agrili on non-target insect species, no-
choice assays were performed in the laboratory using eggs of six Agrilus 
spp., two cerambycids, and four lepidopterans (Table 7).  These insects 
were selected based on taxonomic similarity to EAB; overlap in habitat 
and/or niche with EAB; risk to beneficial, threatened, or endangered 
insects; and feasibility of acquiring or rearing enough eggs to perform and 
replicate reliable assays (Badendreier et al., 2005).

In no-choice assays, O. agrili did not oviposit in eggs of the cerambycids 
and lepidopterans (Table 7).  O. agrili may oviposit and develop in Agrilus 
eggs from different species, but only those with eggs similar in size to 
EAB eggs (Table 7).  These included A. anxius (bronze birch borer), A. 
bilineatis (two-lined chestnut borer), and A. ruficollis (red-necked cane 
borer), which are considered pests of birch, oak, and raspberry, 
respectively.  Although many native Agrilus spp. are considered

respectively.  Although many native Agrilus spp. are considered 
destructive pests of forest and shade trees, most prefer stressed, weakened, 
or dying trees. 
 
Paired no-choice and choice assays were performed (Badendreier et al., 
2005) for two of the Agrilus spp. accepted by O. agrili during the no-
choice assays.  The results of the choice assays demonstrate that O. agrili 
shows a clear preference for EAB (A. planipennis) eggs over those of A. 
ruficollis (Figure 5) and A. anxius (Figure 6).

3.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of T. planipennisi. 
 
 27
Known impact on vertebrates including humans:  Tetrastichus 
planipennisi is a small (females 4-5 mm; males 2-3 mm) and gregarious 
larval endoparasitoid of EAB.  As such, it will rarely come into contact 
with humans or other vertebrates, and if it does, it is incapable of stinging 
or biting.  Eulophid wasps have no known adverse impacts on humans or 
other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of T. planipennisi (e.g. intended effects on EAB, direct 
effects on non-targets).  After discovery of T. planipennisi in China in 
2003 (Liu et al., 2003), effects on EAB populations were quantified by 
sampling EAB larvae monthly from April through August in an infested 
ash plantation in Jilin Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to 
determine its overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  T. planipennisi 
completes four generations per year.  In 2005, parasitism averaged 22.4%

 larvae monthly from April through August in an infested 
ash plantation in Jilin Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to 
determine its overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  T. planipennisi 
completes four generations per year.  In 2005, parasitism averaged 22.4% 
and peaked at approximately 40% in August (Figure 7).  Year-to-year 
variations in parasitism rates can be observed by comparing parasitism 
rates from samples taken in June 2004 and those taken in June 2005.  This 
variation may be caused by differences in the overwintering survival of T. 
planipennisi, developmental rates of EAB populations, and other 
environmental factors.

It was also found that third- and fourth-instar EAB larvae are available as 
hosts throughout spring, summer, and fall for emerging T. planipennisi 
adults, allowing for a rapid population build-up during the summer (Liu et 
al., 2007).  Similar distributions in EAB larval stages are observed in 
Michigan as populations increase throughout an area (Cappaert et al., 
2005).

Michigan as populations increase throughout an area (Cappaert et al., 
2005).  
 
To evaluate the direct effects of T. planipennisi on potential non-target 
insect species, no-choice assays were performed in the laboratory with 
larvae of EAB and eight species of buprestid (five Agrilus and three

hymenopteran (Table 8).  These insects were selected based on taxonomic 
similarity to EAB; overlap in habitat and/or niche with EAB; risk to 
beneficial, threatened, or endangered insects; feasibility of acquiring or 
rearing enough larvae to perform and replicate reliable assays 
(Badendreier et al., 2005).

Effects on physical environment (e.g. water, soil and air resources):  
Trees in the genus Fraxinus are important components of many forested 
ecosystems throughout North America and are planted extensively as 
urban and shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and 
Analysis estimates that establishment of EAB throughout the United 
 30
States could result in loss of approximately 2.6% of trees in our 
timberlands, or 8 billion trees (USDA, FS, 2004).  White, blue, and 
Oregon ash grow on fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, 
Carolina, and pumpkin ash are wetland species; and velvet and single-leaf 
ash grow in semi-deserts and canyons.  If EAB populations are not 
managed, ash resources throughout North America could be devastated 
(MacFarlane and Meyer, 2005).  The loss of ash over large geographical 
areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air resources.  Ash is an 
important riparian tree and is often found along river banks.  Removing 
ash from stream banks will likely affect bank soil retention and stream 
processes.  The successful deployment of EAB biocontrol agents such as 
S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. planipennisi will have a positive impact on the 
physical environment by moderating EAB population increase, thus 
limiting tree damage.

physical environment by moderating EAB population increase, thus 
limiting tree damage. 
 
Indirect effects (e.g. potential impacts on organisms that depend on 
EAB or non-target species including potential competition with 
resident biological control agents).  Successful management of EAB 
using biological control agents, including S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi, will result in positive, indirect effects on U.S. municipalities, 
land owners, wood industries, Native American basketry, forest 
biodiversity, wildlife, riparian areas, and organisms that use Fraxinus spp. 
(e.g. the cerambycid: red-headed ash borer, Neoclytus acuminatus; the 
sphingid: great ash sphinx, Sphinx chersis; the sesiids: ash clearwing, 
Podesesia syringae and banded ash clearwing, P. aurecincta; the 
scolytids: eastern, western, and northern ash beetles, Hylesinus aculeatus, 
H. californicus, and H. criddlei). 
  
Indirect effects to ongoing biological control projects that utilize Agrilus 
species to control weeds should also be considered.  Agrilus hyperici was 
released against Klamath weed in the western United States with mixed 
results.  In northern Idaho it is beneficial in assisting two Klamath weed 
beetles, Chrysolina sp., in controlling the target weed (Campbell and 
McCaffery, 1991), but in California it has been displaced by C. 
quadrigemina (McCaffrey et al., 1995).  Agrilus hyperici is a root feed

results.  In northern Idaho it is beneficial in assisting two Klamath weed 
beetles, Chrysolina sp., in controlling the target weed (Campbell and 
McCaffery, 1991), but in California it has been displaced by C. 
quadrigemina (McCaffrey et al., 1995).  Agrilus hyperici is a root feeder 
acting on a rangeland weed.  Another exotic buprestid, Sphenoptera 
jugoslavica, also a root feeder, was released against spotted, diffuse, and 
squarrose knapweeds.  Based on the results of research in the field in 
China and laboratory host specificity studies, S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi are host specific, and are not expected to attack other 
buprestid species that are used for biological control.  
 
 31
5.  Uncertainties Regarding the Environmental Release of S. 
agrili, O. agrili, and T. planipennisi. 
 
Once biological control agents such as S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi are released into the environment and become established, 
there is a slight possibility they could move from the target insect (EAB) 
to attack nontarget insects, such as native Agrilus species.  Based on host 
specificity testing conducted, incidental parasitism of some non-target 
Agrilus spp. may occur by S. agrili and O. agrili, although these agents 
have been shown to prefer EAB (T. planipennisi attacked only EAB in 
host-specificity testing).  Native species that are closely related to the 
target species
Text Len: 1421
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ity testing conducted, incidental parasitism of some non-target 
Agrilus spp. may occur by S. agrili and O. agrili, although these agents 
have been shown to prefer EAB (T. planipennisi attacked only EAB in 
host-specificity testing).  Native species that are closely related to the 
target species are the most likely to be attacked (Louda et al., 2003).  If 
other insect species were to be attacked by S. agrili, O. agrili, or T. 
planipennisi, the resulting effects could be environmental impacts that 
may not be easily reversed.  Biological control agents such as S. agrili, O. 
agrili, and T. planipennisi generally spread without intervention by man.  
In principle, therefore, release of these parasitoids at even one site should 
be considered equivalent to release over the entire area in which potential 
hosts occur and in which the climate is suitable for reproduction and 
survival.  Post-release evaluations of S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi populations and their effects on EAB and other non-target 
species will be conducted by APHIS and FS researchers. 
 
In addition, these agents may not be successful in reducing EAB 
populations in the continental United States.  Approximately 12% of all 
parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control of the pest (Greathead and Greathead, 1992) either because 
introduction did not lead to establishment or establishment did not lead to 
control (Lane et al., 1999).  Actual impacts on EAB populations
Text Len: 1580
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control of the pest (Greathead and Greathead, 1992) either because 
introduction did not lead to establishment or establishment did not lead to 
control (Lane et al., 1999).  Actual impacts on EAB populations by S. 
agrili, O. agrili, and T. planipennisi will not be known until after release 
occurs and post-release monitoring has been conducted.  The 
environmental consequences discussed under the “no action” alternative 
may occur even with the implementation of the biological control 
alternative, depending on the efficacy of those agents to reduce EAB 
populations in the continental United States. 
 
 
6.  Cumulative Impacts 
 
“Cumulative impacts are defined as the impact on the environment which 
results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, 
present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agencies or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).   
 
 32
Currently, no other biological control agents have been released against 
EAB in the continental United States, although hundreds, if not thousands 
of parasitoid species have been released in the United States to attack 
various insect pests such as mealybugs, aphids, whiteflies, and 
agriculturally important lepidopteran pests.  
 
APHIS has put quarantines in place to prevent the movement of EAB out 
of EAB-infested areas of the United States (7 CFR Subpart 301.53).  This 
area may expand as new infestations are discovered. 
Text Len: 1616

 aphids, whiteflies, and 
agriculturally important lepidopteran pests.  
 
APHIS has put quarantines in place to prevent the movement of EAB out 
of EAB-infested areas of the United States (7 CFR Subpart 301.53).  This 
area may expand as new infestations are discovered.  Quarantines are put 
in place to prevent the artificial spread of EAB through movement of 
infested firewood or other infested wood materials. 
 
APHIS, in cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of 
Agriculture, conducts an EAB management program that includes survey 
for EAB to determine new areas of infestation, and eradication of EAB by 
cutting infested ash trees in outlying areas. 
 
Release of the proposed parasitoids will have no negative cumulative 
impacts in the continental United States because of the host specificity of 
the parasitoids to EAB, other than potential impacts on non-target Agrilus 
species.  However, based on host-specificity testing conducted and field 
studies in China, impacts to non-target Agrilus spp. are expected to be 
minimal since all three parasitoids clearly preferred EAB.  Effective 
biocontrol of EAB will have beneficial effects to current EAB 
management activities, and may result in protection of ash resources and 
reduction in removals of infested trees. 
 
 
7.  Endangered Species Act 
 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ESA’s implementing 
regulations require Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of federally listed threatened 
or endangered species or result in the destruction or
Text Len: 1606
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 removals of infested trees. 
 
 
7.  Endangered Species Act 
 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ESA’s implementing 
regulations require Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of federally listed threatened 
or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification 
of critical habitat.   
 
A direct effect of the release of these parasitoids would be the potential 
attack of eggs or larvae of federally listed insects, resulting in additional 
declines of these species.  In particular, the valley elderberry longhorned 
borer (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus Fisher) (Family 
Cerambycidae), a longhorned borer that mines the interior wood of its host 
plant (Paine et al., 2004) could be perceived to be at risk by these 
parasitoids. 
 
 33
During host specificity testing, S. agrili did not attack any non-target 
species other than some Agrilus species.  The larvae of the valley 
elderberry longhorned beetle would not be accessible to the relatively 
short ovipositor of S. agrili.  In addition, this is not closely related to EAB 
and would not likely be accepted as a host by S. agrili.  Spathius agrili 
must attack its hosts, even EAB, as they are feeding inside of wood, so it 
is unlikely to attack any other threatened or endangered insects, which are 
all external feeders. 
 
During laboratory host-specificity testing, O. agrili rejected the eggs of 
cerambycids tested: red-headed ash borer

ili 
must attack its hosts, even EAB, as they are feeding inside of wood, so it 
is unlikely to attack any other threatened or endangered insects, which are 
all external feeders. 
 
During laboratory host-specificity testing, O. agrili rejected the eggs of 
cerambycids tested: red-headed ash borer (Neoclytus acuminatus) eggs on 
ash and locust borer (Megacyllene robiniae) on black locust.  The eggs of 
the valley elderberry longhorned borer are about 2.5-3.0 mm long and are 
shaped like a football with longitudinal ridges, whereas EAB eggs are ca. 
1 mm in diameter and flat, oppressed between bark layers or in bark 
crevices.  Moreover, a closely related encyrtid, Avetienella longoi, was 
released against the eucalyptus longhorned borer, Phoracantha 
semipunctata, in California where no impact on the valley elderberry 
longhorned beetle has been found.  In addition, O. agrili did not oviposit 
in eggs of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, other than Agrilus eggs of similar 
size to EAB. 
 
During laboratory host-specificity testing, T. planipennisi rejected larvae 
of five cerambycids tested: Astylopsis sexguttata, Neoclytus acuminatus, 
Megacyllene robiniae, Monochamus scutellatus, and an unknown species.  
Moreover, T. planipennisi did not oviposit in larvae of any Lepidopteran, 
Coleopteran (other than EAB), or Hy

 tested: Astylopsis sexguttata, Neoclytus acuminatus, 
Megacyllene robiniae, Monochamus scutellatus, and an unknown species.  
Moreover, T. planipennisi did not oviposit in larvae of any Lepidopteran, 
Coleopteran (other than EAB), or Hymenopteran tested. 
 
Thus, due to the host specificity of the three parasitoids, their release will 
have no effect on the wood-boring valley elderberry longhorned beetle or 
its designated critical habitat. 
 
There would be no effect on cave-dwelling or subterranean species 
(Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, Coffin Cave mold beetle, Comal Springs 
dryopid beetle, Tooth Cave ground beetle, Rhadine exilis, Rhadine 
infernalis, Helotes mold beetle); the American burying beetle where eggs 
and larvae occur in soil and carcasses; aquatic species (Comal Springs 
riffle beetle, Hungerford’s crawling water beetle, Hine’s emerald 
dragonfly, Ash meadows naucorid); species that lay eggs in the sand or 
soil (Northeastern beach tiger beetle, Delta green ground beetle, Mount 
Hermon June beetle, Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, Zayante band-winged 
grasshopper, Ohlone tiger beetle, Puritan tiger beetle, Salt Creek tiger 
beetle).  The eggs and larvae of these species occur in habitats where these 
parasitoids would not occur.  These parasitoids would not be attracted to 
eggs and larvae in these habitats.

There would be no effect on listed butterfly, skipper, and moth species

 beetle, Puritan tiger beetle, Salt Creek tiger 
beetle).  The eggs and larvae of these species occur in habitats where these 
parasitoids would not occur.  These parasitoids would not be attracted to 
eggs and larvae in these habitats. 
 
 34
There would be no effect on listed butterfly, skipper, and moth species 
(Karner blue butterfly, Bay checkerspot butterfly, Behren’s silverspot 
butterfly, Callippe silverspot butterfly, El Segundo blue butterfly, Fender’s 
blue butterfly, Lange’s metalmark butterfly, Lotis blue butterfly, Mission 
blue butterfly, Mitchell’s satyr butterfly, Myrtle’s silverspot butterfly, 
Oregon silverspot butterfly, Palos Verdes blue butterfly, Quino 
checkerspot butterfly, Saint Francis’ satyr butterfly, San Bruno elfin 
butterfly, Schaus swallowtail butterfly, Smith’s blue butterfly, 
Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly, Kern primrose sphinx moth, Carson 
wandering skipper, Laguna Mountains skipper, Pawnee montane skipper).  
From host specificity testing, no lepidopteran species were accepted as 
hosts.  In addition, these parasitoids are adapted to attacking larvae and 
eggs of wood-boring species and would not be attracted to eggs and larvae 
of non wood-boring species.

VI.  Other Issues 
 
Executive Orders 
 
Consistent with Executive Order (EO) 12898, “Federal Actions to Address 
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income 
Populations,” APHIS considered the potential for disproportionately high 
and adverse human health or environmental effects on any minority 
populations and low-income populations.  No environmental or human 
health effects from the proposed action are expected and there will be no 
disproportionate adverse effects to any minority or low-income 
populations.   
 
Consistent with EO 13045, “Protection of Children From Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks,” APHIS considered the potential for 
disproportionately high and adverse environmental health and safety risks 
to children.  No circumstances that would trigger the need for special 
environmental reviews are involved in implementing the preferred 
alternative.  Therefore, it is expected that no disproportionate effects on 
children are anticipated as a consequence of implementing the preferred 
alternative. 
 
Consistent with EO 13175, “Consultation and Coordination with Indian 
Tribal Governments”, APHIS has consulted with tribes that have 
requested consultation on this proposed action, the Nottawaseppi Huron 
Band of Potawatomi and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of 
Michigan.  APHIS will continue to work with tribes that have interest in 
biological control of EAB.

Comments Received on This EA 
 
APHIS received 41 comments on the EA.  Thirty commenters were in 
favor of the proposed release of the parasitoids and 11 opposed the 
release.  Several commenters raised general concerns about the uncertainty 
of impacts on the environment if the parasitoids were released, particularly 
in light of the problems associated with certain releases of biological 
control agents in the past.  Based on host-specificity testing conducted in 
China and in the laboratory in the United States, these parasitoids are 
acceptably host-specific and will not have impacts on non-target insects, 
other than incidental attack of come non-target Agrilus species.  In the 
past, some biological control agents were released without adequate host 
specificity testing.  Today much more emphasis is placed on host-
specificity testing of agents prior to environmental release in order to 
avoid unintended impacts to non-targets and ecosystems.  Also, these 
parasitoids will not eradicate EAB (or other Agrilus species) and thus will 
not eliminate their food source. 
 
One commenter questioned why certain species that occur in ash were not 
tested against the parasitoids.  The insects most at risk of non-target attack 
from the three parasitoids are wood borers in the genus Agrilus and those 
that attack ash.  Wood borers that attack ash were tested.  For O.agrili and 
T. planiplennisi, Agrilus subcinctus and Neoclytus acuminatus were tested

 most at risk of non-target attack 
from the three parasitoids are wood borers in the genus Agrilus and those 
that attack ash.  Wood borers that attack ash were tested.  For O.agrili and 
T. planiplennisi, Agrilus subcinctus and Neoclytus acuminatus were tested 
and for S. agrili, Holocerus insularis and an unidentified pyralid were 
tested.  There was no parasitization by any parasitoid on any of these non-
targets.  Borers such as scolytids are too small, and wood-boring insects 
like cossids and cerambycids tend to burrow into the wood as they get 
large, where they are outside of the reach of the short ovipositors of S. 
agrili and T. planipennisi.  Larvae of the eastern ash bark beetle, 
Hylesinus aculeatus, are too small for T. plannipennisi, which parasitizes 
EAB larvae 100 times larger than the mature larvae of this bark beetle.  
Additionally, the eggs of this bark beetle are laid under ash bark within its 
nuptial gallery, remaining inaccessible to parasitism by O. agrili which 
searches for Agrilus eggs on the surface of ash bark.  No evidence was 
found for risk to eggs or larvae of cerambycids such as Tylonotus 
bimaculatus, Stenocerus shaumii, Saperda lateralis, Neoclytus caprea, 
and Obrium rufulum.

and Obrium rufulum.  
 
One commenter submitted the following comments.  Responses follow the 
comments: 
 
Comment:  Lack of data on non-EAB hosts for these parasitoids.  To state 
that there are no, or in the case of Spathius agrili, few known non-EAB 
hosts is meaningless because none of these insects was recognized prior to 
2003 and then only because of the intense focus on EAB parasitoids.  
Response:  Colleagues in China and other Chinese entomologists have for 
 36
many years studied other Agrilus species (because some are pests) and it 
was not until they started collecting parasitoids from A. planipennis that 
they found S. agrili.   
 
Comment:  In host specificity testing, parasitism rates of Agrilus species 
ranged from 7%-32%.  This is hardly "unsuccessful" parasitism, especially 
when A. planipennis was only parasitized at 27%!   
Response:  The commenter failed to look at the proper U.S. and China 
controls.  Parasitism of EAB in China was actually 65% and was 
statistically higher than parasitism on other Agrilus in those tests (see 
Table 4).   
 
Comment:  Kimberling (2004) notes that control is least successful with 
polyphagous, univoltine predators or parasitoids, which is the case with S. 
agrili.

 actually 65% and was 
statistically higher than parasitism on other Agrilus in those tests (see 
Table 4).   
 
Comment:  Kimberling (2004) notes that control is least successful with 
polyphagous, univoltine predators or parasitoids, which is the case with S. 
agrili.   
Response:  S. agrili is not polyphagous but oligophagous, and it is 
multivoltine (3-4 generations per year), not univoltine. 
 
Comment: Of particular concern is the implicit assumption that relatively 
high parasitism rates, particularly in lab studies, are equivalent to the 
potential for achieving similar rates in North America and acquiring 
effective biocontrol thereby.   
Response:  APHIS agrees that parasitism rates in the laboratory do not 
necessarily correllate well to prediction of field rates of parasitism.   
 
Comment:  The acknowledged low success rate of insect biocontrol 
introductions in North America underscores the need to ensure, to the 
degree possible, that such introductions are worth the substantial 
investment in time, labor, and money.  Extensive field studies in China are 
necessary to determine whether the control in a field situation justifies the 
expense of rearing and introducing these species in North America.   
Response:  Just as parasitism levels in the laboratory cannot predict the 
success of biocontrol in the field; neither can studies of parasitism in the 
native range predict the success in the introduced range.  Agents may be 
more or less successful than predicted by laboratory and field studies.  In 
addition, field tests have been conducted in China.  See Liu,

Response:  Post-release evaluations are designed to determine if

organisms. 
 
Comment:  Introduction and establishment of these parasitoids would be 
irrevocable and it would be a relatively useless exercise to track their non-
target impacts after it is too late.   
Response:  Post-release evaluations will help inform future biocontrol 
projects.  Many past biological control releases have been criticized for 
lacking post-release monitoring.   
 
Comment:  The choice of host plants (Table 5) for S. agrili was much too 
limited and should have included many common trees (or at least those 
that are hosts of Agrilus spp. similar in size to EAB) from North America 
to have any validity.   
Response:  Limited resources are available to conduct host-specificity 
testing and all species of trees cannot be tested.  In the case of S. agrili, 
tests were done in China because the researcher did not have enough S. 
agrili adults to do the tests in the United States, thus limiting the number 
of host tree species tested.   
 
Comment:  No papers are cited by the two North American experts on the 
genus Agrilus.  This casts doubt on the quality of input regarding the 
biology and potential non-target consequences for members of this taxon. 
Response:  Omission of specific references from the EA does not reflect a 
lack of knowledge of North American Buprestidae.  Over the last few 
years, the researchers have become very familiar with
Text Len: 1603

genus Agrilus.  This casts doubt on the quality of input regarding the 
biology and potential non-target consequences for members of this taxon. 
Response:  Omission of specific references from the EA does not reflect a 
lack of knowledge of North American Buprestidae.  Over the last few 
years, the researchers have become very familiar with the literature on this 
family and the genus Agrilus by the experts Richard Westcott and Charles 
Bellamy.  The researchers have also been in contact with and/or swapped 
Agrilus specimens with other buprestid experts in the United States 
including Gayle Nelson in California, Stan Wellso in Texas, and Ted 
MacRae in Missouri.  The assistance of these experts and their published 
literature was instrumental in evaluating the host specificity of these 
parasitoids. 
 
Comment: The lengthy discussion of species that are listed as sensitive, 
threatened, and endangered, while perhaps laudable, adds little value to 
the document and may be regarded as little more than a diversionary 
smoke screen by some.  The chances of any parasitoid attacking cave 
dwellers, burying beetles, aquatic insects, and a multitude of Lepidoptera 
are obviously vanishingly small.   
Response:  APHIS is required under section 7 of the Endangered Species 
Act to ensure that its actions will not jeopardize federally listed threatened 
and endangered species and will not adversely modify deisgnated critical 
 38
habitat, and must demonstrate that the effects of the proposed action were 
considered.  Making a “no effect” determination for the proposed action 
requires APHIS to document that potential effects on listed species are 
nonexistent.

I.  Background and Introduction 
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) and Forest Service (FS) are proposing to 
release three insect parasitoid1 species for the biological control 
(biocontrol) of the nonindigenous emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus 
planipennis).  This environmental assessment2 (EA) has been prepared, 
consistent with USDA, APHIS' National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) implementing procedures (Title 7 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), part 372).  It examines the potential effects on the 
quality of the human environment that may be associated with the release 
of these biocontrol agents to control infestations of EAB within the 
continental United States.  This EA considers the potential effects of the 
proposed action and its alternatives, including no action. 
 
The EAB is an invasive wood-boring beetle from Asia threatening North 
America’s ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  It was introduced into the Detroit, 
Michigan area, probably sometime in the 1990s, and was identified as the 
cause of ash mortality in the area in 2002 (Haack et al., 2002).  EAB 
larvae feed on ash phloem, cutting off the movement of resources within 
the tree and killing the tree in 4-5 years.  EAB is now considered 
established in natural ecosystems throughout the lower peninsula of 
Michigan and contiguous areas of Ohio, Indiana, and Ontario, Canada.

ack et al., 2002).  EAB 
larvae feed on ash phloem, cutting off the movement of resources within 
the tree and killing the tree in 4-5 years.  EAB is now considered 
established in natural ecosystems throughout the lower peninsula of 
Michigan and contiguous areas of Ohio, Indiana, and Ontario, Canada.  
Separate infestations have been found in the upper peninsula of Michigan, 
in Illinois, and in Maryland.  EAB appears well suited for climatic 
conditions in North America and destroys entire stands of ash.  It is 
predicted that EAB will continue to disperse along various continuous 
corridors of ash now present in natural and urban environments due to the 
widespread use of ash as a landscape tree. 
 
 
II.  Purpose and Need for the Proposed 
Action 
 
APHIS and FS propose to release three parasitoids into the environment of 
the continental United States for the purpose of reducing EAB 
populations.  These parasitoids are known to attack EAB consistently in its

host individual, eventually killing that individual. 
2 Regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42   
United States Code 4321 et seq.) provide that an environmental assessment “[shall include brief 
discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E), of the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons 
consulted.”  40 CFR § 1508.9.

native range in China.  The biocontrol agents include one larval 
ectoparasitoid, Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (Yang et al., 
2005), one species of egg parasitoid, Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: 
Encyrtidae) (Zhang et al., 2005), and one species of larval endoparasitoid, 
Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (Liu et al., 2003; 
Yang et al., 2006).  Initial releases of each parasitoid are planned for the 
summer of 2007.  Post-release monitoring, including impacts on EAB and 
non-target wood-boring beetles and spread and establishment of each 
parasitoid species, will be conducted. 
 
There is a need to control EAB, an invasive wood-boring beetle that is 
spreading rapidly and poses a serious threat to ash trees in the United 
States if not controlled.  Despite state and federal quarantines designed to 
contain EAB, the lack of effective methods to detect EAB-infested trees 
and the large size of the infestation has resulted in a shift by regulatory 
agencies from a strategy of area-wide eradication to one focused on 
eradication in outlying areas and containment in the core infestation area 
(GAO, 2006).  In the United States, EAB

 the lack of effective methods to detect EAB-infested trees 
and the large size of the infestation has resulted in a shift by regulatory 
agencies from a strategy of area-wide eradication to one focused on 
eradication in outlying areas and containment in the core infestation area 
(GAO, 2006).  In the United States, EAB eradication efforts involved the 
removal of all ash trees within a circle of specified radius around known 
infestations (typically ½ mile).  By the time an infestation was discovered 
and treated, however, EAB had usually already dispersed outside the 
eradication zone.  The bronze birch borer, A. anxius Gory, a native species 
closely related to EAB, is known to spread at a rate of 10 to 20 miles per 
year, and this has been proposed as an estimate for EAB’s natural 
dispersal rate.  Besides natural dispersal, the spread of EAB has been 
accelerated through human-assisted movement of infested ash firewood, 
timber, solid-wood packing materials, and nursery stock.  This resulted in 
the spread of EAB from Michigan to Maryland and Virginia in 2003.  As 
EAB spreads throughout North America, regulatory agencies, land 
managers, and the public are seeking sustainable management tools such 
as biological control to reduce EAB population densities and to slow its 
spread (Cappaert et al., 2005; GAO, 2006; Poland and McCullough, 
2006). 
 
APHIS has responsibility for taking actions to exclude, eradicate, and/or 
control plant pests, including EAB, under the Plant Protection Act (7 
United States Code (U.S.C.) 7701 et seq.).  APH

spread (Cappaert et al., 2005; GAO, 2006; Poland and McCullough, 
2006). 
 
APHIS has responsibility for taking actions to exclude, eradicate, and/or 
control plant pests, including EAB, under the Plant Protection Act (7 
United States Code (U.S.C.) 7701 et seq.).  APHIS has been delegated the 
authority to administer these statutes and has promulgated Quarantines 
and Regulations (7 CFR 319) which regulate the importation of 
commodities and means of conveyance to help protect against the 
introduction and spread of harmful pests.  The underlying strategy of the 
proposed program is to reduce EAB population densities in infested areas 
and slow its spread into new areas.

III.  Alternatives 
 
APHIS considered two alternatives in response to the need to control EAB 
and contain infestations:  (1) no action and (2) biological control by the 
release of the three parasitoids, O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. agrili (the 
preferred action).  Both alternatives are described briefly in this section 
and the potential impacts of each are considered in the following section.  
 
A.  No Action  
 
Under the no action alternative, APHIS and FS would not release the three 
parasitoids, O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. agrili, for the management of 
EAB.  APHIS, in cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of 
Agriculture, would continue the current program that includes survey, 
quarantine, and eradication of EAB in outlying areas and containment
Text Len: 1481
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
parasitoids, O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. agrili, for the management of 
EAB.  APHIS, in cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of 
Agriculture, would continue the current program that includes survey, 
quarantine, and eradication of EAB in outlying areas and containment in 
the core infestation area.  Some control measures could be taken by other 
Federal or non-Federal entities; those actions would not be under APHIS’ 
control or funded by APHIS.  Local business owners and area residents 
could attempt to control damage from EAB infestations by removing the 
infested trees from their properties.  The lack of effective measures to 
prevent the spread of EAB from infested areas (occurring via natural 
dispersal or artificial spread from movement of infested ash products) will 
likely lead to an increase in EAB populations, increase its range of 
distribution within the United States, and further economic and 
environmental damage. 
 
B.  Biological Control Action (Preferred Alternative)  
 
Under this alternative, APHIS and FS would release three parasitoids for 
biocontrol of EAB.  The biocontrol agents include one species of egg 
parasitoid, Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) (Zhang et al., 2005), 
one species of larval endoparasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi 
(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (Liu et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2006), and one 
larval ectoparasitoid, Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera
Text Len: 1433
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zhang et al., 2005), 
one species of larval endoparasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi 
(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (Liu et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2006), and one 
larval ectoparasitoid, Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (Yang et 
al., 2005).  Initial releases of each parasitoid are planned for the summer 
of 2007.  Releases of these EAB parasitoids are expected to reduce the 
population of EAB and slow the spread rate in the United States.  This 
alternative would reduce but not eradicate EAB in the United States.  
Measures that are occurring under the “no action” alternative would likely 
continue even if the three parasitoids are released into the environment; 
however, these biocontrol agents would serve as another tool to assist in 
the protection of ash trees in North America.

1)  Spathius agrili: 
 
Spathius agrili is a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid; adult wasps lay 
multiple eggs on the surface of an EAB larva.  Oviposition (egg laying) by 
S. agrili paralyzes the EAB larva, stopping its development beyond the 
larval stage.

synonymy or common names.

climatic requirements of S. agrili).  Spathius agrili has been collected 
from Tianjin, China and Changchun, Jilin Province, China.  This species is 
much easier to collect in Tianjin, which would be the likely source of 
insects released in the United States.  The climatic conditions that are most 
conducive to population growth of S. agrili are not explicitly known; 
therefore a climate matching analysis was conducted to determine how 
similar Tianjin is to the upper Midwest.  The climate matching feature of 
the climate analysis software CLIMEX (Herne Scientific Software Pty. 
Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) was used.  The model calculated a Climate 
Match Index (CMI) that is a composite of six variables:

therefore a climate matching analysis was conducted to determine how 
similar Tianjin is to the upper Midwest.  The climate matching feature of 
the climate analysis software CLIMEX (Herne Scientific Software Pty. 
Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) was used.  The model calculated a Climate 
Match Index (CMI) that is a composite of six variables: maximum 
temperature, minimum temperature, total rainfall, rainfall pattern, relative 
humidity, and soil moisture.  A CMI of 1 indicates an exact climate match.  
Because these insects do not live in the soil, soil moisture was not 
included in the model.  Adult Spathius are only present in the summer, so 
the model was run for the adult stage only for June through September, 
and because adults are free living outside of the tree, relative humidity was 
included as a factor.  For larvae, which live under bark, relative humidity 
was not included in the model, and the entire year was included. 
 
For larvae, the CMI for Lansing MI, which is representative of locations in 
the upper Midwest, was 0.63 (Figure 1) when comparisons were made 
with Tianjin, China.  CMI values were similar throughout the central part 
of the United States (Figure 1).  The CMI for adults was 0.60.  Although 
the CMI for adults was higher for Changchun (0.74) the value for larvae 
was similar (0.66).  This indicates that there is not a great advantage to 
attempting to collect S. agrili from Changchun rather than Tianjin, where 
collections are much easier to make.  Although the climate in Tianjin does 
not perfectly match that in the upper Midwest, it is sufficiently similar that

was similar (0.66).  This indicates that there is not a great advantage to 
attempting to collect S. agrili from Changchun rather than Tianjin, where 
collections are much easier to make.  Although the climate in Tianjin does 
not perfectly match that in the upper Midwest, it is sufficiently similar that 
S. agrili could establish successfully.

The cold hardiness of EAB and S. agrili were tested in the laboratory.  The 
super-cooling point of EAB was -22.36ºC, while that of S. agrili was 
-26.28 (Wu et al., in press), indicating that S. agrili should be able to 
withstand cold temperatures in the more northerly range of EAB.

Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  Spathius agrili is well synchronized with its host, emerging in the 
spring over 1½ months after adult EAB when third- and fourth- instar 
EAB larvae are present.  Females search the trunks of infested trees, 
ovipositing on the EAB larvae through the bark.  The EAB larva is 
paralyzed and from 2-18 eggs are laid per larva.  In the laboratory, a 
female lays an average of 23 eggs during her lifetime, which averages 29 
days.  Because S. agrili females only seem to attack EAB larvae that are 
feeding and close to the surface of the tree, fecundity in the lab may be

average of 12% to an average of 42% (Yang et al., in press).  Although 
data are not available on the dispersal capability of S. agrili, they fly 
strongly and are long lived, indicating that dispersal capabilities may be 
high.

Pathogens, parasites, hyperparasitoids of S. agrili and how to 
eliminate them from a culture of the agent.  No pathogens, parasitoids, 
or hyperparasitoids have been observed attacking S. agrili, either in China 
or in specimens shipped to the United States.  A small subset of the 
parasitoids collected in China will be reared and identified by Dr. Yang 
Zhong-qi, an expert on braconid parasitoids.  This will ensure that the 
established colony contains only S. agrili and no other braconids or 
hyperparasitoids.  Further observations will be made on parasitoids 
emerging in quarantine in the United States.  Only healthy S. agrili will be 
used to establish a colony.  Any diseased organisms will be sent to insect 
pathologists for identification and hyperparasitoids will be eliminated 
from the colony.  Insects that are subsequently reared in the United States 
will be maintained in pure culture and monitored for disease.

2)  Oobius agrili: 
 
Oobius agrili is an egg parasitoid.  Adult wasps lay an egg inside EAB 
eggs, that are laid between bark layers and crevices on ash trunks and 
branches.  Larval wasps consume and kill host eggs to complete their 
development. 
 
Taxonomy:  Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) 
(Zhang et al., 2005).  No synonymy or common names. 
 
Methods used to identify Oobius agrili.  Oobius agrili is distinguished 
from the other Oobius spp. according to morphological characteristics 
described by Zhang et al. (2005).  Although no egg parasitoids are known 
from EAB in Michigan (Bauer et al., 2005), encyrtid parasitoids are 
reported from eggs of Agrilus anxius (bronze birch borer) including 
Ablerus sp., Avetianella sp., Ooencyrtus sp., and Thysanus sp. (Nash et al., 
1951; Barter, 1957; Loerch and Cameron, 1983).

2004 in the vicinity of Changchun in Jilin Province, China.  This species 
may have a wider distribution in China, however, no further exploration 
for EAB egg parasitoids has been conducted in China due to limited 
funding and the difficulty in finding EAB eggs.  To estimate climatic 
conditions conducive to establishment of O. agrili in North America, Jilin 
Province was compared to North America using the climate matching 
feature of the climate analysis software CLIMEX (Herne Scientific 
Software Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia).  Because these insects do not 
live in the soil, soil moisture was not included in the model.  Adult O. 
agrili are only present in the summer, so the model was run for adults only 
for June through September, and because adults are free living outside of 
the tree, relative humidity was included as a factor.

125º12'E) in Jilin Province, China by Dr. Tonghai Zhao, Chinese 
Academy of Forestry, Beijing and shipped from this area of China to a 
quarantine laboratory in East Lansing, Michigan.  The eggs were held for 
up to 8 months until emergence of O. agrili was complete.  
 
Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  Based on data from field-collected eggs from China, O. agrili 
spends the winter as mature larvae in EAB eggs and peak emergence 
occurs when EAB begin ovipositing in mid-June, although some adults 
remain in diapause3 until July and August.  The sex ratio of O. agrili 
reared from field-collected EAB eggs in China is 14.5:1 (female:male).  O. 
agrili is thelytokous parthenogenic (females produce females without 
mating).  Much of the knowledge of this parasitoid’s biology is based on 
laboratory studies performed at 25ºC with females held in a plastic cup 
with a streak of honey, moist cotton ball, and EAB eggs laid on a small 
ash twig.  Oobius agrili females prefer to oviposit in 0- to 6-day-old EAB 
eggs and live an average of 22.5 days.  Their average lifetime fecundity is 
approximately 24 progeny per female, and each generation requires about 
three weeks (Table 1).

 eggs laid on a small

eggs and live an average of 22.5 days.  Their average lifetime fecundity is 
approximately 24 progeny per female, and each generation requires about 
three weeks (Table 1).  Based on monthly field collections in China during 
2005, it was confirmed that O. agrili completes at least two generations 
per year with parasitism reaching almost 62% in August.  These attributes 
of O. agrili, including female-biased sex ratio, parthenogenesis, short 
generation time, and high rates of parasitism and fecundity, are 
characteristics of successful biocontrol agents (Kimberling, 2004).  No 
data are available on the dispersal capability of O. agrili, but despite their 
small size (about 0.9 mm) they are relatively long-lived (approximately 
three weeks) and are active jumpers and fliers in the laboratory.  Dispersal, 
however, may be facilitated by selecting release sites with connecting 
corridors of ash.  Moreover, since O. agrili reproduces through 
parthenogenesis, dispersal is facilitated because females do not need to 
find a male and mate before parasitism of EAB can occur.

Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  T. planipennisi is a gregarious larval endoparasitoid; host EAB 
larvae continue feeding after parasitoid oviposition until external 
symptoms of parasitism appear.  Symptoms include bulges on the surface 
of the host integument (outer covering of the body), causing the host 
cadaver to look like a small braided rope.  The larval parasitoids are then 
mature and ready to exit the host cadaver during their wandering phase 
just prior to pupation.  Parasitized host EAB larvae produce a range of 5 to 
122 parasitoids, with an average of 35.2 parasitoid larvae per host.  
Tetrastichus planipennisi attacks both third- and fourth-instar EAB larvae, 
and overwinters as mature larvae in EAB galleries (Liu et al., 2007).  In 
the spring, the parasitoid larvae form pupae, emerge as adults, and chew a 
1-mm diameter hole through the bark from which the wasp brood exits the 
host gallery and tree.

In the laboratory, the egg-larval period for T. planipennisi is about 11 days 
and its pupal period is about 10 days (Table 2).  Adult longevity of 
females is around 24 days, almost twice that of males, and one generation 
requires approximately three weeks.  Their sex ratio is 3.5:1

parasitoids are maintained with a streak of honey and moist cotton ball 
during exposure to host larvae.  Female parasitoids will not oviposit unless 
host larvae are inserted in ash branches.

are characteristics of successful biocontrol agents (Kimberling, 2004).  No 
data are available on the dispersal capability of T. planipennisi, but despite 
their small size adult females live more than three weeks; both sexes are

facilitated by selecting release sites with connecting corridors of ash, such 
as along riparian areas.

IV. Affected Environment 
 
A.  North American Agrilus species 
 
The “Nomina Insecta Nearctica; a check list of the insects of North 
America” (Poole, 1997) lists 164 species of Agrilus in North America (see 
appendix 1).  Most are not considered pests; however, Solomon (1995) 
considers 24 Agrilus species to cause injury to trees and shrubs under 
certain circumstances.  Most species of Agrilus are unable to colonize 
healthy trees; in fact, EAB is not considered a pest throughout its native 
range.  Agrilus species typically attack trees stressed by factors such as 
drought, damage from other insects, or poor silvicultural practices.  
Species such as A. anxius (bronze birch borer) and A. bilineatus (Weber) 
(two-lined chestnut borer) are often considered major pest species in forest 
and landscape situations, but they are typically acting as secondary pests 
on already stressed trees or trees not native to the United States.  Agrilus 
species in North America could potentially be at risk from attack by the 
three parasitoids proposed for environmental release. 
 
B.  Ash Resources of North America 
 
Hosts of EAB:  The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash 
trees (Fraxinus spp.) including F. americana (white ash), F. nigra (black 
ash), F. pennsylvanica (green ash), and some varieties of horticultural ash.

:  The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash 
trees (Fraxinus spp.) including F. americana (white ash), F. nigra (black 
ash), F. pennsylvanica (green ash), and some varieties of horticultural ash.  
Twenty-two species of ash grow in the United States, of which sixteen are 
native (USDA, NRCS, 2006).  See appendix 2 for distribution maps of 
native Fraxinus species in the United States.  There is increasing evidence 
that EAB will attack all Fraxinus spp., although innate susceptibility 
varies by species and variety (Liu et al., 2003; Wie et al., 2004; Rebek et 
al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007).  The FS estimates that 7,553,000,000 ash trees 
in United States timberlands are potentially susceptible to EAB (USDA, 
FS, 2004). 
Ash trees are present as ornamentals, street trees, or timber trees in all of 
the lower 48 states.  Each Fraxinus sp. is adapted to slightly different 
habitats within forest ecosystems.  Several species are tolerant of poorly-
drained sites and wet soils, protecting environmentally-sensitive riparian 
areas; e.g. pure stands of black ash grow in bogs and swamps in northern 
areas where they provide browse, thermal cover, and protection for 
wildlife such as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash 
provides vital shelter for livestock; e.g. about 25% of all trees in North

wildlife such as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash 
provides vital shelter for livestock; e.g. about 25% of all trees in North 
 16
Dakota are Fraxinus spp.  Bark of young ash trees is a favored food of 
mammals including beaver, rabbit, and porcupines; older trees provide 
habitat for cavity-nesting birds such as wood ducks, woodpeckers, 
chickadees, and nuthatches; seeds are consumed by ducks, song and game 
birds, small mammals, and insects. 
Ash timber is valued for applications requiring strong, hardwood, but with 
less rigidity than maple.  In the Eastern United States, a net volume of 114 
billion board feet of ash sawtimber is harvested, comprising 7.5% of the 
volume of all hardwood species (FR, 2003).  The impact varies by state, 
but in Michigan alone an estimated 7.7 billion board feet of ash timber is 
harvested annually.  In 2001, ash accounted for over 149 million board 
feet of timber products produced in the United States.  White ash is the 
primary commercial hardwood used in production of tool handles, 
baseball bats, furniture, flooring, containers, railroad cars and ties, canoe 
paddles, snowshoes, boats, doors, and cabinets; green ash is used for both 
solid wood applications such as crating, boxes, handles, and for fiber in 
the manufacture of high grade paper; black ash is typically used for 
interior furniture, cabinets (FR, 2003), and Northeastern Native Americans 
require ash for the art of basketry.

interior furniture, cabinets (FR, 2003), and Northeastern Native Americans 
require ash for the art of basketry. 
 
Beyond manufacturing, ash trees play an important role in the urban 
landscape due to their historical resistance to pests and tolerance of 
adverse growing conditions, such as soil compaction and drought.  Many 
of the ash trees that now serve as street, shade, and landscape trees were 
planted to replace elm trees destroyed by Dutch elm disease; ash trees now 
comprise 5-20% of all street trees throughout North America.  In the 
United States, urban areas cover about 3.5% of the total land area, contain 
more than 75% of the population, and support about 3.8 billion trees.  The 
City of Chicago has approximately 603,000 ash trees that provide 14.4% 
of leaf area (FR, 2003).  Trees are considered vital to the health of cities 
because they sequester gaseous air pollutants and particulate matter, help 
people conserve energy through the shade they provide, assist in the 
dispersal of storm water, provide shelter belts for urban fauna, and 
contribute aesthetic pleasure to the lives of city-dwellers and tourists.  Ash 
is a vital component of the urban forest.

state and federal quarantines designed to contain EAB, the lack of 
effective methods to detect EAB-infested trees and the large size of the 
infestation has resulted in a shift by regulatory agencies from a strategy of 
area-wide eradication to one focused on eradication in outlying areas and 
containment in the core infestation area (GAO, 2006).  In the United 
States, EAB eradication efforts involved the removal of all ash trees 
within a circle of specified radius around known infestations (typically ½ 
mile).  By the time an infestation was discovered and treated, however, 
EAB had usually already dispersed outside the eradication zone.  The 
bronze birch borer, A. anxius Gory, a native species closely related to 
EAB, is known to spread at a rate of 10 to 20 miles per year, and this has 
been proposed as an estimate for EAB’s natural dispersal rate (FR, 2003).  
Besides natural dispersal, the spread of EAB has been accelerated through 
human-assisted movement of infested ash firewood, timber, solid-wood 
packing materials, and nursery stock.  This resulted in the spread of EAB 
from Michigan to Maryland and Virginia in 2003.  As EAB spreads 
throughout North America, regulatory agencies, land managers, and the 
public are seeking sustainable management tools to reduce EAB 
population densities and to slow its spread (Cappaert et al., 2005

wood 
packing materials, and nursery stock.  This resulted in the spread of EAB 
from Michigan to Maryland and Virginia in 2003.  As EAB spreads 
throughout North America, regulatory agencies, land managers, and the 
public are seeking sustainable management tools to reduce EAB 
population densities and to slow its spread (Cappaert et al., 2005; GAO, 
2006; Poland and McCullough, 2006).  Since its discovery, EAB has 
killed more than 20 million ash trees in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana 
(MSU, 2007). 
The potential path of expansion of the EAB infestation is through Ohio 
and Indiana into the hardwood forests of the Northeast through 
Pennsylvania and New York and into the Appalachian Mountain States 
through Kentucky.  In addition, spread of the pest through the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan to Wisconsin and through Ontario to New York is 
possible.  The economic impact would be severe if EAB spread from 
currently infested areas into the forests of the northeastern United States 
where nursery, landscaping, timber, recreation, and tourism industries are 
economically critical. 
Michigan implemented a moratorium on importing and selling ash nursery 
stock in the Lower Peninsula of the State, impacting at least 9,519 
nurseries (McPartlan et al., 2006).  The State’s 1,847 logging companies 
and sawmills were also affected by their inability to receive ash logs from 
the quarantined area (McPartlan et al., 2006).  Additionally, more than 
2,500 private campgrounds in the tri-state area have been impacted; many 
are losing business when campers are told that they cannot bring firewood 
 18
from quarantined areas (McPartlan et al., 2006).

 to receive ash logs from 
the quarantined area (McPartlan et al., 2006).  Additionally, more than 
2,500 private campgrounds in the tri-state area have been impacted; many 
are losing business when campers are told that they cannot bring firewood 
 18
from quarantined areas (McPartlan et al., 2006).  The area also supports 
industries that utilize ash for tool handles, rail road ties and pallet 
production.   
The continued spread of this pest would threaten these resources and 
permanently alter the Midwest’s forest ecosystem that in some areas is 
made up of 20 to 40 percent ash (McPartlan et al., 2006).  In addition to its 
value in forest ecosystems and for the timber industry, ash has become an 
extremely popular urban/suburban landscape tree because of its tolerance 
of less than ideal planting conditions and resistance to gypsy moth and 
other pests.  It is currently the most commonly planted tree in new 
residential and commercial developments.  Ash was planted widely in 
Midwestern States to replace elms lost to Dutch elm disease, and it is 
common in parks, public spaces, and neighborhoods across the United 
States.  The potential national impact of EAB on the urban environment 
alone is 0.5 to 2 percent loss of total leaf area, or 30-90 million trees with 
a loss of $20-60 billion dollars (McPartlan et al., 2006). 
The spread of EAB infestations could potentially have an enormous 
impact on the U.S. nursery industry, municipal governments, and 
individual home owners.  As many as 300 million landscape ash trees 
have been planted in Michigan alone.  Removal and replacement costs 
would be staggering.  In an initial economic

The spread of EAB infestations could potentially have an enormous 
impact on the U.S. nursery industry, municipal governments, and 
individual home owners.  As many as 300 million landscape ash trees 
have been planted in Michigan alone.  Removal and replacement costs 
would be staggering.  In an initial economic analysis of EAB, the USDA, 
FS estimated that EAB, if not contained and eradicated, could cause 
approximately $7 billion in additional costs to state and local governments 
and landowners to remove and replace dead and dying ash trees in urban 
and suburban areas over the next 25 years (McPartlan et al., 2006).  One 
city in Michigan reported substantially higher water and electrical use 
because of the loss of ash as shade trees (Victor Mastro, USDA-APHIS, 
personal communication).

1.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of S. agrili 
 
Known impact on vertebrates including humans:   Spathius agrili is an 
obligate parasitoid of wood boring larvae, specifically the EAB.  As such, 
it will rarely come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it 
does, it is incapable of stinging or biting.  Braconid wasps have no known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of S. agrili (e.g. intended effects on EAB, direct effects 
on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism of EAB by S. agrili in China can 
reach 30-50%, and in a few stands 85-90% of

 known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of S. agrili (e.g. intended effects on EAB, direct effects 
on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism of EAB by S. agrili in China can 
reach 30-50%, and in a few stands 85-90% of the EAB are parasitized 
 19
(Yang et al., 2005).  Because S. agrili has three generations per year 
compared with just one for EAB, generational percentage parasitism will 
be greater than that measured during a single collection.  Spathius agrili 
clearly has the potential to cause considerable mortality to EAB 
populations.  In China, it is probable that EAB is not typically a pest 
because of the interaction between host plant resistance and natural 
enemies.  While it is clear that American ash species are not resistant to 
EAB per se, they can withstand some attack as evidenced by callusing of 
EAB galleries (Gould, 2007).  In China, where F. pennsylvanica (native to 
North America) was attacked by EAB, parasitism by O. agrili and T. 
planipennisi reduced EAB populations by 74% and the trees continued to 
produce fruit.  Spathius agrili will not have to cause 100% mortality of 
EAB to impact the health of ash stands, because ash can successfully 
withstand some attack (Gould, 2007). 
 
To evaluate the effects of S. agrili on non-target insect species, no-choice 
host specificity tests were conducted in China and the United States to 
determine the physiological host range of S. agrili and possible direct 
effects

 health of ash stands, because ash can successfully 
withstand some attack (Gould, 2007). 
 
To evaluate the effects of S. agrili on non-target insect species, no-choice 
host specificity tests were conducted in China and the United States to 
determine the physiological host range of S. agrili and possible direct 
effects on non-target species.  In 2003-2005, potential host larvae were 
collected in the ash forest where S. agrili was attacking EAB in Tianjin, 
China to determine whether S. agrili would attack other species in the 
same forest habitat.  All species tested were boring insects, including some 
that were closely related to EAB and others that were not. 
 
Spathius agrili finds hosts to parasitize by hearing sounds or feeling 
vibrations produced by feeding larvae.  Studies have shown that they do 
not attack prepupae or molting larvae that are not feeding (Gould, 2007).  
All test larvae, therefore, had to be feeding inside their natural hosts 
during testing.  To accomplish this, 1-1.5 cm diameter twigs were split 
longitudinally and a 3 cm long groove was cut through to the bark on one 
side.  The test larvae were placed in these chambers, and the twigs were 
reassembled and secured with rubber bands.  The ends of the twigs were 
sealed with paraffin wax to prevent desiccation.  The twigs were placed 
into 11.5 by 2.8 cm diameter glass vials that contained a newly-emerged, 
mated S. agrili female.  The parasitoids were fed honey streaked on the 
side of the vial.  In tests in the United

sealed with paraffin wax to prevent desiccation.  The twigs were placed 
into 11.5 by 2.8 cm diameter glass vials that contained a newly-emerged, 
mated S. agrili female.  The parasitoids were fed honey streaked on the 
side of the vial.  In tests in the United States, the larvae were checked 
weekly for the presence of S. agrili eggs or larvae until the parasitoid 
females died.  In China the twigs were only checked after the female died.  
All parasitized larvae were held to determine if S. agrili could develop to 
the adult stage. 
 
In the early host specificity tests, S. agrili did not parasitize wood-boring 
lepidopterans, a longhorned beetle (Cerambycidae), or the one Agrilus 
species tested (Table 3).  Of the three species whose larvae attack ash, 
only EAB was parasitized.  Further testing was, therefore, confined to 
members of the genus Agrilus, which might be at risk because they are 
closely related to EAB.  In the United States, the two-lined chestnut borer, 
A. bilineatus, in oak, and the bronze birch borer, A. anxius, in birch were 
tested.  These species were chosen because oak and birch can be found in 
close proximity to ash, they could be collected in reasonable numbers for 
testing, and they are two Agrilus species that sometimes occur in outbreak 
situations.

In tests in the United States, S. agrili attacked some species of Agrilus 
other than EAB in the no-choice tests, but attack rates were significantly 
lower than for its primary host, the EAB (Table 4).  Two out of thirty A. 
bilineatus were attacked and both attacks resulted in cocoons but only two 
adult males were reared from one egg cluster, and the other egg cluster 
produced cocoons, but no adults emerged.  However, this indicates that A. 
bilineatus could serve as a potential host of S. agrili.  No S. agrili larvae 
survived on the single parasitized A. anxius. 
 
In tests in China, S. agrili attacked A. zanthoxylumi, A. mali, and A. 
inamoenus, but at rates that were lower than attack on EAB (Table 4).

No-choice tests determine the physiological host range of a parasitoid by 
giving them no other option but to oviposit on a non-target host.  To 
determine the ecological host range of S. agrili, olfactometer tests were 
conducted in China to investigate whether S. agrili is attracted to plant 
species harboring the larvae tested in no-choice tests.  Naïve mated S.

 but to oviposit on a non-target host.  To 
determine the ecological host range of S. agrili, olfactometer tests were 
conducted in China to investigate whether S. agrili is attracted to plant 
species harboring the larvae tested in no-choice tests.  Naïve mated S. 
agrili females were placed in vertical y-tube olfactometers and given a 
choice of leaves and twigs of various host plants or clean air.  Spathius 
agrili was only attracted to F. pennsylvanica, F. velutina, and Salix 
babylonica (willow) (Table 5).  The two Fraxinus species are native to the 
United States.  Even though some attack occurred on larvae found in 
Citrus reticulata, Malus micromalus, and Zanthoxylum bungeanum in no-
choice tests, S. agrili females were not attracted to these tree species.  In 
 21
 22
nature, if parasitoids are not attracted to the host tree they are unlikely to 
encounter and parasitize the non-target larvae.  Spathius agrili was 
attracted to willow leaves, and at least two Agrilus species attack willow 
in the United States:  Agrilus politus (adults 5.0-8.5 mm long) and A. 
quadriguttatus (size could not be found in literature).  These insects are 
quite small compared with adult EAB, which are 8.5-13.5 mm long.  
Spathius agrili only attacks large EAB larvae, and A. politus is 
undoubtedly too small to be at risk of attack.  Even

quadriguttatus (size could not be found in literature).  These insects are 
quite small compared with adult EAB, which are 8.5-13.5 mm long.  
Spathius agrili only attacks large EAB larvae, and A. politus is 
undoubtedly too small to be at risk of attack.  Even if S. agrili is attracted 
to willow in the United States, it is unlikely to encounter suitable non-
target hosts. 
 
That some attack by S. agrili on non-target species occurred is not totally 
surprising given that the native S. floridanus does attack EAB in the 
United States.  However, parasitism of EAB by this native Spathius is 
extremely low, well below 0.5%, despite an abundance of EAB.  This low 
level of parasitism is certainly not sufficient to affect EAB population 
growth or dynamics and it is not expected that S. agrili will significantly 
impact populations of native Agrilus. 
 
A fourth piece of evidence concerning host specificity was gathered in 
China by collecting larvae of six Agrilus species and rearing them to 
determine their parasitoid fauna.  A total of 2,074 Agrilus larvae of six 
species were collected and not a single S. agrili was recovered (Table 6). 
 
Given the combination of evidence from no-choice tests (lower parasitism 
rates or no attack on non-target species), olfactometer tests (only attracted 
to ash and willow), the lack of S. agrili reared from other Agrilus spp. in 
China, and the fact that the U.S. native species S. floridanus

China, and the fact that the U.S. native species S. floridanus rarely attacks 
EAB, the release of S. agrili is not expected to have adverse direct effects 
on non-target species.

2.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of O. agrili 
 
Known impact on vertebrates including humans:  Oobius agrili is a 
very small (about 0.9 mm) obligate egg parasitoid of EAB.  As such, it 
will rarely come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it 
does, it is incapable of stinging or biting.  Encyrtid wasps have no known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of Oobius agrili (e.g. intended effects on targets, direct 
effects on non-targets).  After discovery of O. agrili in China in 2004, its 
effects on EAB populations were quantified by sampling EAB eggs 
monthly from April through August in an infested ash plantation in Jilin 
Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to determine its 
overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  Based on the number of O

 of O. agrili in China in 2004, its 
effects on EAB populations were quantified by sampling EAB eggs 
monthly from April through August in an infested ash plantation in Jilin 
Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to determine its 
overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  Based on the number of O. agrili 
adults successfully emerging from EAB eggs after arrival in the FS 
quarantine laboratory in Michigan, parasitism rates reached 56.3% 
parasitism in July and 61.5% in August (Figure 4).  The number of 
parasitoids reared from November collections vs. numbers reared from 
spring collections suggests that overwintering mortality does occur.  Year-
to-year variations in parasitism rates can be observed by comparing 
parasitism rates from samples taken in June 2004 and those taken June 
2005.  This variation may be caused by differences in the overwintering 
survival of O. agrili, developmental rates of EAB populations, and other 
environmental factors.

To evaluate the direct effects of O. agrili on non-target insect species, no-

spp., two cerambycids, and four lepidopterans (Table 7).  These insects 
were selected based on taxonomic similarity to EAB; overlap in habitat 
and/or niche with EAB; risk to beneficial, threatened, or endangered 
insects; and feasibility of acquiring or rearing enough eggs to perform and 
replicate reliable assays (Badendreier et al., 2005).

In no-choice assays, O. agrili did not oviposit in eggs of the cerambycids 
and lepidopterans (Table 7).  O. agrili may oviposit and develop in Agrilus 
eggs from different species, but only those with eggs similar in size to 
EAB eggs (Table 7).  These included A. anxius (bronze birch borer), A. 
bilineatis (two-lined chestnut borer), and A. ruficollis (red-necked cane 
borer), which are considered pests of birch, oak, and raspberry, 
respectively.  Although many native Agrilus spp. are considered

 A. anxius (bronze birch borer), A. 
bilineatis (two-lined chestnut borer), and A. ruficollis (red-necked cane 
borer), which are considered pests of birch, oak, and raspberry, 
respectively.  Although many native Agrilus spp. are considered 
destructive pests of forest and shade trees, most prefer stressed, weakened, 
or dying trees. 
 
Paired no-choice and choice assays were performed (Badendreier et al., 
2005) for two of the Agrilus spp. accepted by O. agrili during the no-
choice assays.  The results of the choice assays demonstrate that O. agrili 
shows a clear preference for EAB (A. planipennis) eggs over those of A. 
ruficollis (Figure 5) and A. anxius (Figure 6).

3.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of T. planipennisi. 
 
 27
Known impact on vertebrates including humans:  Tetrastichus 
planipennisi is a small (females 4-5 mm; males 2-3 mm) and gregarious 
larval endoparasitoid of EAB.  As such, it will rarely come into contact 
with humans or other vertebrates, and if it does, it is incapable of stinging 
or biting.  Eulophid wasps have no known adverse impacts on humans or 
other vertebrates. 
 
Direct impact of T. planipennisi (e.g. intended effects on EAB, direct 
effects on non-targets).  After discovery of T. planipennisi in China in 
2003 (Liu et al., 2003), effects on EAB populations were quantified by 
sampling EAB larvae monthly from April through August in an infested 
ash plantation in Jilin Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to 
determine its overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  T. planipennisi 
completes four generations per year.  In 2005, parasitism averaged 22.4% 
and peaked at approximately 40

 larvae monthly from April through August in an infested 
ash plantation in Jilin Province; samples in November 2005 were taken to 
determine its overwintering stage (Liu et al., 2007).  T. planipennisi 
completes four generations per year.  In 2005, parasitism averaged 22.4% 
and peaked at approximately 40% in August (Figure 7).  Year-to-year 
variations in parasitism rates can be observed by comparing parasitism 
rates from samples taken in June 2004 and those taken in June 2005.  This 
variation may be caused by differences in the overwintering survival of T. 
planipennisi, developmental rates of EAB populations, and other 
environmental factors.

It was also found that third- and fourth-instar EAB larvae are available as 
hosts throughout spring, summer, and fall for emerging T. planipennisi 
adults, allowing for a rapid population build-up during the summer (Liu et 
al., 2007).  Similar distributions in EAB larval stages are observed in 
Michigan as populations increase throughout an area (Cappaert et al., 
2005).

al., 2007).  Similar distributions in EAB larval stages are observed in 
Michigan as populations increase throughout an area (Cappaert et al., 
2005).  
 
To evaluate the direct effects of T. planipennisi on potential non-target 
insect species, no-choice assays were performed in the laboratory with 
larvae of EAB and eight species of buprestid (five Agrilus and three 
 28
 29
Chrysobothris), five cerambycids, two lepidopterans, and one 
hymenopteran (Table 8).  These insects were selected based on taxonomic 
similarity to EAB; overlap in habitat and/or niche with EAB; risk to 
beneficial, threatened, or endangered insects; feasibility of acquiring or 
rearing enough larvae to perform and replicate reliable assays 
(Badendreier et al., 2005).

The results of the no-choice assays of T. planipennisi indicate that this 
parasitoid is highly specific to EAB (Table 8), thus choice assays were not 
performed. 
 
 
4.  Effects on the Physical Environment and Indirect Effects of 
the Release of the Three Parasitoids

the Release of the Three Parasitoids 
 
Effects on physical environment (e.g. water, soil and air resources):  
Trees in the genus Fraxinus are important components of many forested 
ecosystems throughout North America and are planted extensively as 
urban and shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and 
Analysis estimates that establishment of EAB throughout the United 
 30
States could result in loss of approximately 2.6% of trees in our 
timberlands, or 8 billion trees (USDA, FS, 2004).  White, blue, and 
Oregon ash grow on fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, 
Carolina, and pumpkin ash are wetland species; and velvet and single-leaf 
ash grow in semi-deserts and canyons.  If EAB populations are not 
managed, ash resources throughout North America could be devastated 
(MacFarlane and Meyer, 2005).  The loss of ash over large geographical 
areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air resources.  Ash is an 
important riparian tree and is often found along river banks.  Removing 
ash from stream banks will likely affect bank soil retention and stream 
processes.  The successful deployment of EAB biocontrol agents such as 
S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. planipennisi will have a positive impact on the 
physical environment by moderating EAB population increase, thus 
limiting tree damage. 
 
Indirect effects (e.g. potential impacts on organisms that depend on 
EAB or non-target species including potential competition with

limiting tree damage. 
 
Indirect effects (e.g. potential impacts on organisms that depend on 
EAB or non-target species including potential competition with 
resident biological control agents).  Successful management of EAB 
using biological control agents, including S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi, will result in positive, indirect effects on U.S. municipalities, 
land owners, wood industries, Native American basketry, forest 
biodiversity, wildlife, riparian areas, and organisms that use Fraxinus spp. 
(e.g. the cerambycid: red-headed ash borer, Neoclytus acuminatus; the 
sphingid: great ash sphinx, Sphinx chersis; the sesiids: ash clearwing, 
Podesesia syringae and banded ash clearwing, P. aurecincta; the 
scolytids: eastern, western, and northern ash beetles, Hylesinus aculeatus, 
H. californicus, and H. criddlei). 
  
Indirect effects to ongoing biological control projects that utilize Agrilus 
species to control weeds should also be considered.  Agrilus hyperici was 
released against Klamath weed in the western United States with mixed 
results.  In northern Idaho it is beneficial in assisting two Klamath weed 
beetles, Chrysolina sp., in controlling the target weed (Campbell and 
McCaffery, 1991), but in California it has been displaced by C. 
quadrigemina (McCaffrey et al., 1995).  Agrilus hyperici is a root feed

beetles, Chrysolina sp., in controlling the target weed (Campbell and 
McCaffery, 1991), but in California it has been displaced by C. 
quadrigemina (McCaffrey et al., 1995).  Agrilus hyperici is a root feeder 
acting on a rangeland weed.  Another exotic buprestid, Sphenoptera 
jugoslavica, also a root feeder, was released against spotted, diffuse, and 
squarrose knapweeds.  Based on the results of research in the field in 
China and laboratory host specificity studies, S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi are host specific, and are not expected to attack other 
buprestid species that are used for biological control.  
 
 31
5.  Uncertainties Regarding the Environmental Release of S. 
agrili, O. agrili, and T. planipennisi. 
 
Once biological control agents such as S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi are released into the environment and become established, 
there is a slight possibility they could move from the target insect (EAB) 
to attack nontarget insects, such as native Agrilus species.  Based on host 
specificity testing conducted, incidental parasitism of some non-target 
Agrilus spp. may occur by S. agrili and O. agrili, although these agents 
have been shown to prefer EAB (T. planipennisi attacked only EAB in 
host-specificity testing).  Native species that are closely related to the 
target species
Text Len: 1421
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ity testing conducted, incidental parasitism of some non-target 
Agrilus spp. may occur by S. agrili and O. agrili, although these agents 
have been shown to prefer EAB (T. planipennisi attacked only EAB in 
host-specificity testing).  Native species that are closely related to the 
target species are the most likely to be attacked (Louda et al., 2003).  If 
other insect species were to be attacked by S. agrili, O. agrili, or T. 
planipennisi, the resulting effects could be environmental impacts that 
may not be easily reversed.  Biological control agents such as S. agrili, O. 
agrili, and T. planipennisi generally spread without intervention by man.  
In principle, therefore, release of these parasitoids at even one site should 
be considered equivalent to release over the entire area in which potential 
hosts occur and in which the climate is suitable for reproduction and 
survival.  Post-release evaluations of S. agrili, O. agrili, and T. 
planipennisi populations and their effects on EAB and other non-target 
species will be conducted by APHIS and FS researchers. 
 
In addition, these agents may not be successful in reducing EAB 
populations in the continental United States.  Approximately 12% of all 
parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control of the pest (Greathead and Greathead, 1992) either because 
introduction did not lead to establishment or establishment did not lead to 
control (Lane et al., 1999).  Actual impacts on EAB populations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control of the pest (Greathead and Greathead, 1992) either because 
introduction did not lead to establishment or establishment did not lead to 
control (Lane et al., 1999).  Actual impacts on EAB populations by S. 
agrili, O. agrili, and T. planipennisi will not be known until after release 
occurs and post-release monitoring has been conducted.  The 
environmental consequences discussed under the “no action” alternative 
may occur even with the implementation of the biological control 
alternative, depending on the efficacy of those agents to reduce EAB 
populations in the continental United States. 
 
 
6.  Cumulative Impacts 
 
“Cumulative impacts are defined as the impact on the environment which 
results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, 
present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agencies or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).   
 
 32
Currently, no other biological control agents have been released against 
EAB in the continental United States, although hundreds, if not thousands 
of parasitoid species have been released in the United States to attack 
various insect pests such as mealybugs, aphids, whiteflies, and 
agriculturally important lepidopteran pests.  
 
APHIS has put quarantines in place to prevent the movement of EAB out 
of EAB-infested areas of the United States (7 CFR Subpart 301.53).  This 
area may expand as new infestations are discovered.

 aphids, whiteflies, and 
agriculturally important lepidopteran pests.  
 
APHIS has put quarantines in place to prevent the movement of EAB out 
of EAB-infested areas of the United States (7 CFR Subpart 301.53).  This 
area may expand as new infestations are discovered.  Quarantines are put 
in place to prevent the artificial spread of EAB through movement of 
infested firewood or other infested wood materials. 
 
APHIS, in cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of 
Agriculture, conducts an EAB management program that includes survey 
for EAB to determine new areas of infestation, and eradication of EAB by 
cutting infested ash trees in outlying areas. 
 
Release of the proposed parasitoids will have no negative cumulative 
impacts in the continental United States because of the host specificity of 
the parasitoids to EAB, other than potential impacts on non-target Agrilus 
species.  However, based on host-specificity testing conducted and field 
studies in China, impacts to non-target Agrilus spp. are expected to be 
minimal since all three parasitoids clearly preferred EAB.  Effective 
biocontrol of EAB will have beneficial effects to current EAB 
management activities, and may result in protection of ash resources and 
reduction in removals of infested trees. 
 
 
7.  Endangered Species Act 
 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ESA’s implementing 
regulations require Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of federally listed threatened 
or endangered species or result in the destruction or
Text Len: 1606
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 removals of infested trees. 
 
 
7.  Endangered Species Act 
 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ESA’s implementing 
regulations require Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of federally listed threatened 
or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification 
of critical habitat.   
 
A direct effect of the release of these parasitoids would be the potential 
attack of eggs or larvae of federally listed insects, resulting in additional 
declines of these species.  In particular, the valley elderberry longhorned 
borer (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus Fisher) (Family 
Cerambycidae), a longhorned borer that mines the interior wood of its host 
plant (Paine et al., 2004) could be perceived to be at risk by these 
parasitoids. 
 
 33
During host specificity testing, S. agrili did not attack any non-target 
species other than some Agrilus species.  The larvae of the valley 
elderberry longhorned beetle would not be accessible to the relatively 
short ovipositor of S. agrili.  In addition, this is not closely related to EAB 
and would not likely be accepted as a host by S. agrili.  Spathius agrili 
must attack its hosts, even EAB, as they are feeding inside of wood, so it 
is unlikely to attack any other threatened or endangered insects, which are 
all external feeders. 
 
During laboratory host-specificity testing, O. agrili rejected the eggs of 
cerambycids tested: red-headed ash borer

ili 
must attack its hosts, even EAB, as they are feeding inside of wood, so it 
is unlikely to attack any other threatened or endangered insects, which are 
all external feeders. 
 
During laboratory host-specificity testing, O. agrili rejected the eggs of 
cerambycids tested: red-headed ash borer (Neoclytus acuminatus) eggs on 
ash and locust borer (Megacyllene robiniae) on black locust.  The eggs of 
the valley elderberry longhorned borer are about 2.5-3.0 mm long and are 
shaped like a football with longitudinal ridges, whereas EAB eggs are ca. 
1 mm in diameter and flat, oppressed between bark layers or in bark 
crevices.  Moreover, a closely related encyrtid, Avetienella longoi, was 
released against the eucalyptus longhorned borer, Phoracantha 
semipunctata, in California where no impact on the valley elderberry 
longhorned beetle has been found.  In addition, O. agrili did not oviposit 
in eggs of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, other than Agrilus eggs of similar 
size to EAB. 
 
During laboratory host-specificity testing, T. planipennisi rejected larvae 
of five cerambycids tested: Astylopsis sexguttata, Neoclytus acuminatus, 
Megacyllene robiniae, Monochamus scutellatus, and an unknown species.  
Moreover, T. planipennisi did not oviposit in larvae of any Lepidopteran, 
Coleopteran (other than EAB), or Hy

 tested: Astylopsis sexguttata, Neoclytus acuminatus, 
Megacyllene robiniae, Monochamus scutellatus, and an unknown species.  
Moreover, T. planipennisi did not oviposit in larvae of any Lepidopteran, 
Coleopteran (other than EAB), or Hymenopteran tested. 
 
Thus, due to the host specificity of the three parasitoids, their release will 
have no effect on the wood-boring valley elderberry longhorned beetle or 
its designated critical habitat. 
 
There would be no effect on cave-dwelling or subterranean species 
(Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, Coffin Cave mold beetle, Comal Springs 
dryopid beetle, Tooth Cave ground beetle, Rhadine exilis, Rhadine 
infernalis, Helotes mold beetle); the American burying beetle where eggs 
and larvae occur in soil and carcasses; aquatic species (Comal Springs 
riffle beetle, Hungerford’s crawling water beetle, Hine’s emerald 
dragonfly, Ash meadows naucorid); species that lay eggs in the sand or 
soil (Northeastern beach tiger beetle, Delta green ground beetle, Mount 
Hermon June beetle, Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, Zayante band-winged 
grasshopper, Ohlone tiger beetle, Puritan tiger beetle, Salt Creek tiger 
beetle).  The eggs and larvae of these species occur in habitats where these 
parasitoids would not occur.  These parasitoids would not be attracted to 
eggs and larvae in these habitats.

 beetle, Puritan tiger beetle, Salt Creek tiger 
beetle).  The eggs and larvae of these species occur in habitats where these 
parasitoids would not occur.  These parasitoids would not be attracted to 
eggs and larvae in these habitats. 
 
 34
There would be no effect on listed butterfly, skipper, and moth species 
(Karner blue butterfly, Bay checkerspot butterfly, Behren’s silverspot 
butterfly, Callippe silverspot butterfly, El Segundo blue butterfly, Fender’s 
blue butterfly, Lange’s metalmark butterfly, Lotis blue butterfly, Mission 
blue butterfly, Mitchell’s satyr butterfly, Myrtle’s silverspot butterfly, 
Oregon silverspot butterfly, Palos Verdes blue butterfly, Quino

butterfly, Schaus swallowtail butterfly, Smith’s blue butterfly, 
Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly, Kern primrose sphinx moth, Carson 
wandering skipper, Laguna Mountains skipper, Pawnee montane skipper).  
From host specificity testing, no lepidopteran species were accepted as 
hosts.  In addition, these parasitoids are adapted to attacking larvae and 
eggs of wood-boring species and would not be attracted to eggs and larvae 
of non wood-boring species.

VI.  Other Issues 
 
Executive Orders 
 
Consistent with Executive Order (EO) 12898, “Federal Actions to Address 
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income 
Populations,” APHIS considered the potential for disproportionately high 
and adverse human health or environmental effects on any minority 
populations and low-income populations.  No environmental or human 
health effects from the proposed action are expected and there will be no 
disproportionate adverse effects to any minority or low-income 
populations.   
 
Consistent with EO 13045, “Protection of Children From Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks,” APHIS considered the potential for 
disproportionately high and adverse environmental health and safety risks 
to children.  No circumstances that would trigger the need for special 
environmental reviews are involved in implementing the preferred 
alternative.  Therefore, it is expected that no disproportionate effects on 
children are anticipated as a consequence of implementing the preferred 
alternative. 
 
Consistent with EO 13175, “Consultation and Coordination with Indian 
Tribal Governments”, APHIS has consulted with tribes that have 
requested consultation on this proposed action, the Nottawaseppi Huron 
Band of Potawatomi and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of 
Michigan.  APHIS will continue to work with tribes that have interest in 
biological control of EAB.

Comments Received on This EA 
 
APHIS received 41 comments on the EA.  Thirty commenters were in 
favor of the proposed release of the parasitoids and 11 opposed the 
release.  Several commenters raised general concerns about the uncertainty 
of impacts on the environment if the parasitoids were released, particularly 
in light of the problems associated with certain releases of biological 
control agents in the past.  Based on host-specificity testing conducted in 
China and in the laboratory in the United States, these parasitoids are 
acceptably host-specific and will not have impacts on non-target insects, 
other than incidental attack of come non-target Agrilus species.  In the 
past, some biological control agents were released without adequate host 
specificity testing.  Today much more emphasis is placed on host-
specificity testing of agents prior to environmental release in order to 
avoid unintended impacts to non-targets and ecosystems.  Also, these 
parasitoids will not eradicate EAB (or other Agrilus species) and thus will 
not eliminate their food source. 
 
One commenter questioned why certain species that occur in ash were not 
tested against the parasitoids.  The insects most at risk of non-target attack 
from the three parasitoids are wood borers in the genus Agrilus and those 
that attack ash.  Wood borers that attack ash were tested.  For O.agrili and 
T. planiplennisi, Agrilus subcinctus and Neoclytus acuminatus were tested

 most at risk of non-target attack 
from the three parasitoids are wood borers in the genus Agrilus and those 
that attack ash.  Wood borers that attack ash were tested.  For O.agrili and 
T. planiplennisi, Agrilus subcinctus and Neoclytus acuminatus were tested 
and for S. agrili, Holocerus insularis and an unidentified pyralid were 
tested.  There was no parasitization by any parasitoid on any of these non-
targets.  Borers such as scolytids are too small, and wood-boring insects 
like cossids and cerambycids tend to burrow into the wood as they get 
large, where they are outside of the reach of the short ovipositors of S. 
agrili and T. planipennisi.  Larvae of the eastern ash bark beetle, 
Hylesinus aculeatus, are too small for T. plannipennisi, which parasitizes 
EAB larvae 100 times larger than the mature larvae of this bark beetle.  
Additionally, the eggs of this bark beetle are laid under ash bark within its 
nuptial gallery, remaining inaccessible to parasitism by O. agrili which 
searches for Agrilus eggs on the surface of ash bark.  No evidence was 
found for risk to eggs or larvae of cerambycids such as Tylonotus 
bimaculatus, Stenocerus shaumii, Saperda lateralis, Neoclytus caprea, 
and Obrium rufulum.

One commenter submitted the following comments.  Responses follow the 
comments: 
 
Comment:  Lack of data on non-EAB hosts for these parasitoids.  To state 
that there are no, or in the case of Spathius agrili, few known non-EAB 
hosts is meaningless because none of these insects was recognized prior to 
2003 and then only because of the intense focus on EAB parasitoids.  
Response:  Colleagues in China and other Chinese entomologists have for 
 36
many years studied other Agrilus species (because some are pests) and it 
was not until they started collecting parasitoids from A. planipennis that 
they found S. agrili.   
 
Comment:  In host specificity testing, parasitism rates of Agrilus species 
ranged from 7%-32%.  This is hardly "unsuccessful" parasitism, especially 
when A. planipennis was only parasitized at 27%!   
Response:  The commenter failed to look at the proper U.S. and China 
controls.  Parasitism of EAB in China was actually 65% and was 
statistically higher than parasitism on other Agrilus in those tests (see 
Table 4).   
 
Comment:  Kimberling (2004) notes that control is least successful with 
polyphagous, univoltine predators or parasitoids, which is the case with S. 
agrili.

 actually 65% and was 
statistically higher than parasitism on other Agrilus in those tests (see 
Table 4).   
 
Comment:  Kimberling (2004) notes that control is least successful with 
polyphagous, univoltine predators or parasitoids, which is the case with S. 
agrili.   
Response:  S. agrili is not polyphagous but oligophagous, and it is 
multivoltine (3-4 generations per year), not univoltine. 
 
Comment: Of particular concern is the implicit assumption that relatively 
high parasitism rates, particularly in lab studies, are equivalent to the 
potential for achieving similar rates in North America and acquiring 
effective biocontrol thereby.   
Response:  APHIS agrees that parasitism rates in the laboratory do not 
necessarily correllate well to prediction of field rates of parasitism.   
 
Comment:  The acknowledged low success rate of insect biocontrol 
introductions in North America underscores the need to ensure, to the 
degree possible, that such introductions are worth the substantial 
investment in time, labor, and money.  Extensive field studies in China are 
necessary to determine whether the control in a field situation justifies the 
expense of rearing and introducing these species in North America.   
Response:  Just as parasitism levels in the laboratory cannot predict the 
success of biocontrol in the field; neither can studies of parasitism in the 
native range predict the success in the introduced range.  Agents may be 
more or less successful than predicted by laboratory and field studies.  In 
addition, field tests have been conducted in China.  See Liu,

Comment:  The proposed "post release evaluations" would be a case of 
"closing the barn door after the horses have run off".   
Response:  Post-release evaluations are designed to determine if 
predictions are valid and to provide information on the efficacy of the 
organisms.

" would be a case of 
"closing the barn door after the horses have run off".   
Response:  Post-release evaluations are designed to determine if 
predictions are valid and to provide information on the efficacy of the 
organisms. 
 
Comment:  Introduction and establishment of these parasitoids would be 
irrevocable and it would be a relatively useless exercise to track their non-
target impacts after it is too late.   
Response:  Post-release evaluations will help inform future biocontrol 
projects.  Many past biological control releases have been criticized for 
lacking post-release monitoring.   
 
Comment:  The choice of host plants (Table 5) for S. agrili was much too 
limited and should have included many common trees (or at least those 
that are hosts of Agrilus spp. similar in size to EAB) from North America 
to have any validity.   
Response:  Limited resources are available to conduct host-specificity 
testing and all species of trees cannot be tested.  In the case of S. agrili, 
tests were done in China because the researcher did not have enough S. 
agrili adults to do the tests in the United States, thus limiting the number 
of host tree species tested.   
 
Comment:  No papers are cited by the two North American experts on the 
genus Agrilus.  This casts doubt on the quality of input regarding the 
biology and potential non-target consequences for members of this taxon. 
Response:  Omission of specific references from the EA does not reflect a 
lack of knowledge of North American Buprestidae.  Over the last few 
years, the researchers have become very familiar with
Text Len: 1603

genus Agrilus.  This casts doubt on the quality of input regarding the 
biology and potential non-target consequences for members of this taxon. 
Response:  Omission of specific references from the EA does not reflect a 
lack of knowledge of North American Buprestidae.  Over the last few 
years, the researchers have become very familiar with the literature on this 
family and the genus Agrilus by the experts Richard Westcott and Charles 
Bellamy.  The researchers have also been in contact with and/or swapped 
Agrilus specimens with other buprestid experts in the United States 
including Gayle Nelson in California, Stan Wellso in Texas, and Ted 
MacRae in Missouri.  The assistance of these experts and their published 
literature was instrumental in evaluating the host specificity of these 
parasitoids. 
 
Comment: The lengthy discussion of species that are listed as sensitive, 
threatened, and endangered, while perhaps laudable, adds little value to 
the document and may be regarded as little more than a diversionary 
smoke screen by some.  The chances of any parasitoid attacking cave 
dwellers, burying beetles, aquatic insects, and a multitude of Lepidoptera 
are obviously vanishingly small.   
Response:  APHIS is required under section 7 of the Endangered Species 
Act to ensure that its actions will not jeopardize federally listed threatened 
and endangered species and will not adversely modify deisgnated critical 
 38
habitat, and must demonstrate that the effects of the proposed action were 
considered.  Making a “no effect” determination for the proposed action 
requires APHIS to document that potential effects on listed species are 
nonexistent.
