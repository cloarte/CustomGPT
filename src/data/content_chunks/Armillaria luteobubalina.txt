 Invasion: A. luteobubalina resembles A. mellea except for the size of the basidioma (smaller), colour of the pileus (dark brown with yellowish hues becoming lemon-yellow, according toPodger et al., 1978), consistency of the ring (moderately thick, floccose) and dimensions of basidiospores (slightly smaller than in A. mellea). Basidia are without clamp connections. Subcortical fans are often perforated. The morphology of the mycelial mats in culture is very close to that of A. mellea.

 Reproduccion: OntogenyThe different organs initiated by the fungus in nature are described below. Species of Armillaria have no known asexual spores, but are able to differentiate a variety of vegetative structures, both in nature and in vitro.RhizomorphsLike Garrett (1956) many authors distinguish the rhizomorphs from the mycelial cords and reserve the name rhizomorph for highly differentiated organs with apical growth. The subterranean rhizomorphs of many species of Armillaria (the &apos;rhizomorpha subterranea&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ) fall into this category. These organs show "the most highly differentiated vegetative tissues of fungi" ( Garraway et al., 1991 ), with a peripheral cortex, a living medulla, a central canal containing gas and an apical meristem ( Motta, 1969 ; Garraway et al., 1991 ). This organ plays an important role in infection, dissemination, search for and colonization of woody substrates in soil (see Epidemiology).The subterranean rhizomorph takes up and transports nutrients, water and oxygen ( Smith and Griffin, 1971 ). The transport of nutrients has been studied by different experiments with radiolabelled elements (Anderson and Ullrich, 1982b and others); it appears to be bidirectional, but is mostly acropetal, which allows the woody food-base from which the rhizomorph originates to feed the growing apex. It is also likely that, at least in A. gallica and A. cepistipes, the rhizomorphic system can grow without any

 (Anderson and Ullrich, 1982b and others); it appears to be bidirectional, but is mostly acropetal, which allows the woody food-base from which the rhizomorph originates to feed the growing apex. It is also likely that, at least in A. gallica and A. cepistipes, the rhizomorphic system can grow without any food-base, by internal reallocation of metabolites ( Mohammed, 1987 ).The different species have a very different capacity for rhizomorph growthand development: the saprophytic species of the &apos;gallica group&apos; (A. gallica,A. sinapina, A. cepistipes) produce strong, fast-growing, long-livingrhizomorphs.The rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina growmore slowly. In addition, the rhizomorphs of A. mellea are short-living andoften difficult to detect in field, though they play a major role in infection. A. tabescens does not produce rhizomorphs in nature but it does in pure culture. The African species A. heimii produces rhizomorphs only in cool environments at high altitudes. Differences for this trait were also reported within a species; they account for a part of variability in the pathogenicity of individual genotypes.Mycelial fans and cordsIn conditions of abundant nutrition, especially in the living plant, the fungus initiates flat, white, poorly differentiated, aggregated organs, which have received different names: subcortical rhizomorphs (the &apos;rhizomorpha subcorticalis&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ), mycelial cords and mycelial fans.

 fungus initiates flat, white, poorly differentiated, aggregated organs, which have received different names: subcortical rhizomorphs (the &apos;rhizomorpha subcorticalis&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ), mycelial cords and mycelial fans. Their general shape can be more or less linear (cords) or isodiametric (fans) according to the host and the localization. Essentially these organs assume a function of nutrition from the living host or the dead wood.In vitro studies have shown that the rhizomorphs and the fans have the same origin: within certain genetic limits, it is possible to transform fans into differentiated rhizomorphs or vice versa by manipulating the composition of the culture medium.Zone linesMany wood-destroying fungi, including Armillaria species, form dark lines in dead wood. These lines (zone lines or pseudosclerotia) are actually dark surfaces which divide the colonized wood into different, more or less independent, volumes. These surfaces are made of dead, melanized, contiguous isodiametric cells. The phenomenon has nothing to do with &apos;compartmentalization&apos;, a resistance process of trees analysed by Shigo and Tippett (1981) .The physiological conditions of zone-line formation in Armillaria species have been studied by several authors ( Campbell, 1934 ; Lopez-Real and Swift, 1975 ). These organs are mainly found in the heart wood; they are linked to a saprophytic phase of substrate exploitation which begins several weeks after infection.XylostromasIn A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1956 ) and A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), the cankers and cracks at the surface of the roots or the collar are often occupied by fungal dark crusts which probably originate from melanization of cambial mycelial fans. These organs

 of substrate exploitation which begins several weeks after infection.XylostromasIn A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1956 ) and A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), the cankers and cracks at the surface of the roots or the collar are often occupied by fungal dark crusts which probably originate from melanization of cambial mycelial fans. These organs are less evident in the other three species which are studied here.Fruit bodiesBasidiomata in species of Armillaria usually appear late in the infection process, most often on dead trees or on stumps. However, it is not uncommon to observe fruit bodies of A. mellea or A. ostoyae in the autumn at the bases of infected trees which are still alive.Different species of Armillaria have very different propensities to fruit in the field. A. tabescens and A. ostoyae fruit rather commonly in nature ( Rhoads, 1956 ), whereas the appearance of fruit bodies is a rare event for the African A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), although this species fruits easily in the laboratory.Sexual Systems and the Karyological CycleThe sexual and karyological problems in species of Armillaria have been summarized by Guillaumin et al. (1991a) but new outstanding results have been obtained since this date. The Armillaria group is unique amongst Basidiomycetes in that the secondary mycelium (formed after mating of two compatible haploid mycelia) is diploid and not dikaryotic. This characteristic seems to be common to all the species of the genus which have been studied to date. The existence of a double genetic recombination in the cycle of at least certain Armillaria species could be another characteristic of the genus.The karyological cycle in species of Armillaria remained a mystery until 1973.

 dikaryotic. This characteristic seems to be common to all the species of the genus which have been studied to date. The existence of a double genetic recombination in the cycle of at least certain Armillaria species could be another characteristic of the genus.The karyological cycle in species of Armillaria remained a mystery until 1973. Early researchers ( Kniep, 1911 ; Kühner, 1946 ) had observed that hyphal cells are monokaryotic, irrespective of their origin (a single basidiospore, basidioma tissue or vegetative material). Hintikka (1973) was the first to observe a macromorphological difference between the haploid monospore isolates (of fluffy appearence) and the diploid cultures from basidioma tissue (flat and crustose); he established that the species he was studying (probably A. borealis) had a bifactorial (or tetrapolar) sexual incompatibility system. Korhonen (1978) , Ullrich and Anderson (1978) , Anderson (1982) , Guillaumin et al. (1983) , Kile (1983) , Guillaumin (1986) and Kile and Watling (1988) showed that this is also the case for all the Armillaria species of the temperate areas (Europe, North America and Australasia), the only exception being A. ectypa, a rare species of European peat bogs ( Guillaumin, 1973 ; Zolciak et al., 1997 ).By contrast, the tropical species of Armillaria which have been studied to date do not appear to be tetrapolar: A. puiggarii from the West Indies is homothallic whereas the common African species A. heimii includes both homothallic and bipolar (unifactorial) heterothallic isolates (Mohammed and Guillaumin, 1993; Guillaumin et al., 1994 ). The sub

 of Armillaria which have been studied to date do not appear to be tetrapolar: A. puiggarii from the West Indies is homothallic whereas the common African species A. heimii includes both homothallic and bipolar (unifactorial) heterothallic isolates (Mohammed and Guillaumin, 1993; Guillaumin et al., 1994 ). The subspecies A.mellea ssp. nipponica which has been reported from Japan and from tropical Africa is homothallic in both areas ( Cha and Igarashi, 1995b , Abomo-Ndongo et al., 1997; Ota et al., 1998b ). Another homothallic Armillaria taxon has been reported from southern China (K Korhonen, personal communication).Compatible matings in heterothallic species result in the appearance of a crusty mycelium, the diploidy of which has been demonstrated by various methods ( Korhonen and Hintikka, 1974 ; Anderson and Ullrich, 1982a; Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ). The karyological evolution of the tissues of the basidiome is complex and remains questionable; it is likely that in many cases, a somatic haploidization occurs in the sterile parts of the basidiome ( Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ); this haploidization results in a genetic recombination in the young basidiome mimiking a meiosis (Peabody and Peabody, 2000; Grillo et al., 2000 ). Nevertheless, the normal meiosis also exists in the basidium; thus, a double recombination process is likely to take place in the cycle of certain heterothallic Armillaria species. These species (A. tabescens, A. gallica, A. ostoyae and most of the North American species) have dikaryotic, clamped cells in the subhymenium

 Nevertheless, the normal meiosis also exists in the basidium; thus, a double recombination process is likely to take place in the cycle of certain heterothallic Armillaria species. These species (A. tabescens, A. gallica, A. ostoyae and most of the North American species) have dikaryotic, clamped cells in the subhymenium and at the base of the basidia, while others (A. mellea, A. luteobubalina and the other Australasian species) have not.The karyological cycle of the homothallic species is another open problem. The vegetative mycelium is probably also diploid in these species ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). In this case, the mycelium originating from the germination of a single spore could be directly infectious. In the case of the subspecies A. mellea ssp. nipponica, according to Ota et al. (1998b) , homothallism results from a fusion of the postmeiotic nuclei in the basidium, followed by migration to the basidiospores of the diploid nuclei resulting from this fusion.Diploid-haploid matings (the Buller phenomenon) take place both in tetrapolar species ( Korhonen, 1978 ) and in the bipolar isolates of A. heimii ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). This phenomenon is the basis of the most common method used for identification of the European and North American Armillaria species and is sometimes referred to as Korhonen&apos;s method (see Diagnostic Methods).Basis of PathogenicityDestruction of bark, sap wood and heart wood is caused mainly by enzymatic activities: pectinases, cellulases, hemicellulases, peroxidases and laccase (Wahlström et al

 Armillaria species and is sometimes referred to as Korhonen&apos;s method (see Diagnostic Methods).Basis of PathogenicityDestruction of bark, sap wood and heart wood is caused mainly by enzymatic activities: pectinases, cellulases, hemicellulases, peroxidases and laccase (Wahlström et al., 1991; Robene-Soustrade, 1993 ; Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ). Some of these enzymatic activities (especially laccase and polygalacturonase) are mainly detected in just-infected or just dying roots and seem particularly involved in the infection process, while other activities (CM-cellulase, b-glucosidase and b-xylosidase) are linked to the saprophytic decay of wood caused by saprophytic species and by parasitic species in the late stages of the disease ( Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ).Although the Armillaria species are known to synthesize several toxins belonging to the sesquiterpene group ( Donnelly et al., 1990 ; Peipp and Sonnenbichler, 1992 ), most authors consider that these toxins (in contrast to the case of Rosellinia necatrix) do not play a major role in the disease.InfectionThe infection process has been reviewed by Rykowski (1975, 1980) and by Morrison et al. (1991) . All authors agree that the basidiospores play no direct role in the parasitic phase of the cycle. Infection concerns only the large or middle roots, which are lignified and suberized. It can proceed according to two different mechanisms: by contact between a sound root and a subterranean rhizomorph, or by contact between a sound root and an infected root or piece of dead wood colonized by the fungus.Infect

ores play no direct role in the parasitic phase of the cycle. Infection concerns only the large or middle roots, which are lignified and suberized. It can proceed according to two different mechanisms: by contact between a sound root and a subterranean rhizomorph, or by contact between a sound root and an infected root or piece of dead wood colonized by the fungus.Infection through the subterranean rhizomorph has been described by Day (1927) , Thomas (1934) and Guillaumin and Rykowski (1980) . The general scheme is the same for conifers and hardwoods: in their growth through the soil, the subterranean rhizomorphs come into contact with roots to which they attach themselves by means of mucilage and produce short branches, the &apos;infection cones&apos;, which directly enter the root bark. After penetration has occurred, the infection cone separates into individual hyphae which colonize the bark. A second aggregation phase then occurs in the cambium, giving rise to the mycelial fans and flat subcortical rhizomorphs. No wound is required for such a penetration: in an experiment of Guillaumin and Pierson (1976) the rate of success of artificial infections on Prunus mahaleb was decreased when the host was wounded.This &apos;classical&apos; mode of infection is very common for A. mellea and A. ostoyae; it is probably more rare for A. luteobubalina and A. heimii and cannot exist with A. tabescens where subterranean rhizomorphs are not observed in nature.Infection by direct contact between a diseased root (or a colonized wood fragment) and a living root probably concerns all five species: it was first described by Zeller (1926) . The process is less precisely understood, but could involve preliminary

 and A. heimii and cannot exist with A. tabescens where subterranean rhizomorphs are not observed in nature.Infection by direct contact between a diseased root (or a colonized wood fragment) and a living root probably concerns all five species: it was first described by Zeller (1926) . The process is less precisely understood, but could involve preliminary degradation of the outer layers of the root by enzymatic and/or toxic activities. According to Morrison et al. (1991) , in conifers, the first step of infection could consist of external proliferation of the fungus between the outer scales of the root.Whatever the mode of infection, as soon as the fungus has reached the cambium, it begins to grow rapidly in both directions (to the root end and to the collar) by means of mycelial fans and subcortical white rhizomorphs.DisseminationTwo kinds of dissemination occur: short-range dissemination through vegetative structures and long-range dissemination by basidiospores.In short-range dissemination, the fungus spreads partly through the growth of the subterranean rhizomorphs in soil ( Redfern, 1973 ) and partly by mycelium, mycelial fans and subcortical rhizomorphs growing in the living roots or in the dead wood.Dissemination by subterranean rhizomorphs is particularly efficient for species of the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; (A. gallica, A. cepistipes, A. sinapina, etc.) which behave as saprophytes or opportunists. The long, thick, perennial rhizomorphs of these species are well adapted for finding and invading stumps and buried wood. As shown by Mohammed (1987) , the subterranean rhizomorphs of the aggressive species (for instance A. mellea) are more fragile and short lived; their

. sinapina, etc.) which behave as saprophytes or opportunists. The long, thick, perennial rhizomorphs of these species are well adapted for finding and invading stumps and buried wood. As shown by Mohammed (1987) , the subterranean rhizomorphs of the aggressive species (for instance A. mellea) are more fragile and short lived; their main role is in infection, not in dissemination.Whatever the process, the vegetative dissemination in Armillaria species is very efficient; it results in the formation of large homogeneous genotypes (also named &apos;clones&apos; or &apos;genets&apos;). A genet of A. gallica described in Michigan occupied a minimum of 15 ha and was aged 1500 years ( Smith et al., 1992 ). More recently, an even larger genet of A. ostoyae was found in eastern Oregon (T Dreisbach, USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, personal communication, 2000). It covered 800 ha and its calculated age was at least 2400 years. This genet can be regarded as the biggest living individual ever detected in the world. Hodnett and Anderson (2000) have shown that, despite their age, these large clones are genetically completely homogeneous.In long-range dissemination, the basidiospores of Armillaria are transported by wind and probably also by other agents. In contrast to vegetative dissemination, dissemination by basidiospores creates new genotypes. Germination of a basidiospore gives rise to a haploid mycelium which is probably short-lived unless it is diploidized by another compatible haploid mycelium, or by a diploid mycelium (the Buller phenomenon).It is probable that new foci established on first-rotation forests originate from basidiospores ( Rishbeth, 1988 , 1991). However, the site of

 rise to a haploid mycelium which is probably short-lived unless it is diploidized by another compatible haploid mycelium, or by a diploid mycelium (the Buller phenomenon).It is probable that new foci established on first-rotation forests originate from basidiospores ( Rishbeth, 1988 , 1991). However, the site of germination of basidiospores and the establishment of new diploid genotypes is not clearly known. By analogy with Heterobasidion annosum, it was thought to be the surface of cut stumps. However, Rishbeth (1964) failed to obtain regular germination of the basidiospores on stumps. Legrand et al. (1996) showed that stump removal does not prevent the appearence of numerous new genotypes on a stand submitted to clear felling.Whatever the exact site of formation of the new diploids, it is of importance for the epidemiologist to appreciate the respective role of vegetative and sexual dissemination for a given Armillaria species and and in a given environment. More than 25 papers since the pioneering work of Korhonen (1978) on studies using the tools of population genetics: various methods including Somatic Incompatibility (SI) and the molecular or non-molecular markers have been used in order to map the teritories of the genets. The results obtained were diverse, even within the same Armillaria species: the genet of A. ostoyae of 800 ha found is eastern Oregon probably represents an extreme situation when sexual reproduction is completely inhibited. The opposite situation has been described for the same Armillaria species by Legrand et al. (1996) who found 38 genets on a stand ot 4 ha (average area of one genet: <500 m²).SurvivalThe fungus is essentially preserved as mycelial masses in the dead wood buried in the

The opposite situation has been described for the same Armillaria species by Legrand et al. (1996) who found 38 genets on a stand ot 4 ha (average area of one genet: <500 m²).SurvivalThe fungus is essentially preserved as mycelial masses in the dead wood buried in the soil; heart wood is colonized after sap wood and is slowly decomposed. Heart wood is often compartmentalized by zone lines which protect the mycelium against drying and antagonistic organisms. The period of conservation of the fungus depends mainly on the size of the wood fragments. On entire stumps, fungal survival can be estimated at several decades: for example, 40 years on English oak stumps according to Rishbeth (1972) , 20 years on east African hardwoods according to Swift (1972) . The fungus can also survive as mycelium in latent cortical necroses on living roots of symptomless trees ( Whitney et al., 1989 ; Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).The mycelium preserved in stumps or in latent necroses can initiate new subterranean rhizomorphs or infect living roots directly by contact.The large subterranean rhizomorphs of &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; species can probably survive for several years and so play a role in inoculum conservation. However, the species of this subgroup are only weak pathogens.EcologyThe prevailing role of woody inoculumThe characteristics of woody inoculum (volume, age, nature and distribution of dead wood in soil) are the main epidemiological factors and are largely responsible for the evolution of the disease following planting. Three situations are especially risky.The first is when planting follows recent deforestation or shrub clearance. Even if no symptoms of Armillaria root rot have been detected on the trees constituting the natural vegetation, their roots can

y inoculum (volume, age, nature and distribution of dead wood in soil) are the main epidemiological factors and are largely responsible for the evolution of the disease following planting. Three situations are especially risky.The first is when planting follows recent deforestation or shrub clearance. Even if no symptoms of Armillaria root rot have been detected on the trees constituting the natural vegetation, their roots can carry latent necroses from which the fungus can colonize the entire root system after cutting of the tree ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ). However, the type of tree removed is of importance; hardwoods, especially Quercus species, appear to be particularly hazardous even when they are followed by conifers ( Rishbeth, 1972 ; Rykowski, 1985). A. ostoyae as a parasite is mostly aggressive to conifers, but as a saprophyte it can also colonize hardwood stumps and the mycelial survival and rhizomorph production are generally higher from hardwoods. In tropical arboriculture, the risk for woody plantations depends on the volume of wood left in the soil after deforestation and the small indigenous plantations which cannot use important means to uproot the stumps are often more hazardous ( Onsando et al., 1997 ).The second situation is when a new plantation succeeds a previous plantation, especially if the two woody species involved are susceptible to the same Armillaria species.The third is if the plantation is sited on the banks of a river subject to flooding (wood carried in the current is deposited and buried together with alluvions).In forest management, thinning and cutting often play an essential role: the first damage by Armillaria can be triggered by precommercial thinning or by the first commercial cuttings ( Morrison and Mallett, 1996 ).Weak or equilibrium parasitism and predispositionSpecies of Armillaria are a natural component of the mycoflora of forests worldwide.

 buried together with alluvions).In forest management, thinning and cutting often play an essential role: the first damage by Armillaria can be triggered by precommercial thinning or by the first commercial cuttings ( Morrison and Mallett, 1996 ).Weak or equilibrium parasitism and predispositionSpecies of Armillaria are a natural component of the mycoflora of forests worldwide. In most cases, they do not cause important damage in these natural forests. They behave as wood decomposers (particularly the species belonging to the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos;) and weak necrotrophic pathogens, infecting and killing trees which are suppressed or stressed by diverse factors ( Kile et al., 1991 ). Delatour and Guillaumin (1985) distinguished three ecological categories among the agents of the root rots of trees: (i) the primary parasites which can be lethal in the absence of any predisposing factor; (ii) the equilibrium parasites (saprophytes which can become parasites and pathogenic if the host is enfeebled by certain factors) and (iii) the heart-rot agents. The parasites belonging to the last two categories have inferior pathogenic capacities. These three categories can be found among the Armillaria species. For instance, A. gallica generally belongs to type (ii), whilst A. borealis and A. cepistipes often belong to type (iii) on conifers.The five species described here in detail (A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina, A. tabescens and A. heimii) are those which commonly act as primary pathogens. However, in the presence of fairly resistant hosts, they can also behave as equilibrium parasites or heart-rot agents. For instance, A. mellea is currently a primary pathogen on orchard trees and grapevines, an equilibrium pathogen on

. luteobubalina, A. tabescens and A. heimii) are those which commonly act as primary pathogens. However, in the presence of fairly resistant hosts, they can also behave as equilibrium parasites or heart-rot agents. For instance, A. mellea is currently a primary pathogen on orchard trees and grapevines, an equilibrium pathogen on adult Quercus species and a heart-rot agent on poplars. Wargo and Harrington (1991) have reviewed the numerous factors which can act as stresses and thus induce equilibrium parasitism by Armillaria species. These factors can be abiotic (drought, excess of water responsible for anaerobic soil conditions, nutrient deficiencies, air pollution) or biotic (defoliators, sap-sucking insects, bark-infesting beetles, dwarf mistletoe ( Byler, 1978 ), fungal diseases of foliage). An excessive density of stock can also favour the disease by increasing the competition between the trees: thus, insufficient thinning can be favourable to the disease for physiological reasons while excess of thinning can have the same result for epidemiological reasons (by increasing the inoculum potential). The equilibrium point can be very variable function of the host and environment: for example, Rosso and Hansen (1998) showed that on Douglas fir in the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, the impact of A. ostoyae was linked to epidemiological factors, but not to tree vigour. The results could be very different in other ecosystems.Weak or equilibrium parasitism in Armillaria was studied by Wargo in the north-eastern USA, where colonization of hardwood trees (Acer saccharum and Quercus species) by Armillaria species is generally triggered by insect defoliation ( Wargo, 1980 , 1981). One effect of the stress is to enfeeble the host root defences against the fungus. The latent necroses, which are frequent on the

 studied by Wargo in the north-eastern USA, where colonization of hardwood trees (Acer saccharum and Quercus species) by Armillaria species is generally triggered by insect defoliation ( Wargo, 1980 , 1981). One effect of the stress is to enfeeble the host root defences against the fungus. The latent necroses, which are frequent on the root systems of many adult trees, probably play an important role in this restart of fungal growth in the roots; the mycelium confined in the necrosis is still alive and can then break the wound periderms ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).Wargo (1972, 1975, 1980, 1984) has tried to analyse the biochemical ways through which the different stresses enhance the susceptibility of the hosts to Armillaria species. According to this author, several mechanisms can be involved, including hydrolysis of the starch of roots which provides the fungus with soluble sugars, disturbance of phenolic synthesis by the host, and decrease in the efficiency of the host enzymes which decay the wall of the fungal cells.Of course, most of the weakening factors which trigger equilibrium parasitism can also play a role in cases of primary parasitism by modifying the balance between fungal pathogenicity and the host&apos;s responses.Ecological requirements of Armillaria speciesThe European Armillaria species have different temperature requirements ( Mohammed, 1987 ) which can explain their different distributions concerning latitude and altitude ( Guillaumin et al., 1993 ). For instance, A. ostoyae is less thermophilic than A. mellea (their optimal temperatures for growth are 21 and 23°C, respectively) and can be found in Europe at higher latitudes and altitudes than A. mellea.

 is less thermophilic than A. mellea (their optimal temperatures for growth are 21 and 23°C, respectively) and can be found in Europe at higher latitudes and altitudes than A. mellea. However, A. mellea is less thermophilic than A. tabescens.The same ecological differences between the three species can be observed in North America ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Armillaria root rot is found in all soil types. Contrary to some presumptions, it is not restricted to heavy or damp soils, or to those with a particular pH. However, differences exist between the species concerning the optimal pH range for growth of subterranean rhizomorphs: it is generally accepted ( Morrison, 1974 ; Guillaumin and Lung-Escarmant, 1985 ) that the growth of the rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae is higher in acidic soils whereas A. mellea and A. gallica have a preference for neutral pH.Contrary to some presumptions, converging results indicate that Armillaria rot rot is generally more severe on sandy soils than on clayey soils ( Wiensczyk et al., 1997 ; Mallett and Maynard, 1998 ) however, the incidence of soil texture could be indirect, through an effect on host resistance.The importance of the microbiological environment on growth and pathogenicity of Armillaria species is just beginning to be suspected. It is well known that certain microfungi of the rhizosphere of large roots (for example, Trichoderma species) are antagonistic to Armillarias. Kwasna (1996, 1997) has shown that other fungi, especially members of the Zygomycetes, behave as synergists for Armillaria species: the composition of the rhizosphere and its evolution could play an important role in the development of the rhizomorphs outside the root and their penetration into it.

Kwasna (1996, 1997) has shown that other fungi, especially members of the Zygomycetes, behave as synergists for Armillaria species: the composition of the rhizosphere and its evolution could play an important role in the development of the rhizomorphs outside the root and their penetration into it.
 Sintomas: Symptoms on FoliageArmillaria species cause root and collar rot of trees. Infection of a root system does not immediately result in the appearance of symptoms on the aerial part. These only begin to show when the collar is attacked or when several large roots are destroyed. Depending on the age and susceptibility of the host, Armillaria species and isolate, and the environmental conditions, the rate of development of the disease may be progressive (decline) or the tree may die suddenly (apoplexy) ( Guillaumin, 1977 ; Guillaumin et al., 1982 ; Morrison et al., 1991 ).In the case of slow decline, the main symptoms are a reduction of shoot growth, changes in foliage characteristics (foliage becomes stunted, chlorotic and sparse). The leaves can wilt (on fruit trees), fall prematurely or show abnormal colorations (especially on grapevines) in autumn. Then all foliage can turn yellow or sometimes brown (in conifers), or droop. In eucalypts attacked by A. luteobubalina, disease development results in a dead top of mature trees ( Pearce et al., 1986 ). On fruit trees and grapevines &apos;en gobelet&apos;, asymmetric infection of the root system frequently results in death of only one main branch.Disease development can be more rapid (apoplexy): the trees or shrubs can wilt suddenly, sometimes without having shown any previous symptoms. This death often occurs in a period of water stress, or at

 fruit trees and grapevines &apos;en gobelet&apos;, asymmetric infection of the root system frequently results in death of only one main branch.Disease development can be more rapid (apoplexy): the trees or shrubs can wilt suddenly, sometimes without having shown any previous symptoms. This death often occurs in a period of water stress, or at the first onset of fruiting. The trees often respond to infection by an abnormally heavy blooming or fruit production ( Rhoads, 1956 ).In most cases, the disease extends in patches, the dead or dying plants being grouped in foci, surrounded by declining trees.Symptoms on the Basal StemIn the final stages of fungal infection, the mycelial fans of the fungus colonizing the roots reach the level of the collar and can grow up in the trunk for some decimetres or more. Sometimes spectacular, these fans are easily detected by stripping the bark of the base of the tree. In some cases, the fungus can destroy the bark and the mycelial fans are visible outside.Trees attacked by species of Armillaria frequently exhibit cracks or cankers, or produce exudates at the base of the trunk ( Morrison et al., 1991 ). The longitudinal cracks are particularly frequent on tropical trees (cocoa, coffee, etc.). Armillaria disease of cocoa, described by Dade as early as 1927, was named &apos;collar crack&apos; by this author. The cracks are probably due to the mechanical pressure exerted on bark by the fungal fans colonizing the cambium; these fans are particularly thick for the African species A. heimii.The presence of basal cankers, which are generally triangular, means that progression of the fungus has been stopped locally: callusing occurs around the margin of the lesion. This symptom has been occasionally reported from hardwood trees (birch, beech,

 bark by the fungal fans colonizing the cambium; these fans are particularly thick for the African species A. heimii.The presence of basal cankers, which are generally triangular, means that progression of the fungus has been stopped locally: callusing occurs around the margin of the lesion. This symptom has been occasionally reported from hardwood trees (birch, beech, cork oak) infected by A. mellea ( Guillaumin, 1986 ).The production of resin at the collar is a common response of Abietaceae, especially pines, attacked by A. ostoyae or A. heimii ( Gibson, 1960 ; Hintikka, 1974 ; Rykowski; 1975). Production of gums is sometimes observed at the base of citrus ( Rhoads, 1948 ) and is common on stone-fruits attacked by A. mellea ( Guillaumin et al., 1982 ). Latex exudes from rubber trees when the collar is reached by A. heimii ( Petit-Renaud, 1991 ) and &apos;kino&apos; from eucalypts attacked by A. luteobubalina ( Edgar et al., 1976 ).Symptoms on RootsThe bark of the roots is brown, softish and often fissured. With A. mellea, reddish tufts of mycelium sometimes appear through the cracks.The main symptom is the presence at the level of the cambium of white, thick, mycelial fans, sometimes constituting a continuous mycelial tube. This muff is somewhat less developed and continuous in the case of A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ). The fans are frequently perforated in A. luteobubalina ( Kile and Old, 1982 ) and A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Depending on the Armillaria species involved, the roots are

 a continuous mycelial tube. This muff is somewhat less developed and continuous in the case of A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ). The fans are frequently perforated in A. luteobubalina ( Kile and Old, 1982 ) and A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Depending on the Armillaria species involved, the roots are sometimes surrounded by subterranean rhizomorphs 1-2 mm in diameter and varying in colour from black to mahogany: these external rhizomorphs are very frequent when the species involved belongs to the &apos;gallica group&apos; (A. gallica, A. sinapina, etc.). However, these species are generally weak pathogens and their pathogenicity is limited. External rhizomorphs are fairly common with A. ostoyae; they are rather rare with A. mellea, A. heimii and A. luteobubalina; they are never observed with A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Armillaria Infection without SymptomsArmillaria can be an agent of heartwood decay (heart rot). Heart rot of trees is often due to weakly aggressive Armillaria species, for instance A. borealis or A. cepistipes on conifers in northern Europe ( Roll-Hansen, 1985 ). However, even the aggressive species can behave as heart-rot agents on tolerant tree species, as is sometimes the case with A. mellea on beech or poplars ( Guillaumin, 1986 ). This localization of the fungus does not provoke symptoms, except an enhanced susceptibility to windthrow.Infection without symptoms can also occur in the case of latent infections on the roots of young, healthy trees. Armillaria infections are often stopped by the host reactions. The fungus remains alive and constitutes a &apos;latent infection&apos

 poplars ( Guillaumin, 1986 ). This localization of the fungus does not provoke symptoms, except an enhanced susceptibility to windthrow.Infection without symptoms can also occur in the case of latent infections on the roots of young, healthy trees. Armillaria infections are often stopped by the host reactions. The fungus remains alive and constitutes a &apos;latent infection&apos; limited in area and showing no evolution. However, these latent infections (the number of which increases with time) can resume their evolution and colonize the root system if the tree is weakened by age or environment ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).Infestation by an unidentified species of Armillaria was reported in Germany on fir logs during long-term storage under water sprinklers ( Gross et al., 1996 ).
 Organos afectados: Abelia grandiflora (Glossy abelia), Caprifoliaceae, Other, 
 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology OntogenyThe different organs initiated by the fungus in nature are described below. Species of Armillaria have no known asexual spores, but are able to differentiate a variety of vegetative structures, both in nature and in vitro.RhizomorphsLike Garrett (1956) many authors distinguish the rhizomorphs from the mycelial cords and reserve the name rhizomorph for highly differentiated organs with apical growth. The subterranean rhizomorphs of many species of Armillaria (the &apos;rhizomorpha subterranea&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ) fall into this category. These organs show "the most highly differentiated vegetative tissues of fungi" ( Garraway et al., 1991 ), with a peripheral cortex, a living medulla, a central canal containing gas and an apical meristem ( Motta, 1969 ; Garraway et al., 1991 ). This organ plays an important

&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ) fall into this category. These organs show "the most highly differentiated vegetative tissues of fungi" ( Garraway et al., 1991 ), with a peripheral cortex, a living medulla, a central canal containing gas and an apical meristem ( Motta, 1969 ; Garraway et al., 1991 ). This organ plays an important role in infection, dissemination, search for and colonization of woody substrates in soil (see Epidemiology).The subterranean rhizomorph takes up and transports nutrients, water and oxygen ( Smith and Griffin, 1971 ). The transport of nutrients has been studied by different experiments with radiolabelled elements (Anderson and Ullrich, 1982b and others); it appears to be bidirectional, but is mostly acropetal, which allows the woody food-base from which the rhizomorph originates to feed the growing apex. It is also likely that, at least in A. gallica and A. cepistipes, the rhizomorphic system can grow without any food-base, by internal reallocation of metabolites ( Mohammed, 1987 ).The different species have a very different capacity for rhizomorph growthand development: the saprophytic species of the &apos;gallica group&apos; (A. gallica,A. sinapina, A. cepistipes) produce strong, fast-growing, long-livingrhizomorphs.The rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina growmore slowly. In addition, the rhizomorphs of A. mellea are short-living andoften difficult to detect in field, though they play a major role in infection.

lea, A. luteobubalina growmore slowly. In addition, the rhizomorphs of A. mellea are short-living andoften difficult to detect in field, though they play a major role in infection. A. tabescens does not produce rhizomorphs in nature but it does in pure culture. The African species A. heimii produces rhizomorphs only in cool environments at high altitudes. Differences for this trait were also reported within a species; they account for a part of variability in the pathogenicity of individual genotypes.Mycelial fans and cordsIn conditions of abundant nutrition, especially in the living plant, the fungus initiates flat, white, poorly differentiated, aggregated organs, which have received different names: subcortical rhizomorphs (the &apos;rhizomorpha subcorticalis&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ), mycelial cords and mycelial fans. Their general shape can be more or less linear (cords) or isodiametric (fans) according to the host and the localization. Essentially these organs assume a function of nutrition from the living host or the dead wood.In vitro studies have shown that the rhizomorphs and the fans have the same origin: within certain genetic limits, it is possible to transform fans into differentiated rhizomorphs or vice versa by manipulating the composition of the culture medium.Zone linesMany wood-destroying fungi, including Armillaria species, form dark lines in dead wood. These lines (zone lines or pseudosclerotia) are actually dark surfaces which divide the colonized wood into different, more or less independent, volumes. These surfaces are made of dead, melanized, contiguous isodiametric cells. The phenomenon has nothing to do with &apos;compartmentalization&apos;, a resistance process of trees analysed by Shigo

 wood. These lines (zone lines or pseudosclerotia) are actually dark surfaces which divide the colonized wood into different, more or less independent, volumes. These surfaces are made of dead, melanized, contiguous isodiametric cells. The phenomenon has nothing to do with &apos;compartmentalization&apos;, a resistance process of trees analysed by Shigo and Tippett (1981) .The physiological conditions of zone-line formation in Armillaria species have been studied by several authors ( Campbell, 1934 ; Lopez-Real and Swift, 1975 ). These organs are mainly found in the heart wood; they are linked to a saprophytic phase of substrate exploitation which begins several weeks after infection.XylostromasIn A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1956 ) and A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), the cankers and cracks at the surface of the roots or the collar are often occupied by fungal dark crusts which probably originate from melanization of cambial mycelial fans. These organs are less evident in the other three species which are studied here.Fruit bodiesBasidiomata in species of Armillaria usually appear late in the infection process, most often on dead trees or on stumps. However, it is not uncommon to observe fruit bodies of A. mellea or A. ostoyae in the autumn at the bases of infected trees which are still alive.Different species of Armillaria have very different propensities to fruit in the field. A. tabescens and A. ostoyae fruit rather commonly in nature ( Rhoads, 1956 ), whereas the appearance of fruit bodies is a rare event for the African A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), although this species fruits easily in the laboratory.Sexual Systems and the Karyological CycleThe sexual and karyological problems in species of Armillaria have been summarized by Gu

(1991a) but new outstanding results have been obtained since this date. The Armillaria group is unique amongst Basidiomycetes in that the secondary mycelium (formed after mating of two compatible haploid mycelia) is diploid and not dikaryotic. This characteristic seems to be common to all the species of the genus which have been studied to date. The existence of a double genetic recombination in the cycle of at least certain Armillaria species could be another characteristic of the genus.The karyological cycle in species of Armillaria remained a mystery until 1973. Early researchers ( Kniep, 1911 ; Kühner, 1946 ) had observed that hyphal cells are monokaryotic, irrespective of their origin (a single basidiospore, basidioma tissue or vegetative material). Hintikka (1973) was the first to observe a macromorphological difference between the haploid monospore isolates (of fluffy appearence) and the diploid cultures from basidioma tissue (flat and crustose); he established that the species he was studying (probably A. borealis) had a bifactorial (or tetrapolar) sexual incompatibility system. Korhonen (1978) , Ullrich and Anderson (1978) , Anderson (1982) , Guillaumin et al. (1983) , Kile (1983) , Guillaumin (1986) and Kile and Watling (1988) showed that this is also the case for all

 borealis) had a bifactorial (or tetrapolar) sexual incompatibility system. Korhonen (1978) , Ullrich and Anderson (1978) , Anderson (1982) , Guillaumin et al. (1983) , Kile (1983) , Guillaumin (1986) and Kile and Watling (1988) showed that this is also the case for all the Armillaria species of the temperate areas (Europe, North America and Australasia), the only exception being A. ectypa, a rare species of European peat bogs ( Guillaumin, 1973 ; Zolciak et al., 1997 ).By contrast, the tropical species of Armillaria which have been studied to date do not appear to be tetrapolar: A. puiggarii from the West Indies is homothallic whereas the common African species A. heimii includes both homothallic and bipolar (unifactorial) heterothallic isolates (Mohammed and Guillaumin, 1993; Guillaumin et al., 1994 ). The subspecies A.mellea ssp. nipponica which has been reported from Japan and from tropical Africa is homothallic in both areas ( Cha and Igarashi, 1995b , Abomo-Ndongo et al., 1997; Ota et al., 1998b ). Another homothallic Armillaria taxon has been reported from southern China (K Korhonen, personal communication).Compatible matings in heterothallic species result in the appearance of a crusty mycelium, the diploidy of which has been demonstrated by various methods ( Korhonen and Hintikka, 1974 ; Anderson and Ullrich, 1982a; Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ). The karyological evolution of the tissues of the basidiome is complex and remains questionable; it is likely that in many cases, a somatic haploidization

celium, the diploidy of which has been demonstrated by various methods ( Korhonen and Hintikka, 1974 ; Anderson and Ullrich, 1982a; Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ). The karyological evolution of the tissues of the basidiome is complex and remains questionable; it is likely that in many cases, a somatic haploidization occurs in the sterile parts of the basidiome ( Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ); this haploidization results in a genetic recombination in the young basidiome mimiking a meiosis (Peabody and Peabody, 2000; Grillo et al., 2000 ). Nevertheless, the normal meiosis also exists in the basidium; thus, a double recombination process is likely to take place in the cycle of certain heterothallic Armillaria species. These species (A. tabescens, A. gallica, A. ostoyae and most of the North American species) have dikaryotic, clamped cells in the subhymenium and at the base of the basidia, while others (A. mellea, A. luteobubalina and the other Australasian species) have not.The karyological cycle of the homothallic species is another open problem. The vegetative mycelium is probably also diploid in these species ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). In this case, the mycelium originating from the germination of a single spore could be directly infectious. In the case of the subspecies A. mellea ssp. nipponica, according to Ota et al. (1998b) , homothallism results from a fusion of the postmeiotic nuclei in the basidium, followed by migration to the basidiospores of the diploid nuclei resulting from this fusion.Diploid-haploid matings

 the case of the subspecies A. mellea ssp. nipponica, according to Ota et al. (1998b) , homothallism results from a fusion of the postmeiotic nuclei in the basidium, followed by migration to the basidiospores of the diploid nuclei resulting from this fusion.Diploid-haploid matings (the Buller phenomenon) take place both in tetrapolar species ( Korhonen, 1978 ) and in the bipolar isolates of A. heimii ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). This phenomenon is the basis of the most common method used for identification of the European and North American Armillaria species and is sometimes referred to as Korhonen&apos;s method (see Diagnostic Methods).Basis of PathogenicityDestruction of bark, sap wood and heart wood is caused mainly by enzymatic activities: pectinases, cellulases, hemicellulases, peroxidases and laccase (Wahlström et al., 1991; Robene-Soustrade, 1993 ; Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ). Some of these enzymatic activities (especially laccase and polygalacturonase) are mainly detected in just-infected or just dying roots and seem particularly involved in the infection process, while other activities (CM-cellulase, b-glucosidase and b-xylosidase) are linked to the saprophytic decay of wood caused by saprophytic species and by parasitic species in the late stages of the disease ( Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ).Although the Armillaria species are known to synthesize several toxins belonging to the sesquiterpene group ( Donnelly et al., 1990 ; Peipp and Sonnenbichler, 1992 ), most authors consider that these

 of wood caused by saprophytic species and by parasitic species in the late stages of the disease ( Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ).Although the Armillaria species are known to synthesize several toxins belonging to the sesquiterpene group ( Donnelly et al., 1990 ; Peipp and Sonnenbichler, 1992 ), most authors consider that these toxins (in contrast to the case of Rosellinia necatrix) do not play a major role in the disease.InfectionThe infection process has been reviewed by Rykowski (1975, 1980) and by Morrison et al. (1991) . All authors agree that the basidiospores play no direct role in the parasitic phase of the cycle. Infection concerns only the large or middle roots, which are lignified and suberized. It can proceed according to two different mechanisms: by contact between a sound root and a subterranean rhizomorph, or by contact between a sound root and an infected root or piece of dead wood colonized by the fungus.Infection through the subterranean rhizomorph has been described by Day (1927) , Thomas (1934) and Guillaumin and Rykowski (1980) . The general scheme is the same for conifers and hardwoods: in their growth through the soil, the subterranean rhizomorphs come into contact with roots to which they attach themselves by means of mucilage and produce short branches, the &apos;infection cones&apos;, which directly enter the root bark. After penetration has occurred, the infection cone separates into individual hyphae which colonize the bark. A second aggregation phase then occurs in the cambium, giving rise to the mycelial fans and flat subcortical rhizomorphs. No wound is required for such a penetration: in an experiment of Guillaumin and Pierson (1976) the rate of success of

 bark. After penetration has occurred, the infection cone separates into individual hyphae which colonize the bark. A second aggregation phase then occurs in the cambium, giving rise to the mycelial fans and flat subcortical rhizomorphs. No wound is required for such a penetration: in an experiment of Guillaumin and Pierson (1976) the rate of success of artificial infections on Prunus mahaleb was decreased when the host was wounded.This &apos;classical&apos; mode of infection is very common for A. mellea and A. ostoyae; it is probably more rare for A. luteobubalina and A. heimii and cannot exist with A. tabescens where subterranean rhizomorphs are not observed in nature.Infection by direct contact between a diseased root (or a colonized wood fragment) and a living root probably concerns all five species: it was first described by Zeller (1926) . The process is less precisely understood, but could involve preliminary degradation of the outer layers of the root by enzymatic and/or toxic activities. According to Morrison et al. (1991) , in conifers, the first step of infection could consist of external proliferation of the fungus between the outer scales of the root.Whatever the mode of infection, as soon as the fungus has reached the cambium, it begins to grow rapidly in both directions (to the root end and to the collar) by means of mycelial fans and subcortical white rhizomorphs.DisseminationTwo kinds of dissemination occur: short-range dissemination through vegetative structures and long-range dissemination by basidiospores.In short-range dissemination, the fungus spreads partly through the growth of the subterranean rhizomorphs in soil ( Redfern, 1973 ) and partly by mycelium, mycelial fans and subc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ortical white rhizomorphs.DisseminationTwo kinds of dissemination occur: short-range dissemination through vegetative structures and long-range dissemination by basidiospores.In short-range dissemination, the fungus spreads partly through the growth of the subterranean rhizomorphs in soil ( Redfern, 1973 ) and partly by mycelium, mycelial fans and subcortical rhizomorphs growing in the living roots or in the dead wood.Dissemination by subterranean rhizomorphs is particularly efficient for species of the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; (A. gallica, A. cepistipes, A. sinapina, etc.) which behave as saprophytes or opportunists. The long, thick, perennial rhizomorphs of these species are well adapted for finding and invading stumps and buried wood. As shown by Mohammed (1987) , the subterranean rhizomorphs of the aggressive species (for instance A. mellea) are more fragile and short lived; their main role is in infection, not in dissemination.Whatever the process, the vegetative dissemination in Armillaria species is very efficient; it results in the formation of large homogeneous genotypes (also named &apos;clones&apos; or &apos;genets&apos;). A genet of A. gallica described in Michigan occupied a minimum of 15 ha and was aged 1500 years ( Smith et al., 1992 ). More recently, an even larger genet of A. ostoyae was found in eastern Oregon (T Dreisbach, USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, personal communication, 2000). It covered 800 ha and its calculated age was at least 2400 years. This genet can be regarded as the biggest living individual ever detected in the world. Hodnett and Anderson (2000) have shown that, despite their age, these large

 of A. ostoyae was found in eastern Oregon (T Dreisbach, USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, personal communication, 2000). It covered 800 ha and its calculated age was at least 2400 years. This genet can be regarded as the biggest living individual ever detected in the world. Hodnett and Anderson (2000) have shown that, despite their age, these large clones are genetically completely homogeneous.In long-range dissemination, the basidiospores of Armillaria are transported by wind and probably also by other agents. In contrast to vegetative dissemination, dissemination by basidiospores creates new genotypes. Germination of a basidiospore gives rise to a haploid mycelium which is probably short-lived unless it is diploidized by another compatible haploid mycelium, or by a diploid mycelium (the Buller phenomenon).It is probable that new foci established on first-rotation forests originate from basidiospores ( Rishbeth, 1988 , 1991). However, the site of germination of basidiospores and the establishment of new diploid genotypes is not clearly known. By analogy with Heterobasidion annosum, it was thought to be the surface of cut stumps. However, Rishbeth (1964) failed to obtain regular germination of the basidiospores on stumps. Legrand et al. (1996) showed that stump removal does not prevent the appearence of numerous new genotypes on a stand submitted to clear felling.Whatever the exact site of formation of the new diploids, it is of importance for the epidemiologist to appreciate the respective role of vegetative and sexual dissemination for a given Armillaria species and and in a given environment.

 to clear felling.Whatever the exact site of formation of the new diploids, it is of importance for the epidemiologist to appreciate the respective role of vegetative and sexual dissemination for a given Armillaria species and and in a given environment. More than 25 papers since the pioneering work of Korhonen (1978) on studies using the tools of population genetics: various methods including Somatic Incompatibility (SI) and the molecular or non-molecular markers have been used in order to map the teritories of the genets. The results obtained were diverse, even within the same Armillaria species: the genet of A. ostoyae of 800 ha found is eastern Oregon probably represents an extreme situation when sexual reproduction is completely inhibited. The opposite situation has been described for the same Armillaria species by Legrand et al. (1996) who found 38 genets on a stand ot 4 ha (average area of one genet: <500 m²).SurvivalThe fungus is essentially preserved as mycelial masses in the dead wood buried in the soil; heart wood is colonized after sap wood and is slowly decomposed. Heart wood is often compartmentalized by zone lines which protect the mycelium against drying and antagonistic organisms. The period of conservation of the fungus depends mainly on the size of the wood fragments. On entire stumps, fungal survival can be estimated at several decades: for example, 40 years on English oak stumps according to Rishbeth (1972) , 20 years on east African hardwoods according to Swift (1972) . The fungus can also survive as mycelium in latent cortical necroses on living roots of symptomless trees ( Whitney et al., 1989 ; Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).The mycelium preserved in stumps or in latent necroses can initiate new subterranean rhizomorphs or infect living roots directly by contact.The large subterranean rh

The fungus can also survive as mycelium in latent cortical necroses on living roots of symptomless trees ( Whitney et al., 1989 ; Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).The mycelium preserved in stumps or in latent necroses can initiate new subterranean rhizomorphs or infect living roots directly by contact.The large subterranean rhizomorphs of &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; species can probably survive for several years and so play a role in inoculum conservation. However, the species of this subgroup are only weak pathogens.EcologyThe prevailing role of woody inoculumThe characteristics of woody inoculum (volume, age, nature and distribution of dead wood in soil) are the main epidemiological factors and are largely responsible for the evolution of the disease following planting. Three situations are especially risky.The first is when planting follows recent deforestation or shrub clearance. Even if no symptoms of Armillaria root rot have been detected on the trees constituting the natural vegetation, their roots can carry latent necroses from which the fungus can colonize the entire root system after cutting of the tree ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ). However, the type of tree removed is of importance; hardwoods, especially Quercus species, appear to be particularly hazardous even when they are followed by conifers ( Rishbeth, 1972 ; Rykowski, 1985). A. ostoyae as a parasite is mostly aggressive to conifers, but as a saprophyte it can also colonize hardwood stumps and the mycelial survival and rhizomorph production are generally higher from hardwoods. In tropical arboriculture, the risk for woody plantations depends on the volume of wood left in the soil after deforestation and the small indigenous plantations which cannot use important means to uproot the stumps are often more hazardous ( Onsando et al.,

phyte it can also colonize hardwood stumps and the mycelial survival and rhizomorph production are generally higher from hardwoods. In tropical arboriculture, the risk for woody plantations depends on the volume of wood left in the soil after deforestation and the small indigenous plantations which cannot use important means to uproot the stumps are often more hazardous ( Onsando et al., 1997 ).The second situation is when a new plantation succeeds a previous plantation, especially if the two woody species involved are susceptible to the same Armillaria species.The third is if the plantation is sited on the banks of a river subject to flooding (wood carried in the current is deposited and buried together with alluvions).In forest management, thinning and cutting often play an essential role: the first damage by Armillaria can be triggered by precommercial thinning or by the first commercial cuttings ( Morrison and Mallett, 1996 ).Weak or equilibrium parasitism and predispositionSpecies of Armillaria are a natural component of the mycoflora of forests worldwide. In most cases, they do not cause important damage in these natural forests. They behave as wood decomposers (particularly the species belonging to the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos;) and weak necrotrophic pathogens, infecting and killing trees which are suppressed or stressed by diverse factors ( Kile et al., 1991 ). Delatour and Guillaumin (1985) distinguished three ecological categories among the agents of the root rots of trees: (i) the primary parasites which can be lethal in the absence of any predisposing factor; (ii) the equilibrium parasites (saprophytes which can become parasites and pathogenic if the host is enfeebled by certain factors) and (iii) the heart-rot agents. The parasites belonging to the last two categories have inferior pathogenic capacities. These three categories can be found among the Armillaria species

 parasites which can be lethal in the absence of any predisposing factor; (ii) the equilibrium parasites (saprophytes which can become parasites and pathogenic if the host is enfeebled by certain factors) and (iii) the heart-rot agents. The parasites belonging to the last two categories have inferior pathogenic capacities. These three categories can be found among the Armillaria species. For instance, A. gallica generally belongs to type (ii), whilst A. borealis and A. cepistipes often belong to type (iii) on conifers.The five species described here in detail (A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina, A. tabescens and A. heimii) are those which commonly act as primary pathogens. However, in the presence of fairly resistant hosts, they can also behave as equilibrium parasites or heart-rot agents. For instance, A. mellea is currently a primary pathogen on orchard trees and grapevines, an equilibrium pathogen on adult Quercus species and a heart-rot agent on poplars. Wargo and Harrington (1991) have reviewed the numerous factors which can act as stresses and thus induce equilibrium parasitism by Armillaria species. These factors can be abiotic (drought, excess of water responsible for anaerobic soil conditions, nutrient deficiencies, air pollution) or biotic (defoliators, sap-sucking insects, bark-infesting beetles, dwarf mistletoe ( Byler, 1978 ), fungal diseases of foliage). An excessive density of stock can also favour the disease by increasing the competition between the trees: thus, insufficient thinning can be favourable to the disease for physiological reasons while excess of thinning can have the same result for epidemiological reasons (by increasing the inoculum potential). The equilibrium point can be very variable function of the host and environment: for example, Ros

 1978 ), fungal diseases of foliage). An excessive density of stock can also favour the disease by increasing the competition between the trees: thus, insufficient thinning can be favourable to the disease for physiological reasons while excess of thinning can have the same result for epidemiological reasons (by increasing the inoculum potential). The equilibrium point can be very variable function of the host and environment: for example, Rosso and Hansen (1998) showed that on Douglas fir in the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, the impact of A. ostoyae was linked to epidemiological factors, but not to tree vigour. The results could be very different in other ecosystems.Weak or equilibrium parasitism in Armillaria was studied by Wargo in the north-eastern USA, where colonization of hardwood trees (Acer saccharum and Quercus species) by Armillaria species is generally triggered by insect defoliation ( Wargo, 1980 , 1981). One effect of the stress is to enfeeble the host root defences against the fungus. The latent necroses, which are frequent on the root systems of many adult trees, probably play an important role in this restart of fungal growth in the roots; the mycelium confined in the necrosis is still alive and can then break the wound periderms ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).Wargo (1972, 1975, 1980, 1984) has tried to analyse the biochemical ways through which the different stresses enhance the susceptibility of the hosts to Armillaria species. According to this author, several mechanisms can be involved, including hydrolysis of the starch of roots which provides the fungus with soluble sugars, disturbance of phenolic synthesis by the host, and decrease in the efficiency of the host enzymes which decay the wall of the fungal cells.Of course, most of the weakening factors which trigger equilibrium parasitism can also play a role in cases of primary parasitism by modifying the balance between fungal pathogenicity

, including hydrolysis of the starch of roots which provides the fungus with soluble sugars, disturbance of phenolic synthesis by the host, and decrease in the efficiency of the host enzymes which decay the wall of the fungal cells.Of course, most of the weakening factors which trigger equilibrium parasitism can also play a role in cases of primary parasitism by modifying the balance between fungal pathogenicity and the host&apos;s responses.Ecological requirements of Armillaria speciesThe European Armillaria species have different temperature requirements ( Mohammed, 1987 ) which can explain their different distributions concerning latitude and altitude ( Guillaumin et al., 1993 ). For instance, A. ostoyae is less thermophilic than A. mellea (their optimal temperatures for growth are 21 and 23°C, respectively) and can be found in Europe at higher latitudes and altitudes than A. mellea. However, A. mellea is less thermophilic than A. tabescens.The same ecological differences between the three species can be observed in North America ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Armillaria root rot is found in all soil types. Contrary to some presumptions, it is not restricted to heavy or damp soils, or to those with a particular pH. However, differences exist between the species concerning the optimal pH range for growth of subterranean rhizomorphs: it is generally accepted ( Morrison, 1974 ; Guillaumin and Lung-Escarmant, 1985 ) that the growth of the rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae is higher in acidic soils whereas A. mellea and A. gallica have a preference for neutral pH.Contrary to some presumptions, converging results indicate that Armillaria rot rot is generally more severe on sandy soils than on clayey soils ( Wiensczyk et al., 1997 ; Mallett and Maynard, 1998 ) however, the incidence of soil texture could be indirect

It is well known that certain microfungi of the rhizosphere of large roots (for example, Trichoderma species) are antagonistic to Armillarias. Kwasna (1996, 1997) has shown that other fungi, especially members of the Zygomycetes, behave as synergists for Armillaria species: the composition of the rhizosphere and its evolution could play an important role in the development of the rhizomorphs outside the root and their penetration into it.

 Invasion: A. luteobubalina resembles A. mellea except for the size of the basidioma (smaller), colour of the pileus (dark brown with yellowish hues becoming lemon-yellow, according toPodger et al., 1978), consistency of the ring (moderately thick, floccose) and dimensions of basidiospores (slightly smaller than in A. mellea). Basidia are without clamp connections. Subcortical fans are often perforated. The morphology of the mycelial mats in culture is very close to that of A. mellea.

 Reproduccion: OntogenyThe different organs initiated by the fungus in nature are described below. Species of Armillaria have no known asexual spores, but are able to differentiate a variety of vegetative structures, both in nature and in vitro.RhizomorphsLike Garrett (1956) many authors distinguish the rhizomorphs from the mycelial cords and reserve the name rhizomorph for highly differentiated organs with apical growth. The subterranean rhizomorphs of many species of Armillaria (the &apos;rhizomorpha subterranea&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ) fall into this category. These organs show "the most highly differentiated vegetative tissues of fungi" ( Garraway et al., 1991 ), with a peripheral cortex, a living medulla, a central canal containing gas and an apical meristem ( Motta, 1969 ; Garraway et al., 1991 ). This organ plays an important role in infection, dissemination, search for and colonization of woody substrates in soil (see Epidemiology).The subterranean rhizomorph takes up and transports nutrients, water and oxygen ( Smith and Griffin, 1971 ). The transport of nutrients has been studied by different experiments with radiolabelled elements (Anderson and Ullrich, 1982b and others); it appears to be bidirectional, but is mostly acropetal, which allows the woody food-base from which the rhizomorph originates to feed the growing apex. It is also likely that, at least in A. gallica and A. cepistipes, the rhizomorphic system can grow without any

 (Anderson and Ullrich, 1982b and others); it appears to be bidirectional, but is mostly acropetal, which allows the woody food-base from which the rhizomorph originates to feed the growing apex. It is also likely that, at least in A. gallica and A. cepistipes, the rhizomorphic system can grow without any food-base, by internal reallocation of metabolites ( Mohammed, 1987 ).The different species have a very different capacity for rhizomorph growthand development: the saprophytic species of the &apos;gallica group&apos; (A. gallica,A. sinapina, A. cepistipes) produce strong, fast-growing, long-livingrhizomorphs.The rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina growmore slowly. In addition, the rhizomorphs of A. mellea are short-living andoften difficult to detect in field, though they play a major role in infection. A. tabescens does not produce rhizomorphs in nature but it does in pure culture. The African species A. heimii produces rhizomorphs only in cool environments at high altitudes. Differences for this trait were also reported within a species; they account for a part of variability in the pathogenicity of individual genotypes.Mycelial fans and cordsIn conditions of abundant nutrition, especially in the living plant, the fungus initiates flat, white, poorly differentiated, aggregated organs, which have received different names: subcortical rhizomorphs (the &apos;rhizomorpha subcorticalis&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ), mycelial cords and mycelial fans. Their general shape can be more or less linear (cords) or is

 fungus initiates flat, white, poorly differentiated, aggregated organs, which have received different names: subcortical rhizomorphs (the &apos;rhizomorpha subcorticalis&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ), mycelial cords and mycelial fans. Their general shape can be more or less linear (cords) or isodiametric (fans) according to the host and the localization. Essentially these organs assume a function of nutrition from the living host or the dead wood.In vitro studies have shown that the rhizomorphs and the fans have the same origin: within certain genetic limits, it is possible to transform fans into differentiated rhizomorphs or vice versa by manipulating the composition of the culture medium.Zone linesMany wood-destroying fungi, including Armillaria species, form dark lines in dead wood. These lines (zone lines or pseudosclerotia) are actually dark surfaces which divide the colonized wood into different, more or less independent, volumes. These surfaces are made of dead, melanized, contiguous isodiametric cells. The phenomenon has nothing to do with &apos;compartmentalization&apos;, a resistance process of trees analysed by Shigo and Tippett (1981) .The physiological conditions of zone-line formation in Armillaria species have been studied by several authors ( Campbell, 1934 ; Lopez-Real and Swift, 1975 ). These organs are mainly found in the heart wood; they are linked to a saprophytic phase of substrate exploitation which begins several weeks after infection.XylostromasIn A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1956 ) and A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), the cankers and cracks at the surface of the roots or the collar are often occupied by fungal dark crusts which probably originate from melanization of cambial mycelial fans. These organs

 of substrate exploitation which begins several weeks after infection.XylostromasIn A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1956 ) and A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), the cankers and cracks at the surface of the roots or the collar are often occupied by fungal dark crusts which probably originate from melanization of cambial mycelial fans. These organs are less evident in the other three species which are studied here.Fruit bodiesBasidiomata in species of Armillaria usually appear late in the infection process, most often on dead trees or on stumps. However, it is not uncommon to observe fruit bodies of A. mellea or A. ostoyae in the autumn at the bases of infected trees which are still alive.Different species of Armillaria have very different propensities to fruit in the field. A. tabescens and A. ostoyae fruit rather commonly in nature ( Rhoads, 1956 ), whereas the appearance of fruit bodies is a rare event for the African A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), although this species fruits easily in the laboratory.Sexual Systems and the Karyological CycleThe sexual and karyological problems in species of Armillaria have been summarized by Guillaumin et al. (1991a) but new outstanding results have been obtained since this date. The Armillaria group is unique amongst Basidiomycetes in that the secondary mycelium (formed after mating of two compatible haploid mycelia) is diploid and not dikaryotic. This characteristic seems to be common to all the species of the genus which have been studied to date. The existence of a double genetic recombination in the cycle of at least certain Armillaria species could be another characteristic of the genus.The karyological cycle in species of Armillaria remained a mystery until 1973. Early researchers ( Kniep, 1911 ; Kü

 dikaryotic. This characteristic seems to be common to all the species of the genus which have been studied to date. The existence of a double genetic recombination in the cycle of at least certain Armillaria species could be another characteristic of the genus.The karyological cycle in species of Armillaria remained a mystery until 1973. Early researchers ( Kniep, 1911 ; Kühner, 1946 ) had observed that hyphal cells are monokaryotic, irrespective of their origin (a single basidiospore, basidioma tissue or vegetative material). Hintikka (1973) was the first to observe a macromorphological difference between the haploid monospore isolates (of fluffy appearence) and the diploid cultures from basidioma tissue (flat and crustose); he established that the species he was studying (probably A. borealis) had a bifactorial (or tetrapolar) sexual incompatibility system. Korhonen (1978) , Ullrich and Anderson (1978) , Anderson (1982) , Guillaumin et al. (1983) , Kile (1983) , Guillaumin (1986) and Kile and Watling (1988) showed that this is also the case for all the Armillaria species of the temperate areas (Europe, North America and Australasia), the only exception being A. ectypa, a rare species of European peat bogs ( Guillaumin, 1973 ; Zolciak et al., 1997 ).By contrast, the tropical species of Armillaria which have been studied to date do not appear to be tetrapolar: A. puiggarii from the West Indies is homothallic whereas the common African species A. heimii includes both homothallic and bipolar (unifactorial) heterothallic isolates (Mohammed and Guillaumin, 1993; Guillaumin et al., 1994 ). The sub

 of Armillaria which have been studied to date do not appear to be tetrapolar: A. puiggarii from the West Indies is homothallic whereas the common African species A. heimii includes both homothallic and bipolar (unifactorial) heterothallic isolates (Mohammed and Guillaumin, 1993; Guillaumin et al., 1994 ). The subspecies A.mellea ssp. nipponica which has been reported from Japan and from tropical Africa is homothallic in both areas ( Cha and Igarashi, 1995b , Abomo-Ndongo et al., 1997; Ota et al., 1998b ). Another homothallic Armillaria taxon has been reported from southern China (K Korhonen, personal communication).Compatible matings in heterothallic species result in the appearance of a crusty mycelium, the diploidy of which has been demonstrated by various methods ( Korhonen and Hintikka, 1974 ; Anderson and Ullrich, 1982a; Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ). The karyological evolution of the tissues of the basidiome is complex and remains questionable; it is likely that in many cases, a somatic haploidization occurs in the sterile parts of the basidiome ( Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ); this haploidization results in a genetic recombination in the young basidiome mimiking a meiosis (Peabody and Peabody, 2000; Grillo et al., 2000 ). Nevertheless, the normal meiosis also exists in the basidium; thus, a double recombination process is likely to take place in the cycle of certain heterothallic Armillaria species. These species (A. tabescens, A. gallica, A. ostoyae and most of the North American species) have dikaryotic, clamped cells in the subhymenium

 Nevertheless, the normal meiosis also exists in the basidium; thus, a double recombination process is likely to take place in the cycle of certain heterothallic Armillaria species. These species (A. tabescens, A. gallica, A. ostoyae and most of the North American species) have dikaryotic, clamped cells in the subhymenium and at the base of the basidia, while others (A. mellea, A. luteobubalina and the other Australasian species) have not.The karyological cycle of the homothallic species is another open problem. The vegetative mycelium is probably also diploid in these species ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). In this case, the mycelium originating from the germination of a single spore could be directly infectious. In the case of the subspecies A. mellea ssp. nipponica, according to Ota et al. (1998b) , homothallism results from a fusion of the postmeiotic nuclei in the basidium, followed by migration to the basidiospores of the diploid nuclei resulting from this fusion.Diploid-haploid matings (the Buller phenomenon) take place both in tetrapolar species ( Korhonen, 1978 ) and in the bipolar isolates of A. heimii ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). This phenomenon is the basis of the most common method used for identification of the European and North American Armillaria species and is sometimes referred to as Korhonen&apos;s method (see Diagnostic Methods).Basis of PathogenicityDestruction of bark, sap wood and heart wood is caused mainly by enzymatic activities: pectinases, cellulases, hemicellulases, peroxidases and laccase (Wahlström et al

 Armillaria species and is sometimes referred to as Korhonen&apos;s method (see Diagnostic Methods).Basis of PathogenicityDestruction of bark, sap wood and heart wood is caused mainly by enzymatic activities: pectinases, cellulases, hemicellulases, peroxidases and laccase (Wahlström et al., 1991; Robene-Soustrade, 1993 ; Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ). Some of these enzymatic activities (especially laccase and polygalacturonase) are mainly detected in just-infected or just dying roots and seem particularly involved in the infection process, while other activities (CM-cellulase, b-glucosidase and b-xylosidase) are linked to the saprophytic decay of wood caused by saprophytic species and by parasitic species in the late stages of the disease ( Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ).Although the Armillaria species are known to synthesize several toxins belonging to the sesquiterpene group ( Donnelly et al., 1990 ; Peipp and Sonnenbichler, 1992 ), most authors consider that these toxins (in contrast to the case of Rosellinia necatrix) do not play a major role in the disease.InfectionThe infection process has been reviewed by Rykowski (1975, 1980) and by Morrison et al. (1991) . All authors agree that the basidiospores play no direct role in the parasitic phase of the cycle. Infection concerns only the large or middle roots, which are lignified and suberized. It can proceed according to two different mechanisms: by contact between a sound root and a subterranean rhizomorph, or by contact between a sound root and an infected root or piece of dead wood colonized by the fungus.Infect

ores play no direct role in the parasitic phase of the cycle. Infection concerns only the large or middle roots, which are lignified and suberized. It can proceed according to two different mechanisms: by contact between a sound root and a subterranean rhizomorph, or by contact between a sound root and an infected root or piece of dead wood colonized by the fungus.Infection through the subterranean rhizomorph has been described by Day (1927) , Thomas (1934) and Guillaumin and Rykowski (1980) . The general scheme is the same for conifers and hardwoods: in their growth through the soil, the subterranean rhizomorphs come into contact with roots to which they attach themselves by means of mucilage and produce short branches, the &apos;infection cones&apos;, which directly enter the root bark. After penetration has occurred, the infection cone separates into individual hyphae which colonize the bark. A second aggregation phase then occurs in the cambium, giving rise to the mycelial fans and flat subcortical rhizomorphs. No wound is required for such a penetration: in an experiment of Guillaumin and Pierson (1976) the rate of success of artificial infections on Prunus mahaleb was decreased when the host was wounded.This &apos;classical&apos; mode of infection is very common for A. mellea and A. ostoyae; it is probably more rare for A. luteobubalina and A. heimii and cannot exist with A. tabescens where subterranean rhizomorphs are not observed in nature.Infection by direct contact between a diseased root (or a colonized wood fragment) and a living root probably concerns all five species: it was first described by Zeller (1926) . The process is less precisely understood, but could involve preliminary

 and A. heimii and cannot exist with A. tabescens where subterranean rhizomorphs are not observed in nature.Infection by direct contact between a diseased root (or a colonized wood fragment) and a living root probably concerns all five species: it was first described by Zeller (1926) . The process is less precisely understood, but could involve preliminary degradation of the outer layers of the root by enzymatic and/or toxic activities. According to Morrison et al. (1991) , in conifers, the first step of infection could consist of external proliferation of the fungus between the outer scales of the root.Whatever the mode of infection, as soon as the fungus has reached the cambium, it begins to grow rapidly in both directions (to the root end and to the collar) by means of mycelial fans and subcortical white rhizomorphs.DisseminationTwo kinds of dissemination occur: short-range dissemination through vegetative structures and long-range dissemination by basidiospores.In short-range dissemination, the fungus spreads partly through the growth of the subterranean rhizomorphs in soil ( Redfern, 1973 ) and partly by mycelium, mycelial fans and subcortical rhizomorphs growing in the living roots or in the dead wood.Dissemination by subterranean rhizomorphs is particularly efficient for species of the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; (A. gallica, A. cepistipes, A. sinapina, etc.) which behave as saprophytes or opportunists. The long, thick, perennial rhizomorphs of these species are well adapted for finding and invading stumps and buried wood. As shown by Mohammed (1987) , the subterranean rhizomorphs of the aggressive species (for instance A. mellea) are more fragile and short lived; their

. sinapina, etc.) which behave as saprophytes or opportunists. The long, thick, perennial rhizomorphs of these species are well adapted for finding and invading stumps and buried wood. As shown by Mohammed (1987) , the subterranean rhizomorphs of the aggressive species (for instance A. mellea) are more fragile and short lived; their main role is in infection, not in dissemination.Whatever the process, the vegetative dissemination in Armillaria species is very efficient; it results in the formation of large homogeneous genotypes (also named &apos;clones&apos; or &apos;genets&apos;). A genet of A. gallica described in Michigan occupied a minimum of 15 ha and was aged 1500 years ( Smith et al., 1992 ). More recently, an even larger genet of A. ostoyae was found in eastern Oregon (T Dreisbach, USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, personal communication, 2000). It covered 800 ha and its calculated age was at least 2400 years. This genet can be regarded as the biggest living individual ever detected in the world. Hodnett and Anderson (2000) have shown that, despite their age, these large clones are genetically completely homogeneous.In long-range dissemination, the basidiospores of Armillaria are transported by wind and probably also by other agents. In contrast to vegetative dissemination, dissemination by basidiospores creates new genotypes. Germination of a basidiospore gives rise to a haploid mycelium which is probably short-lived unless it is diploidized by another compatible haploid mycelium, or by a diploid mycelium (the Buller phenomenon).It is probable that new foci established on first-rotation forests originate from basidiospores ( Rishbeth, 1988 , 1991). However, the site of

 rise to a haploid mycelium which is probably short-lived unless it is diploidized by another compatible haploid mycelium, or by a diploid mycelium (the Buller phenomenon).It is probable that new foci established on first-rotation forests originate from basidiospores ( Rishbeth, 1988 , 1991). However, the site of germination of basidiospores and the establishment of new diploid genotypes is not clearly known. By analogy with Heterobasidion annosum, it was thought to be the surface of cut stumps. However, Rishbeth (1964) failed to obtain regular germination of the basidiospores on stumps. Legrand et al. (1996) showed that stump removal does not prevent the appearence of numerous new genotypes on a stand submitted to clear felling.Whatever the exact site of formation of the new diploids, it is of importance for the epidemiologist to appreciate the respective role of vegetative and sexual dissemination for a given Armillaria species and and in a given environment. More than 25 papers since the pioneering work of Korhonen (1978) on studies using the tools of population genetics: various methods including Somatic Incompatibility (SI) and the molecular or non-molecular markers have been used in order to map the teritories of the genets. The results obtained were diverse, even within the same Armillaria species: the genet of A. ostoyae of 800 ha found is eastern Oregon probably represents an extreme situation when sexual reproduction is completely inhibited. The opposite situation has been described for the same Armillaria species by Legrand et al. (1996) who found 38 genets on a stand ot 4 ha (average area of one genet: <500 m²).SurvivalThe fungus is essentially preserved as mycelial masses in the dead wood buried in the

The opposite situation has been described for the same Armillaria species by Legrand et al. (1996) who found 38 genets on a stand ot 4 ha (average area of one genet: <500 m²).SurvivalThe fungus is essentially preserved as mycelial masses in the dead wood buried in the soil; heart wood is colonized after sap wood and is slowly decomposed. Heart wood is often compartmentalized by zone lines which protect the mycelium against drying and antagonistic organisms. The period of conservation of the fungus depends mainly on the size of the wood fragments. On entire stumps, fungal survival can be estimated at several decades: for example, 40 years on English oak stumps according to Rishbeth (1972) , 20 years on east African hardwoods according to Swift (1972) . The fungus can also survive as mycelium in latent cortical necroses on living roots of symptomless trees ( Whitney et al., 1989 ; Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).The mycelium preserved in stumps or in latent necroses can initiate new subterranean rhizomorphs or infect living roots directly by contact.The large subterranean rhizomorphs of &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; species can probably survive for several years and so play a role in inoculum conservation. However, the species of this subgroup are only weak pathogens.EcologyThe prevailing role of woody inoculumThe characteristics of woody inoculum (volume, age, nature and distribution of dead wood in soil) are the main epidemiological factors and are largely responsible for the evolution of the disease following planting. Three situations are especially risky.The first is when planting follows recent deforestation or shrub clearance. Even if no symptoms of Armillaria root rot have been detected on the trees constituting the natural vegetation, their roots can

y inoculum (volume, age, nature and distribution of dead wood in soil) are the main epidemiological factors and are largely responsible for the evolution of the disease following planting. Three situations are especially risky.The first is when planting follows recent deforestation or shrub clearance. Even if no symptoms of Armillaria root rot have been detected on the trees constituting the natural vegetation, their roots can carry latent necroses from which the fungus can colonize the entire root system after cutting of the tree ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ). However, the type of tree removed is of importance; hardwoods, especially Quercus species, appear to be particularly hazardous even when they are followed by conifers ( Rishbeth, 1972 ; Rykowski, 1985). A. ostoyae as a parasite is mostly aggressive to conifers, but as a saprophyte it can also colonize hardwood stumps and the mycelial survival and rhizomorph production are generally higher from hardwoods. In tropical arboriculture, the risk for woody plantations depends on the volume of wood left in the soil after deforestation and the small indigenous plantations which cannot use important means to uproot the stumps are often more hazardous ( Onsando et al., 1997 ).The second situation is when a new plantation succeeds a previous plantation, especially if the two woody species involved are susceptible to the same Armillaria species.The third is if the plantation is sited on the banks of a river subject to flooding (wood carried in the current is deposited and buried together with alluvions).In forest management, thinning and cutting often play an essential role: the first damage by Armillaria can be triggered by precommercial thinning or by the first commercial cuttings ( Morrison and Mallett, 1996 ).Weak or equilibrium parasitism and predispositionSpecies of Armillaria are a natural component of the mycoflora of forests worldwide.

 buried together with alluvions).In forest management, thinning and cutting often play an essential role: the first damage by Armillaria can be triggered by precommercial thinning or by the first commercial cuttings ( Morrison and Mallett, 1996 ).Weak or equilibrium parasitism and predispositionSpecies of Armillaria are a natural component of the mycoflora of forests worldwide. In most cases, they do not cause important damage in these natural forests. They behave as wood decomposers (particularly the species belonging to the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos;) and weak necrotrophic pathogens, infecting and killing trees which are suppressed or stressed by diverse factors ( Kile et al., 1991 ). Delatour and Guillaumin (1985) distinguished three ecological categories among the agents of the root rots of trees: (i) the primary parasites which can be lethal in the absence of any predisposing factor; (ii) the equilibrium parasites (saprophytes which can become parasites and pathogenic if the host is enfeebled by certain factors) and (iii) the heart-rot agents. The parasites belonging to the last two categories have inferior pathogenic capacities. These three categories can be found among the Armillaria species. For instance, A. gallica generally belongs to type (ii), whilst A. borealis and A. cepistipes often belong to type (iii) on conifers.The five species described here in detail (A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina, A. tabescens and A. heimii) are those which commonly act as primary pathogens. However, in the presence of fairly resistant hosts, they can also behave as equilibrium parasites or heart-rot agents. For instance, A. mellea is currently a primary pathogen on orchard trees and grapevines, an equilibrium pathogen on

. luteobubalina, A. tabescens and A. heimii) are those which commonly act as primary pathogens. However, in the presence of fairly resistant hosts, they can also behave as equilibrium parasites or heart-rot agents. For instance, A. mellea is currently a primary pathogen on orchard trees and grapevines, an equilibrium pathogen on adult Quercus species and a heart-rot agent on poplars. Wargo and Harrington (1991) have reviewed the numerous factors which can act as stresses and thus induce equilibrium parasitism by Armillaria species. These factors can be abiotic (drought, excess of water responsible for anaerobic soil conditions, nutrient deficiencies, air pollution) or biotic (defoliators, sap-sucking insects, bark-infesting beetles, dwarf mistletoe ( Byler, 1978 ), fungal diseases of foliage). An excessive density of stock can also favour the disease by increasing the competition between the trees: thus, insufficient thinning can be favourable to the disease for physiological reasons while excess of thinning can have the same result for epidemiological reasons (by increasing the inoculum potential). The equilibrium point can be very variable function of the host and environment: for example, Rosso and Hansen (1998) showed that on Douglas fir in the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, the impact of A. ostoyae was linked to epidemiological factors, but not to tree vigour. The results could be very different in other ecosystems.Weak or equilibrium parasitism in Armillaria was studied by Wargo in the north-eastern USA, where colonization of hardwood trees (Acer saccharum and Quercus species) by Armillaria species is generally triggered by insect defoliation ( Wargo, 1980 , 1981). One effect of the stress is to enfeeble the host root defences against the fungus. The latent necroses, which are frequent on the

 studied by Wargo in the north-eastern USA, where colonization of hardwood trees (Acer saccharum and Quercus species) by Armillaria species is generally triggered by insect defoliation ( Wargo, 1980 , 1981). One effect of the stress is to enfeeble the host root defences against the fungus. The latent necroses, which are frequent on the root systems of many adult trees, probably play an important role in this restart of fungal growth in the roots; the mycelium confined in the necrosis is still alive and can then break the wound periderms ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).Wargo (1972, 1975, 1980, 1984) has tried to analyse the biochemical ways through which the different stresses enhance the susceptibility of the hosts to Armillaria species. According to this author, several mechanisms can be involved, including hydrolysis of the starch of roots which provides the fungus with soluble sugars, disturbance of phenolic synthesis by the host, and decrease in the efficiency of the host enzymes which decay the wall of the fungal cells.Of course, most of the weakening factors which trigger equilibrium parasitism can also play a role in cases of primary parasitism by modifying the balance between fungal pathogenicity and the host&apos;s responses.Ecological requirements of Armillaria speciesThe European Armillaria species have different temperature requirements ( Mohammed, 1987 ) which can explain their different distributions concerning latitude and altitude ( Guillaumin et al., 1993 ). For instance, A. ostoyae is less thermophilic than A. mellea (their optimal temperatures for growth are 21 and 23°C, respectively) and can be found in Europe at higher latitudes and altitudes than A. mellea. However, A. mellea is less thermophilic than A. tabescens.The same ecological differences between the three species can be observed in North America (

 is less thermophilic than A. mellea (their optimal temperatures for growth are 21 and 23°C, respectively) and can be found in Europe at higher latitudes and altitudes than A. mellea. However, A. mellea is less thermophilic than A. tabescens.The same ecological differences between the three species can be observed in North America ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Armillaria root rot is found in all soil types. Contrary to some presumptions, it is not restricted to heavy or damp soils, or to those with a particular pH. However, differences exist between the species concerning the optimal pH range for growth of subterranean rhizomorphs: it is generally accepted ( Morrison, 1974 ; Guillaumin and Lung-Escarmant, 1985 ) that the growth of the rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae is higher in acidic soils whereas A. mellea and A. gallica have a preference for neutral pH.Contrary to some presumptions, converging results indicate that Armillaria rot rot is generally more severe on sandy soils than on clayey soils ( Wiensczyk et al., 1997 ; Mallett and Maynard, 1998 ) however, the incidence of soil texture could be indirect, through an effect on host resistance.The importance of the microbiological environment on growth and pathogenicity of Armillaria species is just beginning to be suspected. It is well known that certain microfungi of the rhizosphere of large roots (for example, Trichoderma species) are antagonistic to Armillarias. Kwasna (1996, 1997) has shown that other fungi, especially members of the Zygomycetes, behave as synergists for Armillaria species: the composition of the rhizosphere and its evolution could play an important role in the development of the rhizomorphs outside the root and their penetration into it.

Kwasna (1996, 1997) has shown that other fungi, especially members of the Zygomycetes, behave as synergists for Armillaria species: the composition of the rhizosphere and its evolution could play an important role in the development of the rhizomorphs outside the root and their penetration into it.
 Sintomas: Symptoms on FoliageArmillaria species cause root and collar rot of trees. Infection of a root system does not immediately result in the appearance of symptoms on the aerial part. These only begin to show when the collar is attacked or when several large roots are destroyed. Depending on the age and susceptibility of the host, Armillaria species and isolate, and the environmental conditions, the rate of development of the disease may be progressive (decline) or the tree may die suddenly (apoplexy) ( Guillaumin, 1977 ; Guillaumin et al., 1982 ; Morrison et al., 1991 ).In the case of slow decline, the main symptoms are a reduction of shoot growth, changes in foliage characteristics (foliage becomes stunted, chlorotic and sparse). The leaves can wilt (on fruit trees), fall prematurely or show abnormal colorations (especially on grapevines) in autumn. Then all foliage can turn yellow or sometimes brown (in conifers), or droop. In eucalypts attacked by A. luteobubalina, disease development results in a dead top of mature trees ( Pearce et al., 1986 ). On fruit trees and grapevines &apos;en gobelet&apos;, asymmetric infection of the root system frequently results in death of only one main branch.Disease development can be more rapid (apoplexy): the trees or shrubs can wilt suddenly, sometimes without having shown any previous symptoms. This death often occurs in a period of water stress, or at

 fruit trees and grapevines &apos;en gobelet&apos;, asymmetric infection of the root system frequently results in death of only one main branch.Disease development can be more rapid (apoplexy): the trees or shrubs can wilt suddenly, sometimes without having shown any previous symptoms. This death often occurs in a period of water stress, or at the first onset of fruiting. The trees often respond to infection by an abnormally heavy blooming or fruit production ( Rhoads, 1956 ).In most cases, the disease extends in patches, the dead or dying plants being grouped in foci, surrounded by declining trees.Symptoms on the Basal StemIn the final stages of fungal infection, the mycelial fans of the fungus colonizing the roots reach the level of the collar and can grow up in the trunk for some decimetres or more. Sometimes spectacular, these fans are easily detected by stripping the bark of the base of the tree. In some cases, the fungus can destroy the bark and the mycelial fans are visible outside.Trees attacked by species of Armillaria frequently exhibit cracks or cankers, or produce exudates at the base of the trunk ( Morrison et al., 1991 ). The longitudinal cracks are particularly frequent on tropical trees (cocoa, coffee, etc.). Armillaria disease of cocoa, described by Dade as early as 1927, was named &apos;collar crack&apos; by this author. The cracks are probably due to the mechanical pressure exerted on bark by the fungal fans colonizing the cambium; these fans are particularly thick for the African species A. heimii.The presence of basal cankers, which are generally triangular, means that progression of the fungus has been stopped locally: callusing occurs around the margin of the lesion. This symptom has been occasionally reported from hardwood trees (birch, beech,

 bark by the fungal fans colonizing the cambium; these fans are particularly thick for the African species A. heimii.The presence of basal cankers, which are generally triangular, means that progression of the fungus has been stopped locally: callusing occurs around the margin of the lesion. This symptom has been occasionally reported from hardwood trees (birch, beech, cork oak) infected by A. mellea ( Guillaumin, 1986 ).The production of resin at the collar is a common response of Abietaceae, especially pines, attacked by A. ostoyae or A. heimii ( Gibson, 1960 ; Hintikka, 1974 ; Rykowski; 1975). Production of gums is sometimes observed at the base of citrus ( Rhoads, 1948 ) and is common on stone-fruits attacked by A. mellea ( Guillaumin et al., 1982 ). Latex exudes from rubber trees when the collar is reached by A. heimii ( Petit-Renaud, 1991 ) and &apos;kino&apos; from eucalypts attacked by A. luteobubalina ( Edgar et al., 1976 ).Symptoms on RootsThe bark of the roots is brown, softish and often fissured. With A. mellea, reddish tufts of mycelium sometimes appear through the cracks.The main symptom is the presence at the level of the cambium of white, thick, mycelial fans, sometimes constituting a continuous mycelial tube. This muff is somewhat less developed and continuous in the case of A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ). The fans are frequently perforated in A. luteobubalina ( Kile and Old, 1982 ) and A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Depending on the Armillaria species involved, the roots are

 a continuous mycelial tube. This muff is somewhat less developed and continuous in the case of A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ). The fans are frequently perforated in A. luteobubalina ( Kile and Old, 1982 ) and A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Depending on the Armillaria species involved, the roots are sometimes surrounded by subterranean rhizomorphs 1-2 mm in diameter and varying in colour from black to mahogany: these external rhizomorphs are very frequent when the species involved belongs to the &apos;gallica group&apos; (A. gallica, A. sinapina, etc.). However, these species are generally weak pathogens and their pathogenicity is limited. External rhizomorphs are fairly common with A. ostoyae; they are rather rare with A. mellea, A. heimii and A. luteobubalina; they are never observed with A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Armillaria Infection without SymptomsArmillaria can be an agent of heartwood decay (heart rot). Heart rot of trees is often due to weakly aggressive Armillaria species, for instance A. borealis or A. cepistipes on conifers in northern Europe ( Roll-Hansen, 1985 ). However, even the aggressive species can behave as heart-rot agents on tolerant tree species, as is sometimes the case with A. mellea on beech or poplars ( Guillaumin, 1986 ). This localization of the fungus does not provoke symptoms, except an enhanced susceptibility to windthrow.Infection without symptoms can also occur in the case of latent infections on the roots of young, healthy trees. Armillaria infections are often stopped by the host reactions. The fungus remains alive and constitutes a &apos;latent infection&apos

 poplars ( Guillaumin, 1986 ). This localization of the fungus does not provoke symptoms, except an enhanced susceptibility to windthrow.Infection without symptoms can also occur in the case of latent infections on the roots of young, healthy trees. Armillaria infections are often stopped by the host reactions. The fungus remains alive and constitutes a &apos;latent infection&apos; limited in area and showing no evolution. However, these latent infections (the number of which increases with time) can resume their evolution and colonize the root system if the tree is weakened by age or environment ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).Infestation by an unidentified species of Armillaria was reported in Germany on fir logs during long-term storage under water sprinklers ( Gross et al., 1996 ).
 Organos afectados: Abelia grandiflora (Glossy abelia), Caprifoliaceae, Other, 
 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology OntogenyThe different organs initiated by the fungus in nature are described below. Species of Armillaria have no known asexual spores, but are able to differentiate a variety of vegetative structures, both in nature and in vitro.RhizomorphsLike Garrett (1956) many authors distinguish the rhizomorphs from the mycelial cords and reserve the name rhizomorph for highly differentiated organs with apical growth. The subterranean rhizomorphs of many species of Armillaria (the &apos;rhizomorpha subterranea&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ) fall into this category. These organs show "the most highly differentiated vegetative tissues of fungi" ( Garraway et al., 1991 ), with a peripheral cortex, a living medulla, a central canal containing gas and an apical meristem ( Motta, 1969 ; Garraway et al., 1991 ). This organ plays an important

&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ) fall into this category. These organs show "the most highly differentiated vegetative tissues of fungi" ( Garraway et al., 1991 ), with a peripheral cortex, a living medulla, a central canal containing gas and an apical meristem ( Motta, 1969 ; Garraway et al., 1991 ). This organ plays an important role in infection, dissemination, search for and colonization of woody substrates in soil (see Epidemiology).The subterranean rhizomorph takes up and transports nutrients, water and oxygen ( Smith and Griffin, 1971 ). The transport of nutrients has been studied by different experiments with radiolabelled elements (Anderson and Ullrich, 1982b and others); it appears to be bidirectional, but is mostly acropetal, which allows the woody food-base from which the rhizomorph originates to feed the growing apex. It is also likely that, at least in A. gallica and A. cepistipes, the rhizomorphic system can grow without any food-base, by internal reallocation of metabolites ( Mohammed, 1987 ).The different species have a very different capacity for rhizomorph growthand development: the saprophytic species of the &apos;gallica group&apos; (A. gallica,A. sinapina, A. cepistipes) produce strong, fast-growing, long-livingrhizomorphs.The rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina growmore slowly. In addition, the rhizomorphs of A. mellea are short-living andoften difficult to detect in field, though they play a major role in infection. A. tabescens does not produce rhizomorphs in nature but it does in pure culture. The African species A. heimii produces

lea, A. luteobubalina growmore slowly. In addition, the rhizomorphs of A. mellea are short-living andoften difficult to detect in field, though they play a major role in infection. A. tabescens does not produce rhizomorphs in nature but it does in pure culture. The African species A. heimii produces rhizomorphs only in cool environments at high altitudes. Differences for this trait were also reported within a species; they account for a part of variability in the pathogenicity of individual genotypes.Mycelial fans and cordsIn conditions of abundant nutrition, especially in the living plant, the fungus initiates flat, white, poorly differentiated, aggregated organs, which have received different names: subcortical rhizomorphs (the &apos;rhizomorpha subcorticalis&apos; of Persoon, 1801 ), mycelial cords and mycelial fans. Their general shape can be more or less linear (cords) or isodiametric (fans) according to the host and the localization. Essentially these organs assume a function of nutrition from the living host or the dead wood.In vitro studies have shown that the rhizomorphs and the fans have the same origin: within certain genetic limits, it is possible to transform fans into differentiated rhizomorphs or vice versa by manipulating the composition of the culture medium.Zone linesMany wood-destroying fungi, including Armillaria species, form dark lines in dead wood. These lines (zone lines or pseudosclerotia) are actually dark surfaces which divide the colonized wood into different, more or less independent, volumes. These surfaces are made of dead, melanized, contiguous isodiametric cells. The phenomenon has nothing to do with &apos;compartmentalization&apos;, a resistance process of trees analysed by Shigo

 wood. These lines (zone lines or pseudosclerotia) are actually dark surfaces which divide the colonized wood into different, more or less independent, volumes. These surfaces are made of dead, melanized, contiguous isodiametric cells. The phenomenon has nothing to do with &apos;compartmentalization&apos;, a resistance process of trees analysed by Shigo and Tippett (1981) .The physiological conditions of zone-line formation in Armillaria species have been studied by several authors ( Campbell, 1934 ; Lopez-Real and Swift, 1975 ). These organs are mainly found in the heart wood; they are linked to a saprophytic phase of substrate exploitation which begins several weeks after infection.XylostromasIn A. tabescens ( Rhoads, 1956 ) and A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), the cankers and cracks at the surface of the roots or the collar are often occupied by fungal dark crusts which probably originate from melanization of cambial mycelial fans. These organs are less evident in the other three species which are studied here.Fruit bodiesBasidiomata in species of Armillaria usually appear late in the infection process, most often on dead trees or on stumps. However, it is not uncommon to observe fruit bodies of A. mellea or A. ostoyae in the autumn at the bases of infected trees which are still alive.Different species of Armillaria have very different propensities to fruit in the field. A. tabescens and A. ostoyae fruit rather commonly in nature ( Rhoads, 1956 ), whereas the appearance of fruit bodies is a rare event for the African A. heimii ( Pichel, 1956 ), although this species fruits easily in the laboratory.Sexual Systems and the Karyological CycleThe sexual and karyological problems in species of Armillaria have been summarized by Gu

(1991a) but new outstanding results have been obtained since this date. The Armillaria group is unique amongst Basidiomycetes in that the secondary mycelium (formed after mating of two compatible haploid mycelia) is diploid and not dikaryotic. This characteristic seems to be common to all the species of the genus which have been studied to date. The existence of a double genetic recombination in the cycle of at least certain Armillaria species could be another characteristic of the genus.The karyological cycle in species of Armillaria remained a mystery until 1973. Early researchers ( Kniep, 1911 ; Kühner, 1946 ) had observed that hyphal cells are monokaryotic, irrespective of their origin (a single basidiospore, basidioma tissue or vegetative material). Hintikka (1973) was the first to observe a macromorphological difference between the haploid monospore isolates (of fluffy appearence) and the diploid cultures from basidioma tissue (flat and crustose); he established that the species he was studying (probably A. borealis) had a bifactorial (or tetrapolar) sexual incompatibility system. Korhonen (1978) , Ullrich and Anderson (1978) , Anderson (1982) , Guillaumin et al. (1983) , Kile (1983) , Guillaumin (1986) and Kile and Watling (1988) showed that this is also the case for all

 borealis) had a bifactorial (or tetrapolar) sexual incompatibility system. Korhonen (1978) , Ullrich and Anderson (1978) , Anderson (1982) , Guillaumin et al. (1983) , Kile (1983) , Guillaumin (1986) and Kile and Watling (1988) showed that this is also the case for all the Armillaria species of the temperate areas (Europe, North America and Australasia), the only exception being A. ectypa, a rare species of European peat bogs ( Guillaumin, 1973 ; Zolciak et al., 1997 ).By contrast, the tropical species of Armillaria which have been studied to date do not appear to be tetrapolar: A. puiggarii from the West Indies is homothallic whereas the common African species A. heimii includes both homothallic and bipolar (unifactorial) heterothallic isolates (Mohammed and Guillaumin, 1993; Guillaumin et al., 1994 ). The subspecies A.mellea ssp. nipponica which has been reported from Japan and from tropical Africa is homothallic in both areas ( Cha and Igarashi, 1995b , Abomo-Ndongo et al., 1997; Ota et al., 1998b ). Another homothallic Armillaria taxon has been reported from southern China (K Korhonen, personal communication).Compatible matings in heterothallic species result in the appearance of a crusty mycelium, the diploidy of which has been demonstrated by various methods ( Korhonen and Hintikka, 1974 ; Anderson and Ullrich, 1982a; Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ). The karyological evolution of the tissues of the basidiome is complex and remains questionable; it is likely that in many cases, a somatic haploidization

celium, the diploidy of which has been demonstrated by various methods ( Korhonen and Hintikka, 1974 ; Anderson and Ullrich, 1982a; Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ). The karyological evolution of the tissues of the basidiome is complex and remains questionable; it is likely that in many cases, a somatic haploidization occurs in the sterile parts of the basidiome ( Peabody and Peabody, 1985 ); this haploidization results in a genetic recombination in the young basidiome mimiking a meiosis (Peabody and Peabody, 2000; Grillo et al., 2000 ). Nevertheless, the normal meiosis also exists in the basidium; thus, a double recombination process is likely to take place in the cycle of certain heterothallic Armillaria species. These species (A. tabescens, A. gallica, A. ostoyae and most of the North American species) have dikaryotic, clamped cells in the subhymenium and at the base of the basidia, while others (A. mellea, A. luteobubalina and the other Australasian species) have not.The karyological cycle of the homothallic species is another open problem. The vegetative mycelium is probably also diploid in these species ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). In this case, the mycelium originating from the germination of a single spore could be directly infectious. In the case of the subspecies A. mellea ssp. nipponica, according to Ota et al. (1998b) , homothallism results from a fusion of the postmeiotic nuclei in the basidium, followed by migration to the basidiospores of the diploid nuclei resulting from this fusion.Diploid-haploid matings

 the case of the subspecies A. mellea ssp. nipponica, according to Ota et al. (1998b) , homothallism results from a fusion of the postmeiotic nuclei in the basidium, followed by migration to the basidiospores of the diploid nuclei resulting from this fusion.Diploid-haploid matings (the Buller phenomenon) take place both in tetrapolar species ( Korhonen, 1978 ) and in the bipolar isolates of A. heimii ( Mohammed et al., 1994b ). This phenomenon is the basis of the most common method used for identification of the European and North American Armillaria species and is sometimes referred to as Korhonen&apos;s method (see Diagnostic Methods).Basis of PathogenicityDestruction of bark, sap wood and heart wood is caused mainly by enzymatic activities: pectinases, cellulases, hemicellulases, peroxidases and laccase (Wahlström et al., 1991; Robene-Soustrade, 1993 ; Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ). Some of these enzymatic activities (especially laccase and polygalacturonase) are mainly detected in just-infected or just dying roots and seem particularly involved in the infection process, while other activities (CM-cellulase, b-glucosidase and b-xylosidase) are linked to the saprophytic decay of wood caused by saprophytic species and by parasitic species in the late stages of the disease ( Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ).Although the Armillaria species are known to synthesize several toxins belonging to the sesquiterpene group ( Donnelly et al., 1990 ; Peipp and Sonnenbichler, 1992 ), most authors consider that these

 of wood caused by saprophytic species and by parasitic species in the late stages of the disease ( Robene-Soustrade et al., 1998 ).Although the Armillaria species are known to synthesize several toxins belonging to the sesquiterpene group ( Donnelly et al., 1990 ; Peipp and Sonnenbichler, 1992 ), most authors consider that these toxins (in contrast to the case of Rosellinia necatrix) do not play a major role in the disease.InfectionThe infection process has been reviewed by Rykowski (1975, 1980) and by Morrison et al. (1991) . All authors agree that the basidiospores play no direct role in the parasitic phase of the cycle. Infection concerns only the large or middle roots, which are lignified and suberized. It can proceed according to two different mechanisms: by contact between a sound root and a subterranean rhizomorph, or by contact between a sound root and an infected root or piece of dead wood colonized by the fungus.Infection through the subterranean rhizomorph has been described by Day (1927) , Thomas (1934) and Guillaumin and Rykowski (1980) . The general scheme is the same for conifers and hardwoods: in their growth through the soil, the subterranean rhizomorphs come into contact with roots to which they attach themselves by means of mucilage and produce short branches, the &apos;infection cones&apos;, which directly enter the root bark. After penetration has occurred, the infection cone separates into individual hyphae which colonize the bark. A second aggregation phase then occurs in the cambium, giving rise to the mycelial fans and flat subcortical rhizomorphs. No wound is required for such a penetration: in an experiment of Guillaumin and Pierson (1976) the rate of success of

No wound is required for such a penetration: in an experiment of Guillaumin and Pierson (1976) the rate of success of artificial infections on Prunus mahaleb was decreased when the host was wounded.This &apos;classical&apos; mode of infection is very common for A. mellea and A. ostoyae; it is probably more rare for A. luteobubalina and A. heimii and cannot exist with A. tabescens where subterranean rhizomorphs are not observed in nature.Infection by direct contact between a diseased root (or a colonized wood fragment) and a living root probably concerns all five species: it was first described by Zeller (1926) . The process is less precisely understood, but could involve preliminary degradation of the outer layers of the root by enzymatic and/or toxic activities. According to Morrison et al. (1991) , in conifers, the first step of infection could consist of external proliferation of the fungus between the outer scales of the root.Whatever the mode of infection, as soon as the fungus has reached the cambium, it begins to grow rapidly in both directions (to the root end and to the collar) by means of mycelial fans and subcortical white rhizomorphs.DisseminationTwo kinds of dissemination occur: short-range dissemination through vegetative structures and long-range dissemination by basidiospores.In short-range dissemination, the fungus spreads partly through the growth of the subterranean rhizomorphs in soil ( Redfern, 1973 ) and partly by mycelium, mycelial fans and subc

ortical white rhizomorphs.DisseminationTwo kinds of dissemination occur: short-range dissemination through vegetative structures and long-range dissemination by basidiospores.In short-range dissemination, the fungus spreads partly through the growth of the subterranean rhizomorphs in soil ( Redfern, 1973 ) and partly by mycelium, mycelial fans and subcortical rhizomorphs growing in the living roots or in the dead wood.Dissemination by subterranean rhizomorphs is particularly efficient for species of the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; (A. gallica, A. cepistipes, A. sinapina, etc.) which behave as saprophytes or opportunists. The long, thick, perennial rhizomorphs of these species are well adapted for finding and invading stumps and buried wood. As shown by Mohammed (1987) , the subterranean rhizomorphs of the aggressive species (for instance A. mellea) are more fragile and short lived; their main role is in infection, not in dissemination.Whatever the process, the vegetative dissemination in Armillaria species is very efficient; it results in the formation of large homogeneous genotypes (also named &apos;clones&apos; or &apos;genets&apos;). A genet of A. gallica described in Michigan occupied a minimum of 15 ha and was aged 1500 years ( Smith et al., 1992 ). More recently, an even larger genet of A. ostoyae was found in eastern Oregon (T Dreisbach, USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, personal communication, 2000). It covered 800 ha and its calculated age was at least 2400 years. This genet can be regarded as the biggest living individual ever detected in the world. Hodnett and Anderson (2000) have shown that, despite their age, these large

 of A. ostoyae was found in eastern Oregon (T Dreisbach, USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, personal communication, 2000). It covered 800 ha and its calculated age was at least 2400 years. This genet can be regarded as the biggest living individual ever detected in the world. Hodnett and Anderson (2000) have shown that, despite their age, these large clones are genetically completely homogeneous.In long-range dissemination, the basidiospores of Armillaria are transported by wind and probably also by other agents. In contrast to vegetative dissemination, dissemination by basidiospores creates new genotypes. Germination of a basidiospore gives rise to a haploid mycelium which is probably short-lived unless it is diploidized by another compatible haploid mycelium, or by a diploid mycelium (the Buller phenomenon).It is probable that new foci established on first-rotation forests originate from basidiospores ( Rishbeth, 1988 , 1991). However, the site of germination of basidiospores and the establishment of new diploid genotypes is not clearly known. By analogy with Heterobasidion annosum, it was thought to be the surface of cut stumps. However, Rishbeth (1964) failed to obtain regular germination of the basidiospores on stumps. Legrand et al. (1996) showed that stump removal does not prevent the appearence of numerous new genotypes on a stand submitted to clear felling.Whatever the exact site of formation of the new diploids, it is of importance for the epidemiologist to appreciate the respective role of vegetative and sexual dissemination for a given Armillaria species and and in a given environment.

 to clear felling.Whatever the exact site of formation of the new diploids, it is of importance for the epidemiologist to appreciate the respective role of vegetative and sexual dissemination for a given Armillaria species and and in a given environment. More than 25 papers since the pioneering work of Korhonen (1978) on studies using the tools of population genetics: various methods including Somatic Incompatibility (SI) and the molecular or non-molecular markers have been used in order to map the teritories of the genets. The results obtained were diverse, even within the same Armillaria species: the genet of A. ostoyae of 800 ha found is eastern Oregon probably represents an extreme situation when sexual reproduction is completely inhibited. The opposite situation has been described for the same Armillaria species by Legrand et al. (1996) who found 38 genets on a stand ot 4 ha (average area of one genet: <500 m²).SurvivalThe fungus is essentially preserved as mycelial masses in the dead wood buried in the soil; heart wood is colonized after sap wood and is slowly decomposed. Heart wood is often compartmentalized by zone lines which protect the mycelium against drying and antagonistic organisms. The period of conservation of the fungus depends mainly on the size of the wood fragments. On entire stumps, fungal survival can be estimated at several decades: for example, 40 years on English oak stumps according to Rishbeth (1972) , 20 years on east African hardwoods according to Swift (1972) . The fungus can also survive as mycelium in latent cortical necroses on living roots of symptomless trees ( Whitney et al., 1989 ; Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).The mycelium preserved in stumps or in latent necroses can initiate new subterranean rhizomorphs or infect living roots directly by contact.The large subterranean rh

The fungus can also survive as mycelium in latent cortical necroses on living roots of symptomless trees ( Whitney et al., 1989 ; Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).The mycelium preserved in stumps or in latent necroses can initiate new subterranean rhizomorphs or infect living roots directly by contact.The large subterranean rhizomorphs of &apos;gallica subgroup&apos; species can probably survive for several years and so play a role in inoculum conservation. However, the species of this subgroup are only weak pathogens.EcologyThe prevailing role of woody inoculumThe characteristics of woody inoculum (volume, age, nature and distribution of dead wood in soil) are the main epidemiological factors and are largely responsible for the evolution of the disease following planting. Three situations are especially risky.The first is when planting follows recent deforestation or shrub clearance. Even if no symptoms of Armillaria root rot have been detected on the trees constituting the natural vegetation, their roots can carry latent necroses from which the fungus can colonize the entire root system after cutting of the tree ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ). However, the type of tree removed is of importance; hardwoods, especially Quercus species, appear to be particularly hazardous even when they are followed by conifers ( Rishbeth, 1972 ; Rykowski, 1985). A. ostoyae as a parasite is mostly aggressive to conifers, but as a saprophyte it can also colonize hardwood stumps and the mycelial survival and rhizomorph production are generally higher from hardwoods. In tropical arboriculture, the risk for woody plantations depends on the volume of wood left in the soil after deforestation and the small indigenous plantations which cannot use important means to uproot the stumps are often more hazardous ( Onsando et al.,

phyte it can also colonize hardwood stumps and the mycelial survival and rhizomorph production are generally higher from hardwoods. In tropical arboriculture, the risk for woody plantations depends on the volume of wood left in the soil after deforestation and the small indigenous plantations which cannot use important means to uproot the stumps are often more hazardous ( Onsando et al., 1997 ).The second situation is when a new plantation succeeds a previous plantation, especially if the two woody species involved are susceptible to the same Armillaria species.The third is if the plantation is sited on the banks of a river subject to flooding (wood carried in the current is deposited and buried together with alluvions).In forest management, thinning and cutting often play an essential role: the first damage by Armillaria can be triggered by precommercial thinning or by the first commercial cuttings ( Morrison and Mallett, 1996 ).Weak or equilibrium parasitism and predispositionSpecies of Armillaria are a natural component of the mycoflora of forests worldwide. In most cases, they do not cause important damage in these natural forests. They behave as wood decomposers (particularly the species belonging to the &apos;gallica subgroup&apos;) and weak necrotrophic pathogens, infecting and killing trees which are suppressed or stressed by diverse factors ( Kile et al., 1991 ). Delatour and Guillaumin (1985) distinguished three ecological categories among the agents of the root rots of trees: (i) the primary parasites which can be lethal in the absence of any predisposing factor; (ii) the equilibrium parasites (saprophytes which can become parasites and pathogenic if the host is enfeebled by certain factors) and (iii) the heart-rot agents. The parasites belonging to the last two categories have inferior pathogenic capacities. These three categories can be found among the Armillaria species

 parasites which can be lethal in the absence of any predisposing factor; (ii) the equilibrium parasites (saprophytes which can become parasites and pathogenic if the host is enfeebled by certain factors) and (iii) the heart-rot agents. The parasites belonging to the last two categories have inferior pathogenic capacities. These three categories can be found among the Armillaria species. For instance, A. gallica generally belongs to type (ii), whilst A. borealis and A. cepistipes often belong to type (iii) on conifers.The five species described here in detail (A. ostoyae, A. mellea, A. luteobubalina, A. tabescens and A. heimii) are those which commonly act as primary pathogens. However, in the presence of fairly resistant hosts, they can also behave as equilibrium parasites or heart-rot agents. For instance, A. mellea is currently a primary pathogen on orchard trees and grapevines, an equilibrium pathogen on adult Quercus species and a heart-rot agent on poplars. Wargo and Harrington (1991) have reviewed the numerous factors which can act as stresses and thus induce equilibrium parasitism by Armillaria species. These factors can be abiotic (drought, excess of water responsible for anaerobic soil conditions, nutrient deficiencies, air pollution) or biotic (defoliators, sap-sucking insects, bark-infesting beetles, dwarf mistletoe ( Byler, 1978 ), fungal diseases of foliage). An excessive density of stock can also favour the disease by increasing the competition between the trees: thus, insufficient thinning can be favourable to the disease for physiological reasons while excess of thinning can have the same result for epidemiological reasons (by increasing the inoculum potential). The equilibrium point can be very variable function of the host and environment: for example, Ros

 1978 ), fungal diseases of foliage). An excessive density of stock can also favour the disease by increasing the competition between the trees: thus, insufficient thinning can be favourable to the disease for physiological reasons while excess of thinning can have the same result for epidemiological reasons (by increasing the inoculum potential). The equilibrium point can be very variable function of the host and environment: for example, Rosso and Hansen (1998) showed that on Douglas fir in the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, the impact of A. ostoyae was linked to epidemiological factors, but not to tree vigour. The results could be very different in other ecosystems.Weak or equilibrium parasitism in Armillaria was studied by Wargo in the north-eastern USA, where colonization of hardwood trees (Acer saccharum and Quercus species) by Armillaria species is generally triggered by insect defoliation ( Wargo, 1980 , 1981). One effect of the stress is to enfeeble the host root defences against the fungus. The latent necroses, which are frequent on the root systems of many adult trees, probably play an important role in this restart of fungal growth in the roots; the mycelium confined in the necrosis is still alive and can then break the wound periderms ( Delatour and Guillaumin, 1995 ).Wargo (1972, 1975, 1980, 1984) has tried to analyse the biochemical ways through which the different stresses enhance the susceptibility of the hosts to Armillaria species. According to this author, several mechanisms can be involved, including hydrolysis of the starch of roots which provides the fungus with soluble sugars, disturbance of phenolic synthesis by the host, and decrease in the efficiency of the host enzymes which decay the wall of the fungal cells.Of course, most of the weakening factors which trigger equilibrium parasitism can also play a role in cases of primary parasitism by modifying the balance between fungal pathogenicity

, including hydrolysis of the starch of roots which provides the fungus with soluble sugars, disturbance of phenolic synthesis by the host, and decrease in the efficiency of the host enzymes which decay the wall of the fungal cells.Of course, most of the weakening factors which trigger equilibrium parasitism can also play a role in cases of primary parasitism by modifying the balance between fungal pathogenicity and the host&apos;s responses.Ecological requirements of Armillaria speciesThe European Armillaria species have different temperature requirements ( Mohammed, 1987 ) which can explain their different distributions concerning latitude and altitude ( Guillaumin et al., 1993 ). For instance, A. ostoyae is less thermophilic than A. mellea (their optimal temperatures for growth are 21 and 23°C, respectively) and can be found in Europe at higher latitudes and altitudes than A. mellea. However, A. mellea is less thermophilic than A. tabescens.The same ecological differences between the three species can be observed in North America ( Rhoads, 1945 ).Armillaria root rot is found in all soil types. Contrary to some presumptions, it is not restricted to heavy or damp soils, or to those with a particular pH. However, differences exist between the species concerning the optimal pH range for growth of subterranean rhizomorphs: it is generally accepted ( Morrison, 1974 ; Guillaumin and Lung-Escarmant, 1985 ) that the growth of the rhizomorphs of A. ostoyae is higher in acidic soils whereas A. mellea and A. gallica have a preference for neutral pH.Contrary to some presumptions, converging results indicate that Armillaria rot rot is generally more severe on sandy soils than on clayey soils ( Wiensczyk et al., 1997 ; Mallett and Maynard, 1998 ) however, the incidence of soil texture could be indirect

It is well known that certain microfungi of the rhizosphere of large roots (for example, Trichoderma species) are antagonistic to Armillarias. Kwasna (1996, 1997) has shown that other fungi, especially members of the Zygomycetes, behave as synergists for Armillaria species: the composition of the rhizosphere and its evolution could play an important role in the development of the rhizomorphs outside the root and their penetration into it.
