Release and Recovery of Biological 
Control for Emerald Ash Borer  
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and our partners 
release tiny stingless wasps as biological control agents 
to help manage emerald ash borer (EAB) populations 
in infested areas. This includes trapping to see if 
the wasps have established themselves in these areas. 
Biocontrol partners should follow the EAB Biological 
Control Release and Recovery Guidelines at 
www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-health/eab. 
The following is a quick reference for biocontrol partners 
on key aspects of this work. 
Release Timing 
When and how do I get the wasps? 
Once we approve your release site, track the degree   
days to determine the best time for releasing wasps. 
Degree days are the number of sequential days that 
temperatures are high enough for EAB life cycle stages 
in your area. You can find degree days in the EAB 
interactive map at ww
w.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/maps/ 
plant-health/eab-map. 
As
 your area approaches the appropriate degree days, 
communication will begin between us for when the wasps 
will be shipped. We typically begin shipping wasps to 
partners in early May to start the release season. The 
wasps are shipped by overnight delivery in a cardboard 
box and should arrive by 10:30 a.m. at most locations.  
When do I release them? 
You should release all wasps the same day you receive 
them. If needed, you

When do I release them? 
You should release all wasps the same day you receive 
them. If needed, you can store the shipment in a cool 
place out of the sun for 1 extra day with little impact to 
the wasps.  
If you won’t be able to release the wasps on the same 
day they arrive, arrange for a different shipping date    
by calling 1-810-844-2708.  
If you need to release the wasps at different times 
than those in the guidelines, contact us at 
eab.biocontrol.program@usda.gov. 
Data Management 
Where do I report my data? 
We use an online database called MapBioControl. It 
stores detailed information on where wasps are    
released and recovered, including when, how, under 
what conditions, and how many. There is also a 
MapBioControl app currently available for iPads and 
iPhones that can be synchronized to the website.  
How can I access MapBioControl? 
To access the database, visit www.mapbiocontrol.org 
and click on any tab to create an account.  
If you have questions about MapBioControl, send an 
email to info@asets.msu.edu. 
Do I need to enter both release and recovery data? 
Yes. You must enter both the release and recovery data 
into MapBioControl. Please also enter data for trapping 
locations where wasps were

 to create an account.  
If you have questions about MapBioControl, send an 
email to info@asets.msu.edu. 
Do I need to enter both release and recovery data? 
Yes. You must enter both the release and recovery data 
into MapBioControl. Please also enter data for trapping 
locations where wasps were not recovered. This 
information helps us monitor and evaluate the 
establishment of wasps and their impact on EAB 
populations throughout the United States.  
When do I need to enter the data? 
You must enter release data into MapBioControl within 
48 hours of releasing wasps. Recovery data should be 
entered as soon as possible after trapping.  
Having timely, accurate data is a critical to the success    
of our biological control work. It tells us where releases 
and establishments are happening so we can best target 
our efforts.

Recovery Trapping 
How often do I conduct recovery trapping work? 
You must do recovery trapping in at least one release 
site per county for 2 years. If you don’t recover anything 
during that time, consider additional release or recovery 
efforts. 
What do I do with the recovery samples? 
First, process or sort the specimens found in recovery 
samples at your location. You can find more information 
on the trapping process and species identification in the 
guidelines. Then, send any suspect biocontrol agents that 
resemble the released wasps to APHIS for identification:
