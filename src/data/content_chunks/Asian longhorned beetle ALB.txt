Insecticide Treatments 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal  
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and its 
partners use insecticide treatments as part of an 
integrated approach to eradicate Asian longhorned beetle 
(ALB). This combined approach includes imposing 
quarantines, conducting tree inspections, removing 
infested trees, and sometimes removing at-risk host trees. 
Why is insecticide used to fight ALB? 
We use insecticide to reduce the spread of ALB from 
currently infested areas. It kills beetles that feed on  
the leaves and twigs of treated trees. It is also effective 
against the early larval stages of the beetle that feed  
on the inner, growing layer of the tree. As a result,  
the insecticide treatments decrease the number  
of beetles in an area and prevent new trees from 
becoming infested. 
What insecticide does the ALB program use? 
The generic name of the insecticide is imidacloprid.  
It is a systemic insecticide commonly used to control 
both agricultural and residential insect pests, such  
as aphids, cockroaches, termites, soil insects, thrips, 
whiteflies, and some beetles. It is also used in flea  
and tick prevention products for pets, and it has been 
sold in the United States since 1994. Imidacloprid  
is registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act and is approved for ALB eradication 
program use.

Agency (EPA) under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act and is approved for ALB eradication

When does the ALB program use insecticide 
treatments on trees? 
When deciding whether to treat trees with imidacloprid, 
APHIS and State officials consider several important 
factors, including environmental and biological issues, 
the scale of an infestation, recent ALB survey results,  
and cost. Insecticide treatments are used only on trees 
that are not known to be infested. The treatment kills  
 
 
beetles or larvae that try to feed on the tree and helps 
prevent it from becoming infested. 
How are insecticide treatments used? 
The insecticide is used according to product label 
requirements and is applied through either tree trunk  
or soil injections. Trunk injections are applied directly  
into the tree trunk using a specialized device. Soil 
injections are applied directly into the soil at the base  
of trees. The number of injections (either trunk or soil) 
per tree depends on the size of the tree. With each 
method, the tree’s vascular system pulls the insecticide 
upward into the stems, twigs, and foliage where beetles 
will encounter it as they feed and lay eggs. 
What species of trees are treated with insecticide? 
Tree species that could receive treatments include 
maple and box elder, horse chestnut and buckeye, 
mimosa, birch, katsura tree, ash, golden raintree,

 the stems, twigs, and foliage where beetles

What species of trees are treated with insecticide? 
Tree species that could receive treatments include 
maple and box elder, horse chestnut and buckeye, 
mimosa, birch, katsura tree, ash, golden raintree, 
sycamore and London planetree, poplar, willow, 
mountain ash, and elm. Once an area is identified for 
treatments, it is most effective to treat all host trees 
within that area. 
When do applications take place? 
Imidacloprid treatments can be effective against ALB 
when applied in the spring, early summer, or fall—either 
before adult beetle emergence or when adults are feeding 
and laying eggs. It takes 1 to 3 weeks by trunk injection 
and up to 3 months by soil injection for imidacloprid to

distribute throughout the tree, depending on the tree’s 
size and health and on weather conditions. 
Can insecticide be used to treat infested trees 
instead of removing them? 
Unfortunately, no. Variability in treatments, weather 
conditions, and overall tree health can result in uneven 
insecticide distribution within a tree and prevent the 
insecticide from killing all ALB in an infested tree.  
Also, the insecticide is not effective against the later 
larval stages that spend most of their time inside the 
heartwood of the tree where treatment will not reach 
them. These

 and overall tree health can result in uneven 
insecticide distribution within a tree and prevent the 
insecticide from killing all ALB in an infested tree.  
Also, the insecticide is not effective against the later 
larval stages that spend most of their time inside the 
heartwood of the tree where treatment will not reach 
them. These larvae can continue to grow inside the 
treated tree, develop, and still emerge as adult beetles. 
All infested trees must be removed because that is the 
most effective way to completely eliminate the beetle. 
Even treated trees are removed and destroyed if they  
are later found to be infested.  
What research has been done on the use of 
imidacloprid to control ALB? 
USDA and Chinese researchers conducted lab and field 
tests in China and the United States. Out of multiple 
insecticides tested, imidacloprid proved to be most 
effective. Specifically, the testing indicated that 
imidacloprid was effective against adult beetles as     
they feed on small twigs and against young larvae           
as they feed beneath the bark. Imidacloprid has been 
very well studied for other uses as well, with many 
articles published in international, peer-reviewed 
scientific journals. 
 
How will these treatments affect the 
environment? 
Imidacloprid treatments are applied per product        
label requirements designed to protect human health 
and the environment. The precise placement of injection 
treatments and the measures used to ensure precision 
during applications help prevent potentially adverse 
environmental effects. Also, imidacloprid residues

treatments and the measures used to ensure precision 
during applications help prevent potentially adverse 
environmental effects. Also, imidacloprid residues        
are limited to the treated tree and its root area.             
The degradation process, or natural breakdown of   
these residues, further minimizes any impact on  
the environment.    
Can imidacloprid harm bees? And are there 
alternatives? 
EPA issued a preliminary risk assessment for 
imidacloprid suggesting that some aerial applications 
may harm bees. The risk assessment did not show any 
adverse effects to bees from tree trunk or soil injections. 
USDA conducted a study in Massachusetts and New York 
that demonstrated applications made to control ALB do 
not expose bees to harmful levels of imidacloprid. We 
continue to evaluate alternatives, but at this time none 
are as effective against ALB as imidacloprid.
