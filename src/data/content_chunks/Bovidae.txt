11 I, the undersigned Team Veterinarian of the  described embryo collection team,  hereinafter “ECT,” certify,  either by  direct examination or 
based  on supporting documentation in my possession  that has been separately  attested  to by an official veterinarian,  that: 
11.4 During the 12 months prior  to the collection of  embryos for  export  to the United States, there was  no clinical or pathological evidence of 
brucellosis or  tuberculosis (TB)  found in the donor dams  or on any premises  on which the donor  dams  were located during that  time. 
11.5 During the 60 days prior to the collection of embryos for export  to the United States,  the donor dams were not corralled, pastured,  or held 
with animals of  lesser  health status  or under any restrictions which  would make them ineligible as embryo  donors for  export  to the United 
States. 
11.6 During the 60 days prior to the collection of  embryos for export to the United States, the  donor dams were inspected  at least once and 
appeared  healthy  and were found clinically free  of contagious  or communicable  diseases.  
11.7 Each of the donors  were examined  on the day of  embryo collection  and appeared  healthy and  were clinically  free of  contagious  or 
communicable  diseases.  
11.8 The donor dams originated from herds officially free of tuberculosis  and
