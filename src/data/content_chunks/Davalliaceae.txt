 35 species: mostly in tropical and subtropical Asia, a few species extending to Africa, one species in NW Africa, SW Europe, and Macaronesia; four genera and 17 species (three endemic) in China.One of us (Nooteboom) considers that only one genus,Davallia, can be recognized in the Davalliaceae.Paradavallodes multidentatais nested inAraiostegia+Davallodes, which is a polymorphic basal clade. Among species examined,A. hymenophylloides(Blume) Copeland is the type ofAraiostegia, andP. multidentatais the type ofParadavallodes. Therefore, the earliest published-Davallodes(Copeland) Copeland-should be used as the generic name. However, from morphology and DNA there are no arguments to recognize this genus. TheHumataclade looks quite distinct as an entity, although it containsDavallia corniculata, renamed toH. corniculataby Kato, and in all other systems this is aDavallia. Tsutsumi, Zhang and Kato did not analyzeD. wagnerianaCopeland and included it inDavallia, but morphologically this is the closest relative ofD. corniculata. It should belong toHumata; or better,Humatais part ofDavallia(Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008).However, two of us (Xing and Wang) consider that morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies do not support there being only one genus (e.g., Sen, Sen & Holttum, Kew Bull. 27: 217-243. 1972; Kato and Tsutsumi, Acta Phytotax.

Geobot. 59: 1-14. 2008; and Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008). A recent study about the leaf epidermis and spore morphology of Davalliaceae (He Chunmei, A taxonomic revision of Davalliaceae in China. Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou. 2012) also supportsAraiostegia,Humata, andParadavallodesas natural genera.Polyploidy, through hybridization and polyploidization, has been assessed in theHumatagroup, and these polyploids appeared to be apomictic. This could very well also be the case in other groups. With only cpDNA, the phylogeny of a group like this cannot be assessed. Moreover, in Davalliaceae, incongruence between CpDNA and nrDNA is found on the generic level but is not yet explained (C. W. Chen et al., Insights into Evolutionary History of theHumata repensComplex in Taiwan. 5th Symp. Asian Pteridol. Fern Show: Progr. & Abstr. 42. 2010; C. W.
