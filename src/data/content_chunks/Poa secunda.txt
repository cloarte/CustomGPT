Sandberg bluegrass

Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a native bluegrass occurring generally throughout the NorthernPlains and Western States. It is a bunchgrass reaching to 24 inches underoptimum conditions. Leaves are rather sparse. The grass starts growth early inspring and matures and dries in midsummer. While green, and even after drying,the foliage is quite palatable, so it is a valuable range grass. Seedgermination is usually low. Sandberg is usually seeded in combination withlater growing grasses to obtain maximum pasturage over a long  season.
