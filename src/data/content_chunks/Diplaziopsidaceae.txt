25.Diplaziopsidaceae肠蕨科 chang jue keAuthors:He Zhaorong&Masahiro KatoPlants medium-sized or large, usually in forests near or beside streams. Rhizomes decumbent to erect, thick. Lamina 1-pinnate, imparipinnate, with pinnae entire, glabrous; veins free on either side of midrib, fully anastomosing toward margins and forming 2-4 rows of areoles, without included free veinlets. Sori elongate along long veins close to midrib, covered by a similarly elongate, membranous indusium; indusia usually 3-8 mm, sometimes up to 1-2 cm, arched, sausage-shaped. Spores with winglike fimbriate and echinate folds, or low perforate plain folds.x= 41, 40 or 31.Three genera and five species: tropical America, tropical, subtropical, and temperate Asia; one genus and three species in China.Based on molecular evidence (R. Sano et al., Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 15: 403-413. 2000; Wei et al., Acta Bot. Yunnan., suppl. 17: 46-54. 2010), the family Diplaziopsidaceae consisting ofDiplaziopsisandHomalosorusSmall ex Pichi Sermolli (and provisionallyHemidictyumC. Presl) was proposed by X. C.
