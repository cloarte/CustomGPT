1. Introduction 
 
 
 
 
 
Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) develops New Pest Response Guidelines 
(NPRGs) in preparation for potential pest introductions. This document is based 
on the best information available at the time of development and may not reflect 
the latest state of knowledge at the time the pest is detected. In addition, PPQ’s 
response must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each pest introduction 
event, which cannot be predicted. Therefore, this document provides only general 
guidelines that can be used as a basis for developing a situation-specific response 
plan at the time a new pest is detected.

♦ Anastrepha spp. are estimated to cause losses of 25-80% in various crops 
in Central and South America. 
♦ Anastrepha spp. can have one or more generations per year. Adult 
populations peak when host fruiting peaks. 
♦ Anastrepha spp. primarily spread as adults through flight or as larvae 
through movement of infested fruit.  
♦ For the majority of Anastrepha spp., identification is morphological and 
based primarily on female ovipositor characteristics and wing patterns. 
♦ Several insecticides offer close to 100% control; bait sprays containing 
malathion or spinosad insecticides are recommended for eradication. 
 
Taxonomy 
The genus Anastrepha has more than 300 recognized species belonging to 27 
species groups (Norrbom, 2022; Norrbom et al., 2018; Rodriguez et al., 2022; 
Steck et al., 2019).

Fruit flies of the genus Anastrepha are among the most damaging endemic fruit 
flies in the Americas (Aluja, 1994; Norrbom and Foote, 1989). Anastrepha spp. 
are major pests of commercially important fruit, such as mango, citrus, and guava 
(Baker et al., 1944). The genus has about a dozen economically important species 
(Aluja, 1994; Steck et al., 2019; White and Elson-Harris, 1992); these species 
cause losses in Central and South America of 25 to 80% on average (Enkerlin et 
al., 1989; Soto-Manitiu et al., 1987; Gonzalez et al, 2002, cited by Pérez Chávez 
et al., 2008). 
Among the economically important species, A. fraterculus, A. striata, A. 
serpentina, A. obliqua and A. distincta are distributed throughout Mexico and 
Central and South America (Norrbom and Foote, 1989; Steck et al., 1990). 
Anastrepha ludens is distributed primarily in Mexico and areas of higher 
elevations in Central America (Norrbom and Foote, 1989). Anastrepha grandis is 
native to South America (Silva and Malavasi, 1993), and A. suspensa is native to 
the Caribbean and established in Florida (Enkerlin et al., 1989; Greany and 
Riherd, 1993). Anastrepha curvicauda is present in Mexico, the United States 
(Florida and Texas), and Central and South America (Norrbom et al., 2018).

(Florida and Texas), and Central and South America (Norrbom et al., 2018).  
 
Biology and Ecology 
Life Cycle 
The general life cycle and basic biology of Anastrepha fruit flies are similar 
among species (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 2001; Christenson and Foote, 1960). 
However, developmental times vary and depend on the fly species, host and 
environmental conditions (Baker et al., 1944). Lower temperatures and less 
favorable hosts prolong developmental time among several species (Aluja, 1994; 
Leyva et al., 1991; Bolzan et al., 2017; Telles-Romero et al., 2011; Bolzan et al., 
2015). Anastrepha spp. have one or more generations per year (Aluja, 1994; dos 
Santos et al., 2017; Weems et al., 2012a; Garcia et al., 2003). Adult populations 
peak when host fruiting peaks (Celedonio-Hurtado et al., 1995; Soto‐Manitiu and 
Jirón, 1989; dos Santos et al., 2017; Ronchi-Teles and Da Silva, 2005; Hedström, 
1991). Diapause has not been reported in any Anastrepha spp. (Aluja et al., 2001). 
Eggs 
Most Anastrepha spp. lay eggs in mature or ripe fruit (Aluja et al., 2003; Baker et 
al., 1944; Malavasi et al., 1983; Weems, 1969). Eggs are typically inserted in fruit

Eggs 
Most Anastrepha spp. lay eggs in mature or ripe fruit (Aluja et al., 2003; Baker et 
al., 1944; Malavasi et al., 1983; Weems, 1969). Eggs are typically inserted in fruit 
Last update 23MAY2023 Anastrepha spp. 8 
skin or pulp, but some species, such as A. hamata, deposit eggs inside developing 
seeds (Aluja et al., 2001). Eggs can be laid singly (e.g., A. obliqua) or in clutches 
of up to 110 eggs (e.g., A. grandis), with clutch size dependent on fly species and 
fruit size/ripeness (Aluja et al., 2014; Aluja et al., 2001; Leyva et al., 1991). 
Females may produce hundreds of eggs during their lifetime (Bisognin et al., 
2015; Bolzan et al., 2015); for example, A. ludens has laid up to 1,400 eggs under 
laboratory conditions (Carey et al., 2005). Under favorable temperatures (73oF– 
82oF), Anastrepha eggs hatch in 2–9 days (Leyva et al., 1991; Bolzan et al., 2017; 
Dias and Lucky, 2017; Celedonio-Hurtado et al., 1988). 
Larvae 
Larvae develop inside fruit, consuming pulp and/or seeds (Aluja et al., 2001; 
Morgante et al., 1996; Plummer et al., 1941). They typically exit the fruit after it 
has fallen to the ground to pupate in soil, but some larvae may exit while

Larvae 
Larvae develop inside fruit, consuming pulp and/or seeds (Aluja et al., 2001; 
Morgante et al., 1996; Plummer et al., 1941). They typically exit the fruit after it 
has fallen to the ground to pupate in soil, but some larvae may exit while the fruit 
is still on the tree (Aluja et al., 2001). The larval period generally lasts between 2–
4 weeks (Leyva et al., 1991; Weems et al., 2012b; Celedonio-Hurtado et al., 1988; 
Weems, 1965; Dias and Lucky, 2017; Lawrence, 1979; Bolzan et al., 2017). 
Pupae 
Pupation typically occurs in soil at a depth of 1–2 inches (Aluja et al., 2001; 
Hodgson et al., 1998). Pupal development takes a variable amount of time 
depending on the species and temperature (Aluja et al., 2014; Bolzan et al., 2017; 
Telles-Romero et al., 2011). Some species may overwinter as pupae (McGrath et 
al., 2021; Thomas, 2003). 
Adults 
Adult fruit flies typically emerge during morning hours (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 
1993). After emergence, adults rest and feed on carbohydrate and protein sources 
(e.g., plant sap, rotting fruit, aphid honeydew) before becoming sexually mature 
(Aluja, 1994; Christenson and Foote, 1960). Females can reach sexual maturity 
within 7–20 days (Aluja et al., 2009; Dias et al., 2017; Dickens et al., 1982; 
Martínez et

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e.g., plant sap, rotting fruit, aphid honeydew) before becoming sexually mature 
(Aluja, 1994; Christenson and Foote, 1960). Females can reach sexual maturity 
within 7–20 days (Aluja et al., 2009; Dias et al., 2017; Dickens et al., 1982; 
Martínez et al., 1995). Males of most Anastrepha spp. aggregate in non-host trees 
to compete for females (lekking behavior) (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 1993; Aluja 
et al., 2001). However, in at least one monophagous species (A. bistrigata), males 
patrol host fruit for mating opportunities (Morgante et al., 1993). Egg laying can 
begin shortly after mating (Thomas, 2003). Daily activities (e.g., resting, feeding, 
mating, and oviposition) occur in species-specific patterns, but the timing of these 
behaviors also varies according to environmental conditions, with adults generally 
resting among foliage during the hottest part of the day (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 
1993; Aluja et al., 2001; Malavasi et al., 1983). Longevity is highly variable 
among species (Aluja et al., 2001), but A. ludens adults have been recorded living

Dispersal 
Human-Assisted Spread 
Human-assisted spread of Anastrepha spp. primarily occurs by the transport of 
infested fruit through trade or travel (Weems, 1965; EFSA, 2021; USDA-APHIS-
PPQ, 2001). Pupae in soil or packaging of fruit-bearing trees can also transport 
the pest to new areas (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2001).  
Natural Dispersal 
Members of the genus Anastrepha have varying dispersal capabilities. Prevailing 
winds aid Anastrepha dispersal and orientation (Baker and Chan, 1991; Baker et 
al., 1986). Anastrepha ludens can fly up to 23 miles within a year, but typically 
flies between 3 and 5 miles (Shaw et al., 1967), with a short-range dispersal of 
0.15 miles (Thomas and Loera-Gallardo, 1998). Similarly, A. obliqua, A. 
fraterculus, and

 1986). Anastrepha ludens can fly up to 23 miles within a year, but typically 
flies between 3 and 5 miles (Shaw et al., 1967), with a short-range dispersal of 
0.15 miles (Thomas and Loera-Gallardo, 1998). Similarly, A. obliqua, A. 
fraterculus, and A. suspensa have a general short-range dispersal of less than 0.2 
miles (Hernández et al., 2007; Kendra et al., 2010; Kovaleski et al., 1999). The 
maximum reported dispersal range for A. fraterculus and A. obliqua is 0.6 miles 
within 3–5 weeks (Kovaleski et al., 1999; Soto‐Manitiu and Jirón, 1989).

3. Pest Identification  
 
 
 
 
Species ID/Diagnostic 
Morphological  
Adults 
Adult Anastrepha are predominantly yellowish-brown flies, slightly larger than a 
house fly, with a wingspan of 0.24–0.35 inches depending on the species. The 
genus Anastrepha differs from other fruit fly genera by wing venation characters, 
yellow and brown banding on the wings and body, and the shape and length of the 
ovipositor (Fig. 3-1) (Weems, 1965, 1969, 1982; Weems and Fasulo, 2006; 
Weems, 2001). Typically, most species have an inverted 'V'-shaped marking on 
the outer half of the wings (Figs. 3-2, 3-3) (Norrbom

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 shape and length of the 
ovipositor (Fig. 3-1) (Weems, 1965, 1969, 1982; Weems and Fasulo, 2006; 
Weems, 2001). Typically, most species have an inverted 'V'-shaped marking on 
the outer half of the wings (Figs. 3-2, 3-3) (Norrbom and Foote, 1989; Weems et 
al., 2012a; Weems et al., 2012b). Females are generally larger than males (Dias 
and Lucky, 2017; Sivinski and Dodson, 1992). Identification to the species level 
is based primarily on adult female ovipositor characteristics and wing venation 
and banding (Dias and Lucky, 2017; Weems, 1963; Weems, 1965, 1982; Weems, 
1969, 2001; Norrbom et al., 2019; White and Elson-Harris, 1992).

Larvae 
Larvae are typically cylindrical and pale yellow and have a pair of well-developed 
mouth hooks (Fig. 3-5). Third instar larvae are usually 0.35–0.47 inches in length. 
Identification of several Anastrepha spp. by larval features is possible using 
scanning electron microscopy (Weems, 2001; Steck et al., 1990; Dutra et al., 
2018a; Dutra et al., 2018b; Rodriguez et al., 2022; Rodriguez et al., 2021).

Pupae 
Pupae are brown and cylindrical, measuring about 0.15–0.31 inches in length and 
up to 0.11 inches in diameter depending upon the species (Greene, 1929). 
Molecular 
Molecular identification of some Anastrepha spp. can be done through DNA 
sequencing of the COI gene (Barr et al., 2018) or a portion of the ITS2 gene (Barr 
et al., 2017).

be difficult to detect during early infestation (EFSA, 2021). The most obvious 
sign of infestation is the presence of larvae inside the fruit and exit holes on the 
fruit (Fig. 3-6). Anastrepha ludens infestation may change the color of grapefruit 
(Baker et al., 1944).

4. Delimitation Survey 
 
 
 
 
Introduction 
Delimitation surveys are used to determine the extent of the infested area after a 
detection has been confirmed. The criteria for initiating a delimitation survey are 
determined by the specific response triggers for Anastrepha spp. developed by 
USDA-APHIS Fruit Fly Exclusion and Detection Program (see Emergency 
Response Triggers). Refer to the USDA-APHIS Fruit Fly Exclusion and 
Detection Program Website for updated information regarding quarantine 
information, program updates and reviews, and additional resources. 
 
Delimitation Area 
The standard delimitation area for Anastrepha spp. is a 9 x 9-mile square grid (81 
square miles) around the initial detection. The delimitation area will be expanded 
if there are additional detections within the original

 for updated information regarding quarantine 
information, program updates and reviews, and additional resources. 
 
Delimitation Area 
The standard delimitation area for Anastrepha spp. is a 9 x 9-mile square grid (81 
square miles) around the initial detection. The delimitation area will be expanded 
if there are additional detections within the original 9 x 9-mile delimitation area 
(USDA-APHIS, 2015b). 
 
Survey Considerations 
Surveyors will need to consider the potential challenges when adjusting this 
survey to fit highly developed urban or residential landscapes with few suitable or 
accessible trapping sites. Optimize the likelihood of capture by placing traps 
within or around host plants or in green areas near high-risk introduction points. 
High-risk areas will often include airports, warehouses, nurseries, or other sites 
that are likely to move high volumes of fresh produce and other products that can 
carry pests. Surveying around these high-risk areas will require on the ground 
assessments for access and site suitability as well as permissions from property 
owners to place and maintain traps.

Emergency Response Triggers 
Anastrepha spp. are regulated pests, and their detection will trigger delimitation, 
quarantine, and/or eradication responses. The triggers for emergency response 
activities in the event of an Anastrepha spp. detection are given in Table 4-1.

Timing of Surveys 
Start delimitation surveys immediately after detecting a single wild fly, mated 
female, or immature stages of any Anastrepha spp. (see Emergency Response 
Triggers). A buffer area around the site should be established within 72 hours 
following confirmation of the initial detection. Delimitation surveys should 
continue for at least three life cycles based on the degree day requirements of the 
detected Anastrepha spp. (USDA-APHIS, 2020).

continue for at least three life cycles based on the degree day requirements of the 
detected Anastrepha spp. (USDA-APHIS, 2020).  
 
Survey Techniques for Delimitation 
Trapping 
Trapping using Multilure traps or McPhail traps is the primary method for 
detection and delimitation of adult Anastrepha spp. Multilure traps are baited with 
the two-component (2C) lure of ammonium acetate and putrescine. When 
McPhail traps are used, bait with torula yeast pellets or a liquid mixture of Nu-
Lure, borax, and water (USDA-APHIS, 2015a, 2015b). Refer to the National 
Exotic Fruit Fly Detection Trapping Guidelines for detailed instructions on the 
preparation of attractant bait mixtures and trap setup. 
Last update 23MAY2023 Anastrepha spp. 17 
Trap Density 
The recommended delimitation survey design for Anastrepha spp. consists of a 1 
square mile core area around the initial detection, surrounded by four concentric 
buffer areas comprising a total of 81 square miles (Fig. 4-1). Place traps in the 
core and four buffer areas with an 80-40-20-10-5 array of traps per square mile 
(Table 4-2) (USDA-APHIS, 2015b). 
Trap Placement 
Whenever possible, traps should be placed on host trees (see Hosts), in the upper 
two-thirds of the canopy (Fig. 4-2a). Prioritize host trees with mature or ripe fruits 
when placing traps. Hang traps near ripe or ripening

Trap Placement 
Whenever possible, traps should be placed on host trees (see Hosts), in the upper 
two-thirds of the canopy (Fig. 4-2a). Prioritize host trees with mature or ripe fruits 
when placing traps. Hang traps near ripe or ripening fruits and foliage, but do not 
place in dense foliage that may block the trap entrance (Fig 4-2b). Hang traps 
high enough so that they are out of reach (Fig. 4-2c). Distribute traps evenly based 
on the host tree distribution (USDA-APHIS, 2015a).

Fruit Sampling 
Fruit sampling is required to determine if the detected species has started 
reproducing in the area. Randomly collect 100 or more preferred host fruits (if 
available, see Hosts) from the initial detection site and visually inspect for 
possible signs of oviposition. If there are no visible signs, cut open the fruits and 
inspect for larval presence. Take care not to miss any early larval instars that 
might be feeding immediately under the skin of fruits. If two or more flies are 
trapped in the vicinity, fruit inspection may be expanded to cover all preferred 
host trees within a 656 ft (200 m) radius of detection. Fruit should not be moved 
from the site of detection during inspection and sampled fruits must be destroyed 
(see Fruit Removal) (USDA-APHIS, 2015b; USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021). 
 
Delimitation Survey 
To delimit Anastrepha spp. infestation using a core and buffer grid design: 
1. Identify and survey the core area. 
a. Using a map or mapping software, establish a one-square mile core 
area around the initial detection site (Fig. 4-3). 
b. Place 80 traps in the core area. Increase existing trap density to 80 
traps/square mile, for example, if there are already five traps in the 
area, add 75 more to achieve a total of 80 traps in the area.

Figure 4-3 Trapping in the core area requires 80 traps.  
 
c. Distribute the traps evenly throughout the core area based on the host 
tree distribution patterns (see Trap Placement). 
d. If multiple flies are detected within the existing core area, do not 
expand the core area. 
e. If an additional detection is made outside the initial core area, establish 
a new core area around the detection with 80 traps per square mile. 
f. Service traps daily for the first week following detection. If there are 
no additional detections, service traps weekly and keep in place 
according to the guidelines in Timing of Surveys. 
2. Identify and survey the buffer area 
a. Using a map or mapping software, establish four concentric buffer 
areas moving outward from the core. 
b. Place traps with a density of 40-20-10-5 traps per square mile in 
successive buffer areas, moving outward from the core (Table 4-2). 
c. Distribute the traps evenly throughout the buffer area based on the host 
tree distribution patterns (see Trap Placement).  
d. If no new detections are made in the core or buffer areas, continue 
delimitation survey for three generations of the detected Anastrepha 
spp.

5. Eradication and Control 
Options 
 
 
 
Overview 
This information can be used by PPQ decision-makers after an eradication or 
quarantine-triggering detection to determine the best course of action to eradicate 
the incursion of Anastrepha spp. most expeditiously. The efficacy and feasibility 
of each control option will depend on the pest situation at the time of detection. 
Factors, such as where the pest is detected (i.e., natural or urban environments, 
agricultural crops, greenhouses), how widespread the pest is, the climatic region, 
the time of year, the

pp. most expeditiously. The efficacy and feasibility 
of each control option will depend on the pest situation at the time of detection. 
Factors, such as where the pest is detected (i.e., natural or urban environments, 
agricultural crops, greenhouses), how widespread the pest is, the climatic region, 
the time of year, the phenology of the hosts, and current practices already in 
place, contribute to determining whether a particular control option is appropriate. 
 
Eradication and Control Options 
A combination of the following mitigation options can be used in a systems 
approach to eradicate Anastrepha spp. These protocols are based on the USDA-
APHIS preferred alternative for the eradication of these fruit flies (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2021). Mitigation options include: 
♦ Host fruit removal to target immature stages. 
♦ Chemical control using insecticide-based foliar bait spray treatments to 
target adults and soil drenching with insecticide to prevent larvae or 
pupae maturing to adults. 
♦ Regulatory quarantine procedures to prevent the spread of Anastrepha 
spp. 
Public Notification 
Before the eradication process begins, inform the public and potentially affected 
industries about the eradication and quarantine process via press releases, 
meetings, or any other appropriate forms of communication. Notify residents, 
owners or operators of groves, vendors, nurseries, and other related industries 
whose property will be impacted at least 48 hours in advance of treatment or fruit 
removal (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021; USDA-APHIS, 2015b).

Fruit Removal 
Strip all host fruits within a 656 ft (200 m) radius of the site where the 
eradication-triggering detection(s) occurred. Destroy stripped host fruits either by 
bagging in heavy-duty plastic bags, burying them at an approved landfill at least 
one foot deep, or by incineration (USDA-APHIS, 2001, 2018).  
Chemical Control Options

** Registered in the United States, but no commercial products available for fruit flies.  
Foliar Bait Spray Treatments 
Apply foliar bait spray insecticides either as a targeted ground treatment within a 
0.3 mile radius of each detection site or as an aerial treatment to orchards growing 
Anastrepha hosts (see Hosts, Chemical Control Options). Protein hydrolysate 
(derived from plants or yeast) is generally recommended as the bait. (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2021).  
Soil Drenching  
Soil drenching kills developing pupae in the soil. Apply approved insecticides 
(see Chemical Control Options) within existing driplines under host trees within a 
1312 ft radius of the detection (USDA-APHIS

 generally recommended as the bait. (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2021).  
Soil Drenching  
Soil drenching kills developing pupae in the soil. Apply approved insecticides 
(see Chemical Control Options) within existing driplines under host trees within a 
1312 ft radius of the detection (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021). 
Regulatory Quarantine Procedures 
Regulatory quarantine procedures and controlling movement of host materials 
from the quarantine areas will limit the spread of Anastrepha spp. from infested 
areas. If an infestation is confirmed and Emergency Response Triggers for 
quarantine are met, state program personnel will issue ‘hold orders’ on all infested 
properties and an emergency quarantine will be established (USDA-APHIS, 
2015b; USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021). 
Any area that falls within a 4.5 mile radius of a confirmed infestation will be 
treated as a quarantine area (USDA-APHIS, 2015b). Quarantines will remain in 
effect for three Anastrepha life cycles from the date of the last detection, until 
eradication is declared (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021; USDA-APHIS, 2015b). 
Regulatory Phytosanitary Treatment 
Post-harvest phytosanitary measures may be required to kill fruit flies from the 
quarantine areas. These measures include cold and hot water treatments, 
irradiation with gamma rays and fumigation with methyl bromide (IPPC, 2019).

Introduction 
Use Appendix A as a guide to environmental regulations pertinent to Anastrepha 
spp. 
Overview 
Program managers of Federal emergency response or domestic pest control 
programs must ensure that their programs comply with all Federal Acts and 
Executive Orders pertaining to the environment, as applicable. Two primary 
Federal Acts, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA), often require the development of significant documentation 
before program actions may commence. APHIS, Policy and Program 
Development, Environmental and Risk Analysis Services (ERAS) is available to 
provide guidance to program managers and prepare drafts of applicable 
environmental documentation. PPQ’s Compliance and Environmental 
Coordination program assists ERAS in development of documents and 
implements environmental monitoring. Program leadership is strongly advised to 
consult with ERAS and/or the Compliance and Environmental Coordination 
program early in the development of a program to conduct a preliminary review 
of applicable environmental statutes and ensure timely compliance.  
Environmental monitoring of APHIS pest control activities may be required as 
part of compliance with environmental statutes, as requested

plements environmental monitoring. Program leadership is strongly advised to 
consult with ERAS and/or the Compliance and Environmental Coordination 
program early in the development of a program to conduct a preliminary review 
of applicable environmental statutes and ensure timely compliance.  
Environmental monitoring of APHIS pest control activities may be required as 
part of compliance with environmental statutes, as requested by program 
managers, or as suggested to address concerns with controversial activities. 
Monitoring may be conducted with regards to worker exposure, pesticide quality 
assurance and control, off-site chemical deposition, or program efficacy. Different 
tools and techniques are used depending on the monitoring goals and control 
techniques used in the program. Staff from ECT will work with the program 
manager to develop an environmental monitoring plan, conduct training to 
implement the plan, provide day-to-day guidance on monitoring, and provide an 
interpretive report of monitoring activities. 
The following is a list of pertinent laws and Executive Orders:

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – NEPA requires all Federal 
agencies to examine whether their actions may significantly affect the quality of 
the human environment. The purpose of NEPA is to inform the decision-maker 
prior to taking action and to inform the public of the decision. Actions that are 
excluded from this examination, actions that normally require an Environmental 
Assessment, and actions that normally require Environmental Impact Statements 
are codified in APHIS’ NEPA Implementing Procedures located in 7 CFR 372.5.

 actions that normally require an Environmental 
Assessment, and actions that normally require Environmental Impact Statements 
are codified in APHIS’ NEPA Implementing Procedures located in 7 CFR 372.5. 
The three types of NEPA documentation are: 
1. Categorical Exclusion 
Categorical exclusions are classes of actions that do not have a significant 
effect on the quality of the human environment and for which neither an 
environmental assessment (EA) nor an environmental impact statement 
(EIS) is required. Generally, the means through which adverse 
environmental impacts may be avoided or minimized have actually been 
built into the actions themselves (see 7 CFR 372.5(c)). 
2. Environmental Assessment (EA) 
An EA is a public document that succinctly presents information and 
analysis for the decision-maker of the proposed action. An EA can lead to 
the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS), a finding of 
no significant impact (FONSI), or the abandonment of a proposed action.  
3. Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
In the event that a major Federal action may significantly affect the quality 
of the human environment (adverse or beneficial), or, the proposed action 
may result in public controversy, an EIS is prepared.  
Endangered Species Act (ESA) – This statute requires that programs consider 
their potential effects on federally protected species. The ESA requires programs 
to identify protected species and their habitat in or near program areas and 
documentation of how adverse effects to these species will be avoided. The 
documentation may require review and approval by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service before program activities can 
begin. Knowingly violating this law can lead to criminal charges against 
individual staff members

to identify protected species and their habitat in or near program areas and 
documentation of how adverse effects to these species will be avoided. The 
documentation may require review and approval by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service before program activities can 
begin. Knowingly violating this law can lead to criminal charges against 
individual staff members and program managers. 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act – This statute requires that programs avoid harm to 
over 800 endemic bird species, eggs, and their nests. In some cases, permits may 
be available to capture birds, which require coordination with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
Last update 23MAY2023 Anastrepha spp. 35 
Clean Water Act – This statute requires various permits for work in wetlands 
and for potential discharges of program chemicals into water. This may require 
coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency, individual states, and the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Such permits would be required even if the 
pesticide label allows for direct application to water. 
Tribal Consultation – This Executive Order requires formal government to 
government communication if a program might have substantial direct effects on 
any federally-recognized Indian Nation. This process is often incorrectly included 
as part of the NEPA process, but it must be completed prior to general public 
involvement under NEPA. Staff should be cognizant of the conflict that could 
arise when proposed federal actions intersect with tribal sovereignty. Tribal 
consultation is designed to identify and avoid such potential conflict. 
National Historic Preservation Act – This statute requires programs to consider 
potential impacts on historic properties (such as buildings and archaeological 
sites) and requires coordination with local State Historic Preservation Offices.

consultation is designed to identify and avoid such potential conflict. 
National Historic Preservation Act – This statute requires programs to consider 
potential impacts on historic properties (such as buildings and archaeological 
sites) and requires coordination with local State Historic Preservation Offices. 
Documentation under this Act involves inventorying the project area for historic 
properties and determining what effects, if any, the project may have on them. 
This process may require public involvement and comment prior to the start of 
program activities. 
Coastal Zone Management Act – This statute requires coordination with states 
where programs may impact Coastal Zone Management Plans. Federal activities 
that may affect coastal resources are evaluated through a process called “federal 
consistency”. This process allows the public, local governments, Tribes, and state 
agencies an opportunity to review the federal action. The federal consistency 
process is administered individually by states with Coastal Zone Management 
Plans. 
Environmental Justice – This Executive Order requires consideration of 
program impacts on minority and economically disadvantaged populations. 
Compliance is usually achieved within the NEPA documentation for a project. 
Programs are required to consider if the actions might disproportionally impact 
minority or economically disadvantaged populations, and if so, how such impact 
will be avoided. 
Protection of Children –This Executive Order requires federal agencies to 
identify, assess, and address environmental health risks and safety risks that may 
disproportionately affect children. If such a risk is identified, then measures must 
be described and implemented to minimize such risks.

Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) develops New Pest Response Guidelines 
(NPRGs) in preparation for potential pest introductions. This document is based 
on the best information available at the time of development and may not reflect 
the latest state of knowledge at the time the pest is detected. In addition, PPQ’s 
response must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each pest introduction 
event, which cannot be predicted. Therefore, this document provides only general 
guidelines that can be used as a basis for developing a situation-specific response

♦ Anastrepha spp. can have one or more generations per year. Adult 
populations peak when host fruiting peaks. 
♦ Anastrepha spp. primarily spread as adults through flight or as larvae 
through movement of infested fruit.  
♦ For the majority of Anastrepha spp., identification is morphological and 
based primarily on female ovipositor characteristics and wing patterns. 
♦ Several insecticides offer close to 100% control; bait sprays containing 
malathion or spinosad insecticides are recommended for eradication. 
 
Taxonomy 
The genus Anastrepha has more than 300 recognized species belonging to 27 
species groups (Norrbom, 2022; Norrbom et al., 2018; Rodriguez et al., 2022; 
Steck et al., 2019).

Fruit flies of the genus Anastrepha are among the most damaging endemic fruit 
flies in the Americas (Aluja, 1994; Norrbom and Foote, 1989). Anastrepha spp. 
are major pests of commercially important fruit, such as mango, citrus, and guava 
(Baker et al., 1944). The genus has about a dozen economically important species 
(Aluja, 1994; Steck et al., 2019; White and Elson-Harris, 1992); these species 
cause losses in Central and South America of 25 to 80% on average (Enkerlin et 
al., 1989; Soto-Manitiu et al., 1987; Gonzalez et al, 2002, cited by Pérez Chávez 
et al., 2008). 
Among the economically important species, A. fraterculus, A. striata, A. 
serpentina, A. obliqua and A. distincta are distributed throughout Mexico and 
Central and South America (Norrbom and Foote, 1989; Steck et al., 1990). 
Anastrepha ludens is distributed primarily in Mexico and areas of higher 
elevations in Central America (Norrbom and Foote, 1989). Anastrepha grandis is 
native to South America (Silva and Malavasi, 1993), and A. suspensa is native to 
the Caribbean and established in Florida (Enkerlin et al., 1989; Greany and 
Riherd, 1993). Anastrepha curvicauda is present in Mexico, the United States 
(Florida and Texas), and Central and South America (Norrbom et al., 2018).

Biology and Ecology 
Life Cycle 
The general life cycle and basic biology of Anastrepha fruit flies are similar 
among species (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 2001; Christenson and Foote, 1960). 
However, developmental times vary and depend on the fly species, host and 
environmental conditions (Baker et al., 1944). Lower temperatures and less 
favorable hosts prolong developmental time among several species (Aluja, 1994; 
Leyva et al., 1991; Bolzan et al., 2017; Telles-Romero et al., 2011; Bolzan et al., 
2015). Anastrepha spp. have one or more generations per year (Aluja, 1994; dos 
Santos et al., 2017; Weems et al., 2012a; Garcia et al., 2003). Adult populations 
peak when host fruiting peaks (Celedonio-Hurtado et al., 1995; Soto‐Manitiu and 
Jirón, 1989; dos Santos et al., 2017; Ronchi-Teles and Da Silva, 2005; Hedström, 
1991). Diapause has not been reported in any Anastrepha spp. (Aluja et al., 2001). 
Eggs 
Most Anastrepha spp. lay eggs in mature or ripe fruit (Aluja et al., 2003; Baker et 
al., 1944; Malavasi et al., 1983; Weems, 1969). Eggs are typically inserted in fruit

Eggs 
Most Anastrepha spp. lay eggs in mature or ripe fruit (Aluja et al., 2003; Baker et 
al., 1944; Malavasi et al., 1983; Weems, 1969). Eggs are typically inserted in fruit 
Last update 23MAY2023 Anastrepha spp. 8 
skin or pulp, but some species, such as A. hamata, deposit eggs inside developing 
seeds (Aluja et al., 2001). Eggs can be laid singly (e.g., A. obliqua) or in clutches 
of up to 110 eggs (e.g., A. grandis), with clutch size dependent on fly species and 
fruit size/ripeness (Aluja et al., 2014; Aluja et al., 2001; Leyva et al., 1991). 
Females may produce hundreds of eggs during their lifetime (Bisognin et al., 
2015; Bolzan et al., 2015); for example, A. ludens has laid up to 1,400 eggs under 
laboratory conditions (Carey et al., 2005). Under favorable temperatures (73oF– 
82oF), Anastrepha eggs hatch in 2–9 days (Leyva et al., 1991; Bolzan et al., 2017; 
Dias and Lucky, 2017; Celedonio-Hurtado et al., 1988). 
Larvae 
Larvae develop inside fruit, consuming pulp and/or seeds (Aluja et al., 2001; 
Morgante et al., 1996; Plummer et al., 1941). They typically exit the fruit after it 
has fallen to the ground to pupate in soil, but some larvae may exit while

Larvae 
Larvae develop inside fruit, consuming pulp and/or seeds (Aluja et al., 2001; 
Morgante et al., 1996; Plummer et al., 1941). They typically exit the fruit after it 
has fallen to the ground to pupate in soil, but some larvae may exit while the fruit 
is still on the tree (Aluja et al., 2001). The larval period generally lasts between 2–
4 weeks (Leyva et al., 1991; Weems et al., 2012b; Celedonio-Hurtado et al., 1988; 
Weems, 1965; Dias and Lucky, 2017; Lawrence, 1979; Bolzan et al., 2017). 
Pupae 
Pupation typically occurs in soil at a depth of 1–2 inches (Aluja et al., 2001; 
Hodgson et al., 1998). Pupal development takes a variable amount of time 
depending on the species and temperature (Aluja et al., 2014; Bolzan et al., 2017; 
Telles-Romero et al., 2011). Some species may overwinter as pupae (McGrath et 
al., 2021; Thomas, 2003). 
Adults 
Adult fruit flies typically emerge during morning hours (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 
1993). After emergence, adults rest and feed on carbohydrate and protein sources 
(e.g., plant sap, rotting fruit, aphid honeydew) before becoming sexually mature 
(Aluja, 1994; Christenson and Foote, 1960). Females can reach sexual maturity 
within 7–20 days (Aluja et al., 2009; Dias et al., 2017; Dickens et al., 1982;

(e.g., plant sap, rotting fruit, aphid honeydew) before becoming sexually mature 
(Aluja, 1994; Christenson and Foote, 1960). Females can reach sexual maturity 
within 7–20 days (Aluja et al., 2009; Dias et al., 2017; Dickens et al., 1982; 
Martínez et al., 1995). Males of most Anastrepha spp. aggregate in non-host trees 
to compete for females (lekking behavior) (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 1993; Aluja 
et al., 2001). However, in at least one monophagous species (A. bistrigata), males 
patrol host fruit for mating opportunities (Morgante et al., 1993). Egg laying can 
begin shortly after mating (Thomas, 2003). Daily activities (e.g., resting, feeding, 
mating, and oviposition) occur in species-specific patterns, but the timing of these 
behaviors also varies according to environmental conditions, with adults generally 
resting among foliage during the hottest part of the day (Aluja, 1994; Aluja et al., 
1993; Aluja et al., 2001; Malavasi et al., 1983). Longevity is highly variable 
among species (Aluja et al., 2001), but A. ludens adults have been recorded living

Dispersal 
Human-Assisted Spread 
Human-assisted spread of Anastrepha spp. primarily occurs by the transport of 
infested fruit through trade or travel (Weems, 1965; EFSA, 2021; USDA-APHIS-
PPQ, 2001). Pupae in soil or packaging of fruit-bearing trees can also transport 
the pest to new areas (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2001).  
Natural Dispersal 
Members of the genus Anastrepha have varying dispersal capabilities. Prevailing 
winds aid Anastrepha dispersal and orientation (Baker and Chan, 1991; Baker et 
al., 1986). Anastrepha ludens can fly up to 23 miles within a year, but typically 
flies between 3 and 5 miles (Shaw et al., 1967), with a short-range dispersal of 
0.15 miles (Thomas and Loera-Gallardo, 1998). Similarly, A. obliqua, A. 
fraterculus, and

 1986). Anastrepha ludens can fly up to 23 miles within a year, but typically 
flies between 3 and 5 miles (Shaw et al., 1967), with a short-range dispersal of 
0.15 miles (Thomas and Loera-Gallardo, 1998). Similarly, A. obliqua, A. 
fraterculus, and A. suspensa have a general short-range dispersal of less than 0.2 
miles (Hernández et al., 2007; Kendra et al., 2010; Kovaleski et al., 1999). The 
maximum reported dispersal range for A. fraterculus and A. obliqua is 0.6 miles 
within 3–5 weeks (Kovaleski et al., 1999; Soto‐Manitiu and Jirón, 1989).

Species ID/Diagnostic 
Morphological  
Adults 
Adult Anastrepha are predominantly yellowish-brown flies, slightly larger than a 
house fly, with a wingspan of 0.24–0.35 inches depending on the species. The 
genus Anastrepha differs from other fruit fly genera by wing venation characters, 
yellow and brown banding on the wings and body, and the shape and length of the 
ovipositor (Fig. 3-1) (Weems, 1965, 1969, 1982; Weems and Fasulo, 2006; 
Weems, 2001). Typically, most species have an inverted 'V'-shaped marking on

al., 2012a; Weems et al., 2012b). Females are generally larger than males (Dias 
and Lucky, 2017; Sivinski and Dodson, 1992). Identification to the species level 
is based primarily on adult female ovipositor characteristics and wing venation 
and banding (Dias and Lucky, 2017; Weems, 1963; Weems, 1965, 1982; Weems, 
1969, 2001; Norrbom et al., 2019; White and Elson-Harris, 1992).

Larvae 
Larvae are typically cylindrical and pale yellow and have a pair of well-developed 
mouth hooks (Fig. 3-5). Third instar larvae are usually 0.35–0.47 inches in length. 
Identification of several Anastrepha spp. by larval features is possible using 
scanning electron microscopy (Weems, 2001; Steck et al., 1990; Dutra et al., 
2018a; Dutra et al., 2018b; Rodriguez et al., 2022; Rodriguez et al., 2021).

Pupae 
Pupae are brown and cylindrical, measuring about 0.15–0.31 inches in length and 
up to 0.11 inches in diameter depending upon the species (Greene, 1929).

4. Delimitation Survey 
 
 
 
 
Introduction 
Delimitation surveys are used to determine the extent of the infested area after a 
detection has been confirmed. The criteria for initiating a delimitation survey are 
determined by the specific response triggers for Anastrepha spp. developed by 
USDA-APHIS Fruit Fly Exclusion and Detection Program (see Emergency 
Response Triggers). Refer to the USDA-APHIS Fruit Fly Exclusion and 
Detection Program Website for updated information regarding quarantine 
information, program updates and reviews, and additional resources. 
 
Delimitation Area 
The standard delimitation area for Anastrepha spp. is a 9 x 9-mile square grid (81 
square miles) around the initial detection. The delimitation area will be expanded 
if there are additional detections within the original

 for updated information regarding quarantine 
information, program updates and reviews, and additional resources. 
 
Delimitation Area 
The standard delimitation area for Anastrepha spp. is a 9 x 9-mile square grid (81 
square miles) around the initial detection. The delimitation area will be expanded 
if there are additional detections within the original 9 x 9-mile delimitation area 
(USDA-APHIS, 2015b). 
 
Survey Considerations 
Surveyors will need to consider the potential challenges when adjusting this 
survey to fit highly developed urban or residential landscapes with few suitable or 
accessible trapping sites. Optimize the likelihood of capture by placing traps 
within or around host plants or in green areas near high-risk introduction points. 
High-risk areas will often include airports, warehouses, nurseries, or other sites 
that are likely to move high volumes of fresh produce and other products that can 
carry pests. Surveying around these high-risk areas will require on the ground 
assessments for access and site suitability as well as permissions from property 
owners to place and maintain traps.

Emergency Response Triggers 
Anastrepha spp. are regulated pests, and their detection will trigger delimitation, 
quarantine, and/or eradication responses. The triggers for emergency response 
activities in the event of an Anastrepha spp. detection are given in Table 4-1.

Timing of Surveys 
Start delimitation surveys immediately after detecting a single wild fly, mated 
female, or immature stages of any Anastrepha spp. (see Emergency Response 
Triggers). A buffer area around the site should be established within 72 hours 
following confirmation of the initial detection. Delimitation surveys should 
continue for at least three life cycles based on the degree day requirements of the 
detected Anastrepha spp. (USDA-APHIS, 2020).

continue for at least three life cycles based on the degree day requirements of the 
detected Anastrepha spp. (USDA-APHIS, 2020).  
 
Survey Techniques for Delimitation 
Trapping 
Trapping using Multilure traps or McPhail traps is the primary method for 
detection and delimitation of adult Anastrepha spp. Multilure traps are baited with 
the two-component (2C) lure of ammonium acetate and putrescine. When 
McPhail traps are used, bait with torula yeast pellets or a liquid mixture of Nu-
Lure, borax, and water (USDA-APHIS, 2015a, 2015b). Refer to the National 
Exotic Fruit Fly Detection Trapping Guidelines for detailed instructions on the 
preparation of attractant bait mixtures and trap setup. 
Last update 23MAY2023 Anastrepha spp. 17 
Trap Density 
The recommended delimitation survey design for Anastrepha spp. consists of a 1 
square mile core area around the initial detection, surrounded by four concentric 
buffer areas comprising a total of 81 square miles (Fig. 4-1). Place traps in the 
core and four buffer areas with an 80-40-20-10-5 array of traps per square mile 
(Table 4-2) (USDA-APHIS, 2015b). 
Trap Placement 
Whenever possible, traps should be placed on host trees (see Hosts), in the upper 
two-thirds of the canopy (Fig. 4-2a). Prioritize host trees with mature or ripe fruits 
when placing traps. Hang traps near ripe or ripening

Trap Placement 
Whenever possible, traps should be placed on host trees (see Hosts), in the upper 
two-thirds of the canopy (Fig. 4-2a). Prioritize host trees with mature or ripe fruits 
when placing traps. Hang traps near ripe or ripening fruits and foliage, but do not 
place in dense foliage that may block the trap entrance (Fig 4-2b). Hang traps 
high enough so that they are out of reach (Fig. 4-2c). Distribute traps evenly based 
on the host tree distribution (USDA-APHIS, 2015a).

Fruit Sampling 
Fruit sampling is required to determine if the detected species has started 
reproducing in the area. Randomly collect 100 or more preferred host fruits (if 
available, see Hosts) from the initial detection site and visually inspect for 
possible signs of oviposition. If there are no visible signs, cut open the fruits and 
inspect for larval presence. Take care not to miss any early larval instars that 
might be feeding immediately under the skin of fruits. If two or more flies are 
trapped in the vicinity, fruit inspection may be expanded to cover all preferred 
host trees within a 656 ft (200 m) radius of detection. Fruit should not be moved 
from the site of detection during inspection and sampled fruits must be destroyed 
(see Fruit Removal) (USDA-APHIS, 2015b; USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021). 
 
Delimitation Survey 
To delimit Anastrepha spp. infestation using a core and buffer grid design: 
1. Identify and survey the core area. 
a. Using a map or mapping software, establish a one-square mile core 
area around the initial detection site (Fig. 4-3). 
b. Place 80 traps in the core area. Increase existing trap density to 80 
traps/square mile, for example, if there are already five traps in the 
area, add 75 more to achieve a total of 80 traps in the area.

Figure 4-3 Trapping in the core area requires 80 traps.  
 
c. Distribute the traps evenly throughout the core area based on the host 
tree distribution patterns (see Trap Placement). 
d. If multiple flies are detected within the existing core area, do not 
expand the core area. 
e. If an additional detection is made outside the initial core area, establish 
a new core area around the detection with 80 traps per square mile. 
f. Service traps daily for the first week following detection. If there are 
no additional detections, service traps weekly and keep in place 
according to the guidelines in Timing of Surveys. 
2. Identify and survey the buffer area 
a. Using a map or mapping software, establish four concentric buffer 
areas moving outward from the core. 
b. Place traps with a density of 40-20-10-5 traps per square mile in 
successive buffer areas, moving outward from the core (Table 4-2). 
c. Distribute the traps evenly throughout the buffer area based on the host 
tree distribution patterns (see Trap Placement).  
d. If no new detections are made in the core or buffer areas, continue 
delimitation survey for three generations of the detected Anastrepha 
spp.

5. Eradication and Control 
Options 
 
 
 
Overview 
This information can be used by PPQ decision-makers after an eradication or 
quarantine-triggering detection to determine the best course of action to eradicate 
the incursion of Anastrepha spp. most expeditiously. The efficacy and feasibility 
of each control option will depend on the pest situation at the time of detection. 
Factors, such as where the pest is detected (i.e., natural or urban environments, 
agricultural crops, greenhouses), how widespread the pest is, the climatic region, 
the time of year, the

pp. most expeditiously. The efficacy and feasibility 
of each control option will depend on the pest situation at the time of detection. 
Factors, such as where the pest is detected (i.e., natural or urban environments, 
agricultural crops, greenhouses), how widespread the pest is, the climatic region, 
the time of year, the phenology of the hosts, and current practices already in 
place, contribute to determining whether a particular control option is appropriate. 
 
Eradication and Control Options 
A combination of the following mitigation options can be used in a systems 
approach to eradicate Anastrepha spp. These protocols are based on the USDA-
APHIS preferred alternative for the eradication of these fruit flies (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2021). Mitigation options include: 
♦ Host fruit removal to target immature stages. 
♦ Chemical control using insecticide-based foliar bait spray treatments to 
target adults and soil drenching with insecticide to prevent larvae or 
pupae maturing to adults. 
♦ Regulatory quarantine procedures to prevent the spread of Anastrepha 
spp. 
Public Notification 
Before the eradication process begins, inform the public and potentially affected 
industries about the eradication and quarantine process via press releases, 
meetings, or any other appropriate forms of communication. Notify residents, 
owners or operators of groves, vendors, nurseries, and other related industries 
whose property will be impacted at least 48 hours in advance of treatment or fruit 
removal (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021; USDA-APHIS, 2015b).

bagging in heavy-duty plastic bags, burying them at an approved landfill at least 
one foot deep, or by incineration (USDA-APHIS, 2001, 2018).  
Chemical Control Options 
Insecticide classes listed in Table 5-1 are reported to be effective against various

Foliar Bait Spray Treatments 
Apply foliar bait spray insecticides either as a targeted ground treatment within a 
0.3 mile radius of each detection site or as an aerial treatment to orchards growing 
Anastrepha hosts (see Hosts, Chemical Control Options). Protein hydrolysate 
(derived from plants or yeast) is generally recommended as the bait. (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2021).  
Soil Drenching  
Soil drenching kills developing pupae in the soil. Apply approved insecticides 
(see Chemical Control Options) within existing driplines under host trees within a 
1312 ft radius of the detection (USDA-APHIS

 generally recommended as the bait. (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2021).  
Soil Drenching  
Soil drenching kills developing pupae in the soil. Apply approved insecticides 
(see Chemical Control Options) within existing driplines under host trees within a 
1312 ft radius of the detection (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021). 
Regulatory Quarantine Procedures 
Regulatory quarantine procedures and controlling movement of host materials 
from the quarantine areas will limit the spread of Anastrepha spp. from infested 
areas. If an infestation is confirmed and Emergency Response Triggers for 
quarantine are met, state program personnel will issue ‘hold orders’ on all infested 
properties and an emergency quarantine will be established (USDA-APHIS, 
2015b; USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021). 
Any area that falls within a 4.5 mile radius of a confirmed infestation will be 
treated as a quarantine area (USDA-APHIS, 2015b). Quarantines will remain in 
effect for three Anastrepha life cycles from the date of the last detection, until 
eradication is declared (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2021; USDA-APHIS, 2015b). 
Regulatory Phytosanitary Treatment 
Post-harvest phytosanitary measures may be required to kill fruit flies from the 
quarantine areas. These measures include cold and hot water treatments, 
irradiation with gamma rays and fumigation with methyl bromide (IPPC, 2019).

Introduction 
Use Appendix A as a guide to environmental regulations pertinent to Anastrepha 
spp. 
Overview 
Program managers of Federal emergency response or domestic pest control 
programs must ensure that their programs comply with all Federal Acts and 
Executive Orders pertaining to the environment, as applicable. Two primary 
Federal Acts, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA), often require the development of significant documentation 
before program actions may commence. APHIS, Policy and Program 
Development, Environmental and Risk Analysis Services (ERAS) is available to 
provide guidance to program managers and prepare drafts of applicable 
environmental documentation. PPQ’s Compliance and Environmental 
Coordination program assists ERAS in development of documents and 
implements environmental monitoring. Program leadership is strongly advised to 
consult with ERAS and/or the Compliance and Environmental Coordination 
program early in the development of a program to conduct a preliminary review 
of applicable environmental statutes and ensure timely compliance.  
Environmental monitoring of APHIS pest control activities may be required as 
part of compliance with environmental statutes, as requested

plements environmental monitoring. Program leadership is strongly advised to 
consult with ERAS and/or the Compliance and Environmental Coordination 
program early in the development of a program to conduct a preliminary review 
of applicable environmental statutes and ensure timely compliance.  
Environmental monitoring of APHIS pest control activities may be required as 
part of compliance with environmental statutes, as requested by program 
managers, or as suggested to address concerns with controversial activities. 
Monitoring may be conducted with regards to worker exposure, pesticide quality 
assurance and control, off-site chemical deposition, or program efficacy. Different 
tools and techniques are used depending on the monitoring goals and control 
techniques used in the program. Staff from ECT will work with the program 
manager to develop an environmental monitoring plan, conduct training to 
implement the plan, provide day-to-day guidance on monitoring, and provide an 
interpretive report of monitoring activities. 
The following is a list of pertinent laws and Executive Orders:

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – NEPA requires all Federal 
agencies to examine whether their actions may significantly affect the quality of 
the human environment. The purpose of NEPA is to inform the decision-maker 
prior to taking action and to inform the public of the decision. Actions that are 
excluded from this examination, actions that normally require an Environmental 
Assessment, and actions that normally require Environmental Impact Statements 
are codified in APHIS’ NEPA Implementing Procedures located in 7 CFR 372.5. 
The three types of NEPA documentation are: 
1. Categorical Exclusion

 actions that normally require an Environmental 
Assessment, and actions that normally require Environmental Impact Statements 
are codified in APHIS’ NEPA Implementing Procedures located in 7 CFR 372.5. 
The three types of NEPA documentation are: 
1. Categorical Exclusion 
Categorical exclusions are classes of actions that do not have a significant 
effect on the quality of the human environment and for which neither an 
environmental assessment (EA) nor an environmental impact statement 
(EIS) is required. Generally, the means through which adverse 
environmental impacts may be avoided or minimized have actually been 
built into the actions themselves (see 7 CFR 372.5(c)). 
2. Environmental Assessment (EA) 
An EA is a public document that succinctly presents information and 
analysis for the decision-maker of the proposed action. An EA can lead to 
the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS), a finding of 
no significant impact (FONSI), or the abandonment of a proposed action.  
3. Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
In the event that a major Federal action may significantly affect the quality 
of the human environment (adverse or beneficial), or, the proposed action 
may result in public controversy, an EIS is prepared.  
Endangered Species Act (ESA) – This statute requires that programs consider 
their potential effects on federally protected species. The ESA requires programs 
to identify protected species and their habitat in or near program areas and 
documentation of how adverse effects to these species will be avoided. The 
documentation may require review and approval by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service before program activities can 
begin. Knowingly violating this law can lead to criminal charges against 
individual staff members

to identify protected species and their habitat in or near program areas and 
documentation of how adverse effects to these species will be avoided. The 
documentation may require review and approval by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service before program activities can 
begin. Knowingly violating this law can lead to criminal charges against 
individual staff members and program managers. 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act – This statute requires that programs avoid harm to 
over 800 endemic bird species, eggs, and their nests. In some cases, permits may 
be available to capture birds, which require coordination with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
Last update 23MAY2023 Anastrepha spp. 35 
Clean Water Act – This statute requires various permits for work in wetlands 
and for potential discharges of program chemicals into water. This may require 
coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency, individual states, and the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Such permits would be required even if the 
pesticide label allows for direct application to water. 
Tribal Consultation – This Executive Order requires formal government to 
government communication if a program might have substantial direct effects on 
any federally-recognized Indian Nation. This process is often incorrectly included 
as part of the NEPA process, but it must be completed prior to general public 
involvement under NEPA. Staff should be cognizant of the conflict that could 
arise when proposed federal actions intersect with tribal sovereignty. Tribal 
consultation is designed to identify and avoid such potential conflict. 
National Historic Preservation Act – This statute requires programs to consider 
potential impacts on historic properties (such as buildings and archaeological 
sites) and requires coordination with local State Historic Preservation Offices.

consultation is designed to identify and avoid such potential conflict. 
National Historic Preservation Act – This statute requires programs to consider 
potential impacts on historic properties (such as buildings and archaeological 
sites) and requires coordination with local State Historic Preservation Offices. 
Documentation under this Act involves inventorying the project area for historic 
properties and determining what effects, if any, the project may have on them. 
This process may require public involvement and comment prior to the start of 
program activities. 
Coastal Zone Management Act – This statute requires coordination with states 
where programs may impact Coastal Zone Management Plans. Federal activities 
that may affect coastal resources are evaluated through a process called “federal 
consistency”. This process allows the public, local governments, Tribes, and state 
agencies an opportunity to review the federal action. The federal consistency 
process is administered individually by states with Coastal Zone Management 
Plans. 
Environmental Justice – This Executive Order requires consideration of 
program impacts on minority and economically disadvantaged populations. 
Compliance is usually achieved within the NEPA documentation for a project. 
Programs are required to consider if the actions might disproportionally impact 
minority or economically disadvantaged populations, and if so, how such impact 
will be avoided. 
Protection of Children –This Executive Order requires federal agencies to 
identify, assess, and address environmental health risks and safety risks that may 
disproportionately affect children. If such a risk is identified, then measures must 
be described and implemented to minimize such risks.
