Magness et al. 1971
This is a vigorous sod-forming perennial native in the Southeastern andSouthern Plains States. Plants grow up to 3 feet on strong soil, with numerousleaves 6 to 12 inches long and 0.25 inch wide. The grass grows throughout thewinter producing abundant, nutritious pasture which is highly palatable. Thisis a valuable species where native, but seeding is difficult. The species isdioecious, with male and female plants. It produces only limited quantities ofseed which is covered with woolly hairs that are difficult to remove.Consequently, establishment of stands for agricultural use is limited.
