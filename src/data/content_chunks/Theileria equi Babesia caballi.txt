2022 Equine Piroplasmosis (EP) 
Annual Report  
 
 
Background 
Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a foreign animal disease in the United States and is immediately 
reportable to state and federal animal health officials. The disease can be contracted by any equid 
(horses, donkeys, mules, or zebra) and is caused by infection with blood-borne parasites, either 
Theileria equi or Babesia caballi.  While natural tick-borne transmission of the disease is not 
currently present on the U.S. mainland, sporadic cases of iatrogenic transmission (human-caused 
by medical procedures) in high-risk populations, such as Quarter Horse racehorses, are being 
documented.   
Unhygienic practices being used by horse owners and trainers in this high-risk population are 
contributing to disease spread and include the re-use of needles, syringes, and intravenous 
administration sets between horses, administration of illegal blood products from other countries, 
direct blood transfusion between horses to increase athletic performance (blood doping), and 
administration of multi-dose drug products that have become blood-contaminated by non-sterile 
handling techniques between horses.  In addition to transmitting EP between horses, these 
practices are concurrently transmitting other blood-borne equine diseases, such as equine 
infectious anemia (EIA).  A source of continued EP incursion into the U.S. is the illegal 
movement of horses from EP-endemic regions, such as Mexico.   
Active surveillance for EP occurs in the U.S. through testing to enter sanctioned racetracks, 
export, interstate movement

 diseases, such as equine 
infectious anemia (EIA).  A source of continued EP incursion into the U.S. is the illegal 
movement of horses from EP-endemic regions, such as Mexico.   
Active surveillance for EP occurs in the U.S. through testing to enter sanctioned racetracks, 
export, interstate movement, and diagnostic testing.  Traceback and cohort testing on all exposed 
horses is conducted in response to any EP-positive case found.  Horses confirmed as EP-positive 
have the following disposition options:  lifetime quarantine, euthanasia, export from the country, 
or long-term quarantine with enrollment in the EP-treatment program.  Horses enrolled in the 
treatment program must be confirmed as permanently cleared of the EP pathogen and test EP-
negative on all available diagnostic tests to be released from quarantine.   
Summary of 2022 Testing and EP-Positive Cases 
• There were 19,831 domestic U.S. horses tested for EP from January to December 2022 and a 
total of 23 new EP-infected horses were identified in 8 states.  Fifteen (15) of these horses 
were Quarter Horse (QH) racehorses with iatrogenic transmission involved in the 
epidemiology of the infection, 1 horse was a 2-year-old unraced colt born to a T.equi-infected 
QH race mare where in utero transmission is suspected, and 7 horses (1 Andalusian, 1 
warmblood, 3 Argentinian Polo Ponies, 1 QH saddle horse, 1 grade saddle horse) were 
suspected or confirmed to have been illegally moved from Mexico.  Three (3) of the 23 EP-
positive horses were found to be dual infected with EIA which was likely transmitted by
