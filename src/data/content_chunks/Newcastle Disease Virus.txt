(vNDV) 
 
 
Case Definition 
 
1.  General disease/pathogen information 
Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious and often fatal disease that affects over 250 bird species 
that is caused by infection with virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (vNDV). Clinical signs 
vary and can include respiratory, neurological, reproductive, and intestinal signs. The severity of 
disease produced varies with the host species and the strain of the virus, with chickens being 
the most susceptible and waterfowl the least susceptible. In humans, the virus causes a 
temporary mild conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms. The World Organization for Animal 
Health (OIE) has defined ND (historically called Exotic Newcastle disease [END] in the United 
States) as an OIE-notifiable disease, based on its potential for rapid spread, serious economic 
consequences, and impact on the international trade of poultry and poultry products. 
1.1.  Etiologic Agent: Newcastle disease virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus 
also known as avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1). It is a member of the family 
Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus. There are many different serotypes of avian 
paramyxovirus, with APMV-1 being the most important for poultry. APMV-1 viruses are 
categorized into five pathotypes according to the OIE, which characterize virulence as 
well as tropism:  asymptomatic (no apparent disease), lentogenic (low virulence 
viruses), mesogenic (moderate virulence), and viscerotropic vs neurotropic velogenic

 the most important for poultry. APMV-1 viruses are 
categorized into five pathotypes according to the OIE, which characterize virulence as 
well as tropism:  asymptomatic (no apparent disease), lentogenic (low virulence 
viruses), mesogenic (moderate virulence), and viscerotropic vs neurotropic velogenic 
(virulent) based upon pathogenicity experiments performed in chickens.  While these 
definitions remain important descriptors, APMV-1 viruses are currently reported in the 
U.S. as either low virulent (e.g. lentogenic viruses) or virulent (comprising mesogenic 
and velogenic viruses). The OIE defines Newcastle disease as an infection with a vNDV 
characterized by either an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 0.7 or greater in 
day-old chickens, or the presence of multiple basic amino acids at positions 113- 116 of 
the C-terminus of the fusion (F2) protein (either arginine (R) or lysine (K)), plus 
phenylalanine (F) at residue 117 of the F1 protein. 
1.2.  Distribution:  ND is endemic in a number of countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. 
Commercial poultry in the U.S. and Canada are free of vNDV. Outbreaks of vNDV 
occurred in California, Nevada, and Arizona in 2002-2003 and in Texas in 2003. Virulent 
NDV has not been detected in U.S. commercial poultry since 2003. 
1.3.  Clinical signs: Clinical signs can vary significantly from high levels of morbidity and 
mortality to sub-clinical infections depending on viral strain, host species, age of host,

, Nevada, and Arizona in 2002-2003 and in Texas in 2003. Virulent 
NDV has not been detected in U.S. commercial poultry since 2003. 
1.3.  Clinical signs: Clinical signs can vary significantly from high levels of morbidity and 
mortality to sub-clinical infections depending on viral strain, host species, age of host, 
co-infection with other organisms, physiologic and environmental stress, and immune 
status. General clinical signs include respiratory distress, decreased egg production, 
depression, neurological signs, and diarrhea.

1.3.1. Chickens: Chickens are one of the most susceptible species to disease caused by 
vNDV infection. Poorly protected or unprotected flocks infected with vNDV 
typically experience high death losses within 24-48 hours with no apparent 
clinical signs. Birds that survive beyond 12-14 days may experience permanent 
neurological signs and/or permanent reproductive impairment. Vaccinated birds 
often experience marked drops in egg production with eggs that are misshapen, 
abnormally pale, rough, or thin-shelled with watery albumin. Infections with low 
virulent strains typically cause respiratory signs, decreased feed and water 
consumption, and a small decline in egg production. 
Virulent strains may be viscerotropic or neurotropic. Viscerotropic strains cause 
hemorrhagic lesions in the intestinal tract, with conjunctival edema (at 2-3 days) 
and depression, and may result in sudden death regardless of vaccination

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, decreased feed and water 
consumption, and a small decline in egg production. 
Virulent strains may be viscerotropic or neurotropic. Viscerotropic strains cause 
hemorrhagic lesions in the intestinal tract, with conjunctival edema (at 2-3 days) 
and depression, and may result in sudden death regardless of vaccination 
status. Infection with neurotropic strains causes neurologic signs such as 
muscular tremors, leg and wing paralysis, torticollis, and opisthotonos, with 
death after 5-7 days. It is important to note that viscerotropic strains may also 
cause neurologic signs such as muscle tremors and torticollis; however, 
neurotropic strains rarely cause gastrointestinal hemorrhagic lesions in absence 
of other pathogens.  
1.3.2. Turkeys: In general, turkeys tend to be less susceptible to APMV-1 infections. 
When infected, they may experience high morbidity, but clinical disease is less 
severe and mortality is lower. 
1.3.3. Other birds: Upland game birds occasionally have severe clinical signs when 
affected with vNDV.  Psittacine species exhibit variable susceptibility to vNDV 
and have the potential to chronically shed virus.  
1.3.4. Species-adapted strains: APMV-1 viruses from pigeons are variants referred to 
as pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV-1). While these viruses typically have virulent 
fusion cleavage sites, chickens infected with PPMV-1 demonstrate variable 
clinical disease; however, if found in poultry, these viruses are reportable under 
the current OIE definition. A species-adapted virus is also found in double

as pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV-1). While these viruses typically have virulent 
fusion cleavage sites, chickens infected with PPMV-1 demonstrate variable 
clinical disease; however, if found in poultry, these viruses are reportable under 
the current OIE definition. A species-adapted virus is also found in double 
crested cormorants. These lineages are distinguishable by genomic sequence. 
1.4. Incubation period: The incubation period in poultry ranges from 2-15 days with an 
average of 2-6 days in chickens infected with virulent strains. Time until disease onset 
depends upon host species, viral strain and dose, age and immune status of the host, 
presence of other infections, and environmental conditions.  
1.5.  Differential diagnosis: The differential diagnosis for Newcastle disease includes other 
causes of septicemia, enteritis, respiratory disease, and/or neurological disease. 
1.5.1. Viral diseases: highly pathogenic avian influenza, laryngotracheitis, fowl pox 
(diphtheritic form), Pacheco’s disease, avian metapneumovirus, infectious 
bronchitis.  
1.5.2. Bacterial diseases: fowl cholera, psittacosis (chlamydiosis), mycoplasmosis, 
salmonellosis (especially in pet birds), botulism (especially in cormorants)  
1.5.3. Other: aspergillosis, management errors such as deprivation of water, feed, air

1.6.  Transmission and reservoir:  Transmission can occur directly and indirectly from 
infected birds to susceptible birds. Infection can occur through direct contact with fecal 
excretions and respiratory secretions of infected birds. Contaminated feed, water, 
premises, and other fomites allow for indirect transmission. Vaccinated poultry may 
serve as a source of transmission if acutely infected and introduced to a susceptible 
flock. Virus can be shed throughout the incubation period and into convalescence. 
Illegally imported psittacine species, some of which may not show clinical signs, have 
served as sources of vNDV infection to domestic poultry.  Survival of NDV in the 
environment is prolonged from days to months in the presence of organic matter, and 
up to years in feather follicles or temperatures <0C. However, the virus is destroyed 
rapidly by dehydration and by the ultraviolet rays in sunlight. 
1.7.  Epidemiology: Morbidity of unvaccinated chickens infected with vNDV strains can 
reach 100 percent, and mortality ranges from 70-100 percent. Many other avian 
diseases present with clinical signs similar to vNDV; therefore, laboratory testing is 
necessary to distinguish between diseases. The virulence of the affecting strain is also 
important and OIE-designated assays should be performed to determine virulence of 
vNDV; virulent strains can be maintained in pigeons

 70-100 percent. Many other avian 
diseases present with clinical signs similar to vNDV; therefore, laboratory testing is 
necessary to distinguish between diseases. The virulence of the affecting strain is also 
important and OIE-designated assays should be performed to determine virulence of 
vNDV; virulent strains can be maintained in pigeons and cormorants. Viruses of low 
virulence may be detected as US poultry are typically vaccinated with live NDV vaccines 
and other low virulence viruses may circulate in wild birds, especially wild waterfowl. 
 
2. Laboratory criteria: OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 
2018, Chapter 2.3.14. Newcastle Disease.  
2.1.  Agent isolation and identification: Samples of choice are tracheal, oropharyngeal, or 
cloacal swabs (or feces) from live birds. From dead birds, tissues (lung, spleen, trachea, 
intestine, and brain) as well as pools of organs and feces, are appropriate specimens. 
Tests include the isolation or culture of the virus in embryonated chicken eggs 
(appropriate cell culture may be used per the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests), and real-
time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for detection of the 
virus or the viral genome. Viral isolates can be identified by the hemagglutination (HA), 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. APMV-1 viruses, especially those with moderate to high titers, 
may cross-react in the HI tests with other APMV viruses,

 can be identified by the hemagglutination (HA), 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. APMV-1 viruses, especially those with moderate to high titers, 
may cross-react in the HI tests with other APMV viruses, most specifically APMV-2, -3, 
and -7. 
2.2.  Pathogenicity Assessment:  The intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in 24-40-hour-
old chicks from specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs is the definitive assessment for 
virulence per OIE.  The OIE allows for confirmation of virus virulence by amino acid 
sequence analysis of the fusion protein cleavage site, but molecular methods are not 
sufficient evidence for lack of virulence. 
2.3.  Serological tests: Use clotted blood or serum for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay     
(ELISA) or HI. Antibodies are detectable 6 to 10 days after infection.

3.3. Confirmed positive case: Domesticated bird or flock from which: 
3.3.1. vNDV has been identified at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories 
(NVSL) by:  
3.3.1.1. Presumptive positive (as in 3.2) with confirmation of multiple basic amino 
acids (either directly via protein or by deduction through sequencing) in 
the fusion gene at the C-terminus of the F2 protein and phenylalanine at 
residue 117, which is the N-terminus of the F-1 protein. The term ‘multiple 
basic amino acids’ refers to at least three arginine or lysine residues 
between residues 113 and 116; AND/OR 
Failure to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of amino acid residues as 
described above would require virus isolation and further characterization 
by an in vivo test.

INTRODUCTION 
An Infected Zone and Buffer Zone (Control Area) will be created around an Infected Premises. This 
document provides surveillance guidance for non-commercial backyard poultry1 premises within a 
Control Area. Surveillance activities and associated testing should be based on recommendations 
of the Unified (State-Federal) Incident Command; this guidance may require further modification 
based on epidemiological and situational information. 
 
Newcastle disease, caused by vNDV, is endemic in a number of countries in Asia, the Middle East, 
Africa, and the Americas. Newcastle disease was detected in backyard poultry in California in 2018.

Newcastle disease, caused by vNDV, is endemic in a number of countries in Asia, the Middle East, 
Africa, and the Americas. Newcastle disease was detected in backyard poultry in California in 2018. 
Previous ND outbreaks in poultry the United States occurred in the States of California (2002–
2003), Nevada (2003), Arizona (2003) and Texas (2003). Virulent NDV is endemic in wild 
cormorants and non-virulent forms of ND are endemic in poultry.  There are non-virulent strains of 
NDV endemic in poultry. This document reflects the epidemiological information known about the 
behavior of vNDV from knowledge gained in the 2003–2004 U.S. outbreak.   
 
                                                            
1 For this document, ‘poultry’ is defined as any domesticated bird raised for food, eggs, or fiber and used in exhibitions or 
shows. This includes chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, swans, pheasants, partridges, grouse, quail, guinea fowl, pea fowl, 
pigeons, doves, ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries.

PRIORITIES FOR SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES IN THE CONTROL AREA 
 
Passive Surveillance 
Passive surveillance is conducted at all times in the United States through foreign animal disease 
investigations per VS Guidance Document 12001. In the event of a foreign animal disease 
detection, passive surveillance should be intensified through rapid and clear communication to all 
producers in the Control Area. 
 
Reports of clinical signs or unusual mortality and morbidity from backyard producers (sick bird calls) 
are investigated as rapidly as possible. However, sick bird calls may overwhelm available resources, 
particularly when investigation and/or management of Infected and Contact Premises are not 
complete. In this case, the IMT may recommend triaging disease investigations on backyard 
premises using criteria such as morbidity and mortality, clinical signs for ND and risk factors for 
exposure to vNDV. These parameters should be based on the best information available, and should 
be developed in coordination with IMT, State/Tribal officials, and subject matter experts. Premises in 
the Infected Zone should be prioritized over those in the Buffer Zone.  
 
For sick bird calls on backyard premises, a Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician (or individual 
designated by the IMT) should: 
1. Immediately investigate each sick bird call, if resources allow. 
2. If necessary, prioritize the premises in the Infected Zone and prioritize the premises meeting 
the criteria for further investigation.  
3. Schedule an appointment to collect samples as quickly as possible. 
4. Conduct diagnostic testing

2. If necessary, prioritize the premises in the Infected Zone and prioritize the premises meeting 
the criteria for further investigation.  
3. Schedule an appointment to collect samples as quickly as possible. 
4. Conduct diagnostic testing according to sampling recommendations, submit samples to 
designated National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) lab as indicated by the IMT 
(provided in “Sampling Scheme for Poultry” below). 
 
Active Surveillance 
 
1. Create an inventory of the bird2 populations in the Control Area. 
a. Identify all the premises with birds in the Control Area. This can be done by phone or 
house visits.   
b. Identify any auctions, markets, or exhibitions of birds in the Control Area and consider 
sampling at these events following the sampling scheme below. 
2. Interview the owner of the premises about any birds residing on the premises.  
a. If birds are present, determine if the premises is high-risk for exposure to vNDV (see 
Table 1).  
b. Record contact with owner and risk-status of birds on the premises.  
3. Conduct a surveillance visit to the high-risk premises identified in item 2 above.  
a. Visually inspect the birds and sample following the “Recommended Bird Sampling 
Scheme” below. 
b. Prioritize visits to premises with sick or dead birds.  All premises with sick or dead 
birds should be visited.   
c. Aim to also visit all remaining high-risk premises.  However, if resources are limited,

RECOMMENDED BIRD SAMPLING SIZE AND SCHEME 
 
Select birds to sample and follow the Recommendations for Collecting Specimens from Poultry for 
Viral Diagnostic Testing (WI-AV-0020 available here) for detection of vNDV. Oropharyngeal or 
tracheal swabs are preferred for gallinaceous birds and cloacal swabs for non-gallinaceous birds3. 
Do not combine swabs from different species or different sample types.   
 
1. Select birds to sample. If there are multiple houses or flocks on the premises, sample each 
separately according to the guidelines below. Prioritize sampling of sick and dead birds 
regardless of vaccination status.  
a. For unvaccinated populations, sample two 5- or 11- swab pools. Sampling two 5- 
or 11- swab bird pools is sufficient to detect vNDV with 95 percent confidence if 
prevalence across birds is 40 percent (using an estimated test sensitivity of 91 
percent).  
• If there are fewer than 5 birds, sample all the birds
Text Len: 1501
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 unvaccinated populations, sample two 5- or 11- swab pools. Sampling two 5- 
or 11- swab bird pools is sufficient to detect vNDV with 95 percent confidence if 
prevalence across birds is 40 percent (using an estimated test sensitivity of 91 
percent).  
• If there are fewer than 5 birds, sample all the birds.   
b. For vaccinated populations, sample 30 birds using 5- or 11- swab pools. A 30-bird 
sample can detect vNDV with approximately 95 percent confidence if within-flock 
prevalence among birds considered high-risk of exposure is 10 percent (using an 
estimated test sensitivity 91 percent).  
• If there are fewer than 30 birds, sample all the birds.  
 
2. Prepare, package, and process swabs for laboratory submission according to the guidance 
found in the FAD Investigation Manual. 
3. Repeat visits and sampling on premises are not necessary, unless clinical signs continue or 
escalate.   
4. Encourage owner to call if clinical signs, morbidity, and/or mortality are observed.

DOCUMENTATION 
As with all surveillance activities, documentation is critically important. EMRS2 is the system of 
record for all virulent ND outbreaks in the United States. Relevant data regarding backyard 
surveillance activities must be entered into EMRS2 in as close to real time as possible. This data 
may be reported internally and externally through situation or close-out reports or other means. 
 
At a minimum, the following items are important to maintain and report. Refer to IMT guidance for 
how to appropriately record these and other data: 
 
 Number of backyard premises in Control Area. 
 Number contacted, and means of contact, for passive surveillance. 
 Number of visited and sampled premises for passive surveillance. 
 Number of premises contacted by phone for active surveillance. 
 Number of premises visited and sampled for active surveillance. 
 Total birds sampled per premises. 
 Laboratory results for all submissions.

Virulent Newcastle Disease Virus 
(vNDV) 
 
 
Case Definition 
 
1.  General disease/pathogen information 
Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious and often fatal disease that affects over 250 bird species 
that is caused by infection with virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (vNDV). Clinical signs 
vary and can include respiratory, neurological, reproductive, and intestinal signs. The severity of 
disease produced varies with the host species and the strain of the virus, with chickens being 
the most susceptible and waterfowl the least susceptible. In humans, the virus causes a 
temporary mild conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms. The World Organization for Animal 
Health (OIE) has defined ND (historically called Exotic Newcastle disease [END] in the United 
States) as an OIE-notifiable disease, based on its potential for rapid spread, serious economic 
consequences, and impact on the international trade of poultry and poultry products. 
1.1.  Etiologic Agent: Newcastle disease virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus 
also known as avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1). It is a member of the family 
Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus. There are many different serotypes of avian 
paramyxovirus, with APMV-1 being the most important for poultry. APMV-1 viruses are 
categorized into five pathotypes according to the OIE, which characterize virulence as 
well as tropism:  asymptomatic (no apparent disease), lentogenic (low virulence 
viruses), mesogenic (moderate virulence), and viscerotropic vs neurotropic velogenic

 the most important for poultry. APMV-1 viruses are 
categorized into five pathotypes according to the OIE, which characterize virulence as 
well as tropism:  asymptomatic (no apparent disease), lentogenic (low virulence 
viruses), mesogenic (moderate virulence), and viscerotropic vs neurotropic velogenic 
(virulent) based upon pathogenicity experiments performed in chickens.  While these 
definitions remain important descriptors, APMV-1 viruses are currently reported in the 
U.S. as either low virulent (e.g. lentogenic viruses) or virulent (comprising mesogenic 
and velogenic viruses). The OIE defines Newcastle disease as an infection with a vNDV 
characterized by either an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 0.7 or greater in 
day-old chickens, or the presence of multiple basic amino acids at positions 113- 116 of 
the C-terminus of the fusion (F2) protein (either arginine (R) or lysine (K)), plus 
phenylalanine (F) at residue 117 of the F1 protein. 
1.2.  Distribution:  ND is endemic in a number of countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. 
Commercial poultry in the U.S. and Canada are free of vNDV. Outbreaks of vNDV 
occurred in California, Nevada, and Arizona in 2002-2003 and in Texas in 2003. Virulent 
NDV has not been detected in U.S. commercial poultry since 2003. 
1.3.  Clinical signs: Clinical signs can vary significantly from high levels of morbidity and 
mortality to sub-clinical infections depending on viral strain, host species, age of host,

, Nevada, and Arizona in 2002-2003 and in Texas in 2003. Virulent 
NDV has not been detected in U.S. commercial poultry since 2003. 
1.3.  Clinical signs: Clinical signs can vary significantly from high levels of morbidity and 
mortality to sub-clinical infections depending on viral strain, host species, age of host, 
co-infection with other organisms, physiologic and environmental stress, and immune 
status. General clinical signs include respiratory distress, decreased egg production, 
depression, neurological signs, and diarrhea.

 USDA APHIS VS - 2 
 
1.3.1. Chickens: Chickens are one of the most susceptible species to disease caused by 
vNDV infection. Poorly protected or unprotected flocks infected with vNDV 
typically experience high death losses within 24-48 hours with no apparent 
clinical signs. Birds that survive beyond 12-14 days may experience permanent 
neurological signs and/or permanent reproductive impairment. Vaccinated birds 
often experience marked drops in egg production with eggs that are misshapen, 
abnormally pale, rough, or thin-shelled with watery albumin. Infections with low 
virulent strains typically cause respiratory signs, decreased feed and water 
consumption, and a small decline in egg production. 
Virulent strains may be viscerotropic or neurotropic. Viscerotropic strains cause 
hemorrhagic lesions in the intestinal tract, with conjunctival edema (at 2-3 days) 
and depression, and may result in sudden death regardless of vaccination

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, decreased feed and water 
consumption, and a small decline in egg production. 
Virulent strains may be viscerotropic or neurotropic. Viscerotropic strains cause 
hemorrhagic lesions in the intestinal tract, with conjunctival edema (at 2-3 days) 
and depression, and may result in sudden death regardless of vaccination 
status. Infection with neurotropic strains causes neurologic signs such as 
muscular tremors, leg and wing paralysis, torticollis, and opisthotonos, with 
death after 5-7 days. It is important to note that viscerotropic strains may also 
cause neurologic signs such as muscle tremors and torticollis; however, 
neurotropic strains rarely cause gastrointestinal hemorrhagic lesions in absence 
of other pathogens.  
1.3.2. Turkeys: In general, turkeys tend to be less susceptible to APMV-1 infections. 
When infected, they may experience high morbidity, but clinical disease is less 
severe and mortality is lower. 
1.3.3. Other birds: Upland game birds occasionally have severe clinical signs when 
affected with vNDV.  Psittacine species exhibit variable susceptibility to vNDV 
and have the potential to chronically shed virus.  
1.3.4. Species-adapted strains: APMV-1 viruses from pigeons are variants referred to 
as pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV-1). While these viruses typically have virulent 
fusion cleavage sites, chickens infected with PPMV-1 demonstrate variable 
clinical disease; however, if found in poultry, these viruses are reportable under 
the current OIE definition. A species-adapted virus is also found in double

as pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV-1). While these viruses typically have virulent 
fusion cleavage sites, chickens infected with PPMV-1 demonstrate variable 
clinical disease; however, if found in poultry, these viruses are reportable under 
the current OIE definition. A species-adapted virus is also found in double 
crested cormorants. These lineages are distinguishable by genomic sequence. 
1.4. Incubation period: The incubation period in poultry ranges from 2-15 days with an 
average of 2-6 days in chickens infected with virulent strains. Time until disease onset 
depends upon host species, viral strain and dose, age and immune status of the host, 
presence of other infections, and environmental conditions.  
1.5.  Differential diagnosis: The differential diagnosis for Newcastle disease includes other 
causes of septicemia, enteritis, respiratory disease, and/or neurological disease. 
1.5.1. Viral diseases: highly pathogenic avian influenza, laryngotracheitis, fowl pox 
(diphtheritic form), Pacheco’s disease, avian metapneumovirus, infectious 
bronchitis.  
1.5.2. Bacterial diseases: fowl cholera, psittacosis (chlamydiosis), mycoplasmosis, 
salmonellosis (especially in pet birds), botulism (especially in cormorants)  
1.5.3. Other: aspergillosis, management errors such as deprivation of water, feed, air

1.6.  Transmission and reservoir:  Transmission can occur directly and indirectly from 
infected birds to susceptible birds. Infection can occur through direct contact with fecal 
excretions and respiratory secretions of infected birds. Contaminated feed, water, 
premises, and other fomites allow for indirect transmission. Vaccinated poultry may 
serve as a source of transmission if acutely infected and introduced to a susceptible 
flock. Virus can be shed throughout the incubation period and into convalescence. 
Illegally imported psittacine species, some of which may not show clinical signs, have 
served as sources of vNDV infection to domestic poultry.  Survival of NDV in the 
environment is prolonged from days to months in the presence of organic matter, and 
up to years in feather follicles or temperatures <0C. However, the virus is destroyed 
rapidly by dehydration and by the ultraviolet rays in sunlight. 
1.7.  Epidemiology: Morbidity of unvaccinated chickens infected with vNDV strains can 
reach 100 percent, and mortality ranges from 70-100 percent. Many other avian 
diseases present with clinical signs similar to vNDV; therefore, laboratory testing is 
necessary to distinguish between diseases. The virulence of the affecting strain is also 
important and OIE-designated assays should be performed to determine virulence of 
vNDV; virulent strains can be maintained in pigeons

 70-100 percent. Many other avian 
diseases present with clinical signs similar to vNDV; therefore, laboratory testing is 
necessary to distinguish between diseases. The virulence of the affecting strain is also 
important and OIE-designated assays should be performed to determine virulence of 
vNDV; virulent strains can be maintained in pigeons and cormorants. Viruses of low 
virulence may be detected as US poultry are typically vaccinated with live NDV vaccines 
and other low virulence viruses may circulate in wild birds, especially wild waterfowl. 
 
2. Laboratory criteria: OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 
2018, Chapter 2.3.14. Newcastle Disease.  
2.1.  Agent isolation and identification: Samples of choice are tracheal, oropharyngeal, or 
cloacal swabs (or feces) from live birds. From dead birds, tissues (lung, spleen, trachea, 
intestine, and brain) as well as pools of organs and feces, are appropriate specimens. 
Tests include the isolation or culture of the virus in embryonated chicken eggs 
(appropriate cell culture may be used per the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests), and real-
time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for detection of the 
virus or the viral genome. Viral isolates can be identified by the hemagglutination (HA), 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. APMV-1 viruses, especially those with moderate to high titers, 
may cross-react in the HI tests with other APMV viruses,

 can be identified by the hemagglutination (HA), 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. APMV-1 viruses, especially those with moderate to high titers, 
may cross-react in the HI tests with other APMV viruses, most specifically APMV-2, -3, 
and -7. 
2.2.  Pathogenicity Assessment:  The intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in 24-40-hour-
old chicks from specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs is the definitive assessment for 
virulence per OIE.  The OIE allows for confirmation of virus virulence by amino acid 
sequence analysis of the fusion protein cleavage site, but molecular methods are not 
sufficient evidence for lack of virulence. 
2.3.  Serological tests: Use clotted blood or serum for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay     
(ELISA) or HI. Antibodies are detectable 6 to 10 days after infection.

3.3. Confirmed positive case: Domesticated bird or flock from which: 
3.3.1. vNDV has been identified at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories 
(NVSL) by:  
3.3.1.1. Presumptive positive (as in 3.2) with confirmation of multiple basic amino 
acids (either directly via protein or by deduction through sequencing) in 
the fusion gene at the C-terminus of the F2 protein and phenylalanine at 
residue 117, which is the N-terminus of the F-1 protein. The term ‘multiple 
basic amino acids’ refers to at least three arginine or lysine residues 
between residues 113 and 116; AND/OR 
Failure to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of amino acid residues as 
described above would require virus isolation and further characterization 
by an in vivo test.

Newcastle disease, caused by vNDV, is endemic in a number of countries in Asia, the Middle East, 
Africa, and the Americas. Newcastle disease was detected in backyard poultry in California in 2018. 
Previous ND outbreaks in poultry the United States occurred in the States of California (2002–
2003), Nevada (2003), Arizona (2003) and Texas (2003). Virulent NDV is endemic in wild 
cormorants and non-virulent forms of ND are endemic in poultry.  There are non-virulent strains of 
NDV endemic in poultry. This document reflects the epidemiological information known about the 
behavior of vNDV from knowledge gained in the 2003–2004 U.S. outbreak.   
 
                                                            
1 For this document, ‘poultry’ is defined as any domesticated bird raised for food, eggs, or fiber and used in exhibitions or 
shows. This includes chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, swans, pheasants, partridges, grouse, quail, guinea fowl, pea fowl, 
pigeons, doves, ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries.

PRIORITIES FOR SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES IN THE CONTROL AREA 
 
Passive Surveillance 
Passive surveillance is conducted at all times in the United States through foreign animal disease 
investigations per VS Guidance Document 12001. In the event of a foreign animal disease 
detection, passive surveillance should be intensified through rapid and clear communication to all 
producers in the Control Area. 
 
Reports of clinical signs or unusual mortality and morbidity from backyard producers (sick bird calls) 
are investigated as rapidly as possible. However, sick bird calls may overwhelm available resources, 
particularly when investigation and/or management of Infected and Contact Premises are not 
complete. In this case, the IMT may recommend triaging disease investigations on backyard 
premises using criteria such as morbidity and mortality, clinical signs for ND and risk factors for 
exposure to vNDV. These parameters should be based on the best information available, and should 
be developed in coordination with IMT, State/Tribal officials, and subject matter experts. Premises in 
the Infected Zone should be prioritized over those in the Buffer Zone.  
 
For sick bird calls on backyard premises, a Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician (or individual 
designated by the IMT) should: 
1. Immediately investigate each sick bird call, if resources allow. 
2. If necessary, prioritize the premises in the Infected Zone and prioritize the premises meeting 
the criteria for further investigation.  
3. Schedule an appointment to collect samples as quickly as possible. 
4. Conduct diagnostic testing

2. If necessary, prioritize the premises in the Infected Zone and prioritize the premises meeting 
the criteria for further investigation.  
3. Schedule an appointment to collect samples as quickly as possible. 
4. Conduct diagnostic testing according to sampling recommendations, submit samples to 
designated National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) lab as indicated by the IMT 
(provided in “Sampling Scheme for Poultry” below). 
 
Active Surveillance 
 
1. Create an inventory of the bird2 populations in the Control Area. 
a. Identify all the premises with birds in the Control Area. This can be done by phone or 
house visits.   
b. Identify any auctions, markets, or exhibitions of birds in the Control Area and consider 
sampling at these events following the sampling scheme below. 
2. Interview the owner of the premises about any birds residing on the premises.  
a. If birds are present, determine if the premises is high-risk for exposure to vNDV (see 
Table 1).  
b. Record contact with owner and risk-status of birds on the premises.  
3. Conduct a surveillance visit to the high-risk premises identified in item 2 above.  
a. Visually inspect the birds and sample following the “Recommended Bird Sampling 
Scheme” below. 
b. Prioritize visits to premises with sick or dead birds.  All premises with sick or dead 
birds should be visited.   
c. Aim to also visit all remaining high-risk premises.  However, if resources are limited,

RECOMMENDED BIRD SAMPLING SIZE AND SCHEME 
 
Select birds to sample and follow the Recommendations for Collecting Specimens from Poultry for 
Viral Diagnostic Testing (WI-AV-0020 available here) for detection of vNDV. Oropharyngeal or 
tracheal swabs are preferred for gallinaceous birds and cloacal swabs for non-gallinaceous birds3. 
Do not combine swabs from different species or different sample types.   
 
1. Select birds to sample. If there are multiple houses or flocks on the premises, sample each 
separately according to the guidelines below. Prioritize sampling of sick and dead birds 
regardless of vaccination status.  
a. For unvaccinated populations, sample two 5- or 11- swab pools. Sampling two 5- 
or 11- swab bird pools is sufficient to detect vNDV with 95 percent confidence if 
prevalence across birds is 40 percent (using an estimated test sensitivity of 91 
percent).  
• If there are fewer than 5 birds, sample all the birds
Text Len: 1501
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 unvaccinated populations, sample two 5- or 11- swab pools. Sampling two 5- 
or 11- swab bird pools is sufficient to detect vNDV with 95 percent confidence if 
prevalence across birds is 40 percent (using an estimated test sensitivity of 91 
percent).  
• If there are fewer than 5 birds, sample all the birds.   
b. For vaccinated populations, sample 30 birds using 5- or 11- swab pools. A 30-bird 
sample can detect vNDV with approximately 95 percent confidence if within-flock 
prevalence among birds considered high-risk of exposure is 10 percent (using an 
estimated test sensitivity 91 percent).  
• If there are fewer than 30 birds, sample all the birds.  
 
2. Prepare, package, and process swabs for laboratory submission according to the guidance 
found in the FAD Investigation Manual. 
3. Repeat visits and sampling on premises are not necessary, unless clinical signs continue or 
escalate.   
4. Encourage owner to call if clinical signs, morbidity, and/or mortality are observed.

* Assuming a 95% herd-level sensitivity, sampling the indicated number of premises will result in 0.95 probability that at least 
one positive premises will be detected if the prevalence of virulent Newcastle disease virus is at least 0.5% or 1% in the 
population of premises at the time of sample collection.  
 
 
DOCUMENTATION 
As with all surveillance activities, documentation is critically important. EMRS2 is the system of 
record for all virulent ND outbreaks in the United States. Relevant data regarding backyard 
surveillance activities must be entered into EMRS2 in as close to real time as possible. This data 
may be reported internally and externally through situation or close-out reports or other means. 
 
At a minimum, the following items are important to maintain and report. Refer to IMT guidance for 
how to appropriately record these and other data: 
 
 Number of backyard premises in Control Area. 
 Number contacted, and means of contact, for passive surveillance. 
 Number of visited and sampled premises for passive surveillance. 
 Number of premises contacted by phone for active surveillance. 
 Number of premises visited and sampled for active surveillance. 
 Total birds sampled per premises. 
 Laboratory results for all submissions.
