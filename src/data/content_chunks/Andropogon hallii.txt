Sand bluestem

Hack.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a sod-forming grass native from North Dakota and Montana south to Texas and Arizona. It generally resembles big bluestem but differs in having a hairypanicle (the seed head) and more vigorous rhizomes, resulting in more rapid and extensive lateral spread. Stems reach up to 7 feet under the best conditions.It is found mainly on deep, sandy soils and is a valuable range grass on suchsoil.
