Overview
Appearance
Dianthus armeria
is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant growing to 1-2.5 ft. (0.3-0.8 m) tall.
Foliage
They have patches of fine white hairs beneath each opposite pair of leaves, otherwise they are mostly glabrous. The opposite leaves are up to 3 in. (1.6 cm) long and 0.13 in. (0.32 cm) across. They are linear, sessile, and usually slightly pubescent. The base of each pair of leaves wraps around the stem in a sheath, where the stem is somewhat broader and knobby.
Flowers
Each flower is about 0.33 in. (0.85 cm) across, consisting of 5 spreading petals, a tubular green calyx with 5 teeth, 10 stamens with pink anthers, and 2 styles. The petals are pink with small white dots. Each petal is wedge-shaped at its base, and crenate or dentate toward its outer edge.
Fruit
Each seed is orbicular or rein form and flattened with small bumps across its surface. The root system consists of a slender taproot. This plant spreads by reseeding itself.
Ecological Threat
This plant will over take roadsides, ditches and fields.
