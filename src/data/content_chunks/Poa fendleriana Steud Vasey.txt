Mutton bluegrass
Gramineae
Poa fendleriana
(Steud.) Vasey
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This grass is native from the Great Lakes westward to the CascadeMountains and south into Mexico. It is a perennial bunchgrass with erect stemsup to 24 inches tall. It develops tillers at the base and rarely produces shortrhizomes. Leaves are mainly basal, are rather firm and stiff. They are foldedor inrolled, rarely flat. The species grows under a wide range of conditionsincluding elevations to near the top of the Rocky Mountains. It is also foundamong sagebrush and in open timber stands. It is well adapted to dry slopes andis found on clay loam as well as sandy or gravelly soils. It is droughtresistant, palatable and nutritious, and starts growth very early. Even the drygrowth is grazed well. These characteristics make it a valuable range crrass.The name reflects the value sheepmen place on the grass for sheep feed.
