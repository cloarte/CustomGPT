Epilobium ciliatumRafin. - American Willowherb  -Onagraceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This tall and fairly robust species of willowherb is an accidental introduction from North America.

By the 1990s it was being noted as a common plant of weedy places, streamsides, garden nurseries, disused railways etc.Hybrids with other willowherbs such as marsh willowherb (Epilobium palustre), New Zealand willowherb (E. brunnescens) and broad-leaved willowherb (E. montanum) have been reported at various places on occasions.All names:Epilobium ciliatumRafin.;Epilobium adenocaulonHausskn.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
