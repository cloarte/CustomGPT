 Invasion: P. pinasteris a relatively large tree, 20-40 m tall, with an average diameter at breast height (dbh) at maturity of 35-40 cm. Crowns of old trees are wide and flat and the bole is clear over most of its length. Plantation trees have long, clean cylindrical stems in contrast to those of open-grown individual trees where trunks are broad at the base with a pronounced taper and increased branching. It has a deep tap root with secondary roots well-developed. The bark is thick, deeply fissured and dark red-brown. Needles are spiny, stout, stiff but not rigid, frequently twisted, occurring in pairs, with a vivid green colour. Flowers appear between late winter and mid-spring; male flowers usually abundant, clustered in shallow rings beneath the leaves with pollen shed in early spring. Female flowers occur on the tips of expanding shoots and are dull red in colour. Cones are nearly sessile, very oblique at the base, slightly curved ovoid-conic; shiny light-brown with scales and a broad transverse ridge rising to a central, small, upcurved prickle. Cones ripen between late summer and autumn, persisting closed on the tree for several years.

 Reproduccion: Genetics P. pinaster shows a high degree of genetic variation over its native range. Some authors recognize as many as five different races corresponding to several geographical locations in Western Europe, the Mediterranean region and North Africa. Most of that variation has some kind of expression in growth characteristics, stem straightness and taper, fine branching and frost resistance. A high degree of heritability was evident, particularly for stem form, as well as for the chemical characteristics of resin monoterpenes. Provenances from Portugal, northwestern Spain and southwestern France ( P. pinaster subsp. atlantica ) exhibited faster growth than those from the Mediterranean, inland Spain or Morocco (mainly P. pinaster subsp . pinaster ). However, some provenances of the latter group have a remarkably straight stem (e.g., the Corsican race), or a notable adaptation to summer drought and limestone substrates regardless of their lack of vigour (e.g., the

. atlantica ) exhibited faster growth than those from the Mediterranean, inland Spain or Morocco (mainly P. pinaster subsp . pinaster ). However, some provenances of the latter group have a remarkably straight stem (e.g., the Corsican race), or a notable adaptation to summer drought and limestone substrates regardless of their lack of vigour (e.g., the Moroccan race from Tamjout), as compared to provenances of the former group. A Portuguese provenance from Leiria (central coastal Portugal) was genetically improved in Western Australia, South Africa and Portugal, allowing a growth gain estimated to be 20%, as well as an improvement of about 40% for stem form. Physiology and Phenology P. pinaster is fast-growing until it reaches an age of 60 years old, when annual growth rate usually decline. Flowers appear between late winter and mid-spring, and cones ripen between late summer and autumn, persisting closed on the tree for several years. Reproductive Biology This species has monoecious flowers ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). It is difficult to establish the age from which P. pinaster starts to produce fertile seeds because this factor varies with geographic location. In general, however, flowering may begin at about 6 years old, but regular seed production commences only at 10-15 years of age. Large quantities of seed are produced ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). The cones are serotinous meaning that they are able to withstand the fire that may kill the parent tree, and be stimulated to subsequently release the seeds ( Macdonald and Richardson, 1986 ). According to Dean et al. (1986) the duration of seed viability is approximately one year. Environmental Requirements P. pinaster tolerates different climate conditions depending on the subspecies. In general, it occurs naturally in warm temperate regions including the Mediterranean area, with an oceanic influence on climate, mainly in humid and sub-humid areas, where

 seeds ( Macdonald and Richardson, 1986 ). According to Dean et al. (1986) the duration of seed viability is approximately one year. Environmental Requirements P. pinaster tolerates different climate conditions depending on the subspecies. In general, it occurs naturally in warm temperate regions including the Mediterranean area, with an oceanic influence on climate, mainly in humid and sub-humid areas, where annual rainfall is greater than 600 mm. In spite of that, it is possible for trees to survive in areas with only 400 mm annual precipitation, providing that there is sufficient atmospheric moisture. In particular, the southern provenances ( P. pinaster subsp . pinaster ) may grow well in semi-arid conditions. However, it will grow best in areas with a mean annual precipitation of 850 mm, with at least 75 mm in the period between May and September. In its native range it only withstands a maximum of 100 consecutive days without rainfall, but when used in plantations in some areas it can tolerate a maximum of 150 days of drought. Maritime pine cannot tolerate shade, and grows best at low and medium altitudes. P. pinaster may be found in both flat and mountainous sites in its native range, but usually at low to moderate altitudes. The subspecies atlantica is less tolerant of high altitude than the subspecies pinaster . It seems to prefer siliceous soils with a coarse texture, especially sandy soils, but it can tolerate other soil types. The subspecies pinaster can tolerate some calcareous soils, especially when they have a coarse texture and are free-draining, whereas subsp. atlantica , however, has a low tolerance to limestone soils, and exhibits a clear preference for sandy silicate soils, and has played an important role in the afforestation of loose sand dunes along the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula especially in northern and central Portugal.

It has adapted well to a substrate of silicate origin with low aggregation, poor in major nutrients and organic matter. Afforestation of these areas was undertaken during the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s, and played a major role in dune consolidation and soil improvement. Similarly, the Landes region of southwestern France, with sandy soils, has been extensively planted with P. pinaster . In South Africa, a study of four invasive pines found that soil pH was the most important predictor for the distribution of isolated trees, whereas the establishment of dense pine stands was largely determined by fire history ( Rouget et al., 2001 ).

 Invasion: P. pinasteris a relatively large tree, 20-40 m tall, with an average diameter at breast height (dbh) at maturity of 35-40 cm. Crowns of old trees are wide and flat and the bole is clear over most of its length. Plantation trees have long, clean cylindrical stems in contrast to those of open-grown individual trees where trunks are broad at the base with a pronounced taper and increased branching. It has a deep tap root with secondary roots well-developed. The bark is thick, deeply fissured and dark red-brown. Needles are spiny, stout, stiff but not rigid, frequently twisted, occurring in pairs, with a vivid green colour. Flowers appear between late winter and mid-spring; male flowers usually abundant, clustered in shallow rings beneath the leaves with pollen shed in early spring. Female flowers occur on the tips of expanding shoots and are dull red in colour. Cones are nearly sessile, very oblique at the base, slightly curved ovoid-conic; shiny light-brown with scales and a broad transverse ridge rising to a central, small, upcurved prickle. Cones ripen between late summer and autumn, persisting closed on the tree for several years.

 Reproduccion: Genetics P. pinaster shows a high degree of genetic variation over its native range. Some authors recognize as many as five different races corresponding to several geographical locations in Western Europe, the Mediterranean region and North Africa. Most of that variation has some kind of expression in growth characteristics, stem straightness and taper, fine branching and frost resistance. A high degree of heritability was evident, particularly for stem form, as well as for the chemical characteristics of resin monoterpenes. Provenances from Portugal, northwestern Spain and southwestern France ( P. pinaster subsp. atlantica ) exhibited faster growth than those from the Mediterranean, inland Spain or Morocco (mainly P. pinaster subsp . pinaster ). However, some provenances of the latter group have a remarkably straight stem (e.g., the Corsican race), or a notable adaptation to summer drought and limestone substrates regardless of their lack of vigour (e.g., the

. atlantica ) exhibited faster growth than those from the Mediterranean, inland Spain or Morocco (mainly P. pinaster subsp . pinaster ). However, some provenances of the latter group have a remarkably straight stem (e.g., the Corsican race), or a notable adaptation to summer drought and limestone substrates regardless of their lack of vigour (e.g., the Moroccan race from Tamjout), as compared to provenances of the former group. A Portuguese provenance from Leiria (central coastal Portugal) was genetically improved in Western Australia, South Africa and Portugal, allowing a growth gain estimated to be 20%, as well as an improvement of about 40% for stem form. Physiology and Phenology P. pinaster is fast-growing until it reaches an age of 60 years old, when annual growth rate usually decline. Flowers appear between late winter and mid-spring, and cones ripen between late summer and autumn, persisting closed on the tree for several years. Reproductive Biology This species has monoecious flowers ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). It is difficult to establish the age from which P. pinaster starts to produce fertile seeds because this factor varies with geographic location. In general, however, flowering may begin at about 6 years old, but regular seed production commences only at 10-15 years of age. Large quantities of seed are produced ( Cronk and Fuller, 1995 ). The cones are serotinous meaning that they are able to withstand the fire that may kill the parent tree, and be stimulated to subsequently release the seeds ( Macdonald and Richardson, 1986 ). According to Dean et al. (1986) the duration of seed viability is approximately one year. Environmental Requirements P. pinaster tolerates different climate conditions depending on the subspecies. In general, it occurs naturally in warm temperate regions including the Mediterranean area, with an oceanic influence on climate, mainly in humid and sub-humid areas, where

 seeds ( Macdonald and Richardson, 1986 ). According to Dean et al. (1986) the duration of seed viability is approximately one year. Environmental Requirements P. pinaster tolerates different climate conditions depending on the subspecies. In general, it occurs naturally in warm temperate regions including the Mediterranean area, with an oceanic influence on climate, mainly in humid and sub-humid areas, where annual rainfall is greater than 600 mm. In spite of that, it is possible for trees to survive in areas with only 400 mm annual precipitation, providing that there is sufficient atmospheric moisture. In particular, the southern provenances ( P. pinaster subsp . pinaster ) may grow well in semi-arid conditions. However, it will grow best in areas with a mean annual precipitation of 850 mm, with at least 75 mm in the period between May and September. In its native range it only withstands a maximum of 100 consecutive days without rainfall, but when used in plantations in some areas it can tolerate a maximum of 150 days of drought. Maritime pine cannot tolerate shade, and grows best at low and medium altitudes. P. pinaster may be found in both flat and mountainous sites in its native range, but usually at low to moderate altitudes. The subspecies atlantica is less tolerant of high altitude than the subspecies pinaster . It seems to prefer siliceous soils with a coarse texture, especially sandy soils, but it can tolerate other soil types. The subspecies pinaster can tolerate some calcareous soils, especially when they have a coarse texture and are free-draining, whereas subsp. atlantica , however, has a low tolerance to limestone soils, and exhibits a clear preference for sandy silicate soils, and has played an important role in the afforestation of loose sand dunes along the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula especially in northern and central Portugal.

It has adapted well to a substrate of silicate origin with low aggregation, poor in major nutrients and organic matter. Afforestation of these areas was undertaken during the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s, and played a major role in dune consolidation and soil improvement. Similarly, the Landes region of southwestern France, with sandy soils, has been extensively planted with P. pinaster . In South Africa, a study of four invasive pines found that soil pH was the most important predictor for the distribution of isolated trees, whereas the establishment of dense pine stands was largely determined by fire history ( Rouget et al., 2001 ).
