 hyphae are hyaline, slender, much branched, usually with little aerial growth (Butler, 1910). The pathogen produces three types of spores. Microconidia are usually aseptate, elliptical, hyaline singly but salmon-pink in mass and measure 6-11 x 2-3 µm in diameter. They are produced on simple or clustered, vertically branched conidiophores (Holliday, 1980). In culture, however, the colour may vary from white to salmon-pink and occasionally orange-red on PSA. Macroconidia are formed on short conidiophores and detach soon after abscission. They are hyaline, three to five septate, 15-15 x 3-5 µm in size, falcate with a distinct foot cell and an apical cell of decreasing diameter towards the tip which may be curved or hooked (Holliday, 1980). The chlamydospores are oval or spherical, single or in chains, thick-walled and measure 5-10 µm in diameter.

 Reproduccion: TransmissionThe pathogen is a facultative saprobe, which survives on plant parts left in the soil. Any route by which diseased soil may be transported from infested plot to non-infested plots, including farm implements, irrigation water etc., can potentially transmit the pathogen. Dissemination of the pathogen is also possible through seedborne infection.Life CycleAfter the discovery of the perfect state of the pathogen, two phases of the disease cycle have been suggested: imperfect state (Fusarium udum) and perfect state (G. indica).

.Life CycleAfter the discovery of the perfect state of the pathogen, two phases of the disease cycle have been suggested: imperfect state (Fusarium udum) and perfect state (G. indica). In both phases of the disease, the pathogen occurs intercellularly, intracellularly and ectotrophically on the collar region as well as on the roots of infected plants. It produces a mass of mycelium and conidia. Both states of the pathogen occur simultaneously on the host. In the case of the imperfect state of the disease cycle, conidia and chlamydospores serve as resting structures for long-term survival. In the perfect state, perithecia are produced on the collar region of infected plants. The longevity of survival of the perfect state is yet to be confirmed ( Upadhyay and Rai, 1983 ). The pathogen is heterothallic. If two opposite mating types come into contact they produce perithecia. Under laboratory conditions, perithecia are produced at 25±2°C. The ascus contains eight ascospores, which are two- to three-celled. The ascospores germinate to produce macro- and microconidia (Reddy et al., 1998). The production of the perfect state of this pathogen and its role in pathogenesis needs further investigation.The pathogen survives in infected plant parts. The saprobic mycelium produces conidia. These conidia germinate at a wide range of temperatures (15-30°C) under laboratory conditions. When the germtubes come in contact with the roots of pigeon pea plants, they penetrate and colonize the xylem vessels. As the mycelium ages it produces chlamydospores which, after an initial period of dormancy, germinate and infect the roots of the plants.

As the mycelium ages it produces chlamydospores which, after an initial period of dormancy, germinate and infect the roots of the plants. During the cropping season, the ectotrophic growth of the pathogen can also occur on infected roots and the collar.EpidemologyThe fungus is soilborne on diseased plant debris and it survives only on the tissues which it colonizes as a parasite ( Subramanian, 1955 ). McRae (1924) reported that the fungus spreads about 3 m through the soil in one season, apparently along plant roots. The amount of wilt incidence was influenced by the retentive nature of the soil, but not directly by its water content ( Mitra, 1925 ; McRae, 1926 ). Mundkar (1935) reported that low soil temperature and increasing plant maturity favoured wilt. Shukla (1975) , in a pot experiment, found more wilt inoculum in sand (94%) than in heavy, black soil (18%). Singh and Bhargava (1981) found the fungal population to be highest at 30% soil water-holding capacity and at soil temperatures between 20 and 30°C.Infected seed may be the primary means of spread of F. udum over long distances and to new areas ( Haware and Kannaiyan, 1992 ). The fungus can survive on infected plant debris in the soil for about 3 years. Disease incidence is more severe on vertisols than on alfisols and ratooning predisposes the plant to wilt ( Reddy et al., 1990 ). Early sowing, weed management and vigorous crop growth favour wilt development. Long- and medium-duration types suffer more from wilt than short- and extra short-duration types (Reddy et al.,

 about 3 years. Disease incidence is more severe on vertisols than on alfisols and ratooning predisposes the plant to wilt ( Reddy et al., 1990 ). Early sowing, weed management and vigorous crop growth favour wilt development. Long- and medium-duration types suffer more from wilt than short- and extra short-duration types (Reddy et al., 1998). Though infection may occur in the seedling stage, maximum disease occurs at flowering and podding ( Reddy et al., 1990 ) due to the extended time needed by the fungus to colonize the plant. Recent work at ICRISAT has shown that infected plants wilt only after the basal half of the main stem is colonized by the fungus, which takes approximately 3-4 months ( Reddy et al., 1993a ). This explains why there are low levels of wilt in short-duration types compared to long-duration and ratooned pigeon pea, as the former morphotypes are escaping wilt (Reddy et al., 1998). Any practice which leads to increased plant biomass in pigeon pea was found to increase susceptibility to wilt ( Reddy et al., 1994 ). Higher biomass is produced when the crop is sown early, under weed-free and well-drained conditions, in fertile fields at low plant density and when the rains are well distributed.Recent work has indicated that the fungus can survive to a depth of 120 cm in soil ( Naik, 1993 ). Limited variation in the fungal population was found between the crop season and the off-season, especially at lower depth. Inoculum placed at a depth of 100 cm was found to infect pigeon pea but did not cause wilt. Only inoculum at 50 cm depth resulted in both infection and wilt ( Naik, 1993 ).

Only inoculum at 50 cm depth resulted in both infection and wilt ( Naik, 1993 ). The economic threshold level of 20% wilt incidence in a susceptible cultivar was found to vary for vertisols and alfisols, being slightly lower for alfisols (830 c.f.u./g soil) than for vertisols (920 c.f.u./g soil). Threshold levels were higher for tolerant cultivars than for susceptible cultivars. The initial inoculum level in soil was found to be the major factor influencing final wilt incidence compared to soil moisture and temperature.Pathogen VariabilityMany studies have shown the existence of races of the pathogen ( Baldev and Amin, 1974 ; Shit and Gupta, 1978 ; Reddy and Chaudhary, 1985 ; Pawar and Mayee, 1986 ; Gupta et al., 1988; Reddy and Raju, 1992 ) but a systematic study of the classification and distribution is lacking. This is largely due to the lack of a standardized inoculation technique, a set of differential lines and a rating scale.
 Sintomas: Pigeon pea plants are susceptible to infection by the wilt pathogen at all stages of development. The main symptom of the disease is wilting characterized by gradual, sometimes sudden, yellowing, withering and drying of leaves followed by drying of entire plant or some of its branches ( Singh, 1973 ). Such plants exhibit loss of leaf turgidity, interveinal clearing and chlorosis before death. Isolated wilted plants may appear about a month after sowing and patches of dead plants in the field, usually at the flowering and podding stage, are the first indication of wilt ( Reddy et al., 1990 ).

Isolated wilted plants may appear about a month after sowing and patches of dead plants in the field, usually at the flowering and podding stage, are the first indication of wilt ( Reddy et al., 1990 ). The characteristic symptom of the disease in the adult plants is a purple band extending upwards from the base of the main stem. The band can clearly be seen in pigeon pea, when the green stems of healthy plants are compared to the diseased stems with coloured lines. Partial wilting is quite common and distinguishes the disease from termite damage, drought and Phytophthora blight, which also kill the plants. Partial wilting is due to infection of lateral roots, while total wilt is a result of tap root infection ( Reddy et al., 1990 ). If an infected plant is split open below the purple band, browning of the stem and brown to black discoloration of xylem vessels is visible. Sometimes lower branches show die-back with the purple band extending from the tip downward and intensive xylem blackening ( Reddy et al., 1993b ).

When the germtubes come in contact with the roots of pigeon pea plants, they penetrate and colonize the xylem vessels. As the mycelium ages it produces chlamydospores which, after an initial period of dormancy, germinate and infect the roots of the plants. During the cropping season, the ectotrophic growth of the pathogen can also occur on infected roots and the collar.EpidemologyThe fungus is soilborne on diseased plant debris and it survives only on the tissues which it colonizes as a parasite ( Subramanian, 1955 ). McRae (1924) reported that the fungus spreads about 3 m through the soil in one season, apparently along plant roots. The amount of wilt incidence was influenced by the retentive nature of the soil, but not directly by its water content ( Mitra, 1925 ; McRae, 1926 ). Mundkar (1935) reported that low soil temperature and increasing plant maturity favoured wilt. Shukla (1975) , in a pot experiment, found more wilt inoculum in sand (94%) than in heavy, black soil (18%). Singh and Bhargava (1981) found the fungal population to be highest at 30% soil water-holding capacity and at soil temperatures between 20 and 30°C.Infected seed may be the primary means of spread of F. udum over long distances and to new areas ( Haware and Kannaiyan, 1992

94%) than in heavy, black soil (18%). Singh and Bhargava (1981) found the fungal population to be highest at 30% soil water-holding capacity and at soil temperatures between 20 and 30°C.Infected seed may be the primary means of spread of F. udum over long distances and to new areas ( Haware and Kannaiyan, 1992 ). The fungus can survive on infected plant debris in the soil for about 3 years. Disease incidence is more severe on vertisols than on alfisols and ratooning predisposes the plant to wilt ( Reddy et al., 1990 ). Early sowing, weed management and vigorous crop growth favour wilt development. Long- and medium-duration types suffer more from wilt than short- and extra short-duration types (Reddy et al., 1998). Though infection may occur in the seedling stage, maximum disease occurs at flowering and podding ( Reddy et al., 1990 ) due to the extended time needed by the fungus to colonize the plant. Recent work at ICRISAT has shown that infected plants wilt only after the basal half of the main stem is colonized by the fungus, which takes approximately 3-4 months ( Reddy et al., 1993a ). This explains why there are low levels of wilt in short-duration types compared to long-duration and ratooned pigeon pea, as the former morphotypes are escaping wilt (Reddy et al., 1998). Any practice which leads to increased plant biomass in pigeon pea was found to increase susceptibility to wilt ( Reddy et al., 1994 ). Higher biomass is produced when the crop is sown early, under weed-free and well-drained conditions, in fertile fields at low plant density and when the rains are well distributed.Recent work has indicated that the fungus can survive to a depth of 120 cm in soil ( Naik, 1993 ).

 was found to increase susceptibility to wilt ( Reddy et al., 1994 ). Higher biomass is produced when the crop is sown early, under weed-free and well-drained conditions, in fertile fields at low plant density and when the rains are well distributed.Recent work has indicated that the fungus can survive to a depth of 120 cm in soil ( Naik, 1993 ). Limited variation in the fungal population was found between the crop season and the off-season, especially at lower depth. Inoculum placed at a depth of 100 cm was found to infect pigeon pea but did not cause wilt. Only inoculum at 50 cm depth resulted in both infection and wilt ( Naik, 1993 ). The economic threshold level of 20% wilt incidence in a susceptible cultivar was found to vary for vertisols and alfisols, being slightly lower for alfisols (830 c.f.u./g soil) than for vertisols (920 c.f.u./g soil). Threshold levels were higher for tolerant cultivars than for susceptible cultivars. The initial inoculum level in soil was found to be the major factor influencing final wilt incidence compared to soil moisture and temperature.Pathogen VariabilityMany studies have shown the existence of races of the pathogen ( Baldev and Amin, 1974 ; Shit and Gupta, 1978 ; Reddy and Chaudhary, 1985 ; Pawar and Mayee, 1986 ; Gupta et al., 1988; Reddy and Raju, 1992 ) but a systematic study of the classification and distribution is lacking. This is largely due to the lack of a standardized inoculation technique, a set of differential lines and a rating scale.
