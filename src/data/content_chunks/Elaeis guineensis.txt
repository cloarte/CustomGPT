 Invasion: Elaeis guineensisis a monoecious, erect, one-stemmed palm tree, usually 20–30 m high, with an adventitious root system that forms a dense mat in the upper 35 cm of the soil with only a few roots penetrating deeper than 1 m. The stem is cylindrical, up to 75 cm in diameter and covered with petiole bases in young palms, smooth in older trees (>10–12 years old). Juvenile leaves are lanceolate and entire but gradually becoming pinnate; mature leaves spirally arranged, paripinnate, up to 7.5 m long; petiole 1–2 m long, spinescent, clasping the stem at base; leaflets linear, 35–65 x 2-4 cm, up to 376 per leaf. Inflorescences are unisexual, axillary, pedunculate, until anthesis enclosed in two fusiform or ovate spathes 10–30 cm long, with flowers 3-merous; male ones with numerous cylindrical spikes forming an ovoid body 15–25 cm long and bearing flowers with 6 stamens, connate at base, with linear anthers; female ones subglobose, 15–35 cm diameter, with numerous lanceolate, spiny bracts, each subtending a cylindrical spikelet with 10–20 spirally arranged female flowers, each with two rudimentary male flowers; stigma sessile, 3-lobed. Fruits are ovoid-oblong drupes, 2–5 cm long, tightly packed in large ovoid bunches with 1000–3000 fruits; drupes with a thin exocarp, an oleiferous mesocarp and a lignified endocarp containing the kernel with embryo and solid

 Reproduccion: Elaeis guineensis is native to Africa and it is assumed that speciation took place in that continent. However, all related species classified in the subfamily Cocoideae have a South American origin, except perhaps the coconut, Cocos nucifera , thus the archetypal ancestor may have been indigenous to the Americas. A particular feature of the E. guineensis with considerable economic consequences is the occurrence of (at least) three natural fruit types under monogenic control, which also form the basis for the classification of oil palms: Dura: homozygous (sh+ sh+) for the presence of a relatively thick endocarp (shell 2–8 mm) Tenera: heterozygous (sh+ sh-) with a relatively thin endocarp (0.5–4 mm) Pisifera: homozygous (sh- sh-) for the absence of an endocarp. There is also a Macrocarya form with the thickest endocarps 6–8 mm thick, being the most important type in West Africa and which forms a large proportion of the crop from Nigeria to Sierra Leone. The original Bogor palms and material derived from them were the thick-shelled, Dura types and as a population is generally referred to as Deli Dura. Pisifera

 also a Macrocarya form with the thickest endocarps 6–8 mm thick, being the most important type in West Africa and which forms a large proportion of the crop from Nigeria to Sierra Leone. The original Bogor palms and material derived from them were the thick-shelled, Dura types and as a population is generally referred to as Deli Dura. Pisifera is usually female-sterile and although the cause of this sterility is still unknown, it may be due to reduced protection of the developing embryo through absence of lignified endocarp tissue. Tenera is preferred as planting material because it has more oil-bearing mesocarp (60-90% per fruit weight) than Dura (20–65% per fruit weight). Within each fruit type, however, there is considerable variation apparently under polygenic control. Elucidation of single-gene inheritance of shell thickness caused interest in the Tenera fruit type (sh+ sh-) as commercial material obtained from a cross of Dura (sh+ sh+) with Pisifera (sh- sh-). Material segregating for the shell-thickness gene descended from a single Tenera palm (SP 540) in Sumatra was the major source of Pisifera for several breeding programmes. This palm probably has a common origin with material in the breeding programme at Yangambi, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), descended from nine Tenera palms. By the 1960s, major breeding programmes in Sumatra and Malaysia concentrated primarily on Deli Dura and 'Yangambi' Pisifera for the production of commercial planting material. Since then, extensive new introductions have been effected from various breeding programmes in West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM) started a systematic

ura and 'Yangambi' Pisifera for the production of commercial planting material. Since then, extensive new introductions have been effected from various breeding programmes in West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM) started a systematic programme of prospecting and collecting from oil groves in West Africa and from E. oleifera populations in South and Central America, significantly widening the basis for breeding programmes. Flowers are unisexual, with female flowers grouped in clusters of 200–300 close to the trunk at the end of short heavy pedicels, with male flowers borne in spikes. Fruits are produced 3–4 years after planting, and fruits ripen 5 or 6 months after pollination. The physiological basis of sex differentiation is not yet well understood, except that empirical evidence suggests that physiological stress conditions seem to encourage maleness. Pollination is primarily by insects. One insect pollinator, Elaeidobius kamerunicus , was successfully introduced into Malaysia and subsequently Indonesia in 1979. Before this time, oil palms in the region were wind pollinated, often requiring artificial pollination in the first few years. E. guineensis seeds are dormant after harvesting though the physiology of this dormancy is not well known. Seeds usually require temperatures of 35°C or more in order to germinate, though germination is speeded up by dry heat treatment (40°C) for 80 days followed by cooling at higher moisture contents. The stem has a single growing point from which a leaf primordium develops about every second week. Succeeding primordia are separated by a divergence angle of 137.5° (Fibonacci angle), causing leaf bases to be arranged in various sets of spirals, of which a set of eight parastichies is normally obvious.

 cooling at higher moisture contents. The stem has a single growing point from which a leaf primordium develops about every second week. Succeeding primordia are separated by a divergence angle of 137.5° (Fibonacci angle), causing leaf bases to be arranged in various sets of spirals, of which a set of eight parastichies is normally obvious. Rate of leaf production is up to 40 per year in the first 2 years, dropping to a rate of 18–24 per year from year 8 onwards. From leaf primordium to fully expanded leaf (2–10 m²) takes about 2 years. The normal photosynthetically active life of a leaf is about 2 years, so under natural conditions up to 50 leaves are present per palm. In plantations, this number is usually kept at about 40. In the first 2 years, lateral growth of the trunk dominates, giving a broad base up to 60 cm in diameter. After that, the trunk starts growing in height, 35–75 cm per year, reducing its diameter up to 40 cm. The rate of height increment and rate of leaf production appear to be independent. All leaf bases contain inflorescence primordia, but the first fully developed inflorescence does not appear before leaf 20 and usually much later, some 3 years after germination. The length of male and female phases in individual palms is very variable and irregular, but a population of palms shows clear seasonal trends. The mean interval between sex differentiation and anthesis is around 20 months, and between anthesis of female flowers and fruit ripeness 4–5 months. Fruit ripening on the bunch proceeds simultaneously from top to bottom and from outer to inner fruits and ripe fruits become detached. In well managed plantations in Malaysia and Sumatra, on soils with a reasonable availability of nutrients and a good water-holding capacity under uniform and adequate rainfall, yields of bunches of 24–32 t/ha are common.

In well managed plantations in Malaysia and Sumatra, on soils with a reasonable availability of nutrients and a good water-holding capacity under uniform and adequate rainfall, yields of bunches of 24–32 t/ha are common. Oil extraction rate from a bunch of E. guineensis fruit is 17–27% for palm oil and 4–10% for palm kernels, though figures for factory extraction rates of oil related to bunch weight are 20–22% which represents oil yields of 4.8–7 t/ha, higher than in any other oil crop. The natural environment of oil palms is the lowland humid tropics. Rainfall in its native range is 1780–2280 mm per annum with 2–4 month dry period, and although it has been recorded in areas where annual rainfall is as low as 640 mm or as high as 4200 mm ( Duke, 1983 ), these limits should be treated as exceptional. Mean maximum temperature of 30–32°C and mean minimum of 21–24°C provide suitable range, and growth may cease below 15°C. It is generally a lowland species, and grows on a wide range of tropical soils if not too acid or alkaline (pH 4-8) if sufficiently moist ( Duke, 1983 ). E. guineensis needs a good moisture supply and open areas as they cannot compete with faster-growing tree species. E. guineensis does not grow under continuous flooding but is tolerant of fluctuating water tables with periods of standing water. Hence, the natural habitats are considered to be swamps, riverbanks and other areas too wet for dicotyledonous trees of the tropical rain forest.

Under cultivation, rainfall is often the main limiting factor on production. Major areas of oil-palm cultivation are in the equatorial belt where mean annual rainfall deficits do not exceed 600–650 mm annually. Highest yields are achieved where rainfall is well distributed throughout the year with an optimum of 150 mm monthly. Little is known about temperature effects other than that oil palms grow less well at higher altitudes (above 500–600 m) and at higher latitudes (above 10°). In regions where minimum temperatures regularly drop below 20°C for prolonged periods, productivity and growth are severely reduced. E. guineensis is also affected by high temperatures, with photochemical efficiency reduced above 35°C. Elaeis guineensis can grow on a wide variety of soils ranging from sandy soils to lateritic red and yellow podzols, young volcanic soils, alluvial clays and peat soils. A major criterion for relative suitability seems to be water-holding capacity. As E. guineensis is responsive to soil nutrients, nutrient-release characteristics are also important as they affect efficiency of fertilizer use in plantations. Elaeis guineensis is adapted to lowland tropical humid climates, with regular rainfall and consistently high temperature and humidity, though may be occasionally found at its ecological extremes from savanna to rainforest, otherwise mostly in tropical dry to tropical wet forest vegetation types. Rainfall is often the major factor limiting production in plantations: highest yields occur where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, with an optimum of 150 mm per month ( Westphal and Jansen, 1989 ).

E. guineensis is also affected by high temperatures, with photochemical efficiency reduced above 35°C. In its native range, Duke (1983) reports that E. guineensis occurs wild in riverine forests or in freshwater swamps. It does not regenerate or grow well in dense natural forests as it is apparently not very competitive with other forest species, and therefore tends to be found where other forest species do not grow well. It is shade intolerant, needs adequate soil moisture and can tolerate periodic waterlogging.

 Invasion: Elaeis guineensisis a monoecious, erect, one-stemmed palm tree, usually 20–30 m high, with an adventitious root system that forms a dense mat in the upper 35 cm of the soil with only a few roots penetrating deeper than 1 m. The stem is cylindrical, up to 75 cm in diameter and covered with petiole bases in young palms, smooth in older trees (>10–12 years old). Juvenile leaves are lanceolate and entire but gradually becoming pinnate; mature leaves spirally arranged, paripinnate, up to 7.5 m long; petiole 1–2 m long, spinescent, clasping the stem at base; leaflets linear, 35–65 x 2-4 cm, up to 376 per leaf. Inflorescences are unisexual, axillary, pedunculate, until anthesis enclosed in two fusiform or ovate spathes 10–30 cm long, with flowers 3-merous; male ones with numerous cylindrical spikes forming an ovoid body 15–25 cm long and bearing flowers with 6 stamens, connate at base, with linear anthers; female ones subglobose, 15–35 cm diameter, with numerous lanceolate, spiny bracts, each subtending a cylindrical spikelet with 10–20 spirally arranged female flowers, each with two rudimentary male flowers; stigma sessile, 3-lobed. Fruits are ovoid-oblong drupes, 2–5 cm long, tightly packed in large ovoid bunches with 1000–3000 fruits; drupes with a thin exocarp, an oleiferous mesocarp and a lignified endocarp containing the kernel with embryo and solid

 Reproduccion: Elaeis guineensis is native to Africa and it is assumed that speciation took place in that continent. However, all related species classified in the subfamily Cocoideae have a South American origin, except perhaps the coconut, Cocos nucifera , thus the archetypal ancestor may have been indigenous to the Americas. A particular feature of the E. guineensis with considerable economic consequences is the occurrence of (at least) three natural fruit types under monogenic control, which also form the basis for the classification of oil palms: Dura: homozygous (sh+ sh+) for the presence of a relatively thick endocarp (shell 2–8 mm) Tenera: heterozygous (sh+ sh-) with a relatively thin endocarp (0.5–4 mm) Pisifera: homozygous (sh- sh-) for the absence of an endocarp. There is also a Macrocarya form with the thickest endocarps 6–8 mm thick, being the most important type in West Africa and which forms a large proportion of the crop from Nigeria to Sierra Leone. The original Bogor palms and material derived from them were the thick-shelled, Dura types and as a population is generally referred to as Deli Dura. Pisifera

The original Bogor palms and material derived from them were the thick-shelled, Dura types and as a population is generally referred to as Deli Dura. Pisifera is usually female-sterile and although the cause of this sterility is still unknown, it may be due to reduced protection of the developing embryo through absence of lignified endocarp tissue. Tenera is preferred as planting material because it has more oil-bearing mesocarp (60-90% per fruit weight) than Dura (20–65% per fruit weight). Within each fruit type, however, there is considerable variation apparently under polygenic control. Elucidation of single-gene inheritance of shell thickness caused interest in the Tenera fruit type (sh+ sh-) as commercial material obtained from a cross of Dura (sh+ sh+) with Pisifera (sh- sh-). Material segregating for the shell-thickness gene descended from a single Tenera palm (SP 540) in Sumatra was the major source of Pisifera for several breeding programmes. This palm probably has a common origin with material in the breeding programme at Yangambi, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), descended from nine Tenera palms. By the 1960s, major breeding programmes in Sumatra and Malaysia concentrated primarily on Deli Dura and 'Yangambi' Pisifera for the production of commercial planting material. Since then, extensive new introductions have been effected from various breeding programmes in West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM) started a systematic

ura and 'Yangambi' Pisifera for the production of commercial planting material. Since then, extensive new introductions have been effected from various breeding programmes in West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM) started a systematic programme of prospecting and collecting from oil groves in West Africa and from E. oleifera populations in South and Central America, significantly widening the basis for breeding programmes. Flowers are unisexual, with female flowers grouped in clusters of 200–300 close to the trunk at the end of short heavy pedicels, with male flowers borne in spikes. Fruits are produced 3–4 years after planting, and fruits ripen 5 or 6 months after pollination. The physiological basis of sex differentiation is not yet well understood, except that empirical evidence suggests that physiological stress conditions seem to encourage maleness. Pollination is primarily by insects. One insect pollinator, Elaeidobius kamerunicus , was successfully introduced into Malaysia and subsequently Indonesia in 1979. Before this time, oil palms in the region were wind pollinated, often requiring artificial pollination in the first few years. E. guineensis seeds are dormant after harvesting though the physiology of this dormancy is not well known. Seeds usually require temperatures of 35°C or more in order to germinate, though germination is speeded up by dry heat treatment (40°C) for 80 days followed by cooling at higher moisture contents. The stem has a single growing point from which a leaf primordium develops about every second week. Succeeding primordia are separated by a divergence angle of 137.5° (Fibonacci angle), causing leaf bases to be arranged in various sets of spirals, of which a set of eight parastichies is normally obvious.

 cooling at higher moisture contents. The stem has a single growing point from which a leaf primordium develops about every second week. Succeeding primordia are separated by a divergence angle of 137.5° (Fibonacci angle), causing leaf bases to be arranged in various sets of spirals, of which a set of eight parastichies is normally obvious. Rate of leaf production is up to 40 per year in the first 2 years, dropping to a rate of 18–24 per year from year 8 onwards. From leaf primordium to fully expanded leaf (2–10 m²) takes about 2 years. The normal photosynthetically active life of a leaf is about 2 years, so under natural conditions up to 50 leaves are present per palm. In plantations, this number is usually kept at about 40. In the first 2 years, lateral growth of the trunk dominates, giving a broad base up to 60 cm in diameter. After that, the trunk starts growing in height, 35–75 cm per year, reducing its diameter up to 40 cm. The rate of height increment and rate of leaf production appear to be independent. All leaf bases contain inflorescence primordia, but the first fully developed inflorescence does not appear before leaf 20 and usually much later, some 3 years after germination. The length of male and female phases in individual palms is very variable and irregular, but a population of palms shows clear seasonal trends. The mean interval between sex differentiation and anthesis is around 20 months, and between anthesis of female flowers and fruit ripeness 4–5 months. Fruit ripening on the bunch proceeds simultaneously from top to bottom and from outer to inner fruits and ripe fruits become detached. In well managed plantations in Malaysia and Sumatra, on soils with a reasonable availability of nutrients and a good water-holding capacity under uniform and adequate rainfall, yields of bunches of 24–32 t/ha are common.

In well managed plantations in Malaysia and Sumatra, on soils with a reasonable availability of nutrients and a good water-holding capacity under uniform and adequate rainfall, yields of bunches of 24–32 t/ha are common. Oil extraction rate from a bunch of E. guineensis fruit is 17–27% for palm oil and 4–10% for palm kernels, though figures for factory extraction rates of oil related to bunch weight are 20–22% which represents oil yields of 4.8–7 t/ha, higher than in any other oil crop. The natural environment of oil palms is the lowland humid tropics. Rainfall in its native range is 1780–2280 mm per annum with 2–4 month dry period, and although it has been recorded in areas where annual rainfall is as low as 640 mm or as high as 4200 mm ( Duke, 1983 ), these limits should be treated as exceptional. Mean maximum temperature of 30–32°C and mean minimum of 21–24°C provide suitable range, and growth may cease below 15°C. It is generally a lowland species, and grows on a wide range of tropical soils if not too acid or alkaline (pH 4-8) if sufficiently moist ( Duke, 1983 ). E. guineensis needs a good moisture supply and open areas as they cannot compete with faster-growing tree species. E. guineensis does not grow under continuous flooding but is tolerant of fluctuating water tables with periods of standing water. Hence, the natural habitats are considered to be swamps, riverbanks and other areas too wet for dicotyledonous trees of the tropical rain forest.

Under cultivation, rainfall is often the main limiting factor on production. Major areas of oil-palm cultivation are in the equatorial belt where mean annual rainfall deficits do not exceed 600–650 mm annually. Highest yields are achieved where rainfall is well distributed throughout the year with an optimum of 150 mm monthly. Little is known about temperature effects other than that oil palms grow less well at higher altitudes (above 500–600 m) and at higher latitudes (above 10°). In regions where minimum temperatures regularly drop below 20°C for prolonged periods, productivity and growth are severely reduced. E. guineensis is also affected by high temperatures, with photochemical efficiency reduced above 35°C. Elaeis guineensis can grow on a wide variety of soils ranging from sandy soils to lateritic red and yellow podzols, young volcanic soils, alluvial clays and peat soils. A major criterion for relative suitability seems to be water-holding capacity. As E. guineensis is responsive to soil nutrients, nutrient-release characteristics are also important as they affect efficiency of fertilizer use in plantations. Elaeis guineensis is adapted to lowland tropical humid climates, with regular rainfall and consistently high temperature and humidity, though may be occasionally found at its ecological extremes from savanna to rainforest, otherwise mostly in tropical dry to tropical wet forest vegetation types. Rainfall is often the major factor limiting production in plantations: highest yields occur where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, with an optimum of 150 mm per month ( Westphal and Jansen, 1989 ).

E. guineensis is also affected by high temperatures, with photochemical efficiency reduced above 35°C. In its native range, Duke (1983) reports that E. guineensis occurs wild in riverine forests or in freshwater swamps. It does not regenerate or grow well in dense natural forests as it is apparently not very competitive with other forest species, and therefore tends to be found where other forest species do not grow well. It is shade intolerant, needs adequate soil moisture and can tolerate periodic waterlogging.
