Human-Wildlife Conflicts 
Numbering in the tens of millions of birds, 
grackle populations in North America can 
cause a variety of conflicts with people. 
Grackles eat agricultural crops and 
livestock feed, damage property, spread 
pathogens, and collide with aircraft. Their 
large roosts can be a nuisance in urban 
and suburban areas. A combination of 
dispersal techniques, exclusion, and lethal 
removal may help to reduce grackle 
damage.    
Agricultural Crops and Landscapes 
Grackles feed upon and damage grain and 
fruit crops, including rice, corn, wheat, 
tomatoes, watermelon, lettuce, figs, citrus, 
and cantaloupe. Newly planted rice in 
southern states is often consumed by 
grackles prior to the birds’ spring 
migration. In peanut-growing areas, 
common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) 
(Figure 1) damage can result in crop 
losses up to 25 percent after windrowing. 
A 1969 to 1971 study in Oklahoma 
showed that more than 72 percent of 
common grackles captured in peanut-
growing areas had peanuts in their 
gizzards. 
Where producers grow sunflowers and 
corn simultaneously, sunflowers receive 
more damage than corn. Grackles feed on 
sunflowers during the early ripening stage.

sunflowers does not subside until late fall.  
Common grackles will pull up sprouting corn, feed on corn 
during the milk and dough stages when the kernels are 
soft, and on mature field corn in the dent stage, removing 
the entire kernels from the cob. Throughout the Midwest, 
common grackles cause extensive damage to ripening 
corn. In Southern Ontario, common grackles are most 
active in corn fields during May and June and in grape 
vineyards during July.

Great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) damage to 
ripening oranges and grapefruit (Figure 2) in south Texas 
varies in type and economic importance. Fruit with 
cosmetic damage, small pecks and/or scratches on the 
fruit peel are downgraded and reduced in value. Holes 
poked in the fruit or pulp cause blemishes that make the 
fruit unfit for direct consumption. Grackles damage citrus 
to acquire monoterpenes from the peel. The birds spread 
the monoterpenes on their feathers to kill ectoparasites.  
Grackle damage to fruit starts in the spring on immature 
citrus and extends through the fall and winter on ripening 
fruit. The most significant damage occurs after the 
breeding season during July through September as birds 
prepare for migration. 
Because it is difficult to disperse great-tailed grackles from 
citrus groves during the summer, producers and managers 
often resort to lethal removal.  
Droppings from grackle winter roosts change soil pH and 
damage ornamental trees, (e.g., Bradford pear trees), 
harvestable trees (e.g., loblolly pine), and turf. Small 
ornamental plants, especially when sprouting, are 
damaged directly by foraging birds.  
Livestock and Aquaculture 
Grackles are agricultural pests at feedlots and dairy farms. 
They eat livestock feed and spread bacterial pathogens 
that may impact cattle and milk production. Rates of feed 
consumption vary with the weather and number of birds.

Livestock and Aquaculture 
Grackles are agricultural pests at feedlots and dairy farms. 
They eat livestock feed and spread bacterial pathogens 
that may impact cattle and milk production. Rates of feed 
consumption vary with the weather and number of birds. 
Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 may be spread 
mechanically (i.e., on feathers and feet) and through 
droppings by grackles and other blackbirds in mixed flocks 
both within a feedlot and between feedlots.  
Great-tailed grackles, pigeons (Columbia livia), European 
starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and mourning doves (Zenaidura 
macroura) cause the greatest economic losses in 
southwestern cattle feeding operations.  
Common grackles also have been known to prey upon fish 
in fish hatcheries, natural ponds and aquaculture facilities. 
Structures 
In some winter roosts, grackles concentrate on powerlines, 
as well as on nearby trees and shrubs. When grackles 
depart en masse from powerlines, the lines oscillate wildly, 
often contacting other lines or structures and causing 
power outages. A single power outage caused by birds can 
easily cost over $10,000 in repairs and lost productivity.  
Human Health and Safety 
Winter roost sites for mixed blackbird flocks, including 
grackles, typically result in large concentrations of fecal 
droppings that can serve as a fertile medium for the 
fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. If the soil under these 
Histoplasma-positive roost sites is disturbed, the fungal

Histoplasma-positive roost sites is disturbed, the fungal

hazard. If inhaled, the fungal spores cause a lung infection 
in people called histoplasmosis.  
Grackles can be a significant threat to aviation safety 
where large winter roosts or croplands used for feeding

coincide with aviation flight paths. According to a U.S. 
Federal Aviation Administration report, from 1990 to 2013, 
the following number of aircraft-bird collisions occurred by 
species: boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major) (22), great-
tailed grackle (37), common grackle (122), unidentified 
grackle species (125), and blackbirds (1,271). The 
blackbird category likely included grackles due to their 
tendency to join mixed flocks.  
Nuisance Problems 
In urban and suburban settings, large grackle roosts can 
be noisy. The noise can last throughout the night, if the 
area is well lit. Nuisance complaints also arise because of 
droppings, especially on houses and cars located under 
roost trees and structures.  
Grackles can attack people and pets when they perceive a 
threat to nests or young. Minor injuries to people have 
been documented.

Grackles can attack people and pets when they perceive a 
threat to nests or young. Minor injuries to people have 
been documented.  
 
Damage Identification 
Because of their gregarious nature, grackles are easily 
observed and identified. Nuisance complaints are 
determined from visual observations, noise, and fecal 
droppings.  
Citrus damage requires close inspection, as grackles may 
peck only one small hole in the fruit that is not visible until 
picked. Systematic searches of ripening fruit must be 
made if grackles are observed in orchards. Inspect hanging 
fruit from a ladder to determine the whether fruit is being 
damaged.  
Blackbird damage to agricultural seed crops often is easy 
to identify because the flocks of birds and the visible signs 
of the damage are conspicuous. However, correct 
identification of the species of birds in the agricultural field 
is important, along with evidence that the birds are actually 
feeding on the crop. For example, European starlings 
superficially resemble blackbirds and sometimes feed in 
cornfields, yet they usually feed on concentrations of 
insects, such as armyworms, and cause little, if any, 
damage to corn. Also, red-winged blackbirds often are 
attracted to agricultural fields, such as corn and sunflower, 
initially feeding on rootworm beetles, sunflower weevils, 
and other insect pests. They will not damage the crop itself 
until the grain has reached the milk stage. Blackbirds often 
forage in newly planted grain fields,

. Also, red-winged blackbirds often are 
attracted to agricultural fields, such as corn and sunflower, 
initially feeding on rootworm beetles, sunflower weevils, 
and other insect pests. They will not damage the crop itself 
until the grain has reached the milk stage. Blackbirds often 
forage in newly planted grain fields, such as winter wheat, 
feeding on previous crop residue, weed seeds, and insects 
without bothering the sprouting grain. Blackbirds can, 
however, cause serious damage to newly sprouted rice. 
Blackbird damage also can be confused with other forms 
of loss. Deer, raccoon, and squirrel damage to corn can be 
mistaken for blackbird damage. Also, seed shatter in 
sunflower caused by wind may resemble bird damage; 
however, the difference usually can be detected by 
examining sunflower heads for the presence or absence of 
bird droppings and by looking on the ground for hulls or 
whole seeds. Careful observation of the birds in the field 
and a little detective work usually will result in the correct 
identification of the cause of damage.  
To accurately estimate the amount of blackbird damage in 
an agricultural field, examine at least 10 locations widely 
spaced throughout the field. For example, if a field has 100 
rows and is 1,000 feet long, walk staggered distances of 
100 feet along every 10th row (for example, 0 to 100 feet 
in row 10, then 101 to 200 feet in row 20, and so on). In 
each of the 100-foot lengths, randomly select 10 plants 
and visually estimate the damage on the head or ear of 
each plant to the nearest 1% (for instance, 2% destroyed, 
20%

 every 10th row (for example, 0 to 100 feet 
in row 10, then 101 to 200 feet in row 20, and so on). In 
each of the 100-foot lengths, randomly select 10 plants 
and visually estimate the damage on the head or ear of 
each plant to the nearest 1% (for instance, 2% destroyed, 
20% destroyed). For corn, six kernels usually represent 
about 1% of the corn on an ear; for sunflower, it may be 
easiest to visually divide the head into four quarters and 
then estimate the percentage of seeds missing. When 
finished, simply determine the average damage for the 
100 plants examined. This will give an approximation of 
the percent loss to the field. Multiply the percent loss by 
expected yield to get a rough estimate of yield loss. In 
small grains, such as rice, estimates of loss are more 
difficult to obtain. One possibility is to compare the yields 
from plots in damaged and undamaged sections of a field.

Management Methods 
Grackles adapt easily to human-dominated environments, 
and exploit human food and other features of human 
landscapes. Thus, an integrated damage management 
approach to grackle damage focuses on reducing and 
eliminating the damage, rather than simply controlling 
grackle populations.  
The effectiveness of management methods varies 
considerably by bird species and crops. Strategies that 
work in one situation might not be applicable in another. 
For example, a strategy to manage damage in rice fields 
where blackbirds feed and roost will likely differ from a 
strategy to protect sunflower fields where blackbirds only 
feed. Additionally, a repellent application that is effective
Text Len: 1665
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 varies 
considerably by bird species and crops. Strategies that 
work in one situation might not be applicable in another. 
For example, a strategy to manage damage in rice fields 
where blackbirds feed and roost will likely differ from a 
strategy to protect sunflower fields where blackbirds only 
feed. Additionally, a repellent application that is effective 
with common grackles might not be as effective with larger 
species, such as great-tailed grackles.  
The timing of management activities is important. 
Management is most effective when done just prior to 
planting a vulnerable crop or just prior to the crop ripening. 
Producers should also be knowledgeable of grackle 
movement and behavior. For instance, southern rice 
growers can best protect their crops if they are planted 
after most blackbirds have migrated north, usually after 
late March. 
The effectiveness of certain methods to prevent bird 
damage to citrus varies considerably from season to 
season. From April to July, the birds congregate in small 
breeding colonies which makes them more susceptible to 
baiting and toxicants. From August to October, the birds 
can be baited into and treated with toxicants. Intensive 
shooting and use of pyrotechnics can also be successful at 
this time of year at groves with high grackle 
concentrations. From late October to March, birds travel 
widely each day and are easily frightened from groves by 
pyrotechnics and shooting. Depending on the cost and 
duration of the damage to citrus and other fruits, exclusion 
with netting and hazing may be successful. Otherwise, 
habitat modification, repellents and lethal removal may be 
tried.

pyrotechnics and shooting. Depending on the cost and 
duration of the damage to citrus and other fruits, exclusion 
with netting and hazing may be successful. Otherwise, 
habitat modification, repellents and lethal removal may be 
tried.  
 
Habitat Modification 
Habitat modification to disperse roosts may be effective 
when trees are used for thermal cover in the winter. 
Pruning trees to open the canopy reduces the thermal 
cover and forces the grackles to roost elsewhere. Pruning 
trees is not effective in southern climates, however, where 
trees and powerlines are selected for predator defense 
and not for thermal cover. Roost structures may be 
completely removed, but the birds may relocate to a new 
roost location nearby. 
Mechanical methods (e.g., mowing, disking or burning) for 
managing cattail roosts and nesting areas used by mixed 
flocks are labor-intensive, expensive, and often ineffective 
because the stands quickly reestablish themselves. 
Cattails can be managed by flooding, but cattail-dominated 
wetlands in the prairie pothole region seldom have water 
controls to facilitate flooding.  
Sometimes glyphosate herbicide is aerially applied for 
controlling cattails due to the limitations associated with 
mechanical treatments and flooding. Aerial application is 
recommended for managing cattails because basin areas 
usually are too large for ground-based sprayers. Cattails 
should be treated with glyphosate during the late summer 
when the plants are most actively metabolizing and 
transporting carbohydrates to their rhizomes (i.e.,

mechanical treatments and flooding. Aerial application is 
recommended for managing cattails because basin areas 
usually are too large for ground-based sprayers. Cattails 
should be treated with glyphosate during the late summer 
when the plants are most actively metabolizing and 
transporting carbohydrates to their rhizomes (i.e.,

underground stems). Treatments can last for more than 4 
years, if water levels remain stable. To prevent blackbird 
use of cattail, the ideal ratio of open water to cattails is 
70:30. For greatest success, water levels should remain 
stable at a depth of more than one foot.  
Exclusion 
Nets are used to exclude grackles from small trees, 
gardens, or vines with ripening fruit. The use of netting for 
large-scale applications is often cost-prohibitive. Exclusion 
wires, such as porcupine wires, may prevent grackles from 
roosting on some human-made objects, such as light 
fixtures, and reduce damage associated with droppings on 
cars and equipment.  
Netting is effective in the protection of blueberries (Figure 
3). Netting is expensive to use and many owners of small 
plantings do not invest in it. Unfortunately, it is these small 
producers who tend to experience more severe bird 
damage.  
In south Texas, several citrus grove owners used 
monofilament lines placed in grids of 10, 23, and 36 feet 
apart and 3 feet above the canopy of their trees to prevent

 invest in it. Unfortunately, it is these small 
producers who tend to experience more severe bird 
damage.  
In south Texas, several citrus grove owners used 
monofilament lines placed in grids of 10, 23, and 36 feet 
apart and 3 feet above the canopy of their trees to prevent 
damage from great-tailed grackles. These protected groves 
experienced less damage than unprotected groves; 
however, preliminary results indicated that the grids only 
were cost-effective when damage levels were high. 
Frightening Devices 
Grackles may be hazed from roost sites using 
pyrotechnics. However, continuous, multiple-night efforts 
are often required to move the birds from well-established 
roosts.  
Propane cannons and pyrotechnics are effective in citrus 
groves to reduce great-tailed grackle damage. Both are 
used extensively in sunflower fields to reduce common 
grackle damage. Propane cannons can be made more 
effective by elevating them above the crop, using timers, 
and allowing the cannons to rotate and fire in alternative 
directions. The use of scarecrows can enhance the 
effectiveness of propane cannons. 
Mylar tape or helium-filled “eye-spot” balloons (Figure 4)
may be used to protect small areas, such as gardens, for a 
limited period of time. However, long-term efficacy should 
not be expected. Mylar tape is ineffective for protecting 
large citrus groves from great-tailed grackles.  
Although frightening techniques help reduce damage to 
citrus during the late fall and winter, site tenacity by great-
tailed grackles makes these methods less effective during

 time. However, long-term efficacy should 
not be expected. Mylar tape is ineffective for protecting 
large citrus groves from great-tailed grackles.  
Although frightening techniques help reduce damage to 
citrus during the late fall and winter, site tenacity by great-
tailed grackles makes these methods less effective during 
the post-breeding period of July through September. 
Repellents 
Methyl anthranilate (MA) is registered as a repellent for a 
wide variety of birds and situations (see EPA Reg. No. 
33162-1). The naturally-occurring compound stimulates 
the trigeminal nerves in a bird’s beak, eyes, and throat 
causing discomfort. MA can be used on grass and turf to 
prevent grazing (particularly by geese) and on ripening 
fruit, rice, sunflowers, and other crops to prevent pecking. 
MA products may not be cost-effective for nuisance 
damage if their use requires repeated applications over a 
large area.  
MA products are water soluble, so they must be reapplied 
following irrigation or rain. MA is not registered for use in 
feedlots or dairies, nor is it effective at preventing damage 
associated with roosting birds. Applicators should read and 
follow label directions and contact their state pesticide 
regulatory agencies to determine if MA requires special 
pesticide licensing. MA products may not be used in 
California or Nebraska.

Toxicants 
DRC-1339 (3-Chloro-4-methylbenzenamine) is an oral 
toxicant registered for use with grackles in both 
commercial animal operations and non-crop areas where 
grackles gather and feed, loaf, or roost. DRC-1339 may 
only be used by USDA-APHIS certified applicators trained in 
bird control or by persons under their direct supervision.  
DRC-1339-treated baits are fed to birds as part of a 
mixture of treated and untreated bait. Rice, fat pellets, 
cracked corn, distiller’s grain, french fries, dog food, and 
watermelon have been used as bait. Birds consuming   
DRC-1339 metabolize the chemical and die of renal failure 
within 1 to 3 days, usually at roost sites. Applicators should 
carefully examine every application project to determine 
where birds may die. It is recommended that local 
authorities and the public be notified when large bird 
mortalities in populated areas are anticipated. Special 
local needs labels may be approved under certain 
circumstances.  
DRC-1339 can be used to reduce migrating blackbird 
populations prior to nesting season. The application of  
DRC-1339-treated baits in corn stubble is more effective 
than soybean stubble, and rice bait is preferred over corn 
bait by blackbirds. However,

circumstances.  
DRC-1339 can be used to reduce migrating blackbird 
populations prior to nesting season. The application of  
DRC-1339-treated baits in corn stubble is more effective 
than soybean stubble, and rice bait is preferred over corn 
bait by blackbirds. However, the application of DRC-1339-
treated rice bait down bait lanes in ripening sunflower 
fields does not reduce local blackbird populations or 
sunflower damage. The use of bait trays is also ineffective.   
Trapping 
Grackles can be trapped using decoy traps, funnel traps 
and drop nets. However, trapping usually is ineffective if 
food sources outside of the traps are readily available to 
the birds.  
A decoy trap is a large poultry wire or net enclosure 
containing 10-20 decoy birds, food, and water. Birds enter 
the trap through an opening in the top of the cage that is 
covered with a wire mesh. The birds can fold their wings 
and readily drop though the opening to the food below. 
Decoy traps have been effective at capturing grackles in 
small areas, notably at airfields where off-site food is 
unavailable. If decoy traps are used, care must be taken to 
prevent tampering by the public 
Funnel traps (Figure 5) with entrances on the ground are 
more effective than decoy traps for capturing great-tailed 
grackles.   
Drop nets have been used successfully for small scale 
trapping, particularly at food sources or small roosts. Drop

Drop nets have been used successfully for small scale 
trapping, particularly at food sources or small roosts. Drop 
nets are weighted nets set on poles above the ground with 
a triggering device to release the net and allow it to drop 
on top of birds. They are normally used at locations where 
birds gather to feed or roost and may be used over bait.  
Neither traps nor drop nets are considered effective for 
large roost problems or for reducing fruit or citrus damage. 
Shooting 
While night shooting of birds in roosts may remove some of 
the animals, shooting is rarely effective at stopping 
damage. Shooting birds coming into a feedlot, dairy, or a 
crop field may reinforce hazing with pyrotechnics, but it is 
rarely an effective stand-alone tool.  
Other Control Methods 
Decoy (lure) crops are used to entice feeding blackbirds 
away from valuable, commercial crops. The concept is 
simple—plant a small field (about 20 acres) of sunflowers

other birds.  
or another crop, such as corn, that is attractive to grackles. 
The decoy crop and the commercial crop should be 
synchronized so they mature at the same time, otherwise 
the decoy crop will be less attractive to the birds. Do not 
spray the decoy crop with insecticides, and do not harass 
the birds using it. The goal is to keep the birds in the decoy 
crop

. 
The decoy crop and the commercial crop should be 
synchronized so they mature at the same time, otherwise 
the decoy crop will be less attractive to the birds. Do not 
spray the decoy crop with insecticides, and do not harass 
the birds using it. The goal is to keep the birds in the decoy 
crop as long as possible, thereby reducing the time they 
spend in the nearby commercial field. To encourage the 
birds to stay in the decoy field, farmers can continue to 
spray registered repellents and harass birds in their 
commercial field. In essence, the decoy crop is sacrificed 
to grackles to protect the harvestable crop. North Dakota 
producers who used decoy crops saved $2 to $4 for every 
$1 spent on the crops. Fields with associated decoy crops 
sustained less damage than fields without them.  
In addition to decoy crops, bird-resistant, nontoxic coatings 
for rice seeds have been studied to evaluate their 
effectiveness at reducing bird damage. The coated rice 
becomes sticky when wet and fouls the birds' bills so that 
they cannot feed efficiently. In a study using clay-coated 
rice, the amount of sprouting rice lost to birds decreased 
from 36.5 percent to 17 percent. Bird resistant varieties of 
sorghum, corn, and sunflower have also been studied and 
limited varieties have been produced to alleviate blackbird 
damage.  
Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is a wetting agent (i.e., 
surfactant) used on grackles at roost sites. When applied 
to birds, SLS allows water to penetrate and saturate the

 studied and 
limited varieties have been produced to alleviate blackbird 
damage.  
Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is a wetting agent (i.e., 
surfactant) used on grackles at roost sites. When applied 
to birds, SLS allows water to penetrate and saturate the 
feathers so that with low temperatures (< 41°F) and 
sufficient water, birds die of hypothermia. The product is 
for use on upland roosts located away from bodies of 
water. In some situations, it may be an appropriate 
alternative to DRC-1339. Check federal and state 
regulations before using SLS. 
Relocation of roosting grackles in urban areas may be 
effective for reducing damage. Relocation of roosts can be 
accomplished with pyrotechnics, habitat modification or 
continued disturbance of the roost using low-powered 
lasers or water from a high-pressure hose. Relocation of 
the roost is particularly attractive as an alternative to lethal 
control. However, relocation may result in the movement of 
the roost to another area where damage may continue.  
Because grackles often feed over a large area surrounding 
their roost site, relocation of the roost is not an effective 
method for protecting crops. The exception may be when 
crops are planted in southern states around the same time 
that birds are preparing to migrate north. In these limited 
situations, the dispersal of the roost may trigger a northern 
migration away from all freshly planted crops.  
Handling 
When handling birds, be sure to wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment, such as gloves and protective eye 
wear.

Handling 
When handling birds, be sure to wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment, such as gloves and protective eye 
wear. 
Translocation 
Translocation of grackles is not considered effective for 
resolving most conflicts or significantly reducing roosting 
populations. 
Euthanasia 
Euthanasia of grackles may be done by cervical dislocation 
or by administering isoflurane or carbon dioxide gas to 
birds placed in a sealed container. Care should be taken to 
minimize stress and handling prior to euthanasia. Confined 
areas must be large enough to avoid stress to the birds as 
much as possible. 
Disposal 
Check your local and state regulations regarding carcass 
disposal. 
 
Economics 
There are no economic estimates for grackle damage to 
crops nationwide. Most national damage estimates are for 
mixed flocks that include grackles, European starlings, and 
several blackbird species. The following includes damage 
estimates in specific states.

blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), yellow-headed 
blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), and brown-
headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater). 
A 2003 bioenergetics model estimated blackbird damage 
to sunflowers in North Dakota at $5 to $10 million 
annually. Losses by blackbirds continue to remain high. 
Annual blackbird damages to corn and sunflower crops in 
North Dakota from 2008 to 2010 averaged $1.3 million 
and $3.5 million, respectively. The economic impact to 
sunflower producers in North Dakota, South Dakota, and 
Nebraska for the years 2009 to 2013 had an annual 
average loss from blackbirds of $18.7 million, $7.3 million, 
and $2.6 million, respectively. 
In Florida, two types of tropical fruit— the lychee (Litchi 
chinensis) and longan (Euphoria longana)— are rapidly 
increasing in economic importance with a combined 
annual value of over $19 million. During the late 1990s, 
estimates of bird damage to longan ranged from 1 to 28 
percent ($640 to $43,546) per acre, with most of the 
damage caused by common grackles and monk parakeets. 
Bird damage to lychee was 11 percent or $1,179 per acre 
in only 1 of 4 of the groves studied.  
In 1989, producers identified European starlings, American 
robins (Turdus americanus), and common grackles as the

Bird damage to lychee was 11 percent or $1,179 per acre 
in only 1 of 4 of the groves studied.  
In 1989, producers identified European starlings, American 
robins (Turdus americanus), and common grackles as the 
3 most common species causing damage to blueberries in 
15 states and British Columbia. The survey also found that 
birds accounted for 10 percent of the losses to blueberry 
crops. With blueberries averaging $2.42 per pound, birds 
caused an estimated $8.5 million in blueberry damages 
nationwide. Common grackles also feed on cherries, 
showing a preference for sweet cherries over tart cherries.  
Damage estimates associated with cattle feed depredation 
are dependent upon feed mixture, but a 2010 study 
showed the economic losses were as high as $15.43 per 
100 kilograms ($6.99 per 100 pounds) of daily 
maintenance livestock feed. By eating the feed, birds 
deprive the livestock of important grain, starch and other 
nutrients.

Species Overview 
Identification 
Three species of grackles are present in North America: the 
common grackle, the boat-tailed grackle, and the great-
tailed grackle. A fourth species, the greater Antillean 
grackle (Q. niger) is present in Puerto Rico. All are part of 
the Family Icteridae that includes blackbirds, orioles, 
cowbirds, meadowlarks, and bobolinks.

. A fourth species, the greater Antillean 
grackle (Q. niger) is present in Puerto Rico. All are part of 
the Family Icteridae that includes blackbirds, orioles, 
cowbirds, meadowlarks, and bobolinks. 
Physical Description 
The common grackle is 12.5 inches long, with a wing span 
of 17 inches, and weighs 4 ounces. The bird has glossy 
black feathers and pale yellow eyes. The male’s feathers 
are iridescent purple on the head, nape, and breast with 
bronze iridescence on the body and wings. Females are 
slightly less glossy than males. Young birds are dark brown 
with a dark eye. There may be a slight color variation 
between populations. Common grackles are larger than 
other blackbirds, such as red-winged blackbirds, Brewer’s 
blackbirds, and rusty blackbirds, with longer wings and a 
keeled tail. Males have distinctive mating displays.  
The male boat-tailed grackle is 16.5 inches long, with a 
wing span of 23 inches, and weighs 8.8 ounces. The 
female is slightly smaller (length 14.5 inches, wing span 
17.5 inches, weight 4.2 ounces). The male boat-tailed 
grackle is glossy black with greenish-blue iridescence. The 
female is blackish above with a rufous-brown breast and 
throat. Eye color varies between populations from brown to 
pale to yellow. The boat-tailed grackle is larger than other 
blackbirds and the common grackle, with longer wings and 
a keeled tail. Males have distinctive mating displays. The

throat. Eye color varies between populations from brown to 
pale to yellow. The boat-tailed grackle is larger than other 
blackbirds and the common grackle, with longer wings and 
a keeled tail. Males have distinctive mating displays. The 
boat-tailed grackle is located in coastal saltmarshes and 
adjacent open areas, generally not flocking with other 
birds.  
The male great-tailed grackle (Figure 6) is 18 inches long, 
with a wing span of 23 inches, and weighs 6.7 ounces. 
Females are 15 inches long, with a 19-inch wing span, and 
weigh 3.7 ounces. The male is glossy black with uniform 
purple-blue iridescence. The female is blackish above with 
pale to dark greyish-brown on the breast and throat. Eye 
color varies between populations from brown to white. The 
great-tailed grackle is the largest grackle, with longer wings 
and an extremely long, keeled tail. Mating displays by 
males are distinctive. It is located in various upland 
habitats from farmlands to city parks. The great-tailed 
grackle forms large winter roosts.  
Range 
The common grackle breeds throughout the United States 
and southern Canada east of the Rocky Mountains and 
south of Hudson’s Bay. It winters from Nebraska to Texas, 
and east to Pennsylvania and Florida (Figure 7). A native to 
North America, its range may have expanded due to 
agriculture and climate.  
The boat-tailed grackle is found on the coastal Atlantic, 
south of Massachusetts through all of Florida and the U.S

south of Hudson’s Bay. It winters from Nebraska to Texas, 
and east to Pennsylvania and Florida (Figure 7). A native to 
North America, its range may have expanded due to 
agriculture and climate.  
The boat-tailed grackle is found on the coastal Atlantic, 
south of Massachusetts through all of Florida and the U.S. 
Gulf coast through Texas (Figure 8). It is native to North 
America.  
The range of the great-tailed grackle extends from 
Louisiana and western Arkansas, west through Colorado, 
Utah, southern Nevada and southern California, and 
southward through northern Mexico (Figure 9). Native to 
North America, its range may have expanded due to 
agriculture and climate.  
Voice and Sounds 
The common grackle’s song is not musical— it consists of a 
harsh, toneless hiss (“kh-sheee or kh-reezzh”). Its call is a 
harsh, dry “karrz” or “kerrr,” and the male’s call is a thin, 
wheezy, toneless “zweeesh” and a nasal, hoarse “krrrjk”. 
The song of the boat-tailed grackle is a varied series of 
high, ringing notes “kent, kent,” or “teer, teer”. The male 
call is a deep “chuk”. 
The great-tailed grackle’s song is a series of loud, 
unpleasant noises and mechanical rattles of “kikikiki” or 
“ke ke ke ke ke teep”. The male’

Figure 7. Distribution of common grackles.  

Reproduction 
Female grackles breed during their first year. Common 
grackle and great-tailed grackle males also breed during 
their first year, although the territorial breeding behavior of 
great-tailed grackles does not always allow for yearling 
males to establish breeding territories. Male boat-tailed 
grackles do not breed until their second year. 
Average clutch size for all three species is 3 to 5 eggs with 
a range of 1 to 5 eggs for great-tailed and boat-tailed 
grackles and 1 to 7 eggs for common grackles. All three  
species typically raise 1 clutch, but may raise a maximum 
of 2 clutches per year. 
Common grackle males assist in defending the nest and 
raising chicks, but great-tailed grackle and boat-tailed 
grackle males do not. Differential survival rates for male 
and female boat-tailed grackles yields a breeding season 
sex ratio of 2 females per male, with a corresponding 
incre

of 2 clutches per year. 
Common grackle males assist in defending the nest and 
raising chicks, but great-tailed grackle and boat-tailed 
grackle males do not. Differential survival rates for male 
and female boat-tailed grackles yields a breeding season 
sex ratio of 2 females per male, with a corresponding 
increase in population fecundity. 
Following a nest building period of 1 to 6 weeks, female 
grackles lay their eggs. Incubation for all grackle species is 
11 to 15 days. Boat-tailed and common grackle chicks 
fledge in 10 to 17 days, while great-tailed grackle chicks 
fledge in 20 to 23 days. 
Male great-tailed grackles do not participate in the raising 
of young, leaving nest building, incubation, and feeding of 
nestlings and fledglings to the females. Great-tailed 
grackles experience nest loss during the breeding season, 
with hatching success rate of 55 to 89 percent and a 
nestling fledging rate of 36 to 93 percent.  
Nesting Cover 
Female grackles build nests, preferably in the tree canopy 
and out of reach of predators. All species of grackles are 
“loose colonial breeders” (i.e., nesting and breeding in 
close proximity as a group), but single nests may also 
occur.  
Common grackles prefer to nest colonially in shelterbelts 
near inhabited farms. In North Dakota, one study 
estimated a mean density of 0.2 common grackle colonies 
and 3.4 nests per square mile. Common grackles have a 
preference for blue spruce (Picea pungens), but also

estimated a mean density of 0.2 common grackle colonies 
and 3.4 nests per square mile. Common grackles have a 
preference for blue spruce (Picea pungens), but also nest 
in Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila), box elder maple (Acer 
negundo),  caragana (Caragana arborescens) and 
hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). 
Because boat-tailed grackles are found primarily along the 
coast, nests are often built in cattail or other marsh 
vegetation, above the reach of flood waters.  
Page 10 WDM Technical Series─Grackles 
Figure 8. Distribution of boat-tailed grackles.  Figure 9. Distribution of great-tailed grackles.  
During the nesting season in south Texas, great-tailed 
grackles prefer to nest and roost in huesache (Acacia 
farnesciana), mesquite (Prosopis qlandulosa) and ebony 
(Pithecellobium flexicaule) thickets.  
Mortality 
The rat snake (Elaphe obsoletta) has been identified as a 
common predator on grackle nestlings. Texas indigo 
snakes (Drymarchon melanurus erebennus) feed on great-
tailed grackle nestlings, and purple gallinules (Porphyrula 
martinica) are known to eat boat-tailed grackle chicks.

snakes (Drymarchon melanurus erebennus) feed on great-
tailed grackle nestlings, and purple gallinules (Porphyrula 
martinica) are known to eat boat-tailed grackle chicks.  
During a 7-year study in South Carolina, approximately 61 
percent of common grackle nests fledged at least 1 young. 
Depredation was the leading cause of common grackle egg 
and nestling mortality (32.3 percent), while 27.2 percent of 
nestlings died of starvation. Nestling losses due to 
starvation are probably greater for the great-tailed grackle.  
Population Status 
The population status of all three grackle species is 
considered common to overabundant.  
Common grackle populations peak in August and 
September when sunflowers reach their maturity. In the 
prairie pothole region of North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Minnesota, and Canada, the size of the fall population of 
common grackles is estimated to be 19 million birds.  
Typically, boat-tailed grackles do not associate with other 
species of birds and usually are found in small colonies 
during the breeding season. Both great-tailed grackles and 
common grackles may join other species in winter 
concentrations, roosting in mixed flocks numbering in the 
tens of thousands. Urban roosts may spread over several 
city blocks.  
Overall, great-tailed grackles have a sex ratio of 1.3 
females:1 male. The ratio varies throughout the year based 
on life history needs.

Page 11 U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Habitat 
Wetlands dominated by cattails can harbor more than 
70,000 blackbirds, including common grackles. Wetlands 
containing over 20,000 birds are common in the prairie 
pothole region of the United States. The peak roosting and 
staging period at Sand Lake, South Dakota, is from late 
August through September. The roosting habitat is 
dominated by cattails (Typha latifolia) with areas of 
phragmites (Phragmites spp.).  
Common grackles are known to roost in forested areas 
along Lake Texoma in southeastern Oklahoma in 
November. Their home ranges average 125 square miles. 
The minimum area used by the Lake Texoma roosting 
population is estimated at 768 square miles. 
Boat-tailed grackles are associated with salt and fresh 
water marshes. They are rarely found more than 30 miles 
from the coast. 
The use of chaparral, citrus, and residential areas by great-
tailed grackles is low during the winter, but increases 
sharply with the start of the nesting season in April. The 
species sometimes uses agricultural fields and pastures. 
Their use of feedlots is low during the summer, but high 
from October to April, with peak use in October and March 
when the birds are migrating.

species sometimes uses agricultural fields and pastures. 
Their use of feedlots is low during the summer, but high 
from October to April, with peak use in October and March 
when the birds are migrating. 
Behavior 
Grackles are diurnal birds that forage from nest sites or 
roost areas. Great-tailed grackles and common grackles 
form large winter roosts, often mixing with other species of 
blackbirds.  
Common grackles may exhibit communal nesting with little 
to no territoriality except immediately surrounding the 
individual nests. All species of grackles form loose pair 
bonds with 1 male breeding with 1 or more females, and 1 
female mating with 1 or more males. Males play a minor 
role in building and repairing nests or feeding  young. 
Molting occurs during late summer. 
 
Figure 10.  Common grackle at bird feeder. 
Common grackles are habitat generalists that nest in a 
variety of habitats, including open woodlands, swamps, 
and areas around human habitation. 
The primary winter roosting period in the southern rice belt 
states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas is from December 
15 to January 31. During the winter, more than 80 percent  
of blackbirds in the southern rice states are from northern 
breeding areas. Approximately 50 percent of the red-
winged blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles that breed in 
eastern North America winter in rice producing states. 
Migrant blackbirds leave southern roosts in mid-February 
to early March.

winged blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles that breed in 
eastern North America winter in rice producing states. 
Migrant blackbirds leave southern roosts in mid-February 
to early March. 
Food Habits 
 
Grackles are primarily granivores and eat agricultural seed 
crops, as well as hard and soft mast. They feed in 
agricultural areas, forests, open spaces and human-
dominated landscapes.  
Grackles forage on the ground. In the summer, animal 
matter, such as worms, grasshoppers, spiders, moths, 
salamanders, small fish, mice and the eggs of other birds, 
make up 25 percent to 50 percent of their diet. From July 
to mid-August, grackles eat primarily small grains (42 
percent) and insects (34 percent), whereas, between mid-
August and late October small grains (36 percent) and 
sunflower seeds (48 percent) are important food items. In 
the winter, human-provided food sources, such as garbage 
and birdseed (Figure 10), make up a significant part of 
their diet.  
Overall, crop and habitat availability influence the diet of 
common grackles. In North Dakota, insects comprise 79 
percent of the diet for common grackles during May and 
June. During the summer, the amount of sunflower seeds 
in a grackle’s diet can increase dramatically.  
Boat-tailed grackles (Figure 11) often feed in shallow 
water, wading and plunging their heads into the water to 
capture prey.

Boat-tailed grackles (Figure 11) often feed in shallow 
water, wading and plunging their heads into the water to 
capture prey.  
Legal Status 
 
All grackles are federally protected by the Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act, but actions to control damage, including lethal 
take, is allowed under a “Standing Depredation Order” (50 
CFR 21.43) which allows take of grackles “…when found 
committing or about to commit depredations upon 
ornamental or shade trees, agricultural crops, livestock or 
wildlife, or when concentrated in such numbers and 
manner as to constitute a health hazard or other 
nuisance.” The federal standing depredation order 
overrides state regulations or the need for a state permit.

Human-Wildlife Conflicts 
Numbering in the tens of millions of birds, 
grackle populations in North America can 
cause a variety of conflicts with people. 
Grackles eat agricultural crops and 
livestock feed, damage property, spread 
pathogens, and collide with aircraft. Their 
large roosts can be a nuisance in urban 
and suburban areas. A combination of 
dispersal techniques, exclusion, and lethal 
removal may help to reduce grackle 
damage.    
Agricultural Crops and Landscapes 
Grackles feed upon and damage grain and 
fruit crops, including rice, corn, wheat, 
tomatoes, watermelon, lettuce, figs, citrus, 
and cantaloupe. Newly planted rice in 
southern states is often consumed by 
grackles prior to the birds’ spring 
migration. In peanut-growing areas, 
common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) 
(Figure 1) damage can result in crop 
losses up to 25 percent after windrowing. 
A 1969 to 1971 study in Oklahoma 
showed that more than 72 percent of 
common grackles captured in peanut-
growing areas had peanuts in their 
gizzards. 
Where producers grow sunflowers and 
corn simultaneously, sunflowers receive 
more damage than corn. Grackles feed on 
sunflowers during the early ripening stage.

sunflowers does not subside until late fall.  
Common grackles will pull up sprouting corn, feed on corn 
during the milk and dough stages when the kernels are 
soft, and on mature field corn in the dent stage, removing 
the entire kernels from the cob. Throughout the Midwest, 
common grackles cause extensive damage to ripening 
corn. In Southern Ontario, common grackles are most 
active in corn fields during May and June and in grape 
vineyards during July.

active in corn fields during May and June and in grape 
vineyards during July.  
Great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) damage to 
ripening oranges and grapefruit (Figure 2) in south Texas 
varies in type and economic importance. Fruit with 
cosmetic damage, small pecks and/or scratches on the 
fruit peel are downgraded and reduced in value. Holes 
poked in the fruit or pulp cause blemishes that make the 
fruit unfit for direct consumption. Grackles damage citrus 
to acquire monoterpenes from the peel. The birds spread 
the monoterpenes on their feathers to kill ectoparasites.  
Grackle damage to fruit starts in the spring on immature 
citrus and extends through the fall and winter on ripening 
fruit. The most significant damage occurs after the 
breeding season during July through September as birds 
prepare for migration. 
Because it is difficult to disperse great-tailed grackles from 
citrus groves during the summer, producers and managers 
often resort to lethal removal.  
Droppings from grackle winter roosts change soil pH and 
damage ornamental trees, (e.g., Bradford pear trees), 
harvestable trees (e.g., loblolly pine), and turf. Small 
ornamental plants, especially when sprouting, are 
damaged directly by foraging birds.  
Livestock and Aquaculture 
Grackles are agricultural pests at feedlots and dairy farms. 
They eat livestock feed and spread bacterial pathogens 
that may impact cattle and milk production. Rates of feed 
consumption vary with the weather and number of birds.

Livestock and Aquaculture 
Grackles are agricultural pests at feedlots and dairy farms. 
They eat livestock feed and spread bacterial pathogens 
that may impact cattle and milk production. Rates of feed 
consumption vary with the weather and number of birds. 
Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 may be spread 
mechanically (i.e., on feathers and feet) and through 
droppings by grackles and other blackbirds in mixed flocks 
both within a feedlot and between feedlots.  
Great-tailed grackles, pigeons (Columbia livia), European 
starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and mourning doves (Zenaidura 
macroura) cause the greatest economic losses in 
southwestern cattle feeding operations.  
Common grackles also have been known to prey upon fish 
in fish hatcheries, natural ponds and aquaculture facilities. 
Structures 
In some winter roosts, grackles concentrate on powerlines, 
as well as on nearby trees and shrubs. When grackles 
depart en masse from powerlines, the lines oscillate wildly, 
often contacting other lines or structures and causing 
power outages. A single power outage caused by birds can 
easily cost over $10,000 in repairs and lost productivity.  
Human Health and Safety 
Winter roost sites for mixed blackbird flocks, including 
grackles, typically result in large concentrations of fecal 
droppings that can serve as a fertile medium for the 
fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. If the soil under these 
Histoplasma-positive roost sites is disturbed, the fungal

Histoplasma-positive roost sites is disturbed, the fungal 
spores can be released resulting in a human health 
hazard. If inhaled, the fungal spores cause a lung infection 
in people called histoplasmosis.  
Grackles can be a significant threat to aviation safety 
where large winter roosts or croplands used for feeding

coincide with aviation flight paths. According to a U.S. 
Federal Aviation Administration report, from 1990 to 2013, 
the following number of aircraft-bird collisions occurred by 
species: boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major) (22), great-
tailed grackle (37), common grackle (122), unidentified 
grackle species (125), and blackbirds (1,271). The 
blackbird category likely included grackles due to their 
tendency to join mixed flocks.  
Nuisance Problems 
In urban and suburban settings, large grackle roosts can 
be noisy. The noise can last throughout the night, if the 
area is well lit. Nuisance complaints also arise because of 
droppings, especially on houses and cars located under 
roost trees and structures.  
Grackles can attack people and pets when they perceive a 
threat to nests or young. Minor injuries to people have 
been documented.

Grackles can attack people and pets when they perceive a 
threat to nests or young. Minor injuries to people have 
been documented.  
 
Damage Identification 
Because of their gregarious nature, grackles are easily 
observed and identified. Nuisance complaints are 
determined from visual observations, noise, and fecal 
droppings.  
Citrus damage requires close inspection, as grackles may 
peck only one small hole in the fruit that is not visible until 
picked. Systematic searches of ripening fruit must be 
made if grackles are observed in orchards. Inspect hanging 
fruit from a ladder to determine the whether fruit is being 
damaged.  
Blackbird damage to agricultural seed crops often is easy 
to identify because the flocks of birds and the visible signs 
of the damage are conspicuous. However, correct 
identification of the species of birds in the agricultural field 
is important, along with evidence that the birds are actually 
feeding on the crop. For example, European starlings 
superficially resemble blackbirds and sometimes feed in 
cornfields, yet they usually feed on concentrations of 
insects, such as armyworms, and cause little, if any, 
damage to corn. Also, red-winged blackbirds often are 
attracted to agricultural fields, such as corn and sunflower, 
initially feeding on rootworm beetles, sunflower weevils, 
and other insect pests. They will not damage the crop itself 
until the grain has reached the milk stage. Blackbirds often 
forage in newly planted grain fields,

. Also, red-winged blackbirds often are 
attracted to agricultural fields, such as corn and sunflower, 
initially feeding on rootworm beetles, sunflower weevils, 
and other insect pests. They will not damage the crop itself 
until the grain has reached the milk stage. Blackbirds often 
forage in newly planted grain fields, such as winter wheat, 
feeding on previous crop residue, weed seeds, and insects 
without bothering the sprouting grain. Blackbirds can, 
however, cause serious damage to newly sprouted rice. 
Blackbird damage also can be confused with other forms 
of loss. Deer, raccoon, and squirrel damage to corn can be 
mistaken for blackbird damage. Also, seed shatter in 
sunflower caused by wind may resemble bird damage; 
however, the difference usually can be detected by 
examining sunflower heads for the presence or absence of 
bird droppings and by looking on the ground for hulls or 
whole seeds. Careful observation of the birds in the field 
and a little detective work usually will result in the correct 
identification of the cause of damage.  
To accurately estimate the amount of blackbird damage in 
an agricultural field, examine at least 10 locations widely 
spaced throughout the field. For example, if a field has 100 
rows and is 1,000 feet long, walk staggered distances of 
100 feet along every 10th row (for example, 0 to 100 feet 
in row 10, then 101 to 200 feet in row 20, and so on). In 
each of the 100-foot lengths, randomly select 10 plants 
and visually estimate the damage on the head or ear of 
each plant to the nearest 1% (for instance, 2% destroyed, 
20%

 every 10th row (for example, 0 to 100 feet 
in row 10, then 101 to 200 feet in row 20, and so on). In 
each of the 100-foot lengths, randomly select 10 plants 
and visually estimate the damage on the head or ear of 
each plant to the nearest 1% (for instance, 2% destroyed, 
20% destroyed). For corn, six kernels usually represent 
about 1% of the corn on an ear; for sunflower, it may be 
easiest to visually divide the head into four quarters and 
then estimate the percentage of seeds missing. When 
finished, simply determine the average damage for the 
100 plants examined. This will give an approximation of 
the percent loss to the field. Multiply the percent loss by 
expected yield to get a rough estimate of yield loss. In 
small grains, such as rice, estimates of loss are more 
difficult to obtain. One possibility is to compare the yields 
from plots in damaged and undamaged sections of a field.

Management Methods 
Grackles adapt easily to human-dominated environments, 
and exploit human food and other features of human 
landscapes. Thus, an integrated damage management 
approach to grackle damage focuses on reducing and 
eliminating the damage, rather than simply controlling 
grackle populations.  
The effectiveness of management methods varies 
considerably by bird species and crops. Strategies that 
work in one situation might not be applicable in another. 
For example, a strategy to manage damage in rice fields 
where blackbirds feed and roost will likely differ from a 
strategy to protect sunflower fields where blackbirds only 
feed. Additionally, a repellent application that is effective
Text Len: 1665
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 varies 
considerably by bird species and crops. Strategies that 
work in one situation might not be applicable in another. 
For example, a strategy to manage damage in rice fields 
where blackbirds feed and roost will likely differ from a 
strategy to protect sunflower fields where blackbirds only 
feed. Additionally, a repellent application that is effective 
with common grackles might not be as effective with larger 
species, such as great-tailed grackles.  
The timing of management activities is important. 
Management is most effective when done just prior to 
planting a vulnerable crop or just prior to the crop ripening. 
Producers should also be knowledgeable of grackle 
movement and behavior. For instance, southern rice 
growers can best protect their crops if they are planted 
after most blackbirds have migrated north, usually after 
late March. 
The effectiveness of certain methods to prevent bird 
damage to citrus varies considerably from season to 
season. From April to July, the birds congregate in small 
breeding colonies which makes them more susceptible to 
baiting and toxicants. From August to October, the birds 
can be baited into and treated with toxicants. Intensive 
shooting and use of pyrotechnics can also be successful at 
this time of year at groves with high grackle 
concentrations. From late October to March, birds travel 
widely each day and are easily frightened from groves by 
pyrotechnics and shooting. Depending on the cost and 
duration of the damage to citrus and other fruits, exclusion 
with netting and hazing may be successful. Otherwise, 
habitat modification, repellents and lethal removal may be 
tried.

pyrotechnics and shooting. Depending on the cost and 
duration of the damage to citrus and other fruits, exclusion 
with netting and hazing may be successful. Otherwise, 
habitat modification, repellents and lethal removal may be 
tried.  
 
Habitat Modification 
Habitat modification to disperse roosts may be effective 
when trees are used for thermal cover in the winter. 
Pruning trees to open the canopy reduces the thermal 
cover and forces the grackles to roost elsewhere. Pruning 
trees is not effective in southern climates, however, where 
trees and powerlines are selected for predator defense 
and not for thermal cover. Roost structures may be 
completely removed, but the birds may relocate to a new 
roost location nearby. 
Mechanical methods (e.g., mowing, disking or burning) for 
managing cattail roosts and nesting areas used by mixed 
flocks are labor-intensive, expensive, and often ineffective 
because the stands quickly reestablish themselves. 
Cattails can be managed by flooding, but cattail-dominated 
wetlands in the prairie pothole region seldom have water 
controls to facilitate flooding.  
Sometimes glyphosate herbicide is aerially applied for 
controlling cattails due to the limitations associated with 
mechanical treatments and flooding. Aerial application is 
recommended for managing cattails because basin areas 
usually are too large for ground-based sprayers. Cattails 
should be treated with glyphosate during the late summer 
when the plants are most actively metabolizing and 
transporting carbohydrates to their rhizomes (i.e.,

 with 
mechanical treatments and flooding. Aerial application is 
recommended for managing cattails because basin areas 
usually are too large for ground-based sprayers. Cattails 
should be treated with glyphosate during the late summer 
when the plants are most actively metabolizing and 
transporting carbohydrates to their rhizomes (i.e., 
Page 4 WDM Technical Series─Grackles

underground stems). Treatments can last for more than 4 
years, if water levels remain stable. To prevent blackbird 
use of cattail, the ideal ratio of open water to cattails is 
70:30. For greatest success, water levels should remain 
stable at a depth of more than one foot.  
Exclusion 
Nets are used to exclude grackles from small trees, 
gardens, or vines with ripening fruit. The use of netting for 
large-scale applications is often cost-prohibitive. Exclusion 
wires, such as porcupine wires, may prevent grackles from 
roosting on some human-made objects, such as light 
fixtures, and reduce damage associated with droppings on 
cars and equipment.  
Netting is effective in the protection of blueberries (Figure 
3). Netting is expensive to use and many owners of small 
plantings do not invest in it. Unfortunately, it is these small 
producers who tend to experience more severe bird 
damage.  
In south Texas, several citrus grove owners used 
monofilament lines placed in grids of 10, 23, and 36 feet 
apart and 3 feet above the canopy of their trees to prevent 
damage from great-tailed grack

 invest in it. Unfortunately, it is these small 
producers who tend to experience more severe bird 
damage.  
In south Texas, several citrus grove owners used 
monofilament lines placed in grids of 10, 23, and 36 feet 
apart and 3 feet above the canopy of their trees to prevent 
damage from great-tailed grackles. These protected groves 
experienced less damage than unprotected groves; 
however, preliminary results indicated that the grids only 
were cost-effective when damage levels were high. 
Frightening Devices 
Grackles may be hazed from roost sites using 
pyrotechnics. However, continuous, multiple-night efforts 
are often required to move the birds from well-established 
roosts.  
Propane cannons and pyrotechnics are effective in citrus 
groves to reduce great-tailed grackle damage. Both are 
used extensively in sunflower fields to reduce common 
grackle damage. Propane cannons can be made more 
effective by elevating them above the crop, using timers, 
and allowing the cannons to rotate and fire in alternative 
directions. The use of scarecrows can enhance the 
effectiveness of propane cannons. 
Mylar tape or helium-filled “eye-spot” balloons (Figure 4)
may be used to protect small areas, such as gardens, for a 
limited period of time. However, long-term efficacy should 
not be expected. Mylar tape is ineffective for protecting 
large citrus groves from great-tailed grackles.  
Although frightening techniques help reduce damage to 
citrus during the late fall and winter, site tenacity by great-
tailed grackles makes these methods less effective during

 time. However, long-term efficacy should 
not be expected. Mylar tape is ineffective for protecting 
large citrus groves from great-tailed grackles.  
Although frightening techniques help reduce damage to 
citrus during the late fall and winter, site tenacity by great-
tailed grackles makes these methods less effective during 
the post-breeding period of July through September. 
Repellents 
Methyl anthranilate (MA) is registered as a repellent for a 
wide variety of birds and situations (see EPA Reg. No. 
33162-1). The naturally-occurring compound stimulates 
the trigeminal nerves in a bird’s beak, eyes, and throat 
causing discomfort. MA can be used on grass and turf to 
prevent grazing (particularly by geese) and on ripening 
fruit, rice, sunflowers, and other crops to prevent pecking. 
MA products may not be cost-effective for nuisance 
damage if their use requires repeated applications over a 
large area.  
MA products are water soluble, so they must be reapplied 
following irrigation or rain. MA is not registered for use in 
feedlots or dairies, nor is it effective at preventing damage 
associated with roosting birds. Applicators should read and 
follow label directions and contact their state pesticide 
regulatory agencies to determine if MA requires special 
pesticide licensing. MA products may not be used in 
California or Nebraska.

Toxicants 
DRC-1339 (3-Chloro-4-methylbenzenamine) is an oral 
toxicant registered for use with grackles in both 
commercial animal operations and non-crop areas where 
grackles gather and feed, loaf, or roost. DRC-1339 may 
only be used by USDA-APHIS certified applicators trained in 
bird control or by persons under their direct supervision.  
DRC-1339-treated baits are fed to birds as part of a 
mixture of treated and untreated bait. Rice, fat pellets, 
cracked corn, distiller’s grain, french fries, dog food, and 
watermelon have been used as bait. Birds consuming   
DRC-1339 metabolize the chemical and die of renal failure 
within 1 to 3 days, usually at roost sites. Applicators should 
carefully examine every application project to determine 
where birds may die. It is recommended that local 
authorities and the public be notified when large bird 
mortalities in populated areas are anticipated. Special 
local needs labels may be approved under certain 
circumstances.  
DRC-1339 can be used to reduce migrating blackbird 
populations prior to nesting season. The application of  
DRC-1339-treated baits in corn stubble is more effective 
than soybean stubble, and rice bait is preferred over corn

DRC-1339 can be used to reduce migrating blackbird 
populations prior to nesting season. The application of  
DRC-1339-treated baits in corn stubble is more effective 
than soybean stubble, and rice bait is preferred over corn 
bait by blackbirds. However, the application of DRC-1339-
treated rice bait down bait lanes in ripening sunflower 
fields does not reduce local blackbird populations or 
sunflower damage. The use of bait trays is also ineffective.   
Trapping 
Grackles can be trapped using decoy traps, funnel traps 
and drop nets. However, trapping usually is ineffective if 
food sources outside of the traps are readily available to 
the birds.  
A decoy trap is a large poultry wire or net enclosure 
containing 10-20 decoy birds, food, and water. Birds enter 
the trap through an opening in the top of the cage that is 
covered with a wire mesh. The birds can fold their wings 
and readily drop though the opening to the food below. 
Decoy traps have been effective at capturing grackles in 
small areas, notably at airfields where off-site food is 
unavailable. If decoy traps are used, care must be taken to 
prevent tampering by the public 
Funnel traps (Figure 5) with entrances on the ground are

Drop nets have been used successfully for small scale 
trapping, particularly at food sources or small roosts. Drop 
nets are weighted nets set on poles above the ground with 
a triggering device to release the net and allow it to drop 
on top of birds. They are normally used at locations where 
birds gather to feed or roost and may be used over bait.  
Neither traps nor drop nets are considered effective for 
large roost problems or for reducing fruit or citrus damage. 
Shooting 
While night shooting of birds in roosts may remove some of 
the animals, shooting is rarely effective at stopping 
damage. Shooting birds coming into a feedlot, dairy, or a 
crop field may reinforce hazing with pyrotechnics, but it is 
rarely an effective stand-alone tool.  
Other Control Methods 
Decoy (lure) crops are used to entice feeding blackbirds 
away from valuable, commercial crops. The concept is 
simple—plant a small field (about 20 acres) of sunflowers

other birds.  
or another crop, such as corn, that is attractive to grackles. 
The decoy crop and the commercial crop should be 
synchronized so they mature at the same time, otherwise 
the decoy crop will be less attractive to the birds. Do not 
spray the decoy crop with insecticides, and do not harass 
the birds using it. The goal is to keep the birds in the decoy 
crop

. 
The decoy crop and the commercial crop should be 
synchronized so they mature at the same time, otherwise 
the decoy crop will be less attractive to the birds. Do not 
spray the decoy crop with insecticides, and do not harass 
the birds using it. The goal is to keep the birds in the decoy 
crop as long as possible, thereby reducing the time they 
spend in the nearby commercial field. To encourage the 
birds to stay in the decoy field, farmers can continue to 
spray registered repellents and harass birds in their 
commercial field. In essence, the decoy crop is sacrificed 
to grackles to protect the harvestable crop. North Dakota 
producers who used decoy crops saved $2 to $4 for every 
$1 spent on the crops. Fields with associated decoy crops 
sustained less damage than fields without them.  
In addition to decoy crops, bird-resistant, nontoxic coatings 
for rice seeds have been studied to evaluate their 
effectiveness at reducing bird damage. The coated rice 
becomes sticky when wet and fouls the birds' bills so that 
they cannot feed efficiently. In a study using clay-coated 
rice, the amount of sprouting rice lost to birds decreased 
from 36.5 percent to 17 percent. Bird resistant varieties of 
sorghum, corn, and sunflower have also been studied and 
limited varieties have been produced to alleviate blackbird 
damage.

surfactant) used on grackles at roost sites. When applied

 studied and 
limited varieties have been produced to alleviate blackbird 
damage.  
Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is a wetting agent (i.e., 
surfactant) used on grackles at roost sites. When applied 
to birds, SLS allows water to penetrate and saturate the 
feathers so that with low temperatures (< 41°F) and 
sufficient water, birds die of hypothermia. The product is 
for use on upland roosts located away from bodies of 
water. In some situations, it may be an appropriate 
alternative to DRC-1339. Check federal and state 
regulations before using SLS. 
Relocation of roosting grackles in urban areas may be 
effective for reducing damage. Relocation of roosts can be 
accomplished with pyrotechnics, habitat modification or 
continued disturbance of the roost using low-powered 
lasers or water from a high-pressure hose. Relocation of 
the roost is particularly attractive as an alternative to lethal 
control. However, relocation may result in the movement of 
the roost to another area where damage may continue.  
Because grackles often feed over a large area surrounding 
their roost site, relocation of the roost is not an effective 
method for protecting crops. The exception may be when 
crops are planted in southern states around the same time 
that birds are preparing to migrate north. In these limited 
situations, the dispersal of the roost may trigger a northern 
migration away from all freshly planted crops.  
Handling 
When handling birds, be sure to wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment, such as gloves and protective eye 
wear.

Handling 
When handling birds, be sure to wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment, such as gloves and protective eye 
wear. 
Translocation 
Translocation of grackles is not considered effective for 
resolving most conflicts or significantly reducing roosting 
populations. 
Euthanasia 
Euthanasia of grackles may be done by cervical dislocation 
or by administering isoflurane or carbon dioxide gas to 
birds placed in a sealed container. Care should be taken to 
minimize stress and handling prior to euthanasia. Confined 
areas must be large enough to avoid stress to the birds as 
much as possible. 
Disposal 
Check your local and state regulations regarding carcass 
disposal. 
 
Economics 
There are no economic estimates for grackle damage to 
crops nationwide. Most national damage estimates are for 
mixed flocks that include grackles, European starlings, and 
several blackbird species. The following includes damage 
estimates in specific states. 
 
Page 7 U.S. Department of Agriculture 
In 1979 and 1980, results from a field survey indicated 
that sunflower producers in North Dakota sustained 
between $4 and $11 million in losses due to blackbird 
flocks that often contain a mixture of grackles, red-winged-
blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), yellow-headed 
blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), and brown-

between $4 and $11 million in losses due to blackbird 
flocks that often contain a mixture of grackles, red-winged-
blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), yellow-headed 
blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), and brown-
headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater). 
A 2003 bioenergetics model estimated blackbird damage 
to sunflowers in North Dakota at $5 to $10 million 
annually. Losses by blackbirds continue to remain high. 
Annual blackbird damages to corn and sunflower crops in 
North Dakota from 2008 to 2010 averaged $1.3 million 
and $3.5 million, respectively. The economic impact to 
sunflower producers in North Dakota, South Dakota, and 
Nebraska for the years 2009 to 2013 had an annual 
average loss from blackbirds of $18.7 million, $7.3 million, 
and $2.6 million, respectively. 
In Florida, two types of tropical fruit— the lychee (Litchi 
chinensis) and longan (Euphoria longana)— are rapidly 
increasing in economic importance with a combined 
annual value of over $19 million. During the late 1990s, 
estimates of bird damage to longan ranged from 1 to 28 
percent ($640 to $43,546) per acre, with most of the 
damage caused by common grackles and monk parakeets. 
Bird damage to lychee was 11 percent or $1,179 per acre 
in only 1 of 4 of the groves studied.  
In 1989, producers identified European starlings, American 
robins (Turdus americanus), and common grackles as the

Bird damage to lychee was 11 percent or $1,179 per acre 
in only 1 of 4 of the groves studied.  
In 1989, producers identified European starlings, American 
robins (Turdus americanus), and common grackles as the 
3 most common species causing damage to blueberries in 
15 states and British Columbia. The survey also found that 
birds accounted for 10 percent of the losses to blueberry 
crops. With blueberries averaging $2.42 per pound, birds 
caused an estimated $8.5 million in blueberry damages 
nationwide. Common grackles also feed on cherries, 
showing a preference for sweet cherries over tart cherries.  
Damage estimates associated with cattle feed depredation 
are dependent upon feed mixture, but a 2010 study 
showed the economic losses were as high as $15.43 per 
100 kilograms ($6.99 per 100 pounds) of daily 
maintenance livestock feed. By eating the feed, birds 
deprive the livestock of important grain, starch and other 
nutrients.

Species Overview 
Identification 
Three species of grackles are present in North America: the 
common grackle, the boat-tailed grackle, and the great-
tailed grackle. A fourth species, the greater Antillean 
grackle (Q. niger) is present in Puerto Rico. All are part of 
the Family Icteridae that includes blackbirds, orioles, 
cowbirds, meadowlarks, and bobolinks.

. A fourth species, the greater Antillean 
grackle (Q. niger) is present in Puerto Rico. All are part of 
the Family Icteridae that includes blackbirds, orioles, 
cowbirds, meadowlarks, and bobolinks. 
Physical Description 
The common grackle is 12.5 inches long, with a wing span 
of 17 inches, and weighs 4 ounces. The bird has glossy 
black feathers and pale yellow eyes. The male’s feathers 
are iridescent purple on the head, nape, and breast with 
bronze iridescence on the body and wings. Females are 
slightly less glossy than males. Young birds are dark brown 
with a dark eye. There may be a slight color variation 
between populations. Common grackles are larger than 
other blackbirds, such as red-winged blackbirds, Brewer’s 
blackbirds, and rusty blackbirds, with longer wings and a 
keeled tail. Males have distinctive mating displays.  
The male boat-tailed grackle is 16.5 inches long, with a 
wing span of 23 inches, and weighs 8.8 ounces. The 
female is slightly smaller (length 14.5 inches, wing span 
17.5 inches, weight 4.2 ounces). The male boat-tailed 
grackle is glossy black with greenish-blue iridescence. The 
female is blackish above with a rufous-brown breast and 
throat. Eye color varies between populations from brown to 
pale to yellow. The boat-tailed grackle is larger than other 
blackbirds and the common grackle, with longer wings and 
a keeled tail. Males have distinctive mating displays. The

throat. Eye color varies between populations from brown to 
pale to yellow. The boat-tailed grackle is larger than other 
blackbirds and the common grackle, with longer wings and 
a keeled tail. Males have distinctive mating displays. The 
boat-tailed grackle is located in coastal saltmarshes and 
adjacent open areas, generally not flocking with other 
birds.  
The male great-tailed grackle (Figure 6) is 18 inches long, 
with a wing span of 23 inches, and weighs 6.7 ounces. 
Females are 15 inches long, with a 19-inch wing span, and 
weigh 3.7 ounces. The male is glossy black with uniform 
purple-blue iridescence. The female is blackish above with 
pale to dark greyish-brown on the breast and throat. Eye 
color varies between populations from brown to white. The 
great-tailed grackle is the largest grackle, with longer wings 
and an extremely long, keeled tail. Mating displays by 
males are distinctive. It is located in various upland 
habitats from farmlands to city parks. The great-tailed 
grackle forms large winter roosts.  
Range 
The common grackle breeds throughout the United States 
and southern Canada east of the Rocky Mountains and 
south of Hudson’s Bay. It winters from Nebraska to Texas, 
and east to Pennsylvania and Florida (Figure 7). A native to 
North America, its range may have expanded due to 
agriculture and climate.  
The boat-tailed grackle is found on the coastal Atlantic, 
south of Massachusetts through all of Florida and the U.S

south of Hudson’s Bay. It winters from Nebraska to Texas, 
and east to Pennsylvania and Florida (Figure 7). A native to 
North America, its range may have expanded due to 
agriculture and climate.  
The boat-tailed grackle is found on the coastal Atlantic, 
south of Massachusetts through all of Florida and the U.S. 
Gulf coast through Texas (Figure 8). It is native to North 
America.  
The range of the great-tailed grackle extends from 
Louisiana and western Arkansas, west through Colorado, 
Utah, southern Nevada and southern California, and 
southward through northern Mexico (Figure 9). Native to 
North America, its range may have expanded due to 
agriculture and climate.  
Voice and Sounds 
The common grackle’s song is not musical— it consists of a 
harsh, toneless hiss (“kh-sheee or kh-reezzh”). Its call is a 
harsh, dry “karrz” or “kerrr,” and the male’s call is a thin, 
wheezy, toneless “zweeesh” and a nasal, hoarse “krrrjk”. 
The song of the boat-tailed grackle is a varied series of 
high, ringing notes “kent, kent,” or “teer, teer”. The male 
call is a deep “chuk”. 
The great-tailed grackle’s song is a series of loud, 
unpleasant noises and mechanical rattles of “kikikiki” or 
“ke ke ke ke ke teep”. The male’

Reproduction 
Female grackles breed during their first year. Common 
grackle and great-tailed grackle males also breed during 
their first year, although the territorial breeding behavior of 
great-tailed grackles does not always allow for yearling 
males to establish breeding territories. Male boat-tailed 
grackles do not breed until their second year. 
Average clutch size for all three species is 3 to 5 eggs with 
a range of 1 to 5 eggs for great-tailed and boat-tailed 
grackles and 1 to 7 eggs for common grackles. All three  
species typically raise 1 clutch, but may raise a maximum 
of 2 clutches per year. 
Common grackle males assist in defending the nest and 
raising chicks, but great-tailed grackle and boat-tailed 
grackle males do not. Differential survival rates for male 
and female boat-tailed grackles yields a breeding season 
sex ratio of 2 females per male, with a corresponding 
incre

of 2 clutches per year. 
Common grackle males assist in defending the nest and 
raising chicks, but great-tailed grackle and boat-tailed 
grackle males do not. Differential survival rates for male 
and female boat-tailed grackles yields a breeding season 
sex ratio of 2 females per male, with a corresponding 
increase in population fecundity. 
Following a nest building period of 1 to 6 weeks, female 
grackles lay their eggs. Incubation for all grackle species is 
11 to 15 days. Boat-tailed and common grackle chicks 
fledge in 10 to 17 days, while great-tailed grackle chicks 
fledge in 20 to 23 days. 
Male great-tailed grackles do not participate in the raising 
of young, leaving nest building, incubation, and feeding of 
nestlings and fledglings to the females. Great-tailed 
grackles experience nest loss during the breeding season, 
with hatching success rate of 55 to 89 percent and a 
nestling fledging rate of 36 to 93 percent.  
Nesting Cover 
Female grackles build nests, preferably in the tree canopy 
and out of reach of predators. All species of grackles are 
“loose colonial breeders” (i.e., nesting and breeding in 
close proximity as a group), but single nests may also 
occur.  
Common grackles prefer to nest colonially in shelterbelts 
near inhabited farms. In North Dakota, one study 
estimated a mean density of 0.2 common grackle colonies 
and 3.4 nests per square mile. Common grackles have a 
preference for blue spruce (Picea pungens), but also

preference for blue spruce (Picea pungens), but also nest 
in Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila), box elder maple (Acer 
negundo),  caragana (Caragana arborescens) and 
hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). 
Because boat-tailed grackles are found primarily along the 
coast, nests are often built in cattail or other marsh 
vegetation, above the reach of flood waters.  
Page 10 WDM Technical Series─Grackles 
Figure 8. Distribution of boat-tailed grackles.  Figure 9. Distribution of great-tailed grackles.  
During the nesting season in south Texas, great-tailed 
grackles prefer to nest and roost in huesache (Acacia 
farnesciana), mesquite (Prosopis qlandulosa) and ebony 
(Pithecellobium flexicaule) thickets.  
Mortality 
The rat snake (Elaphe obsoletta) has been identified as a 
common predator on grackle nestlings. Texas indigo 
snakes (Drymarchon melanurus erebennus) feed on great-
tailed grackle nestlings, and purple gallinules (Porphyrula 
martinica) are known to eat boat-tailed grackle chicks.

martinica) are known to eat boat-tailed grackle chicks.  
During a 7-year study in South Carolina, approximately 61 
percent of common grackle nests fledged at least 1 young. 
Depredation was the leading cause of common grackle egg 
and nestling mortality (32.3 percent), while 27.2 percent of 
nestlings died of starvation. Nestling losses due to 
starvation are probably greater for the great-tailed grackle.  
Population Status 
The population status of all three grackle species is 
considered common to overabundant.  
Common grackle populations peak in August and 
September when sunflowers reach their maturity. In the 
prairie pothole region of North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Minnesota, and Canada, the size of the fall population of 
common grackles is estimated to be 19 million birds.  
Typically, boat-tailed grackles do not associate with other 
species of birds and usually are found in small colonies 
during the breeding season. Both great-tailed grackles and 
common grackles may join other species in winter 
concentrations, roosting in mixed flocks numbering in the 
tens of thousands. Urban roosts may spread over several 
city blocks.  
Overall, great-tailed grackles have a sex ratio of 1.3 
females:1 male. The ratio varies throughout the year based 
on life history needs.

Page 11 U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Habitat 
Wetlands dominated by cattails can harbor more than 
70,000 blackbirds, including common grackles. Wetlands 
containing over 20,000 birds are common in the prairie 
pothole region of the United States. The peak roosting and 
staging period at Sand Lake, South Dakota, is from late 
August through September. The roosting habitat is 
dominated by cattails (Typha latifolia) with areas of 
phragmites (Phragmites spp.).  
Common grackles are known to roost in forested areas 
along Lake Texoma in southeastern Oklahoma in 
November. Their home ranges average 125 square miles. 
The minimum area used by the Lake Texoma roosting 
population is estimated at 768 square miles. 
Boat-tailed grackles are associated with salt and fresh 
water marshes. They are rarely found more than 30 miles 
from the coast. 
The use of chaparral, citrus, and residential areas by great-
tailed grackles is low during the winter, but increases 
sharply with the start of the nesting season in April. The 
species sometimes uses agricultural fields and pastures. 
Their use of feedlots is low during the summer, but high 
from October to April, with peak use in October and March 
when the birds are migrating.

Their use of feedlots is low during the summer, but high 
from October to April, with peak use in October and March 
when the birds are migrating. 
Behavior 
Grackles are diurnal birds that forage from nest sites or 
roost areas. Great-tailed grackles and common grackles 
form large winter roosts, often mixing with other species of 
blackbirds.  
Common grackles may exhibit communal nesting with little 
to no territoriality except immediately surrounding the 
individual nests. All species of grackles form loose pair 
bonds with 1 male breeding with 1 or more females, and 1 
female mating with 1 or more males. Males play a minor 
role in building and repairing nests or feeding  young. 
Molting occurs during late summer. 
 
Figure 10.  Common grackle at bird feeder. 
Common grackles are habitat generalists that nest in a 
variety of habitats, including open woodlands, swamps, 
and areas around human habitation. 
The primary winter roosting period in the southern rice belt 
states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas is from December 
15 to January 31. During the winter, more than 80 percent  
of blackbirds in the southern rice states are from northern 
breeding areas. Approximately 50 percent of the red-
winged blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles that breed in 
eastern North America winter in rice producing states. 
Migrant blackbirds leave southern roosts in mid-February 
to early March.

winged blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles that breed in 
eastern North America winter in rice producing states. 
Migrant blackbirds leave southern roosts in mid-February 
to early March. 
Food Habits 
 
Grackles are primarily granivores and eat agricultural seed 
crops, as well as hard and soft mast. They feed in 
agricultural areas, forests, open spaces and human-
dominated landscapes.  
Grackles forage on the ground. In the summer, animal 
matter, such as worms, grasshoppers, spiders, moths, 
salamanders, small fish, mice and the eggs of other birds, 
make up 25 percent to 50 percent of their diet. From July 
to mid-August, grackles eat primarily small grains (42 
percent) and insects (34 percent), whereas, between mid-
August and late October small grains (36 percent) and 
sunflower seeds (48 percent) are important food items. In 
the winter, human-provided food sources, such as garbage 
and birdseed (Figure 10), make up a significant part of 
their diet.  
Overall, crop and habitat availability influence the diet of 
common grackles. In North Dakota, insects comprise 79 
percent of the diet for common grackles during May and 
June. During the summer, the amount of sunflower seeds 
in a grackle’s diet can increase dramatically.  
Boat-tailed grackles (Figure 11) often feed in shallow 
water, wading and plunging their heads into the water to 
capture prey.

Boat-tailed grackles (Figure 11) often feed in shallow 
water, wading and plunging their heads into the water to 
capture prey.  
Legal Status 
 
All grackles are federally protected by the Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act, but actions to control damage, including lethal 
take, is allowed under a “Standing Depredation Order” (50 
CFR 21.43) which allows take of grackles “…when found 
committing or about to commit depredations upon 
ornamental or shade trees, agricultural crops, livestock or 
wildlife, or when concentrated in such numbers and 
manner as to constitute a health hazard or other 
nuisance.” The federal standing depredation order 
overrides state regulations or the need for a state permit.

Glossary 
Diurnal: Active during the daytime. 
Ectoparasite: A parasite that lives on the outside of its 
host. 
Granivore: An animal that feeds on the seeds of plants as a 
main or exclusive food source, in many cases leaving the 
seeds damaged and not viable. 
Monoterpene: A component of fragment oils found in 
leaves, flowers, and fruits.  
Pyrotechnics: Flares or cartridges fired from a gun or 
launcher that produce a loud blast or scream accompanied 
by smoke and a flash of light. 
Relocation: The act of moving an animal from one spot to 
another. For example, moving an animal from your attic to 
the backyard. 
Staging Period: During migration, a time when birds rest 
and feed to improve body condition and increase body fat. 
Translocation: The act of moving an animal outside of its 
original home range, usually a considerable distance away.
