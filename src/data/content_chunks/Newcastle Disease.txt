INTRODUCTION 
 
An Infected Zone and Buffer Zone (Control Area) will be created around an Infected Premises. This 
document provides surveillance guidance for commercial poultry
1 premises outside a Control Area 
in the Surveillance Zone. Surveillance activities and associated testing should be based on 
recommendations of the Unified (State-Federal) Incident Command; this guidance may require 
further modification based on epidemiological and situational information. 
 
Newcastle disease, caused by vNDV, is endemic in a number of countries in Asia, the Middle East, 
Africa, and the Americas. Newcastle disease was detected in backyard poultry in California in 2018. 
Previous Newcastle disease outbreaks in poultry in the United States occurred in the States of 
California (2002–2003), Nevada (2003), Arizona (2003), and Texas (2003). Virulent NDV is 
endemic in wild cormorants and

Previous Newcastle disease outbreaks in poultry in the United States occurred in the States of 
California (2002–2003), Nevada (2003), Arizona (2003), and Texas (2003). Virulent NDV is 
endemic in wild cormorants and non-virulent forms of ND are endemic in poultry. There are non-
virulent strains of NDV endemic in poultry. This document reflects the epidemiological information 
known about the behavior of vNDV from knowledge gained in the 2003–2004 U.S. outbreak.   
 
COMMUNICATION 
It is critical to ensure that disease information, as well as recommended biosecurity measures, is 
clearly communicated to all commercial premises in a Surveillance Zone. APHIS and State/Tribal

officials must ensure that instructions are provided to owners/producers to report clinical signs and 
abnormal mortality. Transparent procedures should be used to manage reports of clinical signs or 
unusual mortality from commercial producers (also known as sick bird calls). 
 
VISITING PREMISES 
While it is important to locate commercial poultry premises within a Surveillance Zone, responders 
should not enter premises unless instructed to do so by the Incident Management Team (IMT). It is 
critical to remember that any

unusual mortality from commercial producers (also known as sick bird calls). 
 
VISITING PREMISES 
While it is important to locate commercial poultry premises within a Surveillance Zone, responders 
should not enter premises unless instructed to do so by the Incident Management Team (IMT). It is 
critical to remember that any real or perceived belief that responders are spreading disease is 
incredibly detrimental to the response effort. As with any premises, if a visit is necessary, 
responders should observe appropriate biosecurity and cleaning and disinfection measures and 
follow all guidance provided by Incident Command.  
 
SURVEILLANCE PLAN 
 
Passive Surveillance 
Passive surveillance is conducted at all times in the United States through foreign animal disease 
investigations (per VS Guidance Document 12001). In the event of a foreign animal disease 
detection, passive surveillance should be intensified through rapid and clear communication to all 
producers in the Surveillance Zone, following IMT procedures. 
 
Mortality threshold levels that signal the need for investigation have been established for the different 
commercial poultry sectors. Commercial flocks that exceed the mortality thresholds listed below are 
investigated and sampled as rapidly as possible for virulent ND. 
 Commercial broilers: mortality exceeding 3.5 birds/1,000 per day. 
 Commercial layers: mortality exceeding 3 times the normal daily mortality (normal: 
0.13 birds/1,000 per day for layers from 2 to 50 weeks, and 0.43 birds/1,000 per day for 
layers over 50 weeks); OR 5 percent drop in egg production for 3 consecutive days. 
 Commercial turkeys: mortality exceeding 2 birds/1,000 per day. 
 Broiler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
: 
0.13 birds/1,000 per day for layers from 2 to 50 weeks, and 0.43 birds/1,000 per day for 
layers over 50 weeks); OR 5 percent drop in egg production for 3 consecutive days. 
 Commercial turkeys: mortality exceeding 2 birds/1,000 per day. 
 Broiler breeders: mortality exceeding 2 birds/1,000 per day. 
 Layer breeders: mortality exceeding 3 times the normal daily mortality (normal: 0.2 
birds/1,000 per day up to 50 weeks, and 0.37 birds/1,000 per day after 50 weeks). 
 Turkey breeders: mortality exceeding 2 birds/1,000 per day; OR a decrease in egg 
production of 15 percent occurring over a 2-day period. 
 Small-volume high-value commercial poultry flocks and other commercial flocks not listed 
here: any sudden and significant mortality event or sudden drop in egg production should be 
investigated. 
 
At the State’s discretion, investigation and sampling of flocks that exceed the mortality thresholds can 
be performed by a company veterinarian, a Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician, or other IMT- 
designated response personnel.  Schedule an appointment to collect samples as quickly as possible 
and conduct sampling according to the recommended sampling scheme below. Submit samples to the 
designated National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) lab as indicated by the IMT. 
 
Active Surveillance 
 
In addition to passive surveillance, active surveillance is conducted to find cases and provide evidence 
that the pathogen is not present. Active surveillance in commercial premises during an outbreak is

Active Surveillance 
 
In addition to passive surveillance, active surveillance is conducted to find cases and provide evidence 
that the pathogen is not present. Active surveillance in commercial premises during an outbreak is 
Page 3 of 4  
composed of two components: response surveillance and surveillance for permitted movements of 
poultry and poultry products, referred to as pre-movement surveillance. This document describes 
response surveillance activities only.   
 
These strategies regarding sampling sizes and sampling frequencies pertain to commercial premises 
located in the Surveillance Zone.  
 
RECOMMENDED SAMPLING SCHEME 
 
Premises Level 
1. Select the appropriate number of premises to sample following guidance in Table 1 below.  
Prioritize commercial premises that are closest to the presumptive or confirmed vND 
premises. Sampling the indicated number of premises w ill result in 0.95 probability that at 
least one positive premises will be detected if the prevalence of vNDV among additional 
premises in the Surveillance Zone is 1 percent or greater.  
2. Collect samples from each barn every 5-7 days for 28 days, or use similar sampling frequency 
depending on the resources available and guidance provided by the IMT. 
3. Continue sampling commercial premises every 28 days for 3 months after the last detected 
vND premises2. 
 
Bird Level 
Select birds to sample as follows for detection of vNDV at a 10 percent prevalence with 0.95 
probability of detection, and collect samples in line with the current version of Recommendations for 
Collecting Specimens from Poultry for Viral Diagnostic Testing (WI-AV-0020 available here). 
Prioritize sampling of sick and dead birds

probability of detection, and collect samples in line with the current version of Recommendations for 
Collecting Specimens from Poultry for Viral Diagnostic Testing (WI-AV-0020 available here). 
Prioritize sampling of sick and dead birds; conduct pooling per WI-AV-0020. Random sampling of 
apparently healthy birds provides minimal detection benefit unless you are targeting poultry with a 
high risk of exposure to vNDV. Oropharyngeal or tracheal swabs are preferred for gallinaceous 
birds3 and cloacal swabs for domestic waterfowl. Do not combine swabs from different species or 
different sampling routes. 
 
1. Sample at least 30 sick and dead birds per barn using 5- or 11-swab pools. 
a. If there are more than 30 sick and dead birds, sample an additional 5- or 11- swab 
pool for each 50 sick and dead birds observed.    
b. If there are less than 30 sick and dead birds, sample the apparently healthy birds 
near doorways, vents, and any area with a high potential for exposure to vNDV to 
obtain a total sample size of 30 birds. 
2. Prepare, package, and process swabs for laboratory submission according to the guidance 
found in the Veterinary Services Guidance Document 12001, which provides guidance for 
the investigation of potential foreign animal disease/emerging disease incidents. VS 
Guidance Document 12001 is available here.

DOCUMENTATION 
As with all surveillance activities, documentation is critically important. EMRS2 is the system of 
record for all virulent ND outbreaks in the United States. Relevant data regarding surveillance 
activities must be entered into EMRS2 in as close to real time as possible. This data may be 
reported internally and externally through situation or close-out reports or other means. 
At a minimum, the following items are important to maintain and report: 
 Number of commercial premises in Surveillance Zone 
 Number premises visited and sampled (including dates) for active surveillance 
 Total birds sampled at each premises and visit 
 Laboratory results for all submissions
