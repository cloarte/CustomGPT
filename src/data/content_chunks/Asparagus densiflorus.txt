 Invasion: A. densiflorusis a spiny perennial plant, persisting and spreading by fleshy rhizomes and roots bearing white tubers 2-3 cm long. Stems up to 2 m long are glabrous, green to brown, much-branched and ‘leafy’ but the clusters of flattened ‘leaves’ are in fact cladophylls about 2 cm long, 2-3 m wide. True leaves are represented by small scales at the base of the cladophylls. The stems also bear scattered straight spines, about 5 mm long, just below each branch. Flowers are in groups at the stem apices, white or pale pink, bell-shaped, with a corolla of 6 tepals and orange anthers. Fruit is a red berry 5-8 mm in diameter, containing one or a few seeds 3-4 mm in diameter (Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992).

 Reproduccion: Chromosome number is variously recorded as 2n=40 or 2n=60. Dasgupta et al. (2007) refer to 2n=60 as ‘diploid’ but Marcellán and Camadro (1999) found this number in var. sprengeri and refer to it as hexaploid, 2n = 20 being the diploid number for A. officinalis . Sheidai and Inamdar (1992) found var. myers and ‘ A. sprengeri’ to be tetraploid (2n = 40), while Kar and Sumitra Sen (1986) recorded ‘ A. sprengeri’ as hexaploid, but A. densiflorus var. pyrimidalis as diploid.

Missouri Botanical Garden (2008) states that A. densiflorus is only tetraploid, but tetraploid or hexaploid for ‘ A. sprengeri’ . Unlike those of the crop asparagus, which is dioecious, the flowers of A. densiflorus are hermaphrodite. They are fragrant but can apparently be self-pollinated as well as cross-pollinated ( Camadro, 1994 ; PIER, 2008 ). One to three seeds are formed in a red berry which is dispersed by birds. Seeds may germinate at any time of the year where introduced in Australia but there is a major flush in the spring and a smaller one in the autumn. Germination can occur from below 10°C upwards, in light or darkness ( Massante, 1963 ). Establishment is relatively slow until the roots are well developed, and tubers form on the rhizomes throughout the early summer. Flowering occurs in late winter and spring through to early summer and foliage may die back during mid-summer, with a fresh flush of rhizome and tuber development each season and fruits may be present throughout the year ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ).
