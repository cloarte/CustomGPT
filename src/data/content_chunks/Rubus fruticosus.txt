 Invasion: Rubus fruticosusis a very prickly, scrambling, woody shrub with a perennial root system and biennial canes. It grows up to 2 m (or more) tall and is extremely variable in leaf shape and plant form. Stems are variable, semi-erect canes, which grow up to 8 or 10 m long. The canes may be green, purplish, or red and have generally backward pointing thorns, and are moderately hairy, round or angled, sometimes bearing small, stalked glands. They are arching, entangling, and woody. Stems can root at the tips to form new plants and new stems grow from the base each year. Roots are stout, branched, creeping underground, growing vertically to a maximum depth of 1.5 m, depending on the soil type

orns, and are moderately hairy, round or angled, sometimes bearing small, stalked glands. They are arching, entangling, and woody. Stems can root at the tips to form new plants and new stems grow from the base each year. Roots are stout, branched, creeping underground, growing vertically to a maximum depth of 1.5 m, depending on the soil type, from a woody crown up to 20 cm in diameter. Secondary roots grow horizontally from the crown for 30-60 cm, and then grow down vertically. Many thin roots grow in all directions from the secondary roots (Weber, 1995;Bruzzese, 1998;Roy et al., 1998;Anon., 2001). The alternate leaves are divided into three or five serrated, shortly stalked, oval leaflets, which are arranged palmately, coloured dark green on top and pale beneath. Some taxa have the underside of leaves covered in pale hairs. Stalks and mid-ribs are prickly. Flowers are white to pink, 2-3 cm in diameter, with five petals and numerous stamens, in many-flowered clusters. In the northern hemisphere,R. fruticosusblooms approximately from May to August, in the southern hemisphere from November to April. The fruit is an aggregated berry, 10-20 mm long, changing colour from green to red to black as it ripens, made up of approximately 20 to 50 single-seeded drupelets. Seeds are deeply and irregularly pitted, oval, coloured light to dark brown, and 2.6-3.7 mm long and 1.6-2.5 mm wide.

 Reproduccion: Physiology and Phenology Seeds in the soil seedbank may sometimes remain viable for years. For example, seeds of Rubus anglocandicans , a member of R. fruticosus aggregate, were still viable after being buried in the soil for 5 years ( Delaisse et al., 2023 ). Seeds require stratification and germinate in spring. Seedlings are poor competitors, but this is compensated by the large number of seeds produced annually. Shading and competition affect seedling survival negatively and most seedlings die in early establishment; Amor (1971) found that only 15% of seedlings at one study site survived the first year. Those which succeed in establishing can grow up to four canes, with a length of up to 1 m, producing daughter plants in their first autumn. Blackberries may also vary in their deciduous nature. The evergreen blackberry is the main type in cultivation in Washington and Oregon in the USA. Evergreen types often have canes which persist for more than 2 years, new laterals being produced each year. Reproductive Biology Rubus fruticosus can propagate vegetatively from 'daughter' canes which can root where contacting the soil. It produces large quantities of fleshy fruits apomictically but also sexually by pollination via insects.

Oldest crowns in thickets being found were 7.5 years old and belonged to R. procerus and R. ulmifolius hybrids. The longevity of crowns of other species in the aggregate is not known ( Amor, 1971 ; Bruzzese, 1998 ). Fruits of blackberry may contain up to 80 seeds or more, and in a blackberry field, there may be thousands of seeds per square metre ( Bruzzese et al., 2000 ). Environmental Requirements Rubus fruticosus is generally a temperate species preferring a range of soil conditions and rainfall regimes. In Australia, it is restricted to temperate climates with an annual rainfall of at least 700 mm, and occurs at any altitude ( Bruzzese, 1998 ). R. fruticosus can grow up to elevations of 1600 m in the USA ( Ertter, 1993 ) and even grow at 2700 m ( Singh et al., 2022 ). It requires moist soil but can tolerate some drought, or even in areas with extreme aridity ( Weber, 1995 ). The plant can tolerate strong winds but not maritime exposure ( Bean and Clarke, 1991 ; Huxley et al., 1992 ). When established, R. fruticosus can grow in full shade in deep woodland, semi-shade in light woodland, or no shade situations, but in full shade fruit production is reduced and fruits ripen later. For commercial production of blackberries, winter chilling is required, and the crop will withstand -20°C when dormant. However, it is possible that some species may be unable to withstand such temperatures. According to Takeda (2017) (as cited by McWhirt et al., 2023 ), temperatures at or below -17° to -12°C (0 to

However, it is possible that some species may be unable to withstand such temperatures. According to Takeda (2017) (as cited by McWhirt et al., 2023 ), temperatures at or below -17° to -12°C (0 to 10°F) can damage canes. Chilling hours start at first frost and require temperatures of 0-7°C (32-45°F) ( McWhirt, 2023 ). Flowers are usually not damaged by frost although young shoots are frost sensitive. Spring temperatures of -3°C (27°F) or below can damage buds and flowers. Summer temperatures above 29-32°C (85-90°F) can affect plants ( McWhirt, 2023 ). Blackberries will not tolerate waterlogged soils, drought or excessive periods of low humidity ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). Associations Numerous animal species, especially birds and small mammals, use R. fruticosus as a source of food and for habitat. It is also associated with arbuscular mycorrhiza ( Helgason et al., 2002 ).
