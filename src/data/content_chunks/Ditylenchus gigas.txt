 Reproduccion: Ditylenchus gigas is a migratory endoparasite that feeds upon parenchymatous tissue in stems and bulbs, causing the breakdown of the middle lamellae of cell walls. Assessment of population densities of D. gigas developmental life stages in infected stem tissues of faba beans showed that the proportion of J4 increases approaching plant senescence and is almost 100% at plant maturity ( Vovlas et al., 2011 ).

arenchymatous tissue in stems and bulbs, causing the breakdown of the middle lamellae of cell walls. Assessment of population densities of D. gigas developmental life stages in infected stem tissues of faba beans showed that the proportion of J4 increases approaching plant senescence and is almost 100% at plant maturity ( Vovlas et al., 2011 ). In contrast, adult stages were the least represented (1.1-8.5%) in all stem tissues. In any case, all developmental stages outside the egg are capable of infecting plants, but J4 is the most important infective stage due to its ability to withstand desiccation and to undergo anabiosis. Extensive, brown necrotic zones can be observed on the surface of faba bean stems towards the end of the crop season. Later, the tissue degradation extended to upper aboveground plant parts, affecting apical stems, leaves and even undersized pods and seeds. Diseased necrotic tissues displaying the characteristic symptoms contain juveniles, females, males and embryonated eggs of D. gigas . Examination of infected necrotic areas revealed internal necrosis colonized by nematodes, which induce the formation of sub-epidermic cavities surrounded by necrotic cells. Nematode migration and feeding in sub-epidermic cell layers dissolve cells, resulting in the enlargement of intercellular spaces. Ditylenchus gigas is very resilient, being able to endure sub-zero winter temperatures, warm summer soil temperatures of 55°C and can survive for years in quiescent J4 stage form in plant debris, seed and soil. The survival period of D. gigas cannot be exactly determined and may depend on several other factors (soil conditions, antagonistic organisms, climatic conditions). Because of the availability of nutritional sources, it is therefore likely that the nematode will survive in plant parts used as food for long periods in agricultural soils

 years in quiescent J4 stage form in plant debris, seed and soil. The survival period of D. gigas cannot be exactly determined and may depend on several other factors (soil conditions, antagonistic organisms, climatic conditions). Because of the availability of nutritional sources, it is therefore likely that the nematode will survive in plant parts used as food for long periods in agricultural soils although probably at low population densities. The difficulty in detecting certain stages of the nematode, in particular eggs, complicates soil population studies or determination of intervention thresholds ( Hooper, 1984 ; Vovlas et al., 2011 ). The nematode in its quiescent state can survive passage through pigs and cattle intestine ( Palmisano et al., 1971 ). Cool, moist conditions during the winter growing season in the Mediterranean region favour nematode infection and disease development. This nematode can survive for years without a host plant, and in heavy soils damage and survival is greater as compared with sandy soils ( Sikora et al., 2018 ). Nematode distribution on infested soil is usually aggregated in patches, since it may have originated from foci of infected seeds on isolated infected plants ( Green, 1979 ). Such aggregation increases the probability of nematode reproduction on infested plants and the subsequent establishment of foci of infestation in the soil. These foci will be small and scattered giving the nematode the best chance of a finding a favourable environment in the field ( Green, 1979 ). The duration of the life cycle has not been properly established, but it depends on the temperature and may differ among isolates of different origins. Maximum activity and invasive ability are generally between 10 and 20°C ( Sturhan and Brzeski, 1991 ). Females lay 200-500 eggs each. Fourth-stage juveniles tend to aggregate on or just below the surface of heavily infested tissue to form clumps of 'eelworm wool' and can survive in dry conditions for

 on the temperature and may differ among isolates of different origins. Maximum activity and invasive ability are generally between 10 and 20°C ( Sturhan and Brzeski, 1991 ). Females lay 200-500 eggs each. Fourth-stage juveniles tend to aggregate on or just below the surface of heavily infested tissue to form clumps of 'eelworm wool' and can survive in dry conditions for several years ( Sturhan and Brzeski, 1991 ).
 Sintomas: Giant stem and bulb nematodes feed within the top plant parts and may infect seeds. D. gigas causes severe swellings and deformations of faba bean stem tissues or lesions which turn reddish brown then black. Newly formed pods turn dark brown. The lesions envelop the stem and increase in length (from 0.2 to 8 cm), often reaching the edge of an internode. In severely infected plants (84 to 14,945 nematodes per g of stem tissue can be found), leaf and petiole necrosis was also evident, which can be confused with symptoms induced by fungal leaf pathogens. In this advanced stage of infection, seeds, which were also infected by the nematode (11 to 816 nematodes per g of seed tissue can be detected) appear darker, distorted, smaller in size and with speckle-like spots on the surface. Heavy infections often kill the main shoots, stimulating secondary tiller formation ( Vovlas et al., 2011 ).
