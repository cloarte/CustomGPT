Big trefoil
Leguminosae
Lotus pedunculatus
Cav.

Magness et al. 1971
In general appearance big trefoil resembles birdsfoot trefoil, but itsrange of adaptation is quite different. It is much less winter hardy so isadapted only to humid areas with mild winters. It is grown mostly in westernOregon but also is promising for the Southeastern States. It toleratessubmergence and grows well on wet, poorly drained soil. It spreads byunderground stems. The root system is shallow. It can be grown in combinationwith sod-forming grasses, competing well with them. It is high in palatability,both as pasturage and as hay. Seed inoculation is important in establishingplantings. While less important nationally than birdsfoot trefoil, it is avaluable crop for special areas.
