European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization Council of Europe – Bern Convention Ministero de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación  de España Ministero de Medio Ambiante de España EPPO/CoE Workshop - How to manage invasive alien plants? The case studies of Eichhornia crassipes and Eichhornia azurea 2008-06-02/04, Mérida, Spain The workshop on Eichhornia crassipes gathered 40 participants from Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, France, Germany, Morocco, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, and Zambia. Eichhornia crassipes is a floating aquatic plant originating from South America sold for ornamental purposes. The plant is recognized as one of the most invasive alien plants in the world. It has huge detrimental economic impacts: it is a threat to agriculture, plant health, environment, public safety, recreation activities, water quality and quantity and human health. More than 15 papers and posters were presented during the Workshop on the biology, distribution, pathways, and impacts of the plant. Emphasis was given to management measures taken against E. crassipes in Africa (South Africa, Zambia) and in the EPPO region. In Spain, the removal of nearly 200,000 tonnes of the plant from the Guadiana River (along 75 km) cost 14,680,000 euros from 2005 to 2008. In Portugal, the management actions carried out by the Municipality of Agueda cost 278,000 euros from December 2006 to May 2008.

000 euros from December 2006 to May 2008. All pictures by Ángel Hurtado Nogales, Confederación Hidrográfica del Guadiana (ES) During this Workshop, a Pest Risk Analysis was performed and it concluded that the species has the potential to establish and cause detrimental effects in the whole Mediterranean Basin. It was concluded that E. crassipes should be proposed for regulation as a quarantine pest (EPPO A2 List) in 2008, and that an EPPO Standard on National Regulatory Control Measures should be prepared. Additionally, the Council of Europe will publish a recommendation to invite its Member Countries: to prohibit the sale, movement, possession and planting of the plant, to monitor the species and share information with other countries, to draft a national action plan to manage the plant.
