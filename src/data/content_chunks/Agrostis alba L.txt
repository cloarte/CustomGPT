Redtop is a creeping perennial, related to the bentgrasses. It is now foundover much of the northern United States, although originally from Europe. Thestems are slender. Leaves are narrow, about 0.25 inch. The panicle is loose andpyramidal in shape, and reddish in color, which accounts for the name. Redtopis used in pasture mixes under humid conditions, also in lawns and golf greensin the Southeast. It is low in palatability, but grows and forms a sod quickly,and so protects from erosion until slower-growing grasses become established.It is rarely seeded alone.
