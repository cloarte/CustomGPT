Desert Locusts' Management Desert locust (Schistocera gregaria) invaded countries within East Africa as of December 2019. The locusts have since spread and invaded countries within the Horn of Africa. Several hectares of crops and pasture have been destroyed. Predictions by FAO Desert indicate that the migratory insect is likely to invade countries in West Africa by mid-July 2020 if the conditions are favourable for migration. IAPSC led a three day mission to East Africa in January 2020 to conduct an assessment of the desert locust (DL) invasion and spread. IAPSC updated the Ministerial segment of the Bureau of the 3rd STC on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment, February 29, 2020 on roadmap for DL control. IAPSC further engaged with the Pan-African Parliamentarians in March 2020 on the DL mitigation strategies and the necessary interventions required to curb further DL spread and destruction in Africa. IAPSC also created awareness on the need for Member States to support the establishment and adoption of an emergency fund for management of emerging pests.
