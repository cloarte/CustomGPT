This is a vigorous, rather coarse bunchgrass, native over most of theUnited States; but of major importance in the Central States and the easternedge of the Great Plains. The stems, which may reach to 6 feet, are solidbetween nodes. The leaves reach 12 inches or more in length, and are 0.5 inchor less in width and hairy near the base. Growth starts late in the spring andcontinues throughout the summer, providing good grazing for all kinds oflivestock. Good quality hay is produced if mowed before seed heads have formed.Roots penetrate deeply; but the grass thrives best on moist, well drained soilsof good quality. Propagation is by seeds.
