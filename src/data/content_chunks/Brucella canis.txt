Canine Brucellosis 
Canine Brucellosis, caused by Brucella canis, is a significant reproductive disease of dogs. It is caused by 
an intracellular bacterium and often found in breeding kennels throughout the United States.  B. canis is 
a zoonotic organism that can infect humans and is currently considered to be underreported in human 
medicine. 1  
The true prevalence of the disease in dogs is not well understood.  The prevalence rates mentioned in 
currently available review articles and information sheets reference results obtained in the 1970’s and 
1980’s with reported rates of infection of1 – 8%.  Within the past few years it has become apparent that 
the incidence of B. canis infection within the dog breeding industry has been on the rise. 2,3.4   The 
disease may have also become more recognizable due to increased awareness coupled with improved 
diagnostic testing capabilities.

 rise. 2,3.4   The 
disease may have also become more recognizable due to increased awareness coupled with improved 
diagnostic testing capabilities.  
There is much confusion about the disease among kennel operators and veterinarians alike. Brucellosis, 
while historically thought of as a disease that causes abortions, has many clinical signs that are often 
misinterpreted.  These include but are not limited to early abortions, testicular swelling, uveitis and 
spinal arthritis.  Misunderstanding about the tests available for Brucellosis, often leads to the disease in 
kennels being misdiagnosed or under diagnosed. Routine blood work and urinalysis are often normal. 
It is possible for infected females to raise infected puppies that can enter consumer markets.  A 2011 
survey of State Public Health Veterinarians reported that B. canis infection is a reportable disease in at 
least 28 states. 1 Because the disease is reportable in many states there is a small but important 
“underground” that tries to avert the reporting and thus serves as a continuum for the disease.  
Additionally, it is important to emphasize that in dogs it is not a curable disease, which means that 
carrier animals MUST be removed from the breeding population in a kennel situation.  Attempts at 
treatment have been very disappointing with relapses commonly occurring. Attempted treatment can 
mask diagnostic testing and has been shown to be yet another important contributing factor in the 
spread of the disease.  
Pathogenesis and Clinical Signs  
Natural transmission of canine brucellosis can occur by several routes.  B. canis organisms are shed in 
the highest numbers in aborted material and vaginal discharge. Infected females transmit canine 
brucellosis during estrus, at breeding, or

 to be yet another important contributing factor in the 
spread of the disease.  
Pathogenesis and Clinical Signs  
Natural transmission of canine brucellosis can occur by several routes.  B. canis organisms are shed in 
the highest numbers in aborted material and vaginal discharge. Infected females transmit canine 
brucellosis during estrus, at breeding, or after abortion through oronasal contact of vaginal discharges 
and aborted materials.  Shedding of B. canis may occur for up to six weeks after an abortion.  Semen, 
seminal fluid and urine from infected males have also been documented as sources of infection.  The 
rate of isolation from the semen of B. canis is usually high for the first six to eight weeks after infection 
but males can have intermittent shedding of the organism in low numbers for up to two years. Both 
males and females may shed the organism in the urine for at least three months after becoming 
infected. The organism can also be present in blood, milk, saliva, nasal and ocular secretions, and in the 
feces.  Brucellosis has also been documented to be spread via fomites during vaginoscopy, artificial 
1 
 
insemination, blood transfusion, or by the use of contaminated syringes or other medical and husbandry 
equipment (do not share kennels, crates or other equipment).  Hands and clothing can also act as 
fomites and increase the spread of the organism within a kennel (do not visit other kennels without 
washing clothes, disinfecting shoes and washing your hands).  The use of high pressure spraying and 
cleaning equipment and improper wash-down techniques within kennels have also been shown to 
facilitate the spread of the disease.  Puppies can

fomites and increase the spread of the organism within a kennel (do not visit other kennels without 
washing clothes, disinfecting shoes and washing your hands).  The use of high pressure spraying and 
cleaning equipment and improper wash-down techniques within kennels have also been shown to 
facilitate the spread of the disease.  Puppies can become infected in utero, during birth, while nursing, 
by contact with contaminated surfaces, or by fomite spread. 
Canine brucellosis is considered a lifelong infection in dogs. Clinical signs of canine brucellosis are 
extensive and variable and depend on the sex and age of the dog affected.  The disease often exhibits no 
clinical signs that are obvious to the owner or veterinarian, or it can present as an abortion storm 
affecting many dogs.    B. canis is a major cause of infertility and abortion in breeding dogs and therefore 
should be one of the first diseases to be ruled out when investigating reproductive complaints.  
 Several months after infection, there will be evidence of conception failures and infertility, such as late-
term abortion with prolonged vaginal discharge, stillbirths, decreased litter size, and decreased puppy 
survivability.  As the disease progresses adult dogs may develop epididymitis, orchitis, testicular swelling 
or atrophy, sperm abnormalities, uveitis, meningioencephalitis, spinal arthritis, weight loss, poor hair 
coat, listlessness, swollen lymph nodes, and behavioral changes. Some chronically infected dogs may be 
totally asymptomatic and still be a source of infection for other animals and humans. The clinical signs of 
infection can mimic many other diseases, and for that reason, Canine Brucellosis has been described as 
“The Great Imposter”.

, listlessness, swollen lymph nodes, and behavioral changes. Some chronically infected dogs may be 
totally asymptomatic and still be a source of infection for other animals and humans. The clinical signs of 
infection can mimic many other diseases, and for that reason, Canine Brucellosis has been described as 
“The Great Imposter”.    
In the female the disease is usually thought of as a cause of abortions in affected breeding dogs.  Most 
abortions occur between 45 and 55 days of gestation, and the aborted fetuses appear autolyzed. Early 
embryonic death may lead to resorption and result in perceived conception failure. Endometritis is 
usually seen in cases of uterine infections. It is also common to observe a prolonged vaginal discharge 
either following an abortion or during proestrus.  The female may also have puppies that are born dead, 
born alive and soon die, or in some cases puppies that live to become adults. 
 In the male B. canis usually infects the prostate, testicles and epididymis and clinical signs are 
associated with these areas. Enlargement of one or both of the testicles may be seen. In long standing 
cases atrophy of the testicles may occur.  Enlargement and inflammation of the epididymis 
(epididymitis) is a commonly observed clinical sign.  Scrotal dermatitis and swelling is usually a source of 
intense licking by the affected male. Infertility may be seen, but these infected males may also breed 
successfully.  The organism’s effect on spermatozoa is well described by Greene and Carmichael. 6 Sperm 
abnormalities can be identified starting five weeks post infection (PI) and become pronounced by eight 
weeks. These early abnormalities

intense licking by the affected male. Infertility may be seen, but these infected males may also breed 
successfully.  The organism’s effect on spermatozoa is well described by Greene and Carmichael. 6 Sperm 
abnormalities can be identified starting five weeks post infection (PI) and become pronounced by eight 
weeks. These early abnormalities include immature sperm, deformed acrosomes, swollen midpieces, 
and retained protoplasmic droplets. By 15 weeks PI bent tails, detached heads, and head-to-head 
agglutinations are seen. By 20 weeks PI 90% of sperm are abnormal. Aspermia without inflammatory 
cells may develop and is associated with testicular atrophy.

Generalized signs may be seen in dogs of any sex or age and include lethargy, lymphadenitis, ocular 
disease and vertebral pain. Loss of libido and unwillingness to breed are common signs seen in breeding 
stock.  B. canis should be considered whenever reproductive problems occur, whether acute or chronic. 
Zoonotic Information concerning Brucella canis 
To decrease the possibility of human exposure to B. canis veterinarians should encourage their dog 
breeding clients to wear single-use protective examination gloves during assistance with whelping 
including the handling of newborn puppies, placentas, fetal membranes, or exposure to urine or vaginal 
secretions.  Extreme caution should be taken when handling any aborted materials including dead or 
partially developed puppies, their fetal membranes and placentas. Protective gloves should also be used 
during assistance with any natural or artificial breeding. Appropriate use of personal protective 
equipment beyond just wearing gloves (respiratory and ocular protection) may be required to prevent 
human infection during cleaning and disinfection and animal

 taken when handling any aborted materials including dead or 
partially developed puppies, their fetal membranes and placentas. Protective gloves should also be used 
during assistance with any natural or artificial breeding. Appropriate use of personal protective 
equipment beyond just wearing gloves (respiratory and ocular protection) may be required to prevent 
human infection during cleaning and disinfection and animal handling in brucellosis positive kennels 
during quarantine and isolation situations.  Caution should be taken when collecting and handling blood, 
serum, fluids or tissues for laboratory analysis by the veterinarian, paraprofessional staff, the client, and 
laboratory personnel if brucellosis is suspected. 
   
Veterinarians should discuss with their dog breeding clients the potential for liability and damaged 
reputation surrounding zoonotic cases of B. canis entering consumer markets through the sale of 
infected puppies or adult dogs. These puppies or adult dogs commonly come into contact with children, 
older adults and other immunocompromised individuals. A recent example is a 2012 New York City case 
involving a 3 year old girl which is the first documented case of transmission of B. canis from a puppy to 
a child in the United States. This human case of B. canis infection resulted in a multistate, multi-agency 
investigation to determine the source of the child’s infection, origin of the puppy, location of the 
puppy’s littermate in another state (PA), additional human exposures, and an investigation of the 
Midwest breeding facility (personal communication with the CDC and the New York City Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene).

�s littermate in another state (PA), additional human exposures, and an investigation of the 
Midwest breeding facility (personal communication with the CDC and the New York City Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene).          
 
The symptoms of B. canis infections in humans are generally similar to those of brucellosis caused by the 
other Brucella species (e.g., B. abortus and B. melitensis).  They are frequently non-specific, and may 
include one or more of the following: fever (often periodic and nocturnal), fatigue, headache, weakness, 
malaise, chills, sweats, weight loss, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.  
 A thorough review of the current understanding of B. canis infection and the diagnostic challenges in 
humans can be found in the 2012 National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) 
document “Public Health Implications of B. canis Infections in Humans” 1  from which the following two 
quotes have been extracted:

 “Although there are multiple statements in the literature that B. canis infections tend to cause a 
milder illness compared to other Brucella spp., serious manifestations have been described.  These 
include septic arthritis, aortic valve vegetations, calvarial osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, pleural 
effusion, oral lesions, lower extremity aneurysms, and culture negative endocarditis.  There are at 
least two reports describing B. canis infection in HIV-infected patients. The disease in both patients 
was well-controlled with regard to viral load and CD4 counts, and each had

elitis, epidural abscess, pleural 
effusion, oral lesions, lower extremity aneurysms, and culture negative endocarditis.  There are at 
least two reports describing B. canis infection in HIV-infected patients. The disease in both patients 
was well-controlled with regard to viral load and CD4 counts, and each had typical clinical 
presentations of brucellosis with good responses to treatment. “ 
 “Although the low numbers of known human cases imply that the impact of B. canis on human 
health is minimal, it seems likely that a lack of clinical suspicion of the infection, its nonspecific clinical 
presentation, the non-availability of approved serologic tests, and the organism’s fastidiousness in 
culture all result in the underdiagnosis, and subsequently the underreporting, of this infection”.  
Population Medicine and Biosecurity Considerations 
Ideal control measures for canine brucellosis in breeding kennels centers around sound population 
medicine and biosecurity practices.   Gaining negative Brucellosis status involves testing and removal of 
infected animals, sourcing new additions to the breeding population from proven negative kennels, and   
isolation and repeat testing of new additions to prove them brucellosis negative.  Practicing strict 
biosecurity, continual disease surveillance with proper breeding management and maintaining strict 
environmental controls (cleaning, disinfection, proper temperature and humidity) are required to 
maintain Brucellosis free status. Particular care should be taken to properly clean and disinfect whelping 
sites and nurseries on a daily basis.

maintain Brucellosis free status. Particular care should be taken to properly clean and disinfect whelping 
sites and nurseries on a daily basis.  
Once a breeding dog population is proven to be free of brucellosis the best way to keep brucellosis out 
of the kennel is to isolate and test all incoming dogs, proving them negative prior to placing them into 
the general kennel population.  This is best accomplished by isolating newly purchased dogs in a 
separate building or facility, away from the general population for a minimum of eight weeks. All 
incoming dogs should be tested for B. canis on arrival and again at eight weeks. Only after these two 
negative screening tests have been done on all dogs in the isolation facility can they be safely moved 
into the established kennel.   If during this eight week isolation period any of the dogs in isolation are 
diagnosed with brucellosis they should be eliminated from the premises immediately.  The eight week 
isolation period is then restarted for the remaining dogs in isolation. This isolation and testing approach 
has proven to be the safest way to introduce new dogs into an established breeding population without 
the fear of introducing brucellosis or other infectious organisms. 
Ideally, breeding dogs should never leave the breeding kennel facility other than to visit a veterinarian 
for necessary treatment (e.g., C-section, serious injury or illness).  It is best to maintain a closed 
population of breeding dogs in the kennel and not send females out to be bred. A female sent out for 
breeding purposes is a risk and any dog leaving the breeding kennel facility for any reason other than a 
C-Section should be tested 90 days after its return to confirm its negative

section, serious injury or illness).  It is best to maintain a closed 
population of breeding dogs in the kennel and not send females out to be bred. A female sent out for 
breeding purposes is a risk and any dog leaving the breeding kennel facility for any reason other than a 
C-Section should be tested 90 days after its return to confirm its negative status.  It is best to isolate that 
dog from the rest of the kennel population upon its return, but doing so may not be practical because it 
4 
 
would require isolation during gestation and whelping, which could be problematic in some kennel 
situations.  
An alternative approach for bringing in new genetics would be to use artificial insemination (AI) for 
breeding females, with semen obtained from outside stud dogs that have been proven to be negative 
for B. canis (two negative tests at least eight weeks apart prior to collection of the semen).  If male dogs 
are to be used for outside breeding, the safest approach would be to only offer this service through the 
use of AI, with the semen collected on the premises and then shipped to the outside kennel without the 
female ever coming to the facility. 
Visitors (including the breeding client themselves) should not have visited any other breeding facilities 
that day, should be wearing clean clothing, should disinfect their shoes, should wear disposable 
protective shoe covers, and should adequately wash their hands. Ideally visitors should not touch or 
handle any dogs or equipment. Some accomplish access without direct contact using video viewing of 
dam and sire as well as video of the litter through the nursing period.  This eliminates most direct 
disease transfer risk until the puppy is moved to the new home.

disease transfer risk until the puppy is moved to the new home. 
Cleaning and Disinfection  
B. canis is relatively short-lived outside the body and is readily inactivated by common disinfectants as 
well as by sunlight.  B. canis is stable in the environment in the presence of organic debris for up to two 
months (proper cleaning and disinfecting is therefore a must).  B. canis can withstand drying in the 
presence of organic debris, can withstand freezing, and can survive in water, dust and soil. The 
combination of organic debris, high humidity, low temperatures and little or no sunlight favors survival 
of the organism (winter conditions in most dog kennels).  
An important and often overlooked part of kennel management is the proper cleaning and disinfection 
of a kennel.  When dealing with Brucellosis or other diseases cleaning and disinfection serves to limit the 
spread of the disease and is a critical component in disease prevention. Proper cleaning and disinfection 
takes time and must be done correctly for a kennel to be considered truly disinfected. It is important to 
remember that a clean kennel is not always a disinfected kennel.  The consulting veterinarian must be 
certain that their clients thoroughly understand the entire cleaning and disinfection process including 
proper dilution and storage of the cleaners and disinfectants, and the fact that required contact times 
and appropriate rinsing are absolutely necessary. The required frequency (daily vs. weekly) for cleaning 
and disinfection should be thoroughly discussed with the client. The

proper dilution and storage of the cleaners and disinfectants, and the fact that required contact times 
and appropriate rinsing are absolutely necessary. The required frequency (daily vs. weekly) for cleaning 
and disinfection should be thoroughly discussed with the client. The facility should always be cleaned 
and disinfected in order of animal susceptibility to disease starting first with the kennel areas housing 
the most susceptible animals (puppies and nursing bitches), followed by healthy adults and lastly areas 
housing any unhealthy or isolated animals. Clients should be educated on the specific biosecurity 
procedures that would be required during isolation or quarantine situations.   
If there is a “good” aspect of B. canis, it is that the organism is very sensitive to most disinfectants when 
they are used properly.  The use of a biodegradable enzyme based kennel degreaser is a must before 
disinfection. A properly used degreaser will effectively remove the biofilm and other organic debris (e.g., 
residues from feces, urine, vaginal or preputial discharges, oil from the skin and haircoat, other body 
5 
 
fluids) that build up in all kennels and can “hide” the offending pathogen(s). The degreaser can be 
applied directly with a spray bottle or conveniently by the use of a hose end foamer. The foamer allows 
for ease of application and increases the surface area covered. It can also help to ensure that all surfaces 
are covered.  The use of degreasers that leave a soapy residual film that can contribute to the biofilm is 
discouraged.

for ease of application and increases the surface area covered. It can also help to ensure that all surfaces 
are covered.  The use of degreasers that leave a soapy residual film that can contribute to the biofilm is 
discouraged.  It is important to rinse all surfaces well after using any degreaser. Once a kennel has 
undergone degreasing the final step in the cleaning and disinfection process requires the proper 
application of an appropriate disinfectant to kill the offending pathogens.  A properly functioning hose 
end foamer supplying the correct concentration of disinfectant is an excellent way to apply the 
disinfectant to all surfaces that the dogs will come in contact with.  It is important to remember that all 
disinfectants have a minimal ten minute contact time with the surfaces to be effective (follow product 
labels and instructions supplied with disinfectant). Most disinfectants require adequate rinsing with 
clean water after the appropriate contact time has occurred.  After following these procedures we can 
be assured that we have reduced the biofilm and disinfected the kennel. 
Diagnosis of Brucella canis  
B. canis monitoring may be achieved with a variety of tests which have been well described by Hollett 5 
and by Greene and Carmichael. 6 See the test comparison chart below for specific information on 
available tests.  The chart was compiled from various sources including peer reviewed publications 5,6, 
available product inserts 7, and information obtained from reputable veterinary diagnostic laboratories.   
Because of the zoonotic potential of Brucella, caution should be exercised when collecting and handling 
blood, serum, fluid or tissues.

Screening a Kennel for Brucellosis 
A whole kennel screening test consists of testing all canines over six months of age at least once every 
12 months.   If there are any reproductive concerns within the breeding population, B. canis screening 
should be done. 
If a positive result is obtained on any test, the dog should be isolated and classified as a Brucella suspect 
dog.  Because of the possibility of false positives on some tests, select a different diagnostic test to 
validate the initial results.  If the second test does not agree with the initial test, a third diagnostic test 
should be performed eight weeks after the second test to rule in or rule out Brucellosis.  Because of 
variability in state regulations, veterinarians should check with their state veterinarian or appropriate 
public health official on how to handle Brucellosis positive test results.   
If a female or male dog has left the kennel for any reason other than a C-Section or veterinary 
procedure, the dog should be tested for B. canis eight weeks after returning to the kennel.  
Testing Considerations for Brucellosis Positive Kennels 
Once Brucellosis is diagnosed (two positive tests), testing and removal of all positive dogs in the kennel 
is the only way to gain negative status.  It is highly recommended that all dog sales be stopped until 
negative status is achieved.  Veterinarians should check with their state veterinarians or public health 
officials to verify if a suspect or positive kennel is placed under a strict no-sale quarantine or only a 
partial quarantine, in which only pups from Brucellosis positive

 way to gain negative status.  It is highly recommended that all dog sales be stopped until 
negative status is achieved.  Veterinarians should check with their state veterinarians or public health 
officials to verify if a suspect or positive kennel is placed under a strict no-sale quarantine or only a 
partial quarantine, in which only pups from Brucellosis positive females are prohibited from being sold, 
traded, or bartered.   Even If a state does not have regulations concerning quarantine procedures for 
Brucellosis positive dogs, it is still recommended that the sale, trade, or bartering of Brucella positive 
dog or puppies from Brucellosis positive dams be discontinued.  
Test all remaining dogs and repeat every four weeks until there are two consecutive negative whole 
kennel tests. Two negative tests should eliminate the organism from the kennel population.   Testing 
should be done with the knowledge of the state veterinarian and with a test recognized by the state the 
kennel is physically located in.   
Re-homing Considerations for Dogs Positive for Brucella canis  
It is important to emphasize that brucellosis is currently not considered to be a curable disease in dogs. 
Attempts at treatment have been very disappointing, with relapses commonly occurring. Attempted 
treatment can mask diagnostic testing, and it has been shown to be an important contributing factor in 
the spread of the disease.  What this fact currently means for kennel owners is that animals infected 
with any of the Brucella species MUST be removed from the breeding population.  
Because of the zoonotic potential of Brucella, confirmed Brucellosis-positive dogs should NOT 
be rehomed.  
Decisions concerning the possible re-homing of Brucellosis positive dogs should only be

 means for kennel owners is that animals infected 
with any of the Brucella species MUST be removed from the breeding population.  
Because of the zoonotic potential of Brucella, confirmed Brucellosis-positive dogs should NOT 
be rehomed.  
Decisions concerning the possible re-homing of Brucellosis positive dogs should only be made with the 
approval and knowledge of the appropriate public health official(s) within the state of origin as well as 
within the state of destination if being transferred across state lines. If the decision is made to re-home 
9 
 
Brucellosis positive dogs, they should undergo an ovario-hysterectomy or castration and be placed on 
appropriate long-term antibiotics, with proper supervision by a licensed veterinarian that should include 
lifetime periodic laboratory testing for B. canis.  Brucellosis is considered a lifelong infection in dogs, and  
even after undergoing surgical sterilization and long term antibiotic use, both male and female dogs may 
continue to intermittently shed the organism. New owners should be made aware of the ongoing 
potential risk that these dogs carry for infecting humans, other dogs and other susceptible animal 
species that they come in contact with (see zoonotic section above).  
Re-homing Considerations for Retired Dogs from Kennels with an Unknown 
Brucella canis Status 
Any dogs that are re-homed or transferred to any individual, entity or organization should have a 
negative diagnostic test for B. canis prior to change of ownership and tested again 8 weeks later.  The 
new owner or organization should be educated in the possible zoonotic risks associated with the 
disease.

Summary 
This document contains a compilation of knowledge garnered from currently available science, 
technology, population medicine, and biosecurity strategies surrounding the management of B. canis in 
dog breeding kennels. It should be considered a work in progress, because the understanding of this 
important disease continues to evolve through advances in scientific knowledge. It is the hope of the 
authors that this information will serve as a guide for veterinarians and their clients with the goal of 
bringing consistency and clarity to the diagnosis, prevention and management of B. canis infection in 
dog breeding kennels.  Only through continued advancement of science and the dissemination of 
knowledge can we hope to control this devastating disease. 
 
Recommendations 
There is an ongoing need for continued basic science and clinical research surrounding prevention, 
diagnosis, and the identification of effective treatment options aimed at the control of this important 
disease. Further study will be required to clarify the epizootiology of B. canis with respect to disease 
pathogenesis, transmission and true prevalence rates in both dogs and in humans.  Immunologic 
research directed towards the development of an effective B. canis bacterin to be used in the 
management and control of this disease in dogs would be welcomed.   The authors recommend that 
laboratory standards be developed for all currently utilized and future diagnostic tests used to identify 
B. canis infection in dogs. We recommend the implementation of quality control proficiency testing of

Canine Brucellosis 
Canine Brucellosis, caused by Brucella canis, is a significant reproductive disease of dogs. It is caused by 
an intracellular bacterium and often found in breeding kennels throughout the United States.  B. canis is 
a zoonotic organism that can infect humans and is currently considered to be underreported in human 
medicine. 1  
The true prevalence of the disease in dogs is not well understood.  The prevalence rates mentioned in 
currently available review articles and information sheets reference results obtained in the 1970’s and 
1980’s with reported rates of infection of1 – 8%.  Within the past few years it has become apparent that 
the incidence of B. canis infection within the dog breeding industry has been on the rise. 2,3.4   The 
disease may have also become more recognizable due to increased awareness coupled with improved 
diagnostic testing capabilities.  
There is much confusion about the disease among kennel operators and veterinarians alike. Brucellosis,

 rise. 2,3.4   The 
disease may have also become more recognizable due to increased awareness coupled with improved 
diagnostic testing capabilities.  
There is much confusion about the disease among kennel operators and veterinarians alike. Brucellosis, 
while historically thought of as a disease that causes abortions, has many clinical signs that are often 
misinterpreted.  These include but are not limited to early abortions, testicular swelling, uveitis and 
spinal arthritis.  Misunderstanding about the tests available for Brucellosis, often leads to the disease in 
kennels being misdiagnosed or under diagnosed. Routine blood work and urinalysis are often normal. 
It is possible for infected females to raise infected puppies that can enter consumer markets.  A 2011 
survey of State Public Health Veterinarians reported that B. canis infection is a reportable disease in at 
least 28 states. 1 Because the disease is reportable in many states there is a small but important 
“underground” that tries to avert the reporting and thus serves as a continuum for the disease.  
Additionally, it is important to emphasize that in dogs it is not a curable disease, which means that 
carrier animals MUST be removed from the breeding population in a kennel situation.  Attempts at 
treatment have been very disappointing with relapses commonly occurring. Attempted treatment can 
mask diagnostic testing and has been shown to be yet another important contributing factor in the 
spread of the disease.  
Pathogenesis and Clinical Signs  
Natural transmission of canine brucellosis can occur by several routes.  B. canis organisms are shed in 
the highest numbers in aborted material and vaginal discharge. Infected females transmit canine 
brucellosis during estrus, at breeding, or

 to be yet another important contributing factor in the 
spread of the disease.  
Pathogenesis and Clinical Signs  
Natural transmission of canine brucellosis can occur by several routes.  B. canis organisms are shed in 
the highest numbers in aborted material and vaginal discharge. Infected females transmit canine 
brucellosis during estrus, at breeding, or after abortion through oronasal contact of vaginal discharges 
and aborted materials.  Shedding of B. canis may occur for up to six weeks after an abortion.  Semen, 
seminal fluid and urine from infected males have also been documented as sources of infection.  The 
rate of isolation from the semen of B. canis is usually high for the first six to eight weeks after infection 
but males can have intermittent shedding of the organism in low numbers for up to two years. Both 
males and females may shed the organism in the urine for at least three months after becoming 
infected. The organism can also be present in blood, milk, saliva, nasal and ocular secretions, and in the 
feces.  Brucellosis has also been documented to be spread via fomites during vaginoscopy, artificial 
1 
 
insemination, blood transfusion, or by the use of contaminated syringes or other medical and husbandry 
equipment (do not share kennels, crates or other equipment).  Hands and clothing can also act as 
fomites and increase the spread of the organism within a kennel (do not visit other kennels without 
washing clothes, disinfecting shoes and washing your hands).  The use of high pressure spraying and 
cleaning equipment and improper wash-down techniques within kennels have also been shown to 
facilitate the spread of the disease.  Puppies can

fomites and increase the spread of the organism within a kennel (do not visit other kennels without 
washing clothes, disinfecting shoes and washing your hands).  The use of high pressure spraying and 
cleaning equipment and improper wash-down techniques within kennels have also been shown to 
facilitate the spread of the disease.  Puppies can become infected in utero, during birth, while nursing, 
by contact with contaminated surfaces, or by fomite spread. 
Canine brucellosis is considered a lifelong infection in dogs. Clinical signs of canine brucellosis are 
extensive and variable and depend on the sex and age of the dog affected.  The disease often exhibits no 
clinical signs that are obvious to the owner or veterinarian, or it can present as an abortion storm 
affecting many dogs.    B. canis is a major cause of infertility and abortion in breeding dogs and therefore 
should be one of the first diseases to be ruled out when investigating reproductive complaints.  
 Several months after infection, there will be evidence of conception failures and infertility, such as late-
term abortion with prolonged vaginal discharge, stillbirths, decreased litter size, and decreased puppy 
survivability.  As the disease progresses adult dogs may develop epididymitis, orchitis, testicular swelling 
or atrophy, sperm abnormalities, uveitis, meningioencephalitis, spinal arthritis, weight loss, poor hair 
coat, listlessness, swollen lymph nodes, and behavioral changes. Some chronically infected dogs may be 
totally asymptomatic and still be a source of infection for other animals and humans. The clinical signs of 
infection can mimic many other diseases, and for that reason, Canine Brucellosis has been described as 
“The Great Imposter”.

, listlessness, swollen lymph nodes, and behavioral changes. Some chronically infected dogs may be 
totally asymptomatic and still be a source of infection for other animals and humans. The clinical signs of 
infection can mimic many other diseases, and for that reason, Canine Brucellosis has been described as 
“The Great Imposter”.    
In the female the disease is usually thought of as a cause of abortions in affected breeding dogs.  Most 
abortions occur between 45 and 55 days of gestation, and the aborted fetuses appear autolyzed. Early 
embryonic death may lead to resorption and result in perceived conception failure. Endometritis is 
usually seen in cases of uterine infections. It is also common to observe a prolonged vaginal discharge 
either following an abortion or during proestrus.  The female may also have puppies that are born dead, 
born alive and soon die, or in some cases puppies that live to become adults. 
 In the male B. canis usually infects the prostate, testicles and epididymis and clinical signs are 
associated with these areas. Enlargement of one or both of the testicles may be seen. In long standing 
cases atrophy of the testicles may occur.  Enlargement and inflammation of the epididymis 
(epididymitis) is a commonly observed clinical sign.  Scrotal dermatitis and swelling is usually a source of 
intense licking by the affected male. Infertility may be seen, but these infected males may also breed 
successfully.  The organism’s effect on spermatozoa is well described by Greene and Carmichael. 6 Sperm 
abnormalities can be identified starting five weeks post infection (PI) and become pronounced by eight 
weeks. These early abnormalities

intense licking by the affected male. Infertility may be seen, but these infected males may also breed 
successfully.  The organism’s effect on spermatozoa is well described by Greene and Carmichael. 6 Sperm 
abnormalities can be identified starting five weeks post infection (PI) and become pronounced by eight 
weeks. These early abnormalities include immature sperm, deformed acrosomes, swollen midpieces, 
and retained protoplasmic droplets. By 15 weeks PI bent tails, detached heads, and head-to-head 
agglutinations are seen. By 20 weeks PI 90% of sperm are abnormal. Aspermia without inflammatory 
cells may develop and is associated with testicular atrophy. 
2 
 
Generalized signs may be seen in dogs of any sex or age and include lethargy, lymphadenitis, ocular 
disease and vertebral pain. Loss of libido and unwillingness to breed are common signs seen in breeding 
stock.  B. canis should be considered whenever reproductive problems occur, whether acute or chronic. 
Zoonotic Information concerning Brucella canis 
To decrease the possibility of human exposure to B. canis veterinarians should encourage their dog 
breeding clients to wear single-use protective examination gloves during assistance with whelping 
including the handling of newborn puppies, placentas, fetal membranes, or exposure to urine or vaginal 
secretions.  Extreme caution should be taken when handling any aborted materials including dead or 
partially developed puppies, their fetal membranes and placentas. Protective gloves should also be used 
during assistance with any natural or artificial breeding. Appropriate use of personal protective 
equipment beyond just wearing gloves (respiratory and ocular protection) may be required to prevent 
human infection during cleaning and disinfection and animal

 taken when handling any aborted materials including dead or 
partially developed puppies, their fetal membranes and placentas. Protective gloves should also be used 
during assistance with any natural or artificial breeding. Appropriate use of personal protective 
equipment beyond just wearing gloves (respiratory and ocular protection) may be required to prevent 
human infection during cleaning and disinfection and animal handling in brucellosis positive kennels 
during quarantine and isolation situations.  Caution should be taken when collecting and handling blood, 
serum, fluids or tissues for laboratory analysis by the veterinarian, paraprofessional staff, the client, and 
laboratory personnel if brucellosis is suspected. 
   
Veterinarians should discuss with their dog breeding clients the potential for liability and damaged 
reputation surrounding zoonotic cases of B. canis entering consumer markets through the sale of 
infected puppies or adult dogs. These puppies or adult dogs commonly come into contact with children, 
older adults and other immunocompromised individuals. A recent example is a 2012 New York City case 
involving a 3 year old girl which is the first documented case of transmission of B. canis from a puppy to 
a child in the United States. This human case of B. canis infection resulted in a multistate, multi-agency 
investigation to determine the source of the child’s infection, origin of the puppy, location of the 
puppy’s littermate in another state (PA), additional human exposures, and an investigation of the 
Midwest breeding facility (personal communication with the CDC and the New York City Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene).

�s littermate in another state (PA), additional human exposures, and an investigation of the 
Midwest breeding facility (personal communication with the CDC and the New York City Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene).          
 
The symptoms of B. canis infections in humans are generally similar to those of brucellosis caused by the 
other Brucella species (e.g., B. abortus and B. melitensis).  They are frequently non-specific, and may 
include one or more of the following: fever (often periodic and nocturnal), fatigue, headache, weakness, 
malaise, chills, sweats, weight loss, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.  
 A thorough review of the current understanding of B. canis infection and the diagnostic challenges in 
humans can be found in the 2012 National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) 
document “Public Health Implications of B. canis Infections in Humans” 1  from which the following two 
quotes have been extracted:

 “Although there are multiple statements in the literature that B. canis infections tend to cause a 
milder illness compared to other Brucella spp., serious manifestations have been described.  These 
include septic arthritis, aortic valve vegetations, calvarial osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, pleural 
effusion, oral lesions, lower extremity aneurysms, and culture negative endocarditis.  There are at 
least two reports describing B. canis infection in HIV-infected patients. The disease in both patients

least two reports describing B. canis infection in HIV-infected patients. The disease in both patients 
was well-controlled with regard to viral load and CD4 counts, and each had typical clinical 
presentations of brucellosis with good responses to treatment. “ 
 “Although the low numbers of known human cases imply that the impact of B. canis on human 
health is minimal, it seems likely that a lack of clinical suspicion of the infection, its nonspecific clinical 
presentation, the non-availability of approved serologic tests, and the organism’s fastidiousness in 
culture all result in the underdiagnosis, and subsequently the underreporting, of this infection”.  
Population Medicine and Biosecurity Considerations 
Ideal control measures for canine brucellosis in breeding kennels centers around sound population 
medicine and biosecurity practices.   Gaining negative Brucellosis status involves testing and removal of 
infected animals, sourcing new additions to the breeding population from proven negative kennels, and   
isolation and repeat testing of new additions to prove them brucellosis negative.  Practicing strict 
biosecurity, continual disease surveillance with proper breeding management and maintaining strict 
environmental controls (cleaning, disinfection, proper temperature and humidity) are required to 
maintain Brucellosis free status. Particular care should be taken to properly clean and disinfect whelping 
sites and nurseries on a daily basis.

aning, disinfection, proper temperature and humidity) are required to 
maintain Brucellosis free status. Particular care should be taken to properly clean and disinfect whelping 
sites and nurseries on a daily basis.  
Once a breeding dog population is proven to be free of brucellosis the best way to keep brucellosis out 
of the kennel is to isolate and test all incoming dogs, proving them negative prior to placing them into 
the general kennel population.  This is best accomplished by isolating newly purchased dogs in a 
separate building or facility, away from the general population for a minimum of eight weeks. All 
incoming dogs should be tested for B. canis on arrival and again at eight weeks. Only after these two 
negative screening tests have been done on all dogs in the isolation facility can they be safely moved 
into the established kennel.   If during this eight week isolation period any of the dogs in isolation are 
diagnosed with brucellosis they should be eliminated from the premises immediately.  The eight week 
isolation period is then restarted for the remaining dogs in isolation. This isolation and testing approach 
has proven to be the safest way to introduce new dogs into an established breeding population without 
the fear of introducing brucellosis or other infectious organisms. 
Ideally, breeding dogs should never leave the breeding kennel facility other than to visit a veterinarian 
for necessary treatment (e.g., C-section, serious injury or illness).  It is best to maintain a closed 
population of breeding dogs in the kennel and not send females out to be bred. A female sent out for 
breeding purposes is a risk and any dog leaving the breeding kennel facility for any reason other than a 
C-Section should be tested 90 days after its return to confirm its negative

section, serious injury or illness).  It is best to maintain a closed 
population of breeding dogs in the kennel and not send females out to be bred. A female sent out for 
breeding purposes is a risk and any dog leaving the breeding kennel facility for any reason other than a 
C-Section should be tested 90 days after its return to confirm its negative status.  It is best to isolate that 
dog from the rest of the kennel population upon its return, but doing so may not be practical because it 
4 
 
would require isolation during gestation and whelping, which could be problematic in some kennel 
situations.  
An alternative approach for bringing in new genetics would be to use artificial insemination (AI) for 
breeding females, with semen obtained from outside stud dogs that have been proven to be negative 
for B. canis (two negative tests at least eight weeks apart prior to collection of the semen).  If male dogs 
are to be used for outside breeding, the safest approach would be to only offer this service through the 
use of AI, with the semen collected on the premises and then shipped to the outside kennel without the 
female ever coming to the facility. 
Visitors (including the breeding client themselves) should not have visited any other breeding facilities 
that day, should be wearing clean clothing, should disinfect their shoes, should wear disposable 
protective shoe covers, and should adequately wash their hands. Ideally visitors should not touch or 
handle any dogs or equipment. Some accomplish access without direct contact using video viewing of 
dam and sire as well as video of the litter through the nursing period.  This eliminates most direct 
disease transfer risk until the puppy is moved to the new home.

disease transfer risk until the puppy is moved to the new home. 
Cleaning and Disinfection  
B. canis is relatively short-lived outside the body and is readily inactivated by common disinfectants as 
well as by sunlight.  B. canis is stable in the environment in the presence of organic debris for up to two 
months (proper cleaning and disinfecting is therefore a must).  B. canis can withstand drying in the 
presence of organic debris, can withstand freezing, and can survive in water, dust and soil. The 
combination of organic debris, high humidity, low temperatures and little or no sunlight favors survival 
of the organism (winter conditions in most dog kennels).  
An important and often overlooked part of kennel management is the proper cleaning and disinfection 
of a kennel.  When dealing with Brucellosis or other diseases cleaning and disinfection serves to limit the 
spread of the disease and is a critical component in disease prevention. Proper cleaning and disinfection 
takes time and must be done correctly for a kennel to be considered truly disinfected. It is important to 
remember that a clean kennel is not always a disinfected kennel.  The consulting veterinarian must be 
certain that their clients thoroughly understand the entire cleaning and disinfection process including 
proper dilution and storage of the cleaners and disinfectants, and the fact that required contact times 
and appropriate rinsing are absolutely necessary. The required frequency (daily vs. weekly) for cleaning 
and disinfection should be thoroughly discussed with the client. The

proper dilution and storage of the cleaners and disinfectants, and the fact that required contact times 
and appropriate rinsing are absolutely necessary. The required frequency (daily vs. weekly) for cleaning 
and disinfection should be thoroughly discussed with the client. The facility should always be cleaned 
and disinfected in order of animal susceptibility to disease starting first with the kennel areas housing 
the most susceptible animals (puppies and nursing bitches), followed by healthy adults and lastly areas 
housing any unhealthy or isolated animals. Clients should be educated on the specific biosecurity 
procedures that would be required during isolation or quarantine situations.   
If there is a “good” aspect of B. canis, it is that the organism is very sensitive to most disinfectants when 
they are used properly.  The use of a biodegradable enzyme based kennel degreaser is a must before 
disinfection. A properly used degreaser will effectively remove the biofilm and other organic debris (e.g., 
residues from feces, urine, vaginal or preputial discharges, oil from the skin and haircoat, other body 
5 
 
fluids) that build up in all kennels and can “hide” the offending pathogen(s). The degreaser can be 
applied directly with a spray bottle or conveniently by the use of a hose end foamer. The foamer allows 
for ease of application and increases the surface area covered. It can also help to ensure that all surfaces 
are covered.  The use of degreasers that leave a soapy residual film that can contribute to the biofilm is 
discouraged.

for ease of application and increases the surface area covered. It can also help to ensure that all surfaces 
are covered.  The use of degreasers that leave a soapy residual film that can contribute to the biofilm is 
discouraged.  It is important to rinse all surfaces well after using any degreaser. Once a kennel has 
undergone degreasing the final step in the cleaning and disinfection process requires the proper 
application of an appropriate disinfectant to kill the offending pathogens.  A properly functioning hose 
end foamer supplying the correct concentration of disinfectant is an excellent way to apply the 
disinfectant to all surfaces that the dogs will come in contact with.  It is important to remember that all 
disinfectants have a minimal ten minute contact time with the surfaces to be effective (follow product 
labels and instructions supplied with disinfectant). Most disinfectants require adequate rinsing with 
clean water after the appropriate contact time has occurred.  After following these procedures we can 
be assured that we have reduced the biofilm and disinfected the kennel. 
Diagnosis of Brucella canis  
B. canis monitoring may be achieved with a variety of tests which have been well described by Hollett 5 
and by Greene and Carmichael. 6 See the test comparison chart below for specific information on 
available tests.  The chart was compiled from various sources including peer reviewed publications 5,6, 
available product inserts 7, and information obtained from reputable veterinary diagnostic laboratories.   
Because of the zoonotic potential of Brucella, caution should be exercised when collecting and handling

Screening a Kennel for Brucellosis 
A whole kennel screening test consists of testing all canines over six months of age at least once every 
12 months.   If there are any reproductive concerns within the breeding population, B. canis screening 
should be done. 
If a positive result is obtained on any test, the dog should be isolated and classified as a Brucella suspect 
dog.  Because of the possibility of false positives on some tests, select a different diagnostic test to 
validate the initial results.  If the second test does not agree with the initial test, a third diagnostic test 
should be performed eight weeks after the second test to rule in or rule out Brucellosis.  Because of 
variability in state regulations, veterinarians should check with their state veterinarian or appropriate 
public health official on how to handle Brucellosis positive test results.   
If a female or male dog has left the kennel for any reason other than a C-Section or veterinary 
procedure, the dog should be tested for B. canis eight weeks after returning to the kennel.  
Testing Considerations for Brucellosis Positive Kennels 
Once Brucellosis is diagnosed (two positive tests), testing and removal of all positive dogs in the kennel 
is the only way to gain negative status.  It is highly recommended that all dog sales be stopped until 
negative status is achieved.  Veterinarians should check with their state veterinarians or public health 
officials to verify if a suspect or positive kennel is placed under a strict no-sale quarantine or only a 
partial quarantine, in which only pups from Brucellosis positive

 way to gain negative status.  It is highly recommended that all dog sales be stopped until 
negative status is achieved.  Veterinarians should check with their state veterinarians or public health 
officials to verify if a suspect or positive kennel is placed under a strict no-sale quarantine or only a 
partial quarantine, in which only pups from Brucellosis positive females are prohibited from being sold, 
traded, or bartered.   Even If a state does not have regulations concerning quarantine procedures for 
Brucellosis positive dogs, it is still recommended that the sale, trade, or bartering of Brucella positive 
dog or puppies from Brucellosis positive dams be discontinued.  
Test all remaining dogs and repeat every four weeks until there are two consecutive negative whole 
kennel tests. Two negative tests should eliminate the organism from the kennel population.   Testing 
should be done with the knowledge of the state veterinarian and with a test recognized by the state the 
kennel is physically located in.   
Re-homing Considerations for Dogs Positive for Brucella canis  
It is important to emphasize that brucellosis is currently not considered to be a curable disease in dogs. 
Attempts at treatment have been very disappointing, with relapses commonly occurring. Attempted 
treatment can mask diagnostic testing, and it has been shown to be an important contributing factor in 
the spread of the disease.  What this fact currently means for kennel owners is that animals infected 
with any of the Brucella species MUST be removed from the breeding population.  
Because of the zoonotic potential of Brucella, confirmed Brucellosis-positive dogs should NOT 
be rehomed.

with any of the Brucella species MUST be removed from the breeding population.  
Because of the zoonotic potential of Brucella, confirmed Brucellosis-positive dogs should NOT 
be rehomed.  
Decisions concerning the possible re-homing of Brucellosis positive dogs should only be made with the 
approval and knowledge of the appropriate public health official(s) within the state of origin as well as 
within the state of destination if being transferred across state lines. If the decision is made to re-home 
9 
 
Brucellosis positive dogs, they should undergo an ovario-hysterectomy or castration and be placed on 
appropriate long-term antibiotics, with proper supervision by a licensed veterinarian that should include 
lifetime periodic laboratory testing for B. canis.  Brucellosis is considered a lifelong infection in dogs, and  
even after undergoing surgical sterilization and long term antibiotic use, both male and female dogs may 
continue to intermittently shed the organism. New owners should be made aware of the ongoing 
potential risk that these dogs carry for infecting humans, other dogs and other susceptible animal 
species that they come in contact with (see zoonotic section above).  
Re-homing Considerations for Retired Dogs from Kennels with an Unknown 
Brucella canis Status 
Any dogs that are re-homed or transferred to any individual, entity or organization should have a 
negative diagnostic test for B. canis prior to change of ownership and tested again 8 weeks later.  The 
new owner or organization should be educated in the possible zoonotic risks associated with the 
disease.

Summary 
This document contains a compilation of knowledge garnered from currently available science, 
technology, population medicine, and biosecurity strategies surrounding the management of B. canis in 
dog breeding kennels. It should be considered a work in progress, because the understanding of this 
important disease continues to evolve through advances in scientific knowledge. It is the hope of the 
authors that this information will serve as a guide for veterinarians and their clients with the goal of 
bringing consistency and clarity to the diagnosis, prevention and management of B. canis infection in 
dog breeding kennels.  Only through continued advancement of science and the dissemination of 
knowledge can we hope to control this devastating disease. 
 
Recommendations 
There is an ongoing need for continued basic science and clinical research surrounding prevention, 
diagnosis, and the identification of effective treatment options aimed at the control of this important 
disease. Further study will be required to clarify the epizootiology of B. canis with respect to disease 
pathogenesis, transmission and true prevalence rates in both dogs and in humans.  Immunologic 
research directed towards the development of an effective B. canis bacterin to be used in the 
management and control of this disease in dogs would be welcomed.   The authors recommend that 
laboratory standards be developed for all currently utilized and future diagnostic tests used to identify 
B. canis infection in dogs. We recommend the implementation of quality control proficiency testing of
