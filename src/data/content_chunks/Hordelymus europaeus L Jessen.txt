Hordelymus europaeus(L.) Jessen - Wood Barley  -Gramineae / Poaceae© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This grass is extremely rare in Ireland. Its only known Irish site is near Carnlough where it has not been seen since 1949, and was only seen once before that, in 1889! It seems possible that the plant is extinct, but since it grew amongst other grasses in a very inaccessible situation, it may be merely overlooked.All names:Hordelymus europaeus(L.)
