Precautions: Leptospira spp. are classified as biosafety level 2 pathogens. Handle under 
biological safety hood while wearing gloves. Use face shield when inoculating animals. 
6. Intended Use: Challenge material for L. pomona testing. 
7. Instructions for Use: Remove vials from cold storage and thaw at room temperature (18°-
27°C) for approximately one hour. A water bath or other warming device is not recommended. 
Do not vortex during thawing. An 18 gauge needle is recommended to remove cryopreserved 
challenge from the vial. You may draw the contents of more than one vial into a single syringe 
for convenience. However, to limit spirochete stress and minimize the human safety risk when 
working with a zoonotic agent, do not actively mix the contents of separate vials. 
Inoculate 50-90 g hamsters, preferably four hamsters total, with cryopreserved challenge using a 
23 gauge or smaller bore needle. Each hamster should receive at least 0.25 mL IP. At least 50% 
of the inoculated hamsters should exhibit clinical signs within 10 days post-inoculation, and 
clinical signs within 4-5 days is expected. Hamster death prior to 3 days should not be attributed 
to leptospirosis. The Leptospira must be serially transferred through hamsters a minimum of 
three times before used as challenge material in a potency test according to Supplemental Assay 
Method (SAM) 608. 
8. Test of Reagent: Identity was confirmed by ELISA, MAT, PFGE, REA and MLST 
analysis. IRP 654 was verified as a virulent challenge when used in potency tests conducted 
according to SAM 608. The culture was negative for extr

 as challenge material in a potency test according to Supplemental Assay

8. Test of Reagent: Identity was confirmed by ELISA, MAT, PFGE, REA and MLST 
analysis. IRP 654 was verified as a virulent challenge when used in potency tests conducted 
according to SAM 608. The culture was negative for extraneous bacteria when incubated on 
blood agar plates at 37ºC after three passages in hamsters. No hemadsorbing or cytopathogenic 
viruses were present based on bovine and hamster cells testing. Fluorescent antibody staining 
verified the absence of the following: REO 1, Rabies, BVDV1, BVDV2, BPV, BTV, BAV1, 
BAV5 and BRSV. PCR also verified the absence of BVDV1, BVDV2, PCV1, PCV2, and PRRS.
