IMPACT  OF DETECTING A NEW  PATHOGEN IN THE U.S.  
ISSUE – A NEW PATHOGEN THAT THREATENS THE NURSERY INDUSTRY AND 
NATURAL ECOSYSTEM  
• Oregon’s top agricultural commodity is the nursery 
industry with a value of $1.22 billion annually (NASS 
2022). 
• In 2024, the Oregon State University (OSU) Plant 
Clinic detected Phytophthora austrocedri for the first 
time in the U.S. from a Juniper sample submitted by a 
nursery. 
• The pathogen infects plants in the Cypress family, 
which include juniper and arborvitae, posing a risk to 
the nursery industry.  
• Native forest species, such as Port Orford cedar and 
western red cedar, are also at risk should this 
pathogen establish in forestlands. 
 
RESPONSE  
• The OSU Plant Clinic worked with the Oregon 
Department of Agriculture (ODA) to report the 
pathogen to USDA-APHIS.  
• The ODA worked with USDA-APHIS to survey infested nurseries, identify new hosts, and to 
remove infected plants. 
 
RESULTS  
• OSU Plant Clinic provided rapid identification and communication when this pathogen was 
introduced into the U.S. facilitating regulatory response. 
• Response included raising awareness in Oregon on the risk of Phytophthora to the nursery industry. 
• Information of the new pathogen was shared with diagnosticians in other states to raise awareness 
of this new risk. 
• Researchers

The NPDN is critical for maintaining relationships between diagnostic clinics and 
regulatory agencies so we can surveil emerging pathogens and prevent their spread - 
Mana Ohkura, Director of Oregon State University Plant Clinic 
 
The NPDN expands our capacity to detect and respond to novel plant pathogens. In 
the case of P. austrocedri, the NPDN was key in identifying the causal pathogen to 
species. Going forward the OSU Plant Clinic will continue to provide identification 
services to industry and support ongoing research efforts.  – Chris Benemann, Plant 
Protection Division Director, Oregon Department of Agriculture.
