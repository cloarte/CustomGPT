 Invasion: EggsEggs are contained within the dead body of the female, the cuticle of which tans to a light and then darker brown colour to form the cyst. They may also be deposited into the soil, particularly on the surface of infected host roots, by the partly exposed, fertilized females while the females are still alive. The eggs are laid in a gelatinous matrix often referred to as an egg sac. These eggs in the sac and those within the cyst are the same size. It is possible that second stage juveniles will hatch from the egg sac before encysted eggs do. They can persist in the soil for some months and may not hatch until a new host is available.JuvenileJ2 (n=50):L 486±22 µm; body width at excretory pore 19.4±0.7 µm; stylet length 24.6±0.

The hemizonion is found six to eight annules posterior to the excretory pore and is less than one annule in length. About half way along the body the two-celled, genital primordium can be seen very distinctly. The tail tapers to a rounded point, the hyaline (clear) portion of which is equal to about two thirds of the tail length and often displays one or two refractive bodies near the terminus.

The head skeleton is hexaradiate, but weak. The stylet is ca 26 µm in length. The conus represents 50% of the stylet length and the basal knobs are rounded in shape. The excretory pore is positioned at the base of the neck. The median oesophageal bulb is sub-spherical to spherical with a prominent valve. The oesophageal glands are often displaced by the large well developed ovaries. The vulva is positioned at the terminal end of the female vulval cone. The fenestral area is thin walled and crossing this transversely is the vulval bridge, which bears the vulval slit through which the eggs are extruded into an egg sac. The vulval bridge bisects the fenestra to form two almost equally sized semi-fenestrae, this whole area being bounded by a thick cuticular band. The anus lies dorsally to the bridge. Young females are white, without a yellow phase, and after a short time the female dies to form a tanned cyst.Cyst(n=25) Length excluding neck 521±53 µm; maximum width 372±44 µm; length of fenestra 35.3±5.9 µm; width of fenestra 37.4±4.3 µm; length of semi-fenestra 16.3±3.9 µm; anus to fenestral edge 36.2±4.6 µm; length of vulval bridge 33.0±5.4 µm; maximum width of vulval bridge 3.0±0.9 µm

The cyst contains viable eggs which become the infective second stage juveniles. The head is usually broken off leaving just the neck or a hole at the anterior end of the body. The terminal end of the vulval cone, unless the cyst is very old, is usually intact and is useful in the diagnosis of the Heterodera genus. H. goettingiana is ambifenestrate, i.e. it has two closely depressed semi-fenestrae as described for the female. Lateral muscles on the inner cuticle wall may be seen under the vulval bridge.

ettingiana is ambifenestrate, i.e. it has two closely depressed semi-fenestrae as described for the female. Lateral muscles on the inner cuticle wall may be seen under the vulval bridge. In H. goettingiana this structure, the underbridge is very light and difficult to see. It is often absent from old cysts and is sometimes lost during careless preparation. Bullae (highly pigmented bodies which can be seen above or below the underbridge in other Heterodera spp.), another diagnostic feature used for the identification of cysts, are not usually present. The cuticle of the cyst is covered by ridges and folds. In H. goettingiana these form a fairly characteristic brick-work pattern around the cone and body wall. New cysts have a sub-crystalline layer, which is common in many newly formed Heterodera cysts.Male(n=50) Length 1270±112 µm; width at excretory pore 24.7±0.8 µm; stylet length 26.8±1 µm; stylet base to dorsal oesophageal gland duct 7.9±1.2 µm; head tip to median bulb valve 100.9±5.5 µm; head tip to excretory pore 157.5±9.9 µm; spicule length along axis = 26.5±4.3 µm; gubernaculum length 12.2±2 µm; length of testis plus vas deferens = 663±81 µm; tail length = 5.1±1 µm.Males are vermiform and are usually about 1300 µm in length.

On death, the male acquires a 90° twist from the mid-body to the tail along the length of the nematode. This is a characteristic of male Heterodera and Globodera. There are four incisures in the lateral fields, which are areolated, as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The head is offset and has five or six head annules. The heavily sclerotized head skeleton is hexaradiate. The cephalids are located anteriorly at the second body annule level and more posteriorly at the eighth body annule. The stylet is strong and well developed with knobs that have rounded anterior faces. The median bulb is ellipsoid with strong crescentic valves. The dorsal and sub-ventral oesophageal glands extend past the excretory pore, the sub-ventral gland lobe being the longer of the two glands. From the head end, these glands stretch to ca 15% of body length. There is a prominent dorsal gland nucleus, whereas the subventral nuclei are obscure. The nerve ring is located between the median bulb and gland lobes, surrounding the oesophagus. The hemizonid is found five or six annules in front of the excretory pore and is itself two annules in length. A hemizonion is not found.

The single testis contains an abundance of round spermatogonia and is about half the total body length, ending in the vas deferens which is glandular walled with a narrow lumen. The cloacal opening is small, surrounded by a circular ring of muscle tissue. The spicules are typical of Heterodera males. Spicule tips are broad with bidentate tips (Clark et al., 1973). There is a simple rod-like gubernaculum. Phasmids and caudalids are not found.Some measurements from other sources can be found inFranklin (1949);Hesling (1965); Behrens (1971);Mulvey (1972);Wouts and Weischer (1977);Baldwin and Mundo-Ocampo (1991); DiVito (1991).

 Reproduccion: The life history and biology of most Heterodera species follow similar basic patterns. This has been shown and discussed by Macara (1963) , Stone and Course (1974) and Di Vito and Greco (1986) . The egg contains the first stage juvenile which moults within the egg and the second stage juvenile emerges. The second stage juvenile probably hatches in response to an environmental stimulus such as temperature. The optimum temperature for hatching is around 15°C . At temperatures greater than 25°C hatching is suppressed ( Di Vito and Greco, 1986 ). The stimulation to hatch is also greatly influenced by root exudates from host roots ( Shepherd, 1963 ). Older host roots seem to induce a greater rate of hatching than younger roots ( Perry et al., 1980 ). Once the second stage juvenile has entered the host roots it will pass through three more consecutive moults to become an adult.

 is suppressed ( Di Vito and Greco, 1986 ). The stimulation to hatch is also greatly influenced by root exudates from host roots ( Shepherd, 1963 ). Older host roots seem to induce a greater rate of hatching than younger roots ( Perry et al., 1980 ). Once the second stage juvenile has entered the host roots it will pass through three more consecutive moults to become an adult. Beane and Perry (1984) found that a temperature of 4.4°C appeared to be the basal temperature for development. Below 4.4°C the fourth stage moult is inhibited. Males are common and their development is possibly environmentally influenced, particularly at high population densities when a larger proportion of males are formed (Guevara-Benitez et al., 1970). Males begin to emerge from the host 2 months or less after juvenile invasion but maximum numbers of males emerge ca 4-4.5 months after invasion. Females enlarge in the host root tissue and eventually become so large that they break through the cortical root cells to become exposed on the root surface and are subsequently mated by males. As with other Heterodera males, they are thought not to feed but to mate and die within 2 or 3 weeks of emergence. The white female, once mated, begins to tan, there is no yellow female phase ( Thorne, 1961 ). In optimum conditions, i.e. the correct soil moisture, a good host and a soil temperature of around 13-15°C, maximum egg production should take place and an egg sac may be present. An egg sac usually contains ca 100 eggs. In unfavourable conditions no egg sac will be produced. The number of generations produced in a year is governed by environmental factors: in the warm climates of southern Italy three generations have been recorded per year ( Di Vito et al., 1974 ) whereas in Britain only one, and exceptionally two generations will be produced annually (Jones, 1950).

Cysts can remain in fields for up to 12 years ( Di Vito and Greco, 1986 ), still containing viable eggs.Histological details of H. goettingiana infestations in host roots are now becoming better understood, particularly through the work of Arrigoni et al. (1981) and Melillo et al. (1990, 1992). Other workers ( Endo, 1986 ; Wyss and Zunke, 1986 ) have looked at similar systems to those studied in other species of cyst nematodes such as H. glycines and H. schachtii; for example the granules released in stylet exudates and the overall changes caused in plant cells and syncytia.Unusually, plant roots infected with H. goettingiana do not display excessive numbers of lateral rootlets. This nematode is capable of eliminating Rhizobium nodules from peas completely. In such cases, plants show severe nitrogen deficiency, chlorosis, dwarfing, limitation of the number of flowering nodes and early senescence ( Oostenbrink, 1955 ; Perry and Beane, 1983 ). Extra fertilizer will not stimulate plant growth after invasion by H. goettingiana ( Green and Williamson, 1978 ).In the very early years of nematology, Capus (1917) noticed that the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, which often appeared alongside H. goettingiana in the field, aggravated the damage to field crops: peas would often succumb to root rot.Nematode population densities and effects on plant yield are both variable.

Winslow (1955) found that 127 eggs/gram of soil caused complete crop failure. Various other figures have been given ( Winslow, 1955 ; Di Vito, 1978). Even in the absence of a host plant, cysts are known to remain in the soil for up to 12 years ( Brown, 1958 ), although each year, the viability of the cyst contents falls.
 Sintomas: Heterodera goettingiana becomes noticeable in infested fields when localized patches of plants become stunted and yellowed. Heavily infected pea plants are severely stunted, chlorotic and die off before the pods are full of peas. The roots of heavily infected plants are devoid of Rhizobium nodules and the root systems are smaller than those of their healthy counterparts.The yellowing patches may expand during the growing season. This is due to the slower development of symptoms in the less heavily infected plants at the edges of the patches and not to a sudden spread of the nematodes. In general, patches in fields will increase slowly in size unless the nematode is moved during cultivation operations. When peas are grown in a monocrop in an infested field the crop will eventually fail to give an economic yield.

The oesophageal glands are often displaced by the large well developed ovaries. The vulva is positioned at the terminal end of the female vulval cone. The fenestral area is thin walled and crossing this transversely is the vulval bridge, which bears the vulval slit through which the eggs are extruded into an egg sac. The vulval bridge bisects the fenestra to form two almost equally sized semi-fenestrae, this whole area being bounded by a thick cuticular band. The anus lies dorsally to the bridge. Young females are white, without a yellow phase, and after a short time the female dies to form a tanned cyst.Cyst(n=25) Length excluding neck 521±53 µm; maximum width 372±44 µm; length of fenestra 35.3±5.9 µm; width of fenestra 37.4±4.3 µm; length of semi-fenestra 16.3±3.9 µm; anus to fenestral edge 36.2±4.6 µm; length of vulval bridge 33.0±5.4 µm; maximum width of vulval bridge 3.0±0.9 µm

The cyst contains viable eggs which become the infective second stage juveniles. The head is usually broken off leaving just the neck or a hole at the anterior end of the body. The terminal end of the vulval cone, unless the cyst is very old, is usually intact and is useful in the diagnosis of the Heterodera genus. H. goettingiana is ambifenestrate, i.e. it has two closely depressed semi-fenestrae as described for the female. Lateral muscles on the inner cuticle wall may be seen under the vulval bridge. In H. goettingiana this structure, the underbridge is very light and difficult to see. It is often absent from old cysts and is sometimes lost

ettingiana is ambifenestrate, i.e. it has two closely depressed semi-fenestrae as described for the female. Lateral muscles on the inner cuticle wall may be seen under the vulval bridge. In H. goettingiana this structure, the underbridge is very light and difficult to see. It is often absent from old cysts and is sometimes lost during careless preparation. Bullae (highly pigmented bodies which can be seen above or below the underbridge in other Heterodera spp.), another diagnostic feature used for the identification of cysts, are not usually present. The cuticle of the cyst is covered by ridges and folds. In H. goettingiana these form a fairly characteristic brick-work pattern around the cone and body wall. New cysts have a sub-crystalline layer, which is common in many newly formed Heterodera cysts.Male(n=50) Length 1270±112 µm; width at excretory pore 24.7±0.8 µm; stylet length 26.8±1 µm; stylet base to dorsal oesophageal gland duct 7.9±1.2 µm; head tip to median bulb valve 100.9±5.5 µm; head tip to excretory pore 157.5±9.9 µm; spicule length along axis = 26.5±4.3 µm; gubernaculum length 12.2±2 µm; length of testis plus vas deferens = 663±81 µm; tail length = 5.1±1 µm.Males are vermiform and are usually about 1300 µm in length.

is plus vas deferens = 663±81 µm; tail length = 5.1±1 µm.Males are vermiform and are usually about 1300 µm in length. The tail region is short, blunt and without a bursa. On death, the male acquires a 90° twist from the mid-body to the tail along the length of the nematode. This is a characteristic of male Heterodera and Globodera. There are four incisures in the lateral fields, which are areolated, as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The head is offset and has five or six head annules. The heavily sclerotized head skeleton is hexaradiate. The cephalids are located anteriorly at the second body annule level and more posteriorly at the eighth body annule. The stylet is strong and well developed with knobs that have rounded anterior faces. The median bulb is ellipsoid with strong crescentic valves. The dorsal and sub-ventral oesophageal glands extend past the excretory pore, the sub-ventral gland lobe being the longer of the two glands. From the head end, these glands stretch to ca 15% of body length. There is a prominent dorsal gland nucleus, whereas the subventral nuclei are obscure. The nerve ring is located between the median bulb and gland lobes, surrounding the oesophagus. The hemizonid is found five or six annules in front of the excretory pore and is itself two annules in length. A hemizonion is not found. The single testis contains an abundance of round spermatogonia and is about half the total body length, ending in the vas deferens which is glandular walled with a narrow lumen.

The single testis contains an abundance of round spermatogonia and is about half the total body length, ending in the vas deferens which is glandular walled with a narrow lumen. The cloacal opening is small, surrounded by a circular ring of muscle tissue. The spicules are typical of Heterodera males. Spicule tips are broad with bidentate tips (Clark et al., 1973). There is a simple rod-like gubernaculum. Phasmids and caudalids are not found.Some measurements from other sources can be found inFranklin (1949);Hesling (1965); Behrens (1971);Mulvey (1972);Wouts and Weischer (1977);Baldwin and Mundo-Ocampo (1991); DiVito (1991).

 Reproduccion: The life history and biology of most Heterodera species follow similar basic patterns. This has been shown and discussed by Macara (1963) , Stone and Course (1974) and Di Vito and Greco (1986) . The egg contains the first stage juvenile which moults within the egg and the second stage juvenile emerges. The second stage juvenile probably hatches in response to an environmental stimulus such as temperature. The optimum temperature for hatching is around 15°C . At temperatures greater than 25°C hatching is suppressed ( Di Vito and Greco, 1986 ). The stimulation to hatch is also greatly influenced by root exudates from host roots ( Shepherd, 1963 ). Older host roots seem to induce a greater rate of hatching than younger roots ( Perry et al., 1980 ). Once the second stage juvenile has entered the host roots it will pass through three more consecutive moults to become an adult.

Older host roots seem to induce a greater rate of hatching than younger roots ( Perry et al., 1980 ). Once the second stage juvenile has entered the host roots it will pass through three more consecutive moults to become an adult. Beane and Perry (1984) found that a temperature of 4.4°C appeared to be the basal temperature for development. Below 4.4°C the fourth stage moult is inhibited. Males are common and their development is possibly environmentally influenced, particularly at high population densities when a larger proportion of males are formed (Guevara-Benitez et al., 1970). Males begin to emerge from the host 2 months or less after juvenile invasion but maximum numbers of males emerge ca 4-4.5 months after invasion. Females enlarge in the host root tissue and eventually become so large that they break through the cortical root cells to become exposed on the root surface and are subsequently mated by males. As with other Heterodera males, they are thought not to feed but to mate and die within 2 or 3 weeks of emergence. The white female, once mated, begins to tan, there is no yellow female phase ( Thorne, 1961 ). In optimum conditions, i.e. the correct soil moisture, a good host and a soil temperature of around 13-15°C, maximum egg production should take place and an egg sac may be present. An egg sac usually contains ca 100 eggs. In unfavourable conditions no egg sac will be produced. The number of generations produced in a year is governed by environmental factors: in the warm climates of southern Italy three generations have been recorded per year ( Di Vito et al., 1974 ) whereas in Britain only one, and exceptionally two generations will be produced annually (Jones, 1950).

Cysts can remain in fields for up to 12 years ( Di Vito and Greco, 1986 ), still containing viable eggs.Histological details of H. goettingiana infestations in host roots are now becoming better understood, particularly through the work of Arrigoni et al. (1981) and Melillo et al. (1990, 1992). Other workers ( Endo, 1986 ; Wyss and Zunke, 1986 ) have looked at similar systems to those studied in other species of cyst nematodes such as H. glycines and H. schachtii; for example the granules released in stylet exudates and the overall changes caused in plant cells and syncytia.Unusually, plant roots infected with H. goettingiana do not display excessive numbers of lateral rootlets. This nematode is capable of eliminating Rhizobium nodules from peas completely. In such cases, plants show severe nitrogen deficiency, chlorosis, dwarfing, limitation of the number of flowering nodes and early senescence ( Oostenbrink, 1955 ; Perry and Beane, 1983 ). Extra fertilizer will not stimulate plant growth after invasion by H. goettingiana ( Green and Williamson, 1978 ).In the very early years of nematology, Capus (1917) noticed that the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, which often appeared alongside H. goettingiana in the field, aggravated the damage to field crops: peas would often succumb to root rot.Nematode population densities and effects on plant yield are both variable.

Winslow (1955) found that 127 eggs/gram of soil caused complete crop failure. Various other figures have been given ( Winslow, 1955 ; Di Vito, 1978). Even in the absence of a host plant, cysts are known to remain in the soil for up to 12 years ( Brown, 1958 ), although each year, the viability of the cyst contents falls.
 Sintomas: Heterodera goettingiana becomes noticeable in infested fields when localized patches of plants become stunted and yellowed. Heavily infected pea plants are severely stunted, chlorotic and die off before the pods are full of peas. The roots of heavily infected plants are devoid of Rhizobium nodules and the root systems are smaller than those of their healthy counterparts.The yellowing patches may expand during the growing season. This is due to the slower development of symptoms in the less heavily infected plants at the edges of the patches and not to a sudden spread of the nematodes. In general, patches in fields will increase slowly in size unless the nematode is moved during cultivation operations. When peas are grown in a monocrop in an infested field the crop will eventually fail to give an economic yield.
