Executive Summary 
 
The United States has faced an ongoing and increasing threat from 
harmful invasive alien species (pests and pathogens) found in the solid 
wood packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in 
international trade.  Coping with the risks posed by these pest and disease 
organisms has become an increasingly important issue for most countries 
as international trade expands.  The dynamic nature of international trade

 in the solid 
wood packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in 
international trade.  Coping with the risks posed by these pest and disease 
organisms has become an increasingly important issue for most countries 
as international trade expands.  The dynamic nature of international trade 
and our increasing knowledge of the pest and pathogen risks associated 
with WPM make it important for the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to continue 
to review and consider additional changes to the regulations, as needed.  
The final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was prepared in August 
2003 for the present WPM regulations.  This supplement to the WPM 
FEIS refines APHIS’ previous quantitative analysis of the expected 
environmental impact associated with international compliance with 
APHIS’ current WPM regulations.       
 
The final rule for importation of WPM (September 16, 2004, 69 Federal 
Register (FR) 55719, Docket No. 02–032–3) was promulgated to provide 
APHIS with a means to lower the pest risk associated with WPM 
worldwide in a timely manner.  The rule was developed within the 
framework of international agreements to which the United States is a 
party.  Although interceptions of invasive species in WPM from China and 
Hong Kong decreased subsequent to the promulgation of the China 
Interim Rule (September 18, 1998, 63 FR 50099, Docket No. 98–087–1; 
amended December 17, 1998, 63 FR 69539, Docket No. 98–087–4),

Interim Rule (September 18, 1998, 63 FR 50099, Docket No. 98–087–1; 
amended December 17, 1998, 63 FR 69539, Docket No. 98–087–4), 
interceptions from other parts of the world continued to rise.  Serious 
environmental and economic threats posed from untreated WPM imparted 
a degree of urgency to the rulemaking process.  The mitigation strategy 
provided by the International Plant Protection Convention’s (IPPC) 
“Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International 
Trade” (International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 
(ISPM 15)) set an effective standard that was uniform and equitable to all 
nations.   
 
The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) and FEIS for WPM 
were published in October, 2002 and August, 2003, respectively.  One 
concern voiced during the comment process was over environmental risks 
associated with the usage of the fumigant, methyl bromide, as a treatment 
to mitigate pest risks.  Of particular concern was the potential of methyl 
bromide to deplete the atmosphere’s ozone layer.  Since no countries were 
yet obligated to comply with ISPM 15 guidelines at the time of 
preparation of the WPM FEIS, APHIS lacked quantitative data about 
actual worldwide usage of methyl bromide for this purpose.

iv.  Executive Summary  
Regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) 
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) 
provide that agencies may prepare supplements to a final EIS whenever 
“the agency determines that the purposes of the Act will be furthered by 
doing so.”  This supplement to the WPM FEIS focuses on preparing a 
more accurate methyl bromide estimate to ensure that the NEPA 
documentation adequately informs the decisionmaker and the public about 
the anticipated environmental impact of the WPM regulation.  Since the 
promulgation of WPM regulations by many countries to meet the ISPM 15 
guidelines, actual information is now available about how exporters in 
many countries comply with these regulations.  The specific information 
now available regarding how exporters in different countries actually 
comply with ISPM 15 is new information that is relevant to environmental 
concerns and bears upon the analysis of potential impacts of the actions 
associated with APHIS’ wood packaging rule.  Therefore, this specific 
information is used in this supplement to the WPM FEIS to refine the 
methyl bromide use estimates provided in the FEIS.  This supplementation 
will allow our analysis to more completely and accurately reflect the 
compliance that is occurring and the potential environmental impacts 
associated with that compliance.   
 
The quantitative range for the refined methyl bromide use estimate (822 to 
2,351 metric tons (MT) per year) is more narrow than the range 
determined in the WPM FEIS (384 to 4,630 MT per year), but it is 
encompassed within the range of the estimate from the WPM FEIS

The quantitative range for the refined methyl bromide use estimate (822 to 
2,351 metric tons (MT) per year) is more narrow than the range 
determined in the WPM FEIS (384 to 4,630 MT per year), but it is 
encompassed within the range of the estimate from the WPM FEIS.  
Although the refined estimates determined for this supplement more 
accurately portray the range of methyl bromide used for ISPM 15 
compliance than previous estimates, the dynamic nature of trade and 
compliance with trade-related regulations result in the ongoing need for 
review because this information reflects only the most recent information 
received.  The availability of information about compliance by exporters 
in some countries is still lacking and, for these countries, this supplement 
applies conservative assumptions designed to err in favor of 
overestimating their methyl bromide usage.  Through agreement with the 
provisions of the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer, many countries are gradually phasing out the uses of methyl 
bromide for which alternatives exist, including those uses for WPM.  
However, methyl bromide for quarantine and preshipment (QPS), as well 
as for critical uses, is expected to be needed for an extended period of 
time, such that review of the use of WPM is anticipated to continue at 
APHIS to ensure that future allotments do not exceed present projections.                          
 
Any future selection of alternatives, other than those presently enforced by 
APHIS, will depend upon changes in world trade and those international 
agreements related to world trade within which the agency must

support a comprehensive risk reduction program or a phaseout of WPM to 
substitute packaging material, but the dynamic nature of trade and 
phytosanitary regulations may influence further development of the risk-
reducing strategies involved in these alternatives.  It is conceivable that 
future phytosanitary guidelines negotiated under the IPPC could provide 
the framework for further mitigating pest or pathogen risk through 
additional limitations on packaging materials.  In the meantime, APHIS 
must continue to address the phytosanitary risks by reducing the threat of 
invasive species in a manner that promotes the harmonization of 
international regulatory efforts and the facilitation of trade.

I.  Introduction 
 
A.  Background 
 
With the continual increase of worldwide trade, there has been a concern 
for an increasing threat from harmful invasive alien species (pests and 
pathogens) detected on materials used for trade.  Specifically, these 
harmful invasive alien species have been detected on solid wood 
packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in international

 concern 
for an increasing threat from harmful invasive alien species (pests and 
pathogens) detected on materials used for trade.  Specifically, these 
harmful invasive alien species have been detected on solid wood 
packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in international 
trade.  Wooden pallets, crating, and dunnage can harbor environmentally 
and economically harmful species that use the wood as host material, feed 
upon it, or hitch a ride on it.  It is the role of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) to protect against harmful invasive alien species and to safely 
facilitate trade.  The regulations in 7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
319.40–1 through 319.40–11 contain provisions to mitigate plant pest 
risks presented by the importation of logs, lumber, or other 
unmanufactured wood articles.   
 
The regulations restrict the importation of many types of wood articles 
including wood packaging material such as pallets, crates, boxes, and 
pieces of wood used to support or brace cargo.  On September 16, 2005, a 
rule was implemented to enforce the USDA–APHIS import regulation for 
WPM (see appendix D).  The 2004 final rulemaking requires WPM, such 
as pallets, crates, and boxes, used in international trade to support or brace 
cargo, to be treated to prevent the introduction of harmful insects to U.S. 
agriculture and to natural, cultivated, and urban forest resources. 
 
WPM is often reused, recycled, or remanufactured.  The implementation 
of the final rule published on September 16, 2004, enabled companies to

cargo, to be treated to prevent the introduction of harmful insects to U.S. 
agriculture and to natural, cultivated, and urban forest resources. 
 
WPM is often reused, recycled, or remanufactured.  The implementation 
of the final rule published on September 16, 2004, enabled companies to 
use WPM that complies with ISPM 15 guidelines promulgated by the 
International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) for import and export 
purposes.  Using WPM that has been treated and marked, in accordance 
with the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 
(ISPM 15) guidelines, assures the receiving country that the WPM present 
within a shipment has been treated. 
 
B.  Historical Perspective  
 
Forest ecosystem diversity, function, and productivity have been 
dramatically altered by the introduction of exotic insects and pathogens.  
Historically, outbreaks of the Asian longhorned beetle, (Anoplophora 
glabripennis (Motschulsky)), pine shoot beetle, (Tomicus piniperda (L.)), 
and the emerald ash borer, (Agrilus planipennis (Fairmaire)) have been  
 
2  I.  Introduction   
traced to importations of WPM.  The brief history of introduction into the 
United States for Asian longhorned beetle, pine shoot beetle, and emerald 
ash borer follows below. 
 
• Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) is a native of China and was first 
found in the United States 1996 in New York City and Amityville, 
NY (on Long Island).  Since then it has been found in Chicago, 
Summit, and Addison, Illinois

ash borer follows below. 
 
• Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) is a native of China and was first 
found in the United States 1996 in New York City and Amityville, 
NY (on Long Island).  Since then it has been found in Chicago, 
Summit, and Addison, Illinois.  Scientists believe that the beetle 
entered the United States via wooden crates and pallets used in 
shipping cargo from China.  The only way to get rid of ALB is to 
cut down, chip, and burn the infested trees.  Since 1996, more than 
3,000 trees have been destroyed to eradicate this pest in New York 
and Illinois (USDA, APHIS, 2006a). 
 
• Pine shoot beetle (PSB) was discovered at a Christmas tree farm 
near Cleveland, Ohio, in July 1992.  The only previous U.S. 
infestation of PSB occurred in New Jersey in 1913.  It is believed 
that PSB was probably introduced into the United States in 1992 
by foreign ships carrying PSB-infested wood as dunnage (USDA, 
APHIS, 2002c).  Since the 1992 introduction, PSB has been 
detected in 16 States.  Quarantines have been established in those 
States to restrict the movement of regulated articles in order to 
prevent the artificial spread of PSB. 
 
• Emerald ash borer (EAB) was identified as the causative agent in 
ash tree mortality and decline in Detroit, Michigan.  EAB was 
unknown in North America until June, 2002.  Since 2002, EAB has 
established infestations in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and 
Maryland.  Qu

• Emerald ash borer (EAB) was identified as the causative agent in 
ash tree mortality and decline in Detroit, Michigan.  EAB was 
unknown in North America until June, 2002.  Since 2002, EAB has 
established infestations in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and 
Maryland.  Quarantines have been established in those States 
which have become infested with EAB.  Under the quarantine, ash 
trees, branches, logs, and firewood are prohibited from movement 
from affected counties (USDA, APHIS, 2006b).  
 
Following APHIS’ confirmation of these and other pest risks associated 
with WPM, mitigating measures, risk analyses, and environmental 
analyses were developed to assist decisionmakers about how best to 
protect U.S. forests from such pest risks.  Environmental analyses for 
those rulemakings were necessary to address the potential environmental 
impacts associated with the implementation of each rulemaking.  The 
treatment of WPM, specifically, the options of heat treatment and methyl 
bromide fumigation, were assessed to consider potential impacts to the 
human environment, including public health.  Of importance in regard to 
methyl bromide fumigations is its capacity to damage the atmosphere’s 
ozone layer.   
I.  Introduction   3  
The WPM FEIS assessed the methyl bromide treatments for WPM and the 
potential environmental impacts of such compliance.  In addition, the 
FEIS and supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) entitled 
“Importation of Logs, Lumber, and Other Unmanufactured Wood 
Articles,” (USDA, APHIS, 1998a),

 FEIS assessed the methyl bromide treatments for WPM and the 
potential environmental impacts of such compliance.  In addition, the 
FEIS and supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) entitled 
“Importation of Logs, Lumber, and Other Unmanufactured Wood 
Articles,” (USDA, APHIS, 1998a), the environmental assessment (EA) for 
the China Interim Rule (USDA, APHIS, 1998b), and the FEIS entitled, 
“Rule for the Importation of Unmanufactured Wood Articles From 
Mexico, With Consideration for Cumulative Impact of Methyl Bromide 
Use” (USDA, APHIS, 2002a), also included analysis of methyl bromide 
usage and its impact to the environment.   
 
C.  Relationship to the Rulemaking Process 
 
This supplement to the WPM FEIS provides additional information for the 
decisionmaker to determine whether the previous decision to amend the 
regulations regarding importation of WPM should remain in force as is or 
whether further changes should be promulgated through the rulemaking 
process at this time.  This determination will be published in a Record of 
Decision (ROD) in the Federal Register after completion of the final SEIS.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepared a notice of 
availability of the draft SEIS which included provisions for a public 
comment period from March 9 to April 23, 2007 (March 9, 2007, 72 FR 
10749, Docket No. ER–FRL–6684–7).  Interested parties requested that 
APHIS extend the comment period to provide additional time for technical 
review, and APHIS granted an extension of the comment period until June 
25, 2007 (

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment period from March 9 to April 23, 2007 (March 9, 2007, 72 FR 
10749, Docket No. ER–FRL–6684–7).  Interested parties requested that 
APHIS extend the comment period to provide additional time for technical 
review, and APHIS granted an extension of the comment period until June 
25, 2007 (May 25, 2007, 72 FR 29294, Docket No. APHIS–2006–0152).  
APHIS received a total of four public comments on the draft SEIS.  Those 
comments are presented and the substantive issues from those comments 
are addressed in appendix A.  Any substantive comments on the final 
SEIS received by APHIS up to 30 days after publication by EPA of the 
notice of availability in the Federal Register will be considered before 
publication of the ROD (40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2)).  
 
Although there have been treatments for wood pests for many years, there 
was no programmatic effort to mitigate the associated pest risks of WPM 
until the China Interim Rule in 1998.  This rule consisted of two separate 
notices (September 18, 1998, 63 FR 50099, Docket No. 98–087–1 and an 
amendment on December 17, 1998, 63 FR 69539, Docket No. 98–087–4).  
The rule was promulgated to readily respond to the rapidly increasing pest 
risks to wood traced to importations of WPM from China and Hong Kong.  
The interim rule provided very little phase-in time due to the serious 
nature of the pest risks and the immediate need for mitigation of those 
risks.  The EA for the China Interim Rule (USDA, APHIS, 1998b)

 the rapidly increasing pest 
risks to wood traced to importations of WPM from China and Hong Kong.  
The interim rule provided very little phase-in time due to the serious 
nature of the pest risks and the immediate need for mitigation of those 
risks.  The EA for the China Interim Rule (USDA, APHIS, 1998b) was 
published in September, 1998.  The lack of a phase-in period was 
recognized in this EA prepared for the rule by applying the presumption 
that all imported WPM from China and Hong Kong would be fumigated

after loading.  Although this approach for estimation of methyl bromide 
usage was known to be conservatively high, initially it was not considered 
to be outside the possible range of application.  It was recognized that 
some heat treatment and more conservative usage of methyl bromide 
(treatment of WPM before loading) were anticipated in, at least, the long-
term, but the lack of historical data about actual compliance prevented 
calculation of a refined estimate of methyl bromide usage in the treatment 
of WPM to be imported from China and Hong Kong to the United States.    
 
Although the interceptions of invasive species in WPM from China and 
Hong Kong decreased subsequent to promulgation of the China Interim 
Rule, interceptions on WPM from other parts of the world continued to 
rise.  It was clear that the pest risk from these locations would also need to 
be mitigated.  Concurrent with APHIS’ deliberations on potential

 and 
Hong Kong decreased subsequent to promulgation of the China Interim 
Rule, interceptions on WPM from other parts of the world continued to 
rise.  It was clear that the pest risk from these locations would also need to 
be mitigated.  Concurrent with APHIS’ deliberations on potential 
regulatory options to address the pest risk from WPM from other 
countries, the international community, through the IPPC, became aware 
of the pests associated with WPM and began to consider comparable 
approaches to alleviate pest risks associated with international trade.  This 
international effort to address pest risks ultimately resulted in the 
guidelines negotiated for regulating WPM in international trade that were 
published by the IPPC Secretariat (2002) in ISPM 15.  The international 
negotiations and revisions of these guidelines are expected to continue.   
 
APHIS recognized that the ISPM 15 guidelines provided a firm basis for 
amendments to our regulations and, consequently, APHIS promulgated a 
final rule that established regulations for importation of WPM that were 
consistent with those guidelines negotiated in ISPM 15.  APHIS’ final rule 
on Importation of Wood Packaging Material was published on September 
16, 2004 (69 FR 55719, Docket No. 02–032–3), and was designed to 
provide mitigations for the potential pest risks from importation of WPM 
worldwide (see appendix D).  The regulations established by this final rule 
replaced those regulations promulgated under the China Interim Rule.   
 
Unlike the regulations imposed by the China Interim Rule, those countries 
whose WPM was subject to importation requirements under the final 
WPM rule were aware of the pending change in regulations and

worldwide (see appendix D).  The regulations established by this final rule 
replaced those regulations promulgated under the China Interim Rule.   
 
Unlike the regulations imposed by the China Interim Rule, those countries 
whose WPM was subject to importation requirements under the final 
WPM rule were aware of the pending change in regulations and were 
provided a phase-in period for compliance with those changes.  This 
phase-in period ensured that importers had time to prepare for the 
regulatory treatments of WPM.  Concurrent to this phase-in period, there 
were decreases in methyl bromide (phaseout) for many usages that were 
regulated under the Montreal Protocol.  Although quarantine treatments 
(including those for WPM) were not directly subject to phaseout under  
this international agreement, many countries began to work on alternate 
treatments for fumigation with methyl bromide (such as heat treatment of 
WPM) and some were permitting only heat treatment for WPM.  Although 
there were many factors that contributed to the estimates of methyl

bromide usage in the FEIS, the presumption that methyl bromide 
treatments of WPM would always be applied after the WPM was loaded 
with cargo did not realistically reflect actual usage.  The estimates of  
methyl bromide usage for alternatives presented in the FEIS for 
Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material (USDA, APHIS, 2003)  
sought to make allowance for methods, such as heat treatment and 
fumigation of methyl bromide, prior to loading with cargo.  The 
characterization of compliance was, however, incomplete in that most

characterization of compliance was, however, incomplete in that most 
countries, at that time, had not yet established their requirements for 
compliance with regulations of transported WPM.  Much of this 
supplement to the FEIS examines how countries have actually complied 
with WPM regulations since and, based on that examination, seeks to 
refine APHIS’ early estimates of methyl bromide usage to more accurately 
reflect actual release from fumigation treatments of WPM. 
 
The overall worldwide usage of methyl bromide continues to decline as 
the phaseout requirements of the Montreal Protocol are met by those 
countries that are signatories to this international agreement.  The 
worldwide consumption of methyl bromide was 63,960 MT in 1996 
compared to 36,866 MT in 2005 (United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP), (Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee 
(MBTOC), 2007).  This 42 percent reduction in usage of methyl bromide 
relates almost exclusively to compliance with the phaseout requirements 
of the Montreal Protocol.  It is known that some countries (most notably 
China) have increased their overall usage of methyl bromide, but those 
increases by individual countries have not changed the overall worldwide 
trend towards reduction in usage of methyl bromide.  Even China has 
committed to reduce emissions of methyl bromide from fumigations 
(UNEP, 2003; Beijing Times, 2003; Mercado, 1999).  The impetus for

 of methyl bromide, but those 
increases by individual countries have not changed the overall worldwide 
trend towards reduction in usage of methyl bromide.  Even China has 
committed to reduce emissions of methyl bromide from fumigations 
(UNEP, 2003; Beijing Times, 2003; Mercado, 1999).  The impetus for 
permitting fumigation of WPM with methyl bromide in the final WPM 
rule was to provide an economical means of compliance for those 
developing countries with limited resources to ensure their ability to 
export products loaded on WPM to the United States.  This approach also 
ensured that other countries would accept product shipments from the 
United States that meet the ISPM 15 guidelines.   
 
In accordance with applicable international agreements, APHIS does 
consider changes in its regulations governing phytosanitary issues in trade 
if those measures are transparent, technically justified, and no more 
restrictive of trade than necessary to achieve an appropriate level of 
phytosanitary protection.  This ensures that any changes in our regulations 
adhere to principles of the IPPC.  Should it become evident that the usage  
of methyl bromide fumigation in the treatment of WPM is no longer 
needed by developing countries in order to meet phytosanitary 
requirements (due to increased availability of substitute packaging 
materials and other treatment measures in all affected countries), and that

6  I.  Introduction   
the elimination of methyl bromide fumigation is “not more trade 
restrictive than required to achieve [an] appropriate level of sanitary or 
phytosanitary protection,” as is specified by provisions of the agreement 
on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS 
agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), then APHIS will 
consider further rulemaking for WPM.  Presently, the usage of heat 
treatment of WPM is the only equivalent to fumigation with methyl 
bromide for shippers who depend upon WPM.  The continuing phaseout 
of methyl bromide favors expanded usage of heat treatment of WPM.  It is 
also possible, over time, that market forces may favor expanded use of 
substitute packaging materials such that methyl bromide fumigation of 
WPM may not be needed to ensure the unrestricted flow of trade.  
However, present trade heavily depends upon WPM, and fumigation with 
methyl bromide remains important enough for the shipping industry of 
some countries that circumstances do not justify immediate elimination of 
this treatment measure.  Therefore, APHIS will continue to monitor and 
review trade conditions to determine if there is any need for further 
rulemaking.

IS will continue to monitor and 
review trade conditions to determine if there is any need for further 
rulemaking.    
 
International guidelines, such as ISPM 15, are subject to ongoing review 
and negotiation among the contracting parties to the IPPC.  Changes to 
those guidelines do not necessarily require APHIS to promulgate rule 
changes, but any changes in phytosanitary requirements that APHIS 
intends to enforce on the shipping industry would require revisions to the 
present regulations.  Various negotiations to amend certain aspects of the 
ISPM 15 guidelines are in the process of review by IPPC contracting 
parties.  APHIS monitors these negotiations for potential substantive 
changes that could result in the need for further rulemaking.  Changes to 
the IPPC guidelines could also require environmental documentation to 
address the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) issues 
associated with those anticipated rule changes.  In particular, there has 
been some concern by IPPC contracting parties that the initial methyl 
bromide treatment schedule for WPM did not achieve the desired 
reduction in pest risk.  Any changes in application rate would certainly 
require supplemental environmental documentation.  Other potential 
treatment changes would need to be reviewed to determine whether they 
would result in any changes in environmental effects.   
 
Since the initial methyl bromide fumigation treatment schedule of Annex I 
of ISPM 15 (IPPC, 2006), there has been one revision approved by the 
IPPC (FAO, 2006).  This revision does not propose any changes in the  
dosage for specific temperatures; however, the proposed minimum 
concentrations of methyl bromide within the fumigation enclosure need to 
remain elevated for longer durations of time.  The

dosage for specific temperatures; however, the proposed minimum 
concentrations of methyl bromide within the fumigation enclosure need to

dosage or rate indicates that methyl bromide usage would not increase.  
The revised treatment schedules are designed to eliminate pest risk

without the need for additional usage of methyl bromide.  More recently, 
APHIS proposed an interim rule to amend the wood packaging regulations 
to reflect the revisions to the treatment schedule (June 1, 2007, 72 FR 
30460, Docket No. APHIS–2006–0129).  Recent review of this change in 
the treatment schedule indicates that retention of methyl bromide for these 
longer durations of time can be achieved with adherence to best practices; 
however, anecdotal evidence suggests that some fumigators are increasing 
the initial charge of methyl bromide to compensate for potential leakage to 
ensure adequate concentrations without the need to retreat or top up 
concentrations during the fumigation (page 291 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  Although the revised schedule does not require more usage and 
any adjustments to our methyl bromide usage estimates, APHIS will 
continue to keep track of such revisions to ISPM 15 and review the 
potential environmental impacts.

D.  Summary of the Final Environmental Impact 
Statement 
 
The WPM FEIS (USDA, APHIS, 2003) was prepared in order to consider 
the potential environmental impacts of the proposal and alternatives, in 
accordance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality’s 
(CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the 
NEPA.  The findings of that document are incorporated by reference in 
this SEIS and are summarized below.  Alternatives considered within the 
FEIS included (1) no action (no change in the current regulation),  
(2) extend the treatments in the China Interim Rule to all countries,  
(3) adoption of the IPPC “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging 
Material in International Trade” (the proposed alternative), (4) a 
comprehensive risk reduction program, and (5) substitute packaging 
materials only.  Each alternative contains an array of component control 
methods. 
 
Although each alternative (excluding no action) was determined to have 
the potential to lower pest risk associated with WPM, each alternative 
(including no action) has the potential for adverse environmental 
consequences.  Under NEPA, those consequences are the aggregate of 
their individual effectivenesses (efficacies) and the direct and indirect 
impacts (including cumulative impacts) of their component control 
methods.  The no action alternative would result in the greatest degree of 
risk from invasive species, with impacts from component control methods 
that would be expected to increase as international trade

  Under NEPA, those consequences are the aggregate of

impacts (including cumulative impacts) of their component control 
methods.  The no action alternative would result in the greatest degree of 
risk from invasive species, with impacts from component control methods 
that would be expected to increase as international trade increases.   
 
Extension of the treatments, in the China Interim Rule, to all countries 
would substantially reduce the pest risk from invasive species, but would 
have the greatest potential for adverse environmental impact from its 
component control methods.  Adoption of the IPPC guidelines also would 
 
8  I.  Introduction   
provide substantial reduction of pest risk, with substantial environmental 
impact from its component control methods.   
 
A comprehensive risk reduction program could provide substantial 
reduction of pest risk, with variable impact from its component control 
methods, depending upon which methods were selected.  It is not feasible 
to design different combinations of methods for compliance of various 
countries, at present.  Further, based upon the prevalence of pests within 
those countries, a determinative process to support such a practice would 
not be scientifically or economically practical.  For the comprehensive risk 
reduction program alternative to be practical and worthy of detailed 
consideration by APHIS, the array of approved treatments for this 
alternative would have to be universally applicable and available equally 
to all countries.   
 
Substitute packing materials only (prohibition of WPM), as suggested in 
the FEIS, would achieve the greatest reduction of pest risk with the least 
environmental impact from its component control methods, but would 
generate some impacts from the manufacturing process.  The capability of

 to be universally applicable and available equally 
to all countries.   
 
Substitute packing materials only (prohibition of WPM), as suggested in 
the FEIS, would achieve the greatest reduction of pest risk with the least 
environmental impact from its component control methods, but would 
generate some impacts from the manufacturing process.  The capability of 
industry to tool up to manufacture and switch to substitute packaging 
materials for such large shipping volumes would limit the feasibility or 
implementation of a switch over.  At present, the increased cost of 
substitute packaging materials relative to WPM and limited application of 
substitute packaging materials to niche markets do not provide the 
flexibility needed to fulfill the global trade needs. 
 
The potentially affected environment for the proposed action, as discussed 
in the FEIS, includes the United States (confronted with threats to its 
agricultural and environmental ecosystems), the other nations (which 
would sustain environmental impacts because of measures required by 
U.S. import requirements), and the Global Commons (which also could 
sustain environmental impacts because of measures required by U.S. 
import requirements).  Of particular concern is the potential effect of 
increased use of the fumigant methyl bromide, a chemical that has the 
capacity to damage the atmosphere’s ozone layer.  The stratospheric ozone 
layer shields life on our planet from the harmful effects of ultraviolet 
radiation.  The potential impact from increased usage of methyl bromide is  
mitigated by the availability of other treatments for WPM, the availability 
of other packaging materials, and the phaseout of many uses of ozone-
depleting chemicals (including methyl bromide other than those critical 
uses and quarantine and preship

 the harmful effects of ultraviolet 
radiation.  The potential impact from increased usage of methyl bromide is  
mitigated by the availability of other treatments for WPM, the availability 
of other packaging materials, and the phaseout of many uses of ozone-
depleting chemicals (including methyl bromide other than those critical 
uses and quarantine and preshipment (QPS) uses that are presently 
exempted).   
 
The rationale to adopt the IPPC guidelines, rather than selecting one of the 
other alternatives, involved a number of factors.  First, the serious 
environmental and economic threats imparted a degree of urgency to the 
I.  Introduction   9  
WPM rulemaking process.  Although APHIS continues to work on a long-
term resolution to the pest-risk problems associated with WPM, the 
agency needed an effective mitigation strategy capable of being 
implemented over the short term.  Data were available to support the 
effectiveness of the treatments approved under the IPPC guidelines against 
many pests of concern to APHIS; however, efficacy data for other 
treatment options were lacking.  There were substantial logistical and 
operational barriers associated with some of the alternatives, even though 
they may pose less environmental impact.   
 
APHIS remains committed to developing regulations that reduce the threat 
of invasive species yet which promote the harmonization of international 
mitigation efforts and the facilitation of trade.  The development of new 
regulations, therefore, depends upon technological progress and 
international negotiations to provide an efficient mechanism for 
addressing phytosanitary risks associated with WPM.  Thus, the FEIS 
considered environmental, economic, scientific, and social factors in an

 efforts and the facilitation of trade.  The development of new 
regulations, therefore, depends upon technological progress and 
international negotiations to provide an efficient mechanism for 
addressing phytosanitary risks associated with WPM.  Thus, the FEIS 
considered environmental, economic, scientific, and social factors in an 
effort to derive an appropriate and effective strategy for the regulation of 
imported WPM.

II.  Purpose and Need 
 
The purpose of this SEIS is to reevaluate and refine estimates of methyl 
bromide usage in the treatment of WPM.  This document is consistent 
with APHIS’ intent to further review WPM issues as more data and 
information are now available.  At the time that the methyl bromide 
estimates in the WPM FEIS were prepared, there was uncertainty due to 
the limited information available about compliance (see FEIS on pages  
A–7 to A–9).  Regulations promulgated by CEQ pursuant to NEPA 
provide that agencies may prepare supplements to a final EIS whenever 
“the agency determines that the purposes of the Act will be furthered by 
doing so.”  This SEIS has been prepared to refine the information 
provided in the FEIS in light of new information available and intended to

information will impact the current rule.  The refined information may 
have any number of impacts to the current WPM rule including further 
deliberation, amendments to the current rule, or no changes to the current 
rule.

The focus of this SEIS is the refinement of methyl bromide estimates from 
compliance with APHIS’ WPM regulations.  The limited available data 
provided a rough predictive estimate in the FEIS.  More reliable 
information and more data on actual compliance have since been sought to 
improve the previous estimates to more accurately reflect actual methyl 
bromide usage in the treatment of WPM.  Although information continues 
to be collected about the treatment methods used by different countries to 
comply with ISPM 15, some data gaps continue to exist and some 
uncertainty remains.  Quality information does exist for the compliance 
treatments in some countries, but reporting in other countries is often

  Although information continues 
to be collected about the treatment methods used by different countries to 
comply with ISPM 15, some data gaps continue to exist and some 
uncertainty remains.  Quality information does exist for the compliance 
treatments in some countries, but reporting in other countries is often 
limited, lacking, or compiled for overall consumption purposes (not solely 
for WPM treatment).  There are a number of different ways that one can 
quantitatively calculate the release of methyl bromide to the atmosphere 
from compliance with ISPM 15.  These calculations can continue to be 
refined as more accurate and more complete information is received. 
 
Reporting of overall methyl bromide usage by many countries is sparse.  
The annual reporting requirements of the UNEP Secretariat for methyl 
bromide have increased the overall reporting and those requirements 
include a follow-up for data quality assurance.  Such reporting was 
reviewed for relative consistency with our findings.  All international 
reporting requirements relate to total methyl bromide production or 
consumption including both usage for QPS and usage for non-QPS 
purposes.  There has been no formal reporting mechanism established for 
specific QPS applications, such as treatment of WPM, until recently. 
Reporting of the QPS production of methyl bromide in 2004 amounted to 
10,660 MT (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The amount used for 
QPS treatment of wooden packing materials was determined to account 
for 6.4 percent of the overall QPS usage or 679 MT.  Data were, however, 
not received for 16 of the 70 parties reporting non-zero consumption of 
QPS methyl bromide.  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS

QPS treatment of wooden packing materials was determined to account 
for 6.4 percent of the overall QPS usage or 679 MT.  Data were, however, 
not received for 16 of the 70 parties reporting non-zero consumption of 
QPS methyl bromide.  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS 
purposes rose from 10,660 MT in 2004 to 13,815 MT in 2005, with the 
3,155 MT increase attributed by UNEP largely to implementation of ISPM 
15 for treatment of WPM (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  Other than usage by 
China to comply with the China Interim Rule, there was virtually no usage 
for WPM prior to 2005 when most countries promulgated WPM 
regulations; therefore, this 3,155 MT would largely be attributed to 
countries other than China and Hong Kong.  However, the QPS reporting 
to UNEP for allowances in 2005 included some changes in the use 
designations from 2004.  For example, some methyl bromide treatment 
uses classified as critical use exemptions in the United States in 2004 were 
reclassified in 2005 as QPS based upon export preshipment requirements 
(EPA, OPP, 2005).  The result of this reporting change was that 1,209 MT 
of the methyl bromide used in the United States in 2005 classified as QPS

would have been classified as critical use exemptions in 2004 and prior 
years.  This 1,209 MT increase in QPS reporting by the United States in 
2005 for articles other than WPM accounts for over one-third of the total 
increase in QPS cited by UNEP (3,155 MT).  Such inconsistencies in 
reporting make

would have been classified as critical use exemptions in 2004 and prior 
years.  This 1,209 MT increase in QPS reporting by the United States in 
2005 for articles other than WPM accounts for over one-third of the total 
increase in QPS cited by UNEP (3,155 MT).  Such inconsistencies in 
reporting make any cause-effect relationship for numerical changes 
between individual years tenuous, at best.  The meaning and importance of 
this rough cumulative data is discussed further in this chapter in relation to 
the refined estimates with the recognition that the total methyl bromide 
attributed to WPM worldwide (3,155 MT and 679 MT = 3,834 MT) in 
2005 (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) may not accurately reflect actual usage for 
this purpose due to reporting inconsistencies that exist.        
 
An attempt was made in this SEIS to gather the best available information 
for the majority of WPM treatments.  This involved requesting compliance 
information for those countries that are most heavily involved in world 
trade.  For those countries with reliable compliance data, quantitative  
analysis was the most direct.  For those countries lacking compliance data, 
methyl bromide estimates were based upon projections of the highest 
likely usage.  For many of the larger trading countries, compliance data 
was available in a form that permitted accurate estimations.  Most of these 
countries provided a percentage of the number of units of WPM that were 
fumigated.  The annual estimates in this SEIS assess only a given year in 
time.  Trying to account for future increases in world trade and other 
external factors without clear market trends would be speculative, and no

time.  Trying to account for future increases in world trade and other 
external factors without clear market trends would be speculative, and no 
attempt has been made to factor this into this analysis.  In addition, there 
are a wide range of chamber and tarpaulin enclosures that are used in 
methyl bromide fumigations.  Limited data are available about the relative 
frequency of use of each type of fumigation enclosure; therefore, 
representative fumigation methods were applied to each treatment scenario 
based upon the compliance data provided by the National Plant Protection 
Organization (NPPOs) contacted in each country.   
 
Cumulative methyl bromide usage data includes those WPM treatments 
associated with ISPM 15 compliance by the United States and other WPM 
treatments in world trade not directly related to APHIS’ WPM rule.  This 
includes those countries already subject to compliance treatments under 
the China Interim Rule.  This issue is addressed separately from other 
methyl bromide usage for QPS and non-QPS purposes.  
 
A.  Early Methyl Bromide Estimates for Wood and the 
China Interim Rule 
 
Estimates of the quantities of methyl bromide released from fumigation of 
wood products were first made for the EIS entitled Importation of Logs, 
Lumber, and Other Unmanufactured Wood Articles (USDA, APHIS, 
1998a).  The methods developed for that EIS were adjusted for use in

Lumber, and Other Unmanufactured Wood Articles (USDA, APHIS, 
1998a).  The methods developed for that EIS were adjusted for use in 
III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  15  
estimation of methyl bromide usage in the EA for China Interim Rule.  A 
large part of the quantitative analysis in the China Interim Rule EA 
(USDA, APHIS, 1998b) was tied to the presumption that the lack of 
phase-in time for Chinese exporters to prepare for compliance with the 
rule would result in most, if not all, WPM being fumigated with methyl 
bromide and all fumigations being conducted to WPM that was already 
loaded with cargo.  The capability of shippers to apply heat treatment, 
wood preservative treatments, or to treat WPM by fumigation with methyl 
bromide prior to cargo loading on such short notice was unknown.  Thus, 
the quantitative estimate for methyl bromide used in fumigation resulting 
from this rule was an intentionally high projection that presumed only 
fumigation of already loaded WPM.   
 
Although it was recognized that the shipping industry in China would 
gradually use other available methods, the rough estimate for methyl 
bromide usage calculated for the China Interim Rule was considered 
appropriate as an initial estimate with the recognition that the projected 
usage per unit of WPM would diminish as the industry compliance 
strategies developed.  Those early estimates disregarded issues such as 
treatment availability, reuse of WPM, lack of tolerances for methyl 
bromide of some agricultural commodities, lack

 usage calculated for the China Interim Rule was considered 
appropriate as an initial estimate with the recognition that the projected 
usage per unit of WPM would diminish as the industry compliance 
strategies developed.  Those early estimates disregarded issues such as 
treatment availability, reuse of WPM, lack of tolerances for methyl 
bromide of some agricultural commodities, lack of compatibility of some 
commodities (e.g., leather goods and electronic parts) with methyl 
bromide, and unique fumigation practices; the estimates also did not 
consider the rapidly increasing trade with China in any projections.  The 
result was an estimate that was higher than initial actual usage by China, 
but not necessarily unreasonable given the increasing trade (eightfold 
increase from 1997 to 2005) that has occurred since that time.  The 
potential quantity of methyl bromide determined in the EA for the China 
Interim Rule was estimated to range from 1,040 to 12,565 MT annually.  
However, the total methyl bromide produced in China in 2002 for all uses, 
including not only use on WPM but all QPS and non-QPS usage, 
amounted only to 3,175 MT (BeijingTimes, 2003; UNEP, 2003) therefore, 
the upper tail of this early estimate is clearly higher than the actual 
consumption that occurred in China.    
 
Another assumption in the EA was that the fumigations would occur 
primarily within containers covered by tarps, as is normally done for 
treatments of loaded cargo, to comply with APHIS regulations.  However, 
rather than tarping containers, many of those Chinese shippers who were 
fumigating containers with already loaded cargo were generally testing 
those containers for air

 that the fumigations would occur 
primarily within containers covered by tarps, as is normally done for 
treatments of loaded cargo, to comply with APHIS regulations.  However, 
rather than tarping containers, many of those Chinese shippers who were 
fumigating containers with already loaded cargo were generally testing 
those containers for airtightness, releasing methyl bromide directly into 
the closed containers, and often sealing those containers for shipment prior 
to complete aeration.  There were some initial human health concerns 
expressed by inspectors and workers about the lingering residues of 
methyl bromide in these containers from this practice.  The aeration of 
such containers has increased since that time to ensure the safety of those  
 
16  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
working with such containers.  This direct treatment of sealed containers 
did result in less use of methyl bromide than had been projected for 
fumigation of containers covered by tarps.  
 
The actual application rates analyzed for the China Interim Rule were 
based upon those in the APHIS treatment manual (USDA, APHIS, 1998d) 
at that time.  The application rates ranged from 3 to 5 pounds per 
1,000 cubic feet of space for a 16-hour period of time.  Subsequent  
analyses were based upon the application rates cited in ISPM 15, that is, 
3 to 4 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a 16-hour period of time.  
Although this usage rate of 5 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet contributed to a 
conservatively high methyl bromide estimate in the analysis of the EA for 
the China Interim Rule, the changes in trade and compliance by China and 
Hong

, 
3 to 4 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a 16-hour period of time.  
Although this usage rate of 5 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet contributed to a 
conservatively high methyl bromide estimate in the analysis of the EA for 
the China Interim Rule, the changes in trade and compliance by China and 
Hong Kong since that time are encompassed within that initial projected 
methyl bromide estimate.  
 
B.  Application of Early Estimates to Assess 
Cumulative Impacts 
 
Shortly after completion of the EA for the China Interim Rule, a draft EA 
was completed for the Proposed Rule for the Importation of Wood 
Articles from Mexico (USDA, APHIS, 1998c).  EPA, in its comments on 
this document, suggested the agency analyze potential cumulative impacts 
of methyl bromide for the quarantine uses required by APHIS.  This 
cumulative issue was then addressed through the preparation of an FEIS 
entitled “Rule for the Importation of Unmanufactured Wood Articles 
From Mexico, With Consideration for Cumulative Impact of Methyl 
Bromide Use” (USDA, APHIS, 2002a).  Most anticipated pending 
quarantine uses of methyl bromide, when added to the present usage, were 
considered to pose negligible cumulative risk; however, the pending 
worldwide regulation of WPM was considered to require closer review.

 WPM was considered to require closer review.  
This FEIS applied the conservative, quantitative methodology used in the 
China Interim Rule EA to project methyl bromide estimates for a global 
wood packaging rule that was first being analyzed in the DEIS for the 
importation of unmanufactured wood articles from Mexico.  The 
quantitative methyl bromide estimate using that methodology gave a 
potential range of 8,536 to 102,893 MT per year; however, the same 
paragraph discussed the conservative nature of this estimate and indicated 
that the actual increase of methyl bromide usage would be closer to one-
twentieth of those projected quantities.  This was the first recognition of 
the need to refine WPM methyl bromide estimates for methyl bromide 
usage to provide more realistic data for pending agency decisions.   
 
The Mexican Unmanufactured Wood DEIS also acknowledged the limited 
information about compliance with WPM treatment.  The DEIS 
recognized that fumigations are generally directed at the pest risks in the

cargo being treated and there was no particular reason for treating cargo 
when the target organism was in the WPM.  However, the lack of 
available compliance data for WPM treatments made it difficult to project 
actual methyl bromide usage, and the decision was made to consider this 
issue more closely in the EIS for importation of WPM that was being 
worked on during and after completion of this Mexican Unmanufactured 
Wood EIS.

C.  Estimates From the Final Environmental Impact 
Statement 
 
The methyl bromide estimates prepared for the draft and final EIS for 
Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material (USDA, APHIS, 2002b; 
USDA, APHIS, 2003) involved a systematic review of potential usage to  
provide more realistic data for program decisions.  The limited data 
available did not provide a clear methodology that could be readily 
applied to worldwide compliance with WPM regulations.  The analysis 
did consider the influence of certain factors on likely compliance.  The 
factors included— 
  
• the size of a U.S. Customs entry,  
• the presence of WPM within a U.S. Customs entry,  
• the likely method of treatment (methyl bromide fumigation vs. heat 
treatment),  
• the manner of methyl bromide application,  
• the application rate, the amount of methyl bromide vented from the 
treatment stack by fumigation,  
• the compatibility of methyl bromide with associated cargo,  
• logistics and cost factors for shippers from other countries,  
• the potential reuse of treated WPM, and  
• implications of compliance method on international agreements.

D.  Refined Methyl Bromide Estimation Based Upon 
Compliance Data 
 
We now have information about the manner in which many IPPC 
contracting parties actually comply with ISPM 15 and APHIS’ WPM rule; 
therefore, previous model assumptions are refined in this analysis to more 
accurately and completely assess potential methyl bromide release from 
compliance with the rule.  This analysis reflects information regarding 
compliance for calendar year 2005 which includes more than twice as 
many U.S. Customs entries as in the previous analysis (based on 1997 
data) due to recent increases in world trade.  This increase in world trade 
would normally be expected to result in, at least, a doubling in the 
estimated usage of methyl bromide to comply with ISPM 15 if compliance 
 
18  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
were consistent with earlier methyl bromide usage model assumptions.  
However, the information about actual compliance indicates greater usage 
of heat treatment than methyl bromide fumigation by most major trading 
countries.  In addition, regular treatment of WPM after cargo loading, 
which requires more extensive methyl bromide usage, has been verified to 
occur only for some U.S. Customs entries originating in China (USDA, 
APHIS, 1999).   
 
Treatment of WPM after cargo loading involves fumigation of up to 
20-fold more space than for treatment of WPM before cargo loading, thus, 
the usage of methyl bromide is commensurately greater for fumigations of 
WPM after cargo loading.  Although such methyl bromide fumigation of 
loaded cargo from China does increase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of WPM after cargo loading involves fumigation of up to 
20-fold more space than for treatment of WPM before cargo loading, thus, 
the usage of methyl bromide is commensurately greater for fumigations of 
WPM after cargo loading.  Although such methyl bromide fumigation of 
loaded cargo from China does increase the overall release of methyl 
bromide and associated concerns about potential impacts to stratospheric 
ozone, this usage is considerably less than the worldwide reductions of 
methyl bromide already made in compliance with the phaseout of methyl 
bromide required under the Montreal Protocol, and the impact of this 
WPM treatment with methyl bromide on ozone depletion is dwarfed by 
the effects of chlorofluorocarbons and other compounds with ozone-
depleting potentials that exceed methyl bromide.  QPS treatment of wood 
packaging materials in 2004 was determined to account for 6.4 percent of 
the overall QPS usage or 679 MT (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  
Reported increased production of methyl bromide for QPS purposes 
totaled 3,155 MT more in 2005, much of which was associated with 
worldwide ISPM 15 compliance (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The 
association of this increase with WPM was discussed earlier in this SEIS 
and is tenuous due to reporting inconsistencies (see pages 12 to 13).  
When one compares this roughly 3,834 MT usage increase to the reported 
27,094 MT reduction in methyl bromide consumption from 1996 to 2005 
(page 35 UNEP, MBTOC, 2007), it is clear that the WPM usage amounts 
are considerably less use than

 is tenuous due to reporting inconsistencies (see pages 12 to 13).  
When one compares this roughly 3,834 MT usage increase to the reported 
27,094 MT reduction in methyl bromide consumption from 1996 to 2005 
(page 35 UNEP, MBTOC, 2007), it is clear that the WPM usage amounts 
are considerably less use than the amounts being phased out.  As the 
phaseout provisions of the Montreal Protocol are met and the degradation 
of chlorofluorocarbons with long half-lives progresses, stratospheric ozone 
recovery will occur.   
 
Ongoing review in the 2006 Scientific Assessment (NOAA et al., 2007) 
indicates that the Montreal Protocol is working and there are some early 
signs of stratospheric ozone recovery (page xxxv, Executive Summary in 
NOAA et al., 2007).  The projected date for stratospheric ozone recovery 
to return to the 1980 baseline selected by UNEP as its milestone is 2065 if 
current trends continue (page xxxv of the Executive Summary).  This 
assessment further indicates that a number of potential regulatory options 
are available to accelerate the recovery of the ozone layer by phasing out 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) production and consumption.  The 
associated reduction in stratospheric ozone depletion relative to the full 
recovery of the 1980 baseline projected for phaseout of all methyl bromide

2007) amounts to only 5 percent (NOAA et al., 2007).  This topic is 
discussed in more detail later in this chapter in regard to the refined 
methyl bromide estimates in this SEIS; however, the potential impact on 
stratospheric ozone from anthropogenic usage of methyl bromide does 
justify continuing agency efforts to seek more economical and efficacious 
alternatives to methyl bromide for phytosanitary treatment purposes, 
including those related to packaging material regulations. 
 
The refinements to the methyl bromide calculations in this supplement 
include a closer analysis of the manner in which individual countries 
actually comply with wood packaging regulations.  This involves more 
comprehensive analyses of information on— 
  
• how exporters in individual countries select their method of treatment 
(methyl bromide fumigation vs. heat treatment),  
• the manner of methyl bromide application,  
• the amount of methyl bromide vented from the fumigation,  
• the potential reuse of treated WPM, and  
• any implications of compliance method on international agreements.   
 
Each of these issues influence the amount of methyl bromide fumigation 
of WPM used in compliance with ISPM 15 and are used in the SEIS to 
refine the methyl bromide estimates to the extent possible.  Mathematical 
equations, representative calculations, and descriptions of ISPM 15 
compliance by country are described in detail in appendix E.

refine the methyl bromide estimates to the extent possible.  Mathematical 
equations, representative calculations, and descriptions of ISPM 15 
compliance by country are described in detail in appendix E.           
 
Most calculations used to determine the estimates of methyl bromide 
usage resulting from compliance with APHIS’ WPM regulations in this 
SEIS rely upon U.S. Customs data related to import entries.  None of the 
NPPOs in the various countries provided any data about the actual 
quantity of WPM relative to other packaging materials for their exports; 
therefore, the previous estimate (30 percent) used to determine the number 
of U.S Customs entries with WPM in the FEIS was applied to the present 
calculations when information about actual numbers of treated units or the 
total amount of methyl bromide were unavailable.  There is some 
variability in the types of packaging material used worldwide; however, 
the earlier review of U.S. Customs entries investigated the packaging 
materials over a broad range of commodity import groups to ensure that 
the percentage accurately reflected the proportion of U.S. Customs import 
entries that use WPM. 
 
The descriptions of treatment methods used by exporters in a given 
country were determined primarily from the information provided by the  
NPPOs of various countries about how they comply with ISPM 15.  The 
effort to seek compliance data focused on those countries with larger trade

to the United States; however, information was sought for all major 
trading markets.  The questions posed to these authorities were designed to 
ascertain the amount of methyl bromide fumigation in compliance with 
ISPM 15.  Information was sought from the responding authorities 
regarding their usage of methyl bromide relative to their usage of heat 
treatment for compliance with ISPM 15, the manner in which such 
treatments are conducted, total methyl bromide usage where available, and  
any information about the quantity of WPM relative to other packaging 
materials.  The NPPOs contacted by APHIS responded as part of their 
ongoing cooperation with APHIS to facilitate common trade interests.  
Previous information about phytosanitary trade issues from these sources 
has been reliable.  Although some NPPOs were unable to provide detailed 
information for their respective country, the responses were sufficient for 
a thorough refinement of the earlier methyl bromide estimates.     
 
Certain countries have specific requirements that limit their exporters to 
heat treatment or substitute packaging materials.  This includes a number 
of countries in the European Union and closely associated countries.  The 
European Union has indicated their intent to eliminate all methyl bromide 
fumigation where other alternatives or substitutes are available and 
acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health (Regulation of 
the European Parliament and Council, 2000).  Some other countries treat 
WPM for export solely by heat treatment, most notably Thailand

European Union has indicated their intent to eliminate all methyl bromide 
fumigation where other alternatives or substitutes are available and 
acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health (Regulation of 
the European Parliament and Council, 2000).  Some other countries treat 
WPM for export solely by heat treatment, most notably Thailand 
(Unahawutti, 2006).  In recent years, the United States and Canada have 
been routinely treating WPM by heat treatment to eliminate pine wood 
nematode risk to meet phytosanitary requirements of the European Union 
and China.  This practice of heat treatment of softwoods used in packaging  
materials has continued and has expanded to cover most WPM for foreign 
destinations.  There is still, however, some fumigation of hardwoods with 
methyl bromide in the United States for use as WPM, but it is a relatively 
limited practice.   
 
Specific country authorities provided information about their use of heat 
treatment in compliance with ISPM 15.  The NPPO in Japan indicates that 
90 to 95 percent of their WPM for export is heat treated (Kani, 2006).  
Although most WPM for export from Korea is heat treated, exports to 
Norway and Russia are usually fumigated with methyl bromide, according 
to the NPPOs in those countries (Kim, 2006).  The NPPO in Chile, Marcos 
Beeche, states that 80 to 85 percent of their WPM for export is heat treated 
(Cohen, 2006).  The NPPO in Taiwan indicates that almost all of their 
WPM for export is heat treated and use of methyl bromide, for this 
purpose, is expected to be totally phased out in 2010 or 2015

WPM for export is heat treated and use of methyl bromide, for this 
purpose, is expected to be totally phased out in 2010 or 2015 (Chen, 
2006).  Although Canada is not subject to USDA’s WPM Rule, their 
packing industry is subject to compliance with ISPM 15-related 
regulations promulgated by other countries; therefore, the Canadian NPPO 
was also contacted to get compliance information.  Canada has no

certification system for methyl bromide for exports of WPM; however, 
they do provide exporters with a phytosanitary certificate if fumigation 
with methyl bromide is the only alternative in specific situations (Thomas, 
2006).  Thus, Canada complies with ISPM 15 primarily through the use of 
heat treatment with limited fumigation allowed, as needed.  Although 
Mexico was not initially subject to APHIS’ wood packing rule, the 
requirements have been extended to Mexico separately (69 FR 
165:52409–52419).  The authority from the Mexican Forestry Health 
Office indicates that 92 percent of the WPM for export from Mexico is 
heat treated (Ramos, 2006).   
 
As is evident from the responses received, those countries whose NPPOs  
responded to our recent request for information about compliance with 
ISPM 15 overwhelmingly indicated that heat treatment is the predominant 
treatment method used.  There were several countries that

As is evident from the responses received, those countries whose NPPOs  
responded to our recent request for information about compliance with 
ISPM 15 overwhelmingly indicated that heat treatment is the predominant 
treatment method used.  There were several countries that lacked adequate 
data to respond to our questions about ISPM 15 compliance.  In particular, 
Brazil has only collected data about overall methyl bromide usage, but not 
specific data for ISPM 15 compliance (Franz, 2006).  China lacks data 
about overall compliance with ISPM 15 (Chou, 2006).  The refinement of 
methyl bromide estimates for China in this SEIS relies upon data from a 
previous agency trip report (USDA, APHIS, 1999) that included visits to 
specific port and other treatment facilities of WPM in China.  There is an 
ongoing agency effort to continue to get accurate information about the 
compliance of other countries with ISPM 15; however, meaningful 
responses from the NPPOs of those countries for documentation have not 
yet been received.  For those countries that lack data about frequency of  
treatment method, the analysis applies heat treatment to half of the WPM 
and fumigation with methyl bromide to the other half of the WPM.  
Relevant information has been received for compliance from our most 
important trading partners.  As other authorities respond to our request for 
information, the quantitative value of the methyl bromide estimates can be 
refined accordingly.   
 
Although most calculations used to determine the estimates of methyl

 from our most

information, the quantitative value of the methyl bromide estimates can be 
refined accordingly.   
 
Although most calculations used to determine the estimates of methyl 
bromide usage resulting from compliance with APHIS’ WPM regulations 
in this SEIS are based upon U.S. Customs data related to import entries, 
one country (Nicaragua) provided information specific to WPM.  The 
response from the NPPO for the country of Nicaragua provided actual data 
that showed annual usage of 1,010.5 pounds for the first year of 
compliance with ISPM 15 regulations (Hernandez, 2006).   
Thus, the estimate for Nicaragua is based upon actual usage data.   
 
The data for methyl bromide treatment of WPM for export from the 
United States is maintained by the National Wooden Pallet and Container 
Association (NWPCA).  NWPCA tracks the number of WPM units that 
are fumigated each year.  In calendar year 2005, the United States

fumigated 855,047 WPM units for this purpose (Deomano, 2006a).  This 
NWPCA information is used in the determination of the cumulative 
methyl bromide estimates for the United States’ compliance with ISPM 
15.  Unlike the available export data from NWPCA, comparable data 
about the number of WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide annually 
are not available for import entries to the United States; therefore, 
estimates for

 is used in the determination of the cumulative 
methyl bromide estimates for the United States’ compliance with ISPM 
15.  Unlike the available export data from NWPCA, comparable data 
about the number of WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide annually 
are not available for import entries to the United States; therefore, 
estimates for all countries, other than Nicaragua, are calculated using U.S. 
Customs entry data. 
 
Although China has committed to eventually reduce their usage of methyl 
bromide (UNEP, 2003; Beijing Times, 2003, Mercado, 1999), the rate of  
reduction of this usage for treatment of WPM, over time, is likely to be 
tied to their propensity to continue to promote export trade.  The original 
estimate for the China Interim Rule was based upon analysis of already 
loaded WPM and projected an estimate ranging from 1,040 to 12,565 MT 
per year (USDA, APHIS, 1998b).  The comparable estimate for China, 
from the FEIS, was based upon analysis of WPM not already loaded and 
projected a range of 52 to 628 MT per year.  Subsequent review of the 
information from a trip report (USDA, APHIS, 1999) to China suggests 
that some ports are complying exactly as the FEIS suggests and other ports 
are continuing to treat containers of WPM with already loaded cargo as 
had been projected in the analysis for the China Interim Rule.  For 
example, the port at Tianjin requires the exporter to heat treat or fumigate 
WPM prior to loading of cargo.  On the other hand, Shanghai permits  
fumigation either before or after cargo loading.  At the ports of 

Text Len: 1577
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 with already loaded cargo as 
had been projected in the analysis for the China Interim Rule.  For 
example, the port at Tianjin requires the exporter to heat treat or fumigate 
WPM prior to loading of cargo.  On the other hand, Shanghai permits  
fumigation either before or after cargo loading.  At the ports of 
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, most of the WPM is fumigated prior to cargo 
loading; however, occasional fumigation of containers with loaded cargo 
occurs due to vessel departure constraints.  Most fumigations in Shenzhen 
are conducted at company sites rather than at port facilities.  There was no 
survey conducted at these company sites to determine the method of 
compliance with WPM regulations; therefore, no information is available 
about how the company sites in Shenzen fumigate packing material.   
 
While data on overall production and consumption of methyl bromide 
have been reported to UNEP by China (NOAA et al., 2007; UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007), it is unclear how much is applied to fumigation of WPM.  
The total methyl bromide production capacity of China=s three producers 
was 7,620 MT in 2002, but only 3,175 MT were produced that year 
(BeijingTimes, 2003; UNEP, 2003).  Recent response from the NPPO in 
China indicates their lack of any recent data compiled for the ongoing 
compliance with ISPM 15 (Chou, 2006).  Based upon the information 
obtained from the 1999 trip report and more recent contacts, this 
supplement conservatively refines the methyl bromide estimates based 
upon treatment directly into already loaded containers.  The methyl

 their lack of any recent data compiled for the ongoing 
compliance with ISPM 15 (Chou, 2006).  Based upon the information 
obtained from the 1999 trip report and more recent contacts, this 
supplement conservatively refines the methyl bromide estimates based 
upon treatment directly into already loaded containers.  The methyl 
bromide resulting from China’s compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule, 
using this conservative approach in this SEIS, ranges from 2,027 to 
III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  23  
6,188 MT per year.  Relative to the 3,175 MT of methyl bromide produced 
by China in 2002 for all uses (Beijing Times, 2003; UNEP, 2003), this 
projected range for the methyl bromide estimate is clearly elevated.  In the 
absence of more definitive information from the Chinese NPPO, the 
methyl bromide estimates in our documentation for China will remain 
uncertain and conservatively high. 
 
Information about the manner in which methyl bromide fumigation 
treatments are conducted in given countries was received from responses 
submitted by most of the NPPOs in those countries contacted by APHIS.  
The majority of the countries that responded and permit fumigation of 
methyl bromide in compliance with ISPM 15 report that those fumigations 
occur to the WPM prior to cargo loading.  This includes responses from 
Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan 
(Kim, 2006; Morales, 2006; Cohen, 2006; Chen, 2006; Thomas, 2006; 
Ramos, 2006).  The majority of fumigation of WPM in Japan is applied to

 cargo loading.  This includes responses from 
Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan 
(Kim, 2006; Morales, 2006; Cohen, 2006; Chen, 2006; Thomas, 2006; 
Ramos, 2006).  The majority of fumigation of WPM in Japan is applied to 
lumber before actual assembly of the wood packaging unit (Kani, 2006).   
 
China is the only country where methyl bromide fumigation of loaded 
cargo is known to occur regularly.  The predominant manner of methyl 
bromide fumigation for other countries that permit its usage occurs prior 
to loading of cargo.  This is to be expected based upon the multiple factors 
discussed previously in the FEIS.  However, for calculation purposes, in  
this SEIS, the application of analysis based upon fumigation of WPM 
prior to cargo loading is restricted to only those countries for which 
adequate compliance information is available.  For conservative purposes, 
calculations for those other countries from which compliance data are 
lacking are subject to analysis based upon fumigation of already loaded 
cargo.  Our inquiries to the NPPOs focused on those countries with the 
greatest trade with the United States (those countries with the most U.S. 
Customs entries); therefore, a considerable proportion (greater than 71 
percent) of those entries from countries who permit methyl bromide 
fumigation are subject to analysis under the scenario for treatment of 
unloaded cargo.  
 
In addition to the issue of actual treatment (including or excluding cargo), 
the method of fumigation does influence the quantity of methyl bromide 
needed for treatment.  Although both chamber and tarp fumigations are

In addition to the issue of actual treatment (including or excluding cargo), 
the method of fumigation does influence the quantity of methyl bromide 
needed for treatment.  Although both chamber and tarp fumigations are 
used in the treatment of WPM, the decision was made to apply only tarp 
fumigations to the methyl bromide estimate calculations in the FEIS in the 
absence of complete data about the relative frequency of each type of 
fumigation.  This approach results in conservatively high projections; 
however, it provides a reasonable approximation for the variability in 
treatment methods.  More recently, we have learned that many Chinese 
exporters are using a unique and specific fumigation procedure that differs 
from the chamber and tarp fumigations used elsewhere.  This procedure is

discussed in section III.A. regarding the estimates for the China Interim 
Rule.  Rather than tarping containers, many of those Chinese shippers who 
were fumigating containers with already loaded cargo were conducting 
tests of those containers for airtightness, releasing methyl bromide directly 
into the closed containers, and sealing the entrance to those containers for 
fumigations. 
 
The practice of fumigating containers with already loaded cargo without 
tarping results in considerably less usage of methyl bromide than occurs if 
those containers are tarped for fumigation.  For example. the amount of 
methyl bromide required for fumigation

 and sealing the entrance to those containers for 
fumigations. 
 
The practice of fumigating containers with already loaded cargo without 
tarping results in considerably less usage of methyl bromide than occurs if 
those containers are tarped for fumigation.  For example. the amount of 
methyl bromide required for fumigation of a sealed 40-foot container in 
China amounts to only 9.6 to 12.8 pounds as compared to 16.2 to 21.6 
pounds for the standard tarp fumigation of the same container.  Likewise, 
the amount of methyl bromide required for fumigation of a sealed 20-foot 
container in China amounts to only 4.8 to 6.4 pounds as compared to 9 to 
12 pounds for the standard tarp fumigation of the same container.  
Although previous methyl bromide estimate calculations had not 
considered this factor, the refined assessment, in this SEIS, of the 
cumulative methyl bromide estimate for China applies their unique 
manner of fumigation for all methyl bromide projections.   
 
The methyl bromide estimates for countries where compliance data are 
lacking use those values for the standard tarp fumigation with already 
loaded cargo for 20 to 40-foot containers, as cited above.  The amount of 
methyl bromide used to treat WPM prior to loading varies with the amount 
of WPM.  The previous estimate in the FEIS considered that the quantity 
of methyl bromide required for treatment of a given WPM unit before 
cargo loading would amount to about one-twentieth of that for loaded 
cargo.  This amounts to a range of 0.45 to 1.08 pounds of methyl b

 varies with the amount 
of WPM.  The previous estimate in the FEIS considered that the quantity 
of methyl bromide required for treatment of a given WPM unit before 
cargo loading would amount to about one-twentieth of that for loaded 
cargo.  This amounts to a range of 0.45 to 1.08 pounds of methyl bromide 
per WPM unit for standard tarp fumigations of unloaded WPM.  This 
approach is used to project methyl bromide estimates for those countries 
who indicate treatment of WPM occurs prior to cargo loading.  Likewise, 
some exporters from China and Hong Kong have been fumigating 
unloaded WPM in chambers or containers.  This amounts to a range of 
0.24 to 0.64 pounds of methyl bromide per WPM unit for container 
fumigations of unloaded WPM.   
 
Although we know that China does fumigate unloaded WPM at certain 
ports, such as Tianjin (USDA, APHIS, 1999), our estimates for China are 
based upon fumigation of already loaded cargo, as previously mentioned.  
On the other hand, the estimates for Hong Kong are based upon 
fumigation of unloaded WPM using the above method.  Based upon 
records of U.S. Customs import entries, much of the cargo shipped from 
Hong Kong comes from southern parts of China, such as Guangzhou.  
These locations in southern China often move products by truck, and 
WPM treatment at Guangzhou occurs prior to loading for most shipments

(USDA, APHIS, 1999).  This manner of fumigation is more representative 
of the treatments applied to WPM from Hong Kong and more accurately 
estimates actual usage.      
 
In addition to the above approaches to methyl bromide fumigation of 
WPM, some WPM is constructed from wood that is fumigated prior to 
assembly.  This is the manner of treatment that occurs in Japan (Kani, 
2006).  Although it is known that this approach uses less methyl bromide,  
the quantity used in construction of the WPM varies.  Based upon review 
of methyl bromide treatments of other unmanufactured wood products, it  
is estimated that the methyl bromide usage for one container-sized 
treatment would cover 50 WPM units.  This amounts to a range of 0.18 to 
0.43 pounds of methyl bromide per WPM unit. 
 
The total quantity of methyl bromide emitted from a given fumigation is 
dependent upon the commodity being treated.  In the absence of good 
studies on sorption, the calculations in the draft and final WPM EIS 
applied an estimated 80 to 100 percent release of methyl bromide from the 
fumigation enclosure during venting after a treatment was completed.  
Actual studies have been done by UNEP to analyze the amount of methyl  
bromide sorbed to various commodities (UNEP, MBTOC, 1998; UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007).

lied an estimated 80 to 100 percent release of methyl bromide from the 
fumigation enclosure during venting after a treatment was completed.  
Actual studies have been done by UNEP to analyze the amount of methyl  
bromide sorbed to various commodities (UNEP, MBTOC, 1998; UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007).  Durable commodities, like WPM, were determined to 
adsorb certain quantities of fumigant.  The 1998 findings determined that  
the actual methyl bromide emitted from WPM and related commodities in 
fumigations amounted to a range of 69 to 79 percent of the total amount 
applied.  This information was used in refining the methyl bromide 
estimates to more closely determine potential impact to ozone from 
fumigations of WPM in the draft SEIS.  The more recent studies indicate 
that the percentage of methyl bromide emitted from durable commodities 
ranges from 76 to 88 percent of the total amount applied (page 16 of 
UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  This information was used to refine methyl 
bromide estimates in the final SEIS.       
 
The potential reuse of treated WPM is known to influence the amount of 
treatment of WPM for trade.  There are no hard figures for how much 
WPM is reused worldwide after cargo has been unloaded.  We know from 
life-cycle studies that some WPM can be reused for 8 to 10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the 
loaded cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  The United States does reuse treated 
pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are collected on how much 
WPM is reused.  Review of the present

life-cycle studies that some WPM can be reused for 8 to 10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the 
loaded cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  The United States does reuse treated 
pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are collected on how much 
WPM is reused.  Review of the present rate of reuse in the United States  
indicates that one of every two WPM units is recycled and reused for 
shipping another load of cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  Some countries are 
known to recycle more WPM than the United States.  However, 
information about the actual rates of reuse by other countries is not readily 
available.  Accordingly, we did not apply this information to any

refinements of the methyl bromide release model.  By disregarding this 
issue in the quantitative analysis, our calculated figures overestimate the  
number of WPM units treated by 50 percent or more.  The lower usage of 
methyl bromide associated with less frequent need to treat WPM is, 
therefore, not reflected in the present estimates of methyl bromide released  
or in any previous estimates in the FEIS or earlier documents.  It is 
expected that greater treatment will occur with initial ISPM 15 compliance 
due to the lack of treated WPM already in circulation, but the frequency of 
need to fumigate will decrease with reuse.  The lack of allowance for reuse 
in our analysis ensures that the methyl bromide estimates for initial 
compliance during the first year of enforcement are not understated, but

due to the lack of treated WPM already in circulation, but the frequency of 
need to fumigate will decrease with reuse.  The lack of allowance for reuse 
in our analysis ensures that the methyl bromide estimates for initial 
compliance during the first year of enforcement are not understated, but 
the extended use of treated WPM could indicate overestimation for future 
years.  As information related to this topic becomes available, continuing 
refinements of the methyl bromide estimates may be made in the future to 
more closely reflect actual usage.     
 
Implications of the compliance methods required by individual countries 
on international agreements and changes to international agreements affect  
the pest risks and the usage of methyl bromide.  Australia and New  
Zealand require all WPM to be debarked.  This requirement increases  
the effective control of some pests from methyl bromide and heat 
treatments (Biosecurity Australia, 2006).  The more rapid penetration of 
debarked wood, as compared to wood with bark, has not yet been 
suggested to justify changes to lower methyl bromide application rates, 
however, this topic may influence future regulations of WPM and other 
countries may require debarking of WPM to lower associated pest risks.  It 
is also unclear how debarking affects emissions of methyl bromide upon 
venting.   
 
Although U.S. trade with Australia and New Zealand is relatively limited, 
as compared to the global trade, this issue could be important if other 
countries choose to require debarking of WPM from foreign origins to 
meet their phytosanitary needs as well.  ISPM guidelines are subject to

Although U.S. trade with Australia and New Zealand is relatively limited, 
as compared to the global trade, this issue could be important if other 
countries choose to require debarking of WPM from foreign origins to 
meet their phytosanitary needs as well.  ISPM guidelines are subject to 
ongoing changes as various countries negotiate to ensure phytosanitary 
regulations meet their need to protect plant resources.  The present 
treatment schedule for methyl bromide fumigation, under ISPM 15, ranges 
from 3 to 4 lbs per 1000 cubic feet for 24 hours (FAO, 2006; IPPC 
Secretariat, 2005).  Future changes to the treatment schedule may not 
increase the application rate or necessitate the need for more usage of 
methyl bromide; however, APHIS continues to track proposed revisions to 
ensure that the potential impacts of all revisions to the international 
guidelines are considered. 
 
Some commodities are not marketable if fumigated with methyl bromide; 
some agricultural commodities lack a tolerance for bromine residues;

some commodities, such as leather, react with methyl bromide such that 
strong odors are imparted to the product; and, some commodities, such as  
electronics, may be damaged by reaction with methyl bromide and, 
therefore, methyl bromide fumigation of such commodities is not 
permitted due to the loss of product.  This restriction on methyl bromide 
treatment limits fumigation of already loaded cargo to those commodities 
that can tolerate the chemical and residual effects of the treatment.   
 
When the assumption is made that treatment of loaded cargo is the

, methyl bromide fumigation of such commodities is not 
permitted due to the loss of product.  This restriction on methyl bromide 
treatment limits fumigation of already loaded cargo to those commodities 
that can tolerate the chemical and residual effects of the treatment.   
 
When the assumption is made that treatment of loaded cargo is the 
predominant method of fumigation in China, it is expected that the 
calculations from this assumption will overstate the methyl bromide 
estimate.  This was clearly true for the early estimates made for the China 
Interim Rule, and is true for the present analysis where this assumption 
was applied to China and to other countries lacking information regarding 
the manner of their treatment methodology for ISPM 15 compliance.  
Although there is no detailed data available to support a precise estimate 
of methyl bromide usage in our model, this approach helps to ensure that 
underestimation of potential release of methyl bromide from fumigations 
for China and these other countries does not occur for these estimates.  
 
World trade strongly influences how various countries comply with  
ISPM 15 guidelines.  China continues to use methyl bromide fumigation 
of loaded cargo to help facilitate more rapid export of their cargo for 
trading purposes.  The eightfold increase in U.S. Customs cargo entries 
from China from 1998 to 2005 shows their commitment to the promotion 
of trade with the United States.  Although other countries are also 
increasing their world trade, the overall increase in U.S. Customs entries is 
2.45-fold over the same time period.  As is clear from those responses 
received by APHIS from NPPOs of these other large trading partners, their

of trade with the United States.  Although other countries are also 
increasing their world trade, the overall increase in U.S. Customs entries is 
2.45-fold over the same time period.  As is clear from those responses 
received by APHIS from NPPOs of these other large trading partners, their 
countries are relying on heat treatment rather than methyl bromide 
fumigation for compliance with ISPM 15, and their changes in trade are 
not dramatically affecting their usage of methyl bromide.  Most countries 
have indicated that they plan to continue to decrease their usage of methyl 
bromide, particularly when there are effective alternate treatments 
available. 
 
E.  Impact Assessment of Refined Methyl Bromide 
Estimates  
 
Refined methyl bromide estimates have been calculated using the methods 
described in appendix E and section III.D of this SEIS to more accurately 
reflect actual compliance with ISPM 15 and APHIS’ Wood Packaging 
Rule.  The findings presented in table 3–1 show the estimated methyl 
bromide associated with direct compliance with APHIS’ rule to range 
from 822 to 2,351 MT annually.  This estimate excludes the ongoing 
compliance by China and Hong Kong with the China Interim Rule, which

2005, data for the compliance, under the IPPC alternative, have been 
collected and reviewed.  These values are comparable to those presented 
on pages 67 to 68 of the FEIS (384 to 4,630 MT annually); however, as 
would be expected with better data, the range for the estimate is projected 
to be narrower.  The broad range presented in the FEIS encompasses the 
more refined estimate in this supplement.  That indicates that the initial 
projections in the FEIS were representative of the potential methyl 
bromide usage that has actually occurred for those countries in compliance 
with APHIS’ wood packaging rule.   
 
The effect on stratospheric ozone from the estimated 822 to 2,351 MT of 
methyl bromide released annually from fumigations of WPM can be 
estimated by using similar methodology to that applied in previous 
documents.  However, just as there have been changes in WPM regulation 
compliance and trade that have affected usage, there have been changes in 
assessment methods as more information is gathered and there have been 
changes in the relative contribution of various ozone-depleting chemicals 
to the overall effects on the ozone layer as certain chemicals are phased 
out.  The ultimate recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer is dependent 
upon the reduction in release to the atmosphere of many chemicals.  Most 
of the primary ozone-depleting chemicals are presently regulated 
including many chlorofluorocarbons and bromines.  However, many 
substances such as greenhouse gases that

out.  The ultimate recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer is dependent 
upon the reduction in release to the atmosphere of many chemicals.  Most 
of the primary ozone-depleting chemicals are presently regulated 
including many chlorofluorocarbons and bromines.  However, many 
substances such as greenhouse gases that induce air temperature and 
circulation changes also affect the ozone layer.  Heating of the troposphere 
and cooling of the lower stratosphere associated with these gases has 
affected the ozone layer, particularly by the enhanced ozone destruction 
observed seasonally in the polar lower stratosphere (page 5.1, NOAA 
et al., 2007).  This variable is not factored into our assessment due to the 
present uncertainties over the regulation of greenhouse gases and the 
complex nonlinear effects that they cause to atmospheric temperature and 
ozone destruction in the stratosphere, particularly above polar regions. 
 
Previous APHIS EIS documents have applied the results of analysis of 
potential impacts from policy options cited in 1998 Scientific Assessment 
(pages 18-19 of NOAA et al., 1998) to the assessment of potential effects 
on stratospheric ozone.   The 1998 Scientific Assessment document 
indicated that “the equivalent effective chlorine loading above the 1980 
level” could be decreased by “about 1% by eliminating the global 
production of methyl bromide beginning in 2004.”  This NOAA document 
explained the uncertainty that exists and the dynamic changes in the ozone 
layer associated with the phaseout of various anthropogenic sources of 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS).  It should be remembered that the 
global consumption (not global production) of ODS releases the chemicals 
to the atmosphere and causes the depletion.

future usage, but it is not necessarily the best measure for potential impact.  
In particular, storage of methyl bromide for future usage has occurred 
periodically and consumption does not always mirror production.  This 
analysis was based upon 1996 data that indicated 71,425 MT of global 
annual methyl bromide production and 63,960 MT of global annual 
methyl bromide consumption that year (UNEP, MBTOC, 1998).  
However, as a rough measure, the relative contribution of methyl bromide 
to the ongoing ozone depletion (1 percent above the 1980 level) did 
provide a basis for policy discussion and a means to look more closely at 
potential effects from different uses including QPS treatment of WPM.   
 
Analyses comparable to the 1998 Scientific Assessment were presented in 
the 2006 Scientific Assessment (NOAA et al., 2007).  Although the 
Executive Summary of this scientific assessment was released on  
August 18, 2006, this assessment was not released in its entirety until 
February 2007 after the draft SEIS had already been sent to printing, so its 
findings were not applied to the draft SEIS.  The 2006 assessment

findings were not applied to the draft SEIS.  The 2006 assessment 
analyzes effects from the hypothetical elimination of all emissions by the 
end of 2006.  Based upon this, the comparable loading of methyl bromide 
(in equivalent effective chlorine units) above the 1980 level could be 
decreased by 5 percent by elimination of all production or all emissions.  
This is based upon 2005 data that indicated 37,923 MT of global annual 
methyl bromide production and 36,866 MT of global annual methyl 
bromide consumption that year (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The present 
assessment (in this final SEIS) uses the 2005 data (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) 
released in February 2007 and the 2006 scientific assessment of that data 
(NOAA et al., 2007) published March 15, 2007 as the basis for the 
determination of relative effect on the stratospheric ozone layer of 
compliance with WPM regulations involving methyl bromide fumigation.    
 
The relative loading or effect on stratospheric ozone for methyl bromide 
relative to the 1980 level shows an increase from 1 percent in the 1998 
assessment to 5 percent in the 2006 assessment.  This increase is a 
function of several factors including the reduction in effect from those 
ozone-depleting chemicals that are decreasing due to phasing out their 
usage, better understanding and modeling of ODS effects, and UNEP’s 
refinement of the ozone-depleting potential of ODS including methyl 
bromide.  The assessments prior to 2006 had projected long-term ozone

usage, better understanding and modeling of ODS effects, and UNEP’s 
refinement of the ozone-depleting potential of ODS including methyl 
bromide.  The assessments prior to 2006 had projected long-term ozone 
changes based upon linear trends, but the phaseout of ODS by the mid-
1990s required adjustments to the two-dimensional and three-dimensional 
models in the 2006 Scientific Assessment to more accurately reflect actual 
changes in stratospheric ozone that result from the non-linear changes in 
ODS burden that have resulted from the phaseout (page 3.5 of NOAA 
et al., 2007).  It is also noteworthy that this increased percentage occurs 
during the same period of time when there is a 42 percent reduction in 
worldwide consumption of methyl bromide (63,960 MT in 1996 to  
 
30  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
36,866 MT in 2005).  This 2006 assessment projects conditions in the 
Antarctic stratosphere to return to those preceding 1980 by around 2065 
(page xxxv, Executive Summary of NOAA et al., 2007).  The assessment 
indicates a number of potential options for accelerating the recovery of the 
ozone layer by eliminating ODS production and consumption.  The 
options are presented in Table 1 (page xxxvi, Executive Summary of 
NOAA et al., 2007) and include the 5 percent reduction associated with 
methyl bromide mentioned earlier in this paragraph.  The accelerated 
recovery of the ozone layer from these table 1 options covers only a  
49.2 percent overall increase in the ozone recovery, but is cumulative with 
those increases in ozone resulting from the reductions of other ODS that

methyl bromide mentioned earlier in this paragraph.  The accelerated 
recovery of the ozone layer from these table 1 options covers only a  
49.2 percent overall increase in the ozone recovery, but is cumulative with 
those increases in ozone resulting from the reductions of other ODS that 
have already been phased out and that are projected to result in the pre-
1980 levels by around 2065.  This series of hypothetical projections is 
based upon the contention that the 1980 level of stratospheric ozone is the 
condition under which complete recovery has occurred.  However, the 
2006 Scientific Assessment in the first line of the summary on page 6.1 
indicates that global ozone levels were already declining in the late 1970’s 
due to anthropogenic releases of ODSs (NOAA et al., 2007).   
 
As important as it is to reach a milestone like the ozone levels in 1980, it 
does not guarantee full recovery of the ozone layer.  In fact, the further 
discussion of this issue on page 6.1 of the 2006 Scientific Assessment 
(NOAA et al., 2007) describes the effects of equivalent effective 
stratospheric chlorine (EESC) by saying that “the return of ozone to  
pre-1980 levels may not occur at the same time as the return of EESC to 
pre-1980 levels, and in fact may never occur because of changes in the 
atmosphere since 1980 that are not caused by ODSs.”   This is a reference 
in part to the increase in greenhouse gases responsible for global warming 
of the atmosphere that was discussed previously.  Despite limits in the 
potential reductions of ozone depletion, the continuing phaseout of O

, and in fact may never occur because of changes in the 
atmosphere since 1980 that are not caused by ODSs.”   This is a reference 
in part to the increase in greenhouse gases responsible for global warming 
of the atmosphere that was discussed previously.  Despite limits in the 
potential reductions of ozone depletion, the continuing phaseout of ODSs 
is contributing to stratospheric ozone recovery (page xxxv, Executive 
Summary in NOAA et al., 2007), and continued efforts to reduce usage of 
ODSs such as methyl bromide will benefit that recovery.  It is, however, 
clear from review of the 2006 Scientific Assessment that the QPS uses of 
methyl bromide and uses of other ODSs which are not yet part of the 
worldwide phaseout are not the sole factors that need to be addressed to 
ensure complete recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer.   
 
One factor in the long recovery period is the continued action of ODS 
compounds that have long half-lives.  The chlorofluorocarbons have long 
half-lives in the atmosphere that contribute substantially to the long 
recovery period of the stratospheric ozone.  Those ODS compounds with 
half-lives of 50 to 60 years are a primary factor in the projection of the 
long recovery of Antarctic stratospheric ozone to pre-1980 values by 
2065.  Unlike these ODS compounds which are likely to take 75 to 90 
years for 75 percent reductions in their contribution to ozone depletion,

III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  31  
methyl bromide has a half-life of 0.7 year in the atmosphere (table 1–4 of 
NOAA et al., 2007).  Methyl bromide, therefore, would be expected to 
have comparable reduction in effects upon stratospheric ozone within less 
than 2 years of phase-out due to its more rapid breakdown.  As the 
stratospheric ozone layer recovers (the ppt of ozone approach the 1980 
milestone level) and the phased-out ODS chemicals cease to persist in the 
atmosphere, the ozone depletion from the remaining uses (based upon this 
1980 milestone) can be expected to constitute increasing percentages of 
recovery of stratospheric ozone.  The percentage contribution of individual 
chemicals or cumulative contribution to ozone depletion from all 
remaining uses not phased out could exceed 100 percent recovery because  
the 1980 milestone includes allowance for some ozone depletion of natural 
origin and for a certain amount of ozone depletion from ongoing 
anthropogenic uses (levels before 1980) that the atmosphere is considered  
to be able to handle without adverse effects to the stratospheric ozone 
layer.  Although alternatives to methyl bromide are continuing to be 
sought and there has been at least a 42 percent  reduction in usage since 
1996 based upon UNEP reporting, future anthropogenic usage of methyl 
bromide is anticipated to continue with gradual reductions after the non-
QPS phaseout is completed for all countries by about 2015.

bromide is anticipated to continue with gradual reductions after the non-
QPS phaseout is completed for all countries by about 2015.           
 
The 2006 Scientific Assessment as part of its models revises the global 
ozone depletion potential on a per-atom basis for bromine from 45 times 
as effective as chlorine (previous assessment in 2002) to 60 times as 
effective as chlorine (page xxxv, Executive Summary of NOAA et al., 
2007).  This factor results in an estimated 33 percent increase in ozone 
depletion associated with methyl bromide over that projected for previous 
assessments.  Such corrections to their estimates are important to assessing 
potential risk outcomes that accurately reflect actual impacts.  This factor 
has been subject to ongoing review and revision in each updated version 
of the UNEP scientific assessment, so it can be anticipated that future 
bases for ozone depletion potential may change again as more complete 
data are collected about the interactions of stratospheric gases.  In that this 
corrected factor is included in the 2006 Scientific Assessment for the 
impacts of methyl bromide, the change is applied in this final SEIS which 
uses their most recent assessment as the basis for determination of effects 
on stratospheric ozone.  
 
Based upon the 2006 scientific assessment finding (NOAA et al., 2007), 
the effect of methyl bromide usage in compliance with APHIS’ wood 
packaging rule (822 to 2,351 MT) after 2006 is projected to pose a

the effect of methyl bromide usage in compliance with APHIS’ wood

potential range of 0.1 to 0.32 percent effect on annual depletion of 
stratospheric ozone above the 1980 baseline (total recovery).  The 
implementation of this alternative, as demonstrated in this risk analysis, is 
causing depletion of the ozone layer commensurate to that anticipated in 
the FEIS.  Therefore, no substantial changes to impacts on human health 
 
32  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
or to the environment are anticipated as a result of continuing 
implementation of this alternative.  With the ongoing phaseout of most 
usage of methyl bromide (that are projected  to contribute up to a  
5-percent effect on stratospheric ozone annually above the 1980 baseline), 
the continuing usage from compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule (which is 
less than one-fifteenth of the total methyl bromide usage) is more than 
compensated by the continuing overall reductions in usage.

Alternatives considered in the EIS include (1) no action (no change in the 
current regulation), (2) extend the treatments in the China Interim Rule to 
all countries, (3) adoption of the International Plant Protection 
Convention’s (IPPC) “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging 
Material in International Trade,” (the preferred alternative), (4) a 
comprehensive risk reduction program, and (5) substitute packing 
materials only.  This section compares these alternatives based on the 
refined methyl bromide estimates generated from quantitative analyses in 
this WPM SEIS.  
 
There would be no new mandatory methyl bromide usage under the no 
action alternative for WPM so this alternative involves no direct effects on 
methyl bromide usage per se.  Therefore, the direct effects of the no action 
alternative involve no immediate increase in effects on stratospheric

ozone.  However, those treatments associated with the China Interim Rule 
would continue.  This continuing usage is part of the aggregate impacts of 
methyl bromide usage.  The application rate required under the China 
Interim Rule is slightly higher than ISPM 15, so the projected methyl 
bromide estimate is elevated commensurate with the potential increased 
usage.  Under the no action alternative, and based on the refined methyl 
bromide estimates, it is estimated that the potential usage of methyl 
bromide in China and Hong Kong would continue to range from 2,486 to 
7,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 than ISPM 15, so the projected methyl 
bromide estimate is elevated commensurate with the potential increased 
usage.  Under the no action alternative, and based on the refined methyl 
bromide estimates, it is estimated that the potential usage of methyl 
bromide in China and Hong Kong would continue to range from 2,486 to 
7,676 MT annually.  The impact of this alternative above the 1980 
baseline is projected to pose an annual 0.34 to 1.0 percent effect on 
stratospheric ozone.  This issue is discussed further in the comparison of 
aggregate impacts in part 3 of this section.  
 
Refined estimates were made for the alternative to extend those treatments 
used in the China Interim Rule worldwide.  The estimated methyl bromide 
associated with compliance with this alternative ranges from 910 to 
2,612 MT annually.  This refined estimate is encompassed by the broader 
range determined in the FEIS (see page 62 of the FEIS) for the methyl 
bromide estimate (427 to 5,145 MT annually).  The effect on stratospheric 
ozone from the estimated 910 to 2,612 MT of methyl bromide released 
annually from fumigations using rates applicable to the China Interim 
Rule is projected to pose a potential effect above the 1980 baseline of 
0.12 to 0.3 percent on stratospheric ozone annually.  This represents a 
slightly greater effect on the stratospheric ozone layer than was projected 
for the preferred alternative using APHIS’ wood packaging rule, however, 
not a substantially greater impact.  It is, nonetheless, best to select 
effective treatments that pose the least adverse environmental impacts, and 
APHIS’ wood packaging rule poses less damage

  This represents a 
slightly greater effect on the stratospheric ozone layer than was projected 
for the preferred alternative using APHIS’ wood packaging rule, however, 
not a substantially greater impact.  It is, nonetheless, best to select 
effective treatments that pose the least adverse environmental impacts, and 
APHIS’ wood packaging rule poses less damage to ozone than would 
result from worldwide application of the China Interim Rule.   
 
The comprehensive risk reduction program provides the maximum 
flexibility to select methods and treatments that are the most effective at 
eliminating all potential pest risks.  Since a comprehensive risk reduction 
program uses a combination of methods, and it is unclear exactly how 
frequently specific methods will be selected, the potential environmental  
consequences vary considerably with the frequency of methods employed.  
It is not reasonable to speculate on the methyl bromide estimate with such 
potential variability.  The potential human health and environmental 
consequences from this alternative are expected to be comparable to those 
described in the WPM FEIS. 
 
Substitute packaging material that poses no potential risk of ozone 
depletion was considered in the FEIS as a possible alternative to WPM.  
This alternative would not require the use of heat treatment or fumigation 
with methyl bromide; therefore, any potential human health and 
environmental consequences as a result of heat treatments or treatment

with methyl bromide are not associated with this alternative.  The 
worldwide implementation of this alternative would lower the release of 
methyl bromide from packaging material used in international trade.  
 
The WPM FEIS did a qualitative review of aggregate consequences of 
each alternative.  The aggregate consequences of methyl bromide usage in 
compliance with ISPM 15 relate to the cumulative impact of all usage 
associated with the guidelines.  Cumulative impact, as defined in NEPA 
(40 CFR 1508.7), is the “impact on the environment which results from 
the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and 
reasonably foreseeable future actions.”  Most of the potential cumulative 
impacts associated with ongoing methyl bromide usage for quarantine and 
other purposes were discussed in detail in the FEIS for the Importation of 
Mexican Unmanufactured Wood (USDA, APHIS, 2002a).  That document 
determined that most anticipated future quarantine treatments are not 
expected to pose significant effects to the stratospheric ozone layer, but it 
did analyze the more substantial usage of methyl bromide from the 
pending regulations being contemplated for the regulation of WPM 
worldwide.  The Mexican Unmanufactured Wood FEIS roughly analyzed 
this issue based upon the set manner of compliance as was initially 
anticipated for the China Interim Rule.  The lack of compliance data 
resulted in a projected estimate that was intentionally conservatively high.  
We now have data about how countries are complying with ISPM 15, and 
a more refined aggregate assessment of methyl bromide estimates and 
impacts associated with global WPM regulations is presented here.

anticipated for the China Interim Rule.  The lack of compliance data 
resulted in a projected estimate that was intentionally conservatively high.  
We now have data about how countries are complying with ISPM 15, and 
a more refined aggregate assessment of methyl bromide estimates and 
impacts associated with global WPM regulations is presented here.  
 
The cumulative usage of methyl bromide associated with regulations 
designed to meet the guidelines in ISPM 15 consists of methyl bromide 
usage from countries in compliance with APHIS’ wood packaging rule, 
countries’ compliance with the comparable regulations of other countries, 
and compliance of the United States with the regulations of these other 
countries.  The previous section compares methyl bromide estimates for  
alternatives in regard to the direct compliance of other countries with 
APHIS’ wood packaging rule.  Comparable estimates have been prepared 
for those countries that were already subject to APHIS regulations under 
the China Interim Rule (China and Hong Kong), and methyl bromide 
estimates are made for those countries (including the United States) that 
are not subject to APHIS’ regulations but must comply with the wood 
packaging regulations of other countries.  These estimates for compliance 
with ISPM 15 guidelines are provided below in table 3–2.   
 
The only country projected to have considerable usage of methyl bromide 
for compliance is China.  The original China estimate for the China 
Interim Rule projected a methyl bromide estimate ranging from 1,040 to 
12,565 MT annually (USDA, APHIS, 1998b).  The reported 2002 total

methyl bromide production capacity of China=s three producers was 
7,620 MT; however, their actual production was only 3,175 MT for all 
uses (Beijing Times, 2003; UNEP, 2003).  Although fumigation of WPM 
uses substantial amounts of methyl bromide, much of the usage reported in 
2002 was for other uses, including preshipment and other quarantine 
treatments.  Although some increased consumption has probably occurred 
between 2002 and 2005, the methyl bromide estimates (2,232 to 6,893 MT 
per year) determined in this SEIS for China are within the range of 
possible usage, but the upper tail of the distribution is probably high.  
Based upon this estimate the ongoing use in China is projected to pose a 
potential effect to stratospheric ozone above the 1980 baseline of 0.3 to 
0.93 percent annually.  The methyl bromide estimates for compliance of 
other countries with ISPM 15 are associated with considerably lower 
effects to stratospheric ozone than result from the compliance of China. 
 
In assessing the overall cumulative impact, it is important to add all 
contributing sources of methyl bromide to those determined as direct 
impacts from the imposed regulations.  The data for the United States 
estimate are based upon actual units fumigated with methyl bromide in 
2005 and, thereby, provide a relatively accurate cumulative estimate.  
Estimates for the other countries are determined by using U.S. Customs 
entries.  The data regarding methyl bromide estimates for Canada and 
Mexico pertain to their usage for export to other countries based upon

Estimates for the other countries are determined by using U.S. Customs 
entries.  The data regarding methyl bromide estimates for Canada and 
Mexico pertain to their usage for export to other countries based upon 
information about their manner of compliance with ISPM 15. 
The methyl bromide estimates presented in the previous section 
comparing alternatives (section III.D.2.) provide numerical estimates for 
compliance with APHIS’ regulations and the China Interim Rule 
alternative; however, all these countries must comply with ISPM 15 
regulations of countries other than the United States, as well as APHIS’ 
wood packaging rule.  The lack of reliable data about the amount of world 
trade among countries other than the United States and associated WPM 
 
36  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
with that trade makes any cumulative analysis speculative and therefore, 
the aggregate methyl bromide estimates and effects for each alternative in 
this SEIS are limited to the relative effects of imports to and exports from 
the United States.   
 
The aggregate methyl bromide usage associated with the no action 
alternative is equal to that of China and Hong Kong in compliance with 
the China Interim Rule.  There would be no other methyl bromide usage in 
compliance with this alternative.  The potential cumulative methyl 
bromide estimate for WPM treatment associated with the no action 
alternative ranges from 2,486 to 7,676 MT annually.  This estimate is 
projected to pose potential effects to stratospheric ozone above the 1980 
levels that range from 0.34 to 1.

 bromide usage in 
compliance with this alternative.  The potential cumulative methyl 
bromide estimate for WPM treatment associated with the no action 
alternative ranges from 2,486 to 7,676 MT annually.  This estimate is 
projected to pose potential effects to stratospheric ozone above the 1980 
levels that range from 0.34 to 1.0 percent annually.  The elevated estimate 
is the result of the manner of treatment applied to China compliance 
(fumigation of sealed containers after cargo loading) and the higher 
application rate of methyl bromide for the China Interim Rule.  The upper 
end of the projections for all cumulative estimates are not realistic based 
upon reported production and consumption data from China.  It is clear 
that the upper end of range is conservatively high.  The potential aggregate 
impact of this alternative is lower because it includes only methyl bromide 
fumigations in China and Hong Kong.  Consequently, cumulative human 
health and environmental consequences from methyl bromide usage under 
this alternative are slightly lower. 
 
The aggregate projection of all methyl bromide estimates for compliance 
with ISPM 15 (preferred alternative), based upon the above described 
analytical reasoning (overall compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule and 
reciprocal compliance by the United States), ranges from 3,191 to 
9,628 MT per year.  This estimate is projected to pose a potential effect on 
stratospheric ozone above the 1980 levels that ranges from 0.43 to 
1.3 percent annually.   The implementation of this alternative, as 
demonstrated in this risk analysis, shows potential depletion of the ozone 
layer commensurate to that anticipated in the FEIS.  Therefore, no 
substantial changes to

stratospheric ozone above the 1980 levels that ranges from 0.43 to 
1.3 percent annually.   The implementation of this alternative, as 
demonstrated in this risk analysis, shows potential depletion of the ozone 
layer commensurate to that anticipated in the FEIS.  Therefore, no 
substantial changes to impacts on human health or to the environment are 
anticipated as a result of continuing implementation of this alternative.  
With the ongoing phaseout of most usage of methyl bromide (that has 
resulted in a  27,094 MT reduction in use of methyl  bromide from 1996 to 
2005), the continuing usage from compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule is 
more than compensated by the overall reductions in usage that continue to 
occur. 
 
The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for compliance with ISPM 15 
(3,191 to 9, 628 MT per year) for 2005 can be compared to the figures 
reported by UNEP for treatment of WPM.  Reporting of all QPS 
production of methyl bromide in 2004 amounted to 10,660 MT (page 12 
of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The category for QPS treatment of wooden

packing materials was determined to account for 6.4 percent of the overall  
QPS usage or 679 MT.  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS 
purposes rose from 10,660 MT in 2004 to 13,815 MT in 2005, with the 
3,155 MT increase attributed largely to implementation of ISPM 15 for 
treatment of wood packaging material (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  The association of this increase with WPM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS 
purposes rose from 10,660 MT in 2004 to 13,815 MT in 2005, with the 
3,155 MT increase attributed largely to implementation of ISPM 15 for 
treatment of wood packaging material (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  The association of this increase with WPM was discussed earlier 
in this SEIS and is tenuous due to reporting inconsistencies (see pages  
13–14 of this SEIS).  Combining the two rough UNEP totals gives an 
aggregate WPM usage of 3,834 MT annually.  This usage value is towards 
the lower end of the range of the methyl bromide estimate (3,191 to 9,628 
MT per year) determined in this SEIS, but reporting to UNEP by member 
countries is often incomplete or delayed as discussed previously.  If one 
assumes that the complete implementation of compliance with ISPM 15 
for some countries was delayed until 2006, then the reported consumption 
data to UNEP in 2005 may not reflect actual usage from complete 
compliance.  However, most major trading countries were in compliance 
in 2005 and those countries did report usage to UNEP.  Any increased 
annual usage in 2006 to comply with ISPM 15 is unlikely to exceed the 
upper aggregate methyl bromide estimate (9,628 MT) determined for 
ISPM 15 compliance in this SEIS.          
 
The comparable aggregate projection for methyl bromide estimates in 
compliance with worldwide extension of the China Interim Rule, based 
upon this same analytical reasoning, provides a range of 3,443 to 
10,698 MT per year.  Similar issues of uncertainty to those expressed 
about the cumulative China compliance are

The comparable aggregate projection for methyl bromide estimates in 
compliance with worldwide extension of the China Interim Rule, based 
upon this same analytical reasoning, provides a range of 3,443 to 
10,698 MT per year.  Similar issues of uncertainty to those expressed 
about the cumulative China compliance are also applicable here.  This 
estimate is projected to pose a potential effect on stratospheric ozone 
above the 1980 levels that ranges from 0.47 to 1.5 percent annually.  
Although the aggregate impact from methyl bromide usage associated 
with this alternative is greater than for the preferred alternative, any 
potential impacts of this alternative would be counterbalanced in similar 
manner to that of the preferred alternative by the reductions in usage from 
the continuing phaseout of other uses. 
 
Aggregate methyl bromide estimates are not prepared for the remaining 
two alternatives.  As discussed in the comparison of alternatives section of 
this document, it is not reasonable to attempt to project an aggregate 
methyl bromide estimate for usage under the comprehensive risk reduction 
program alternative with the wide variability of methods.  Further, the 
alternative use of substitute packaging materials involves no fumigation 
with methyl bromide.

I.  Introduction 
 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) thanks all who 
reviewed the “Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material Draft 
Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement—February 
2007” (draft SEIS) and provided their comments on this document.  
APHIS welcomes public involvement and considers public perspectives in 
its decision processes.   
  
Copies of the draft SEIS were provided to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Federal Activities for their review and 
to announce availability of the draft supplement to the public.  EPA 
prepared a notice of availability of the draft SEIS which included 
provision for a public comment period from March 9 to April 23, 2007 
(March 9, 2007, 72 FR 10749, Docket No. ER-FRL-6684-7).  Interested 
parties requested that APHIS extend the comment period to provide 
additional time for technical review in writing (see page 1 footnote of 
public comment sent from State of California) and verbally (EPA, Office 
of Federal Activities).  APHIS granted an extension of the public comment 
period until June

FRL-6684-7).  Interested 
parties requested that APHIS extend the comment period to provide 
additional time for technical review in writing (see page 1 footnote of 
public comment sent from State of California) and verbally (EPA, Office 
of Federal Activities).  APHIS granted an extension of the public comment 
period until June 25, 2007 (May 25, 2007, 72 FR 29294, Docket No. 
APHIS–2006–0152).  The four public comments (including any 
attachments) that were received on the draft SEIS are available for review 
at the APHIS Reading Room and are reproduced in the third section of 
this appendix.   
 
Although this supplement focuses on the estimates of methyl bromide 
usage, there are a number of other technical issues related to the 
regulations that were expressed in the comment letters submitted to 
APHIS.  Those issues are addressed, along with the primary focus, to the 
extent that their potential environmental impact affects agency decisions 
to be made.  Comments from individual respondents are addressed and 
summarized, as provided in 40 CFR 1503.4.  The comment summaries are 
designed to concisely cover the issues and provide responses that clarify 
agency perspectives in the second section of this appendix.  Numerical 
changes related to use of methyl bromide are discussed here as well as in 
changes to the text from the draft SEIS and changes in appendix E.

II.  Summarization of Comments and 
 Responses 
 
For the ease of presentation and thoroughness of coverage, the issues from 
the comment responses are discussed in the order of their submission to 
APHIS and in the order of their occurrence within the individual 
comment.  The four review comments, in order of their receipt by APHIS, 
were sent from the National Wooden Pallet and Container Association 
(NWPCA), the State of California Department of Justice (on behalf of 
three States and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)), NRDC, 
and EPA, Office of Federal Activities.  With the limited number of 
responses received by APHIS, the topics are discussed focusing in greater 
detail on the technical issues within this SEIS to cover specific examples, 
where possible.  Some references provided in response letters lacked 
complete citations for which APHIS made an effort to locate the source 
documents, but not all cited literature references could be located.  The 
responses are complete to the extent that the analysts were able to find and 
review the documentation cited.  To minimize repetition of information, 
reference is made to the discussion of topics in the text, in response to 
other comments, and to previous environmental documentation for the 
Rule.

 to the discussion of topics in the text, in response to 
other comments, and to previous environmental documentation for the 
Rule.         
 A.  National Wooden Pallet and Container Association 
 
NWPCA’s comment is generally supportive of APHIS review and 
decisions. 
 
Comment:  NWPCA states that the draft SEIS continues to suggest that 
substitute packing materials have fewer environmental consequences.  
This cited statement refers strictly to the environmental impacts from 
component control methods themselves, and also indicates in the last 
phrase that there are unquantified impacts from the manufacturing 
processes of substitute packing materials. The FEIS does a thorough 
analysis of environmental impacts of wood packaging materials and 
substitute packaging materials, including plastics.  The FEIS does mention 
and provide reference to support issues including biodegradation, reuse, 
and recycling; however, this comment does raise additional issues not 
covered in the FEIS with specific regard to environmental impacts from 
the use of substitute packaging material including fire hazards of plastics 
versus wood packaging materials, and reduction of pest infestations in 
wood packaging materials since the adoption of the new pest elimination 
standards imposed by the industry.   
 
Response:  Although the new information presented in their comment 
regarding environmental impacts is valid, the associated impacts further 
justify APHIS’ analyses in support of this rulemaking.  In that the scope of 
 
A–4  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
the SEIS is limited to the refinement of methyl bromide estimates, further 
assessment of these other impacts is not presented.

 analyses in support of this rulemaking.  In that the scope of 
 
A–4  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
the SEIS is limited to the refinement of methyl bromide estimates, further 
assessment of these other impacts is not presented. 
 
Comment:  NWPCA suggested to APHIS a domestic standard for wood 
in response to infestations of EAB and Sirex wood wasp.  NWPCA 
suggested to USDA that all new or repaired wood packaging materials be 
treated, which would become a domestic standard compatible with 
international requirements.   
 
Response:  APHIS appreciates the interest of NWPCA in pest risk 
reduction of WPM for domestic use; however, this suggestion is beyond 
the scope of the SEIS and would most appropriately be addressed in a 
separate rulemaking specific to such an action. 
 
Although NWPCA states that “any suggestion or implication that 
substitute packing materials are environmentally advantageous for 
eradicating invasive species is totally unacceptable, impractical, and 
contrary to harmonized international law,” assessing the environmental 
impacts of all reasonable alternatives associated with this rulemaking is 
required to fulfill the requirements of NEPA. 
 
B.  Comments from the California Attorney General’s 
 Office, Illinois Attorney General’s Office, 
 Connecticut Attorney General’s Office, and NRDC 
 
Response:  Contrary to the perspective expressed in the first sentence of 
this comment letter, APHIS had reviewed and applied considerable factual 
information in the preparation of the original estimates of methyl bromide 
fumigation usage.  All information provided in the SEIS is supported by 
credible and peer reviewed sources that are referenced

, and NRDC 
 
Response:  Contrary to the perspective expressed in the first sentence of 
this comment letter, APHIS had reviewed and applied considerable factual 
information in the preparation of the original estimates of methyl bromide 
fumigation usage.  All information provided in the SEIS is supported by 
credible and peer reviewed sources that are referenced in the document.  
All credible sources of pertinent information relevant to the scope of the 
SEIS at the time of preparing the document were incorporated and utilized 
to support discussions and claims made within the document.   
 
Preparers of the SEIS are aware of the fact that the 2006 Scientific 
Assessment (NOAA et al., 2007) was finalized and released to the public 
in February, shortly after the draft SEIS was published; thus, the UNEP 
document was not available as a source for the draft SEIS.  However, the 
findings of this UNEP document are discussed and referenced in the final 
SEIS.    
 
The development of methods to apply the factual information to estimates 
of methyl bromide has occurred over a number of years and was discussed 
in some detail on pages 11 to 15 of the draft SEIS.  Independent of how 
much data was applied to the analysis of the original regulation, the 
determination of how much usage occurs from a given method (relative to  
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–5   
other available methods) was expected to be uncertain until compliance 
data were available from the industry and for those countries subject to 
quarantine requirements.  The monitoring of compliance with a given 
regulation is part of the ongoing regulatory process that allows APHIS to 
review and revise risk reduction strategies.  This compliance monitoring

other available methods) was expected to be uncertain until compliance 
data were available from the industry and for those countries subject to 
quarantine requirements.  The monitoring of compliance with a given 
regulation is part of the ongoing regulatory process that allows APHIS to 
review and revise risk reduction strategies.  This compliance monitoring 
involves collecting information that can be applied to supplement previous 
documentation when previous data are limited.  This is exactly what the 
SEIS does in its reevaluation and refinement of the methyl bromide 
estimates of the use in treatment of wood packing material.  The long-term 
resolution to the pest risk problems associated with wood packing material 
referred to on page v of the final EIS requires establishment of a baseline 
level of phytosanitary protection from which to determine the need for 
further refinement of wood packing material regulations.  Therefore, the 
SEIS constitutes another step in the ongoing review process at APHIS to 
develop a long-term resolution of the pest risks associated with wood 
packing materials.            
 
Response to Further Comment:  Although ALB is a quarantine wood 
pest that was introduced on Staten Island near port facilities, the fact that 
the source (e.g., port, natural spread, human movement of wood from 
adjacent infestations, or hitchhiking beetles) of this introduction is 
unknown makes it a poor justification that a more effective alternative 
than treated WPM should be required.  The suggestion that APHIS could 
have prevented the introduction of ALB on Staten Island by promulgating 
different regulations requires assumptions about the movement of ALB 
that have not been substantiated.

have prevented the introduction of ALB on Staten Island by promulgating 
different regulations requires assumptions about the movement of ALB 
that have not been substantiated.    
 
Comment:  In its first point, the comment letter claims that APHIS 
“improperly hides the environmental impacts of the increased methyl 
bromide use for fumigation by combining it with the potential reduction of 
methyl bromide for other purposes.”   
 
Response:  The data for methyl bromide estimates and environmental 
impacts from the wood packing regulation and each alternative were 
clearly presented on pages 24 to 30 of the draft SEIS.  The effects are 
assessed independent of the other potential reductions in methyl bromide 
use that have occurred as a result of the phaseout.  The direct impact of the 
Rule (from page 32) is projected to result in methyl bromide usage of 822 
to 2,351 MT annually that poses a potential range of 0.1 to 0.32 percent 
effect on annual depletion of stratospheric ozone above the 1980 baseline.   
 
The 42 percent reduction (27,094 MT) in worldwide consumption of 
methyl bromide over the last 10 years, from 63,960 MT in 1996 to 
36,866 MT in 2005, shows the effectiveness of the ongoing overall 
phaseout of methyl bromide (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  It is clear that the 
projected increases in usage of methyl bromide from the Rule do not 
increase usage to the extent that the usage is reduced by the phaseout

projected increases in usage of methyl bromide from the Rule do not 
increase usage to the extent that the usage is reduced by the phaseout.  If

A–6  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
one combines cumulative data for methyl bromide production associated 
with all wood packing material, as reported by UNEP (pages 13 to 14 of 
this SEIS), the total worldwide usage of methyl bromide attributed to 
WPM in 2005 amounts to only 3,834 MT annually.  This WPM 
application clearly involves less increased usage than the 27,094 MT 
reduction related to the phaseout; however, the impact to the stratospheric 
ozone from such continuing usage should not be interpreted to be 
negligible.  Nonetheless, it is clear that the relative contribution to the 
overall impact on the ozone layer is greater from other uses of methyl 
bromide and uses of other ozone-depleting substances. 
 
Comment:  Also, the first point suggests that the impact of other changes 
in use of methyl bromide and other ozone-depleting substances not 
associated with wood packing material need not be considered in the 
determination of impacts to overall stratospheric ozone in this EIS.   
 
Response:  The cumulative impact analysis under NEPA requires 
consideration of the influence of these other ozone-depleting substances 
on the stratospheric ozone layer.  The selection of the 1980 level of

 the 
determination of impacts to overall stratospheric ozone in this EIS.   
 
Response:  The cumulative impact analysis under NEPA requires 
consideration of the influence of these other ozone-depleting substances 
on the stratospheric ozone layer.  The selection of the 1980 level of 
stratospheric ozone as the baseline for full recovery of the ozone layer 
(NOAA et al., 2007; UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) is a worthy milestone; 
nevertheless, it does not guarantee full recovery of the ozone layer.  The 
2006 Scientific Assessment in the first line of the summary on page 6.1 
indicates that global ozone levels were already declining in the late 1970s 
due to anthropogenic releases of ozone-depleting substances (NOAA et 
al., 2007).  Although this same document projects conditions in the 
Antarctic stratosphere to return those preceding 1980 by around 2065 
(page xxxv of the Executive Summary of NOAA et al., 2007), that 
projection does not take into account the potential options for accelerating 
or hindering the recovery of the ozone layer (including phaseouts of QPS 
usage of methyl bromide and other presently unregulated uses of ozone-
depleting substances) shown in their table 1.  Independent of the milestone 
selected for the ozone layer recovery, use of other ozone-depleting 
substances will either increase or decrease effects to stratospheric ozone.  
Pages 29 to 32 in this final SEIS discuss the limitations of this type of 
projection.  The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for all compliance 
with ISPM 15 determined in this SEIS ranges from 3,191 to 9,628 MT 
annually (see page 37).

Pages 29 to 32 in this final SEIS discuss the limitations of this type of 
projection.  The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for all compliance 
with ISPM 15 determined in this SEIS ranges from 3,191 to 9,628 MT 
annually (see page 37).   
 
As indicated in the previous paragraph, the determination of effects on 
ozone are calculated relative to the 1980 baseline for stratospheric ozone 
levels.  As other ozone-depleting substances are phased out and degrade 
(including some substances with long half-lives), the elimination of the 
remaining uses will be associated with increasingly greater potential to 
recover the remaining ozone to the 1980 baseline level, so the potential 
effect as a percentage is subject to change over time, particularly as the 
impacts of the phaseout increase the stratospheric ozone levels.  This 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–7   
indicates that the potential effect on stratospheric ozone from the same 
usage of methyl bromide this year as in the previous 10 years would 
contribute to a higher percentage of depletion above the 1980 baseline 
than previously.  The UNEP Scientific Assessments of Ozone Depletion 
continue to track the recovery and science of ozone depletion.  The 
Executive Summary for the WHO/UNEP “Scientific Assessment of Ozone 
Depletion: 2006” was released August 18, 2006; however, the entire 
assessment, including supporting chapters (NOAA et al., 2007), was not 
available until February 2007.  The draft SEIS was in the process of being 
printed in February at the time of release of their complete assessment;

assessment, including supporting chapters (NOAA et al., 2007), was not 
available until February 2007.  The draft SEIS was in the process of being 
printed in February at the time of release of their complete assessment; 
consequently, the complete information was not available to update the 
draft SEIS.  However, APHIS has since recalculated impacts in the final 
SEIS to account for the determined 33 percent increase in effectiveness 
(from 45 to 60) of bromine relative to chlorine in global ozone depletion 
potential on a per-atom basis.  In addition, other refinements to the 
calculations from this scientific assessment and from the 2006 UNEP, 
MBTOC assessment (published March 15, 2007) were made to update the 
methyl bromide estimates and their potential impacts based upon the 
present state of the ozone layer.  Based upon the above discussion, it is 
anticipated that further refinements will continue as the science improves 
and recovery of the ozone layer progresses. 
 
Comment:  The second comment suggests that the incomplete 
compliance data precludes the ability of APHIS to reach a viable 
conclusion.   
 
Response:  It is noteworthy that APHIS had considerably less data upon 
which to base their risk calculations and environmental assessment at the 
time of the China Interim Rule and other previous wood regulations than 
we have now.  Appendix E of the final SEIS has been expanded to clarify 
methods and the compliance data reported to APHIS.  The calculations 
have consistently been designed to avoid underestimation of methyl 
bromide usage, and the reporting that has been submitted to UNEP has

im Rule and other previous wood regulations than 
we have now.  Appendix E of the final SEIS has been expanded to clarify 
methods and the compliance data reported to APHIS.  The calculations 
have consistently been designed to avoid underestimation of methyl 
bromide usage, and the reporting that has been submitted to UNEP has 
been within or below the range determined by our calculations.  In the 
assessment of China in the draft and final SEIS, the analyses intentionally 
selected the fumigation of already loaded cargo as the treatment for 
calculations to ensure that the methyl bromide estimate was not 
underestimated for this country.  In addition, it adjusted the analysis to 
account for their practice of sealing containers for fumigation rather than 
tarping containers that is more conventionally practiced elsewhere.  
Knowledge of this practice in China would not have been determined if 
APHIS did not continue to monitor their compliance and seek more 
complete information about their methyl bromide usage during the last 
few years.  This practice was discussed on pages 20 to 21 of the draft SEIS 
and is discussed on page 24 of the final SEIS.

A–8  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
The reported methyl bromide consumption from China to UNEP in 2005 
(table 3.13 on page 53 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) amounted to 841 MT for 
regulated uses, so a noteworthy amount of their consumption is not used 
for QPS.  Of the 13,815 MT of methyl bromide used for QPS worldwide 
in 2005, only 978 MT of methyl bromide are estimated to be used for 
durable goods such as wood packaging material (table 3

OC, 2007) amounted to 841 MT for 
regulated uses, so a noteworthy amount of their consumption is not used 
for QPS.  Of the 13,815 MT of methyl bromide used for QPS worldwide 
in 2005, only 978 MT of methyl bromide are estimated to be used for 
durable goods such as wood packaging material (table 3.15 on page 57 of 
UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The projected methyl bromide estimates for 
wood packing material for China in the final SEIS range from 2,232 to 
6,893 MT which exceeds the UNEP data by a substantial margin.  From 
the usage reported to UNEP, there is no clear basis to suggest that 
substantially greater usage occurs through imports or remaining stock.  
The total production of methyl bromide in 2005 was 37,923 MT (table 3.2 
on page 31 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007); however, the overall consumption 
was 36,866 MT of methyl bromide in 2005 (page 57 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  This indicates only about 1,000 MT not consumed in the same 
year as production.  This is comparable to remaining stocks from other 
recent years.  The reported quantities do not suggest that large stocks or 
imports are being used to meet ISPM 15 in China.  
 
The final EIS, on page 16, discusses inspections of WPM and the results 
of monitoring.  APHIS, in its consideration of the China Interim Rule, 
took into consideration the existence of some fraudulent certification by 
focusing early inspection on WPM from China.  The compliance study in 
1998, cited on page 16 of the final EIS, found China to lack treatment in

, discusses inspections of WPM and the results 
of monitoring.  APHIS, in its consideration of the China Interim Rule, 
took into consideration the existence of some fraudulent certification by 
focusing early inspection on WPM from China.  The compliance study in 
1998, cited on page 16 of the final EIS, found China to lack treatment in 
only 0.7 to 0.9 percent of the shipments and incorrect treatment in only 
0.05 to 0.2 percent of the shipments.  Although comparable studies have 
not been reported for more recent years, there is no inspection data to 
suggest that their compliance has either improved or declined.   
 
Other than compliance since the China Interim Rule, the final SEIS has a 
lack of compliance data for 65 other countries that account for about 
3.6 percent of the U.S. Customs entries in 2005.  This list, along with the 
compliance information for other countries, are described in part of 
appendix E of the final SEIS.  Fumigation of WPM from these countries is 
assumed to occur by tarping containers with already loaded cargo.  As 
with the China calculations, this results in a conservatively high estimate 
for methyl bromide for these countries.  The remainder of the countries 
that export to the United States have either provided complete information 
about their manner of compliance or sufficient data were available 
regarding their compliance provided by them or from UNEP reporting to 
prepare an informed analysis.

Comment:  The third comment suggests that APHIS, in the draft SEIS, 
precludes substitute packaging consideration.   
 
Response:  On page 5 of the  draft SEIS, it states, “In accordance with 
applicable international agreements, APHIS does consider in its 
3.  Point 3 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–9   
regulations governing phytosanitary issues in trade if those measures are 
transparent, technically justified, and no more restrictive of trade than 
necessary to achieve an appropriate level of phytosanitary protection. 
…Should it become evident that the us age of methyl bromide fumigation 
in the treatment of WPM is no longer needed by developing countries in 
order to meet phytosanitary requirements (due to increased availability of 
substitute packaging materials and other treatment measures in all affected 
countries), and that the elimination of methyl bromide fumigation is ‘not 
more trade restrictive than required to achieve [an] appropriate level of 
sanitary or phytosanitary protection,’ as is specified by provisions of the 
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreements of the World Trade Organization, 
then APHIS will consider further rulemaking for WPM (e.g., substitute 
packaging).  Thus, the claim made in the above stated comment 
inaccurately suggests that APHIS interprets “no more restrictive” to mean 
that the usage of an alternative method must be widespread for a switch to 
be permitted.

then APHIS will consider further rulemaking for WPM (e.g., substitute 
packaging).  Thus, the claim made in the above stated comment 
inaccurately suggests that APHIS interprets “no more restrictive” to mean 
that the usage of an alternative method must be widespread for a switch to 
be permitted.   
 
As stated in the text on page 5 of the draft SEIS (and quoted above), 
APHIS considers any alternative (including substitute packaging) for 
regulation presented in this rulemaking to be “more trade restrictive” if it 
is not feasible for equitable implementation in all countries and 
particularly for those developing countries whose trade could be restricted 
by the implementation.  Further, the costs of the alternative limited to 
substitute packaging materials (e.g., plastics) in these developing countries 
are likely to exceed those in developed countries due to costs of importing 
the raw materials for manufacturing or of those packing materials already 
constructed.  
 
Contrary to the view that APHIS can impose any regulations that it wants, 
the IPPC requires that new regulations be technically justified first.  The 
quarantine pests (bark beetles) of concern to Australia and New Zealand 
do not necessarily mirror those of concern to APHIS, nor do their methods 
necessarily achieve the same level of phytosanitary protection for every 
country.  The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service has not yet 
submitted their technical justification for required debarking.  In the 
absence of their technical justification, the NPPOs of other countries are 
not obligated to apply the more stringent applications proposed.

The scope of the draft SEIS was to reevaluate and refine the methyl 
bromide estimates from the FEIS.  The refinement of methyl bromide 
estimates was initiated because of the availability of new information, and 
this refinement was promised in the FEIS.  The assessment of the 
alternative to phaseout methyl bromide and adopt the use of alternative 
packaging materials has not changed substantially.  The lack of definition 
for the phaseout/phase-in period, suggested from comments, show the 
limited basis available for regulatory decisionmaking.  Cost aspects related 
to this rulemaking were thoroughly assessed in the associated regulatory

impact analysis (USDA, APHIS, 2004).  The fact that substitute packing 
materials make up only about 5 percent of the U.S. market for packing 
materials (FEIS on pages 41 and 80) and plastic pallets only comprise 
8 percent of the European pallet market indicates that such materials are 
not and, for the foreseeable future, will not be the dominant share of the 
market in developed countries, let alone developing countries.  It is to the 
benefit of industry groups, such as RPM Technologies, to provide 
optimistic projections about future market share to their customers and 
stockholders; however, sound decisions for enforceable regulations require 
consideration of all information, including contrary information from the

optimistic projections about future market share to their customers and 
stockholders; however, sound decisions for enforceable regulations require 
consideration of all information, including contrary information from the 
wood packing industry (see public comments from NWPCA).  Many 
developing countries still depend on wood packaging materials for pallets 
due to the low cost and accessibility of wood.  Thus, the assumed increase 
in plastic pallet market share and use is not sufficient to suggest that 
plastic pallet use should be adopted as standard packaging material 
worldwide, because it is not a feasible alternative for many nations. 
 
Comment:  The fourth comment states that the draft SEIS did not 
adequately identify and discuss the worldwide and collateral effects of the 
WPM rule.  The comment indicates a lack of satisfaction with the point in 
time estimates referred to in the draft SEIS at page 11.   
 
Response:  Information was sought by APHIS for methyl bromide usage 
and methods of treatment from NPPOs of certain countries.  Conservative 
estimates were used to account for information that was not available for 
some countries.  The SEIS does make reference to and incorporates the 
increase of trade since the FEIS into its refined methyl bromide 
calculations.  The draft SEIS states, on page iv of the Executive Summary, 
that “although the refined estimates determined for this supplement more 
accurately portray the range of methyl bromide used for ISPM 15 
compliance than previous estimates, the dynamic nature of trade and 
compliance with trade-related regulations result in the ongoing need for 
review because this information reflects only the most recent information 
received.  The availability of

that “although the refined estimates determined for this supplement more 
accurately portray the range of methyl bromide used for ISPM 15 
compliance than previous estimates, the dynamic nature of trade and 
compliance with trade-related regulations result in the ongoing need for 
review because this information reflects only the most recent information 
received.  The availability of information about compliance by exporters 
in some countries is still lacking, and for these countries, this supplement 
applies conservative assumptions designed to err in favor of 
overestimating their methyl bromide usage.”  Thus, the draft SEIS takes 
into consideration the issues mentioned in this comment and addresses 
them in the document appropriately. 
 
It is noteworthy that other analytical documents making projections use 
data for specific points in time for their projections.  For example, the 
2006 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion selected the end of 2006 
as their point for projections of elimination of emissions from ozone-
depleting substances (page xxxvi of NOAA et al., 2007).  No effort was 
made by the UNEP scientists to quantitatively speculate on how 
anthropogenic use will or will not change with human activity after 2006, 
4.  Point 4 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–11   
so it is likewise not appropriate for the SEIS to attempt to estimate future 
anthropogenic use beyond present data.   
 
Comment:  The comment also expressed concern with the discussion of 
collateral impact analysis, as mentioned on page 29 of the draft SEIS.   
 
Response:  As was indicated in the draft SEIS at page 29, “The lack of

Comment:  The comment also expressed concern with the discussion of 
collateral impact analysis, as mentioned on page 29 of the draft SEIS.   
 
Response:  As was indicated in the draft SEIS at page 29, “The lack of 
reliable data about the amount of world trade among countries other than 
the United States and associated WPM with that trade makes any 
cumulative analysis speculative and, therefore, the aggregate methyl 
bromide estimates and effects for each alternatives in this SEIS are limited 
to the relative effects of imports to and exports from the United States.”   
If one looks at the cumulative data for the methyl bromide associated with 
all wood packing material as reported by UNEP (MBTOC, 2007) and 
discussed on pages 13 to 14 of this SEIS, the potential annual worldwide 
usage amounts to 3,834 MT in 2005.  Comparing this figure to the 
conservative aggregate projection in this SEIS (3,191 to 9,628 MT per 
year) indicates that the additional usage by other countries is covered 
within the overall range projection.  For export from countries such as 
South Korea, there was usage allowance projected to account for 
uncertainty (see table 3–1).    
 
Comment:  This comment suggests that APHIS did not provide adequate 
information to make a fair assessment of the accuracy of methyl bromide 
estimates.   
 
Response:  The draft SEIS, on pages 17 to 22, provides questions asked of 
foreign NPPOs, their responses for methyl bromide and heat treatment 
usage, their method of application to wood packaging materials, and the 
country that the information represents.  The information obtained from

Response:  The draft SEIS, on pages 17 to 22, provides questions asked of 
foreign NPPOs, their responses for methyl bromide and heat treatment 
usage, their method of application to wood packaging materials, and the 
country that the information represents.  The information obtained from 
foreign NPPOs was used to refine methyl bromide estimates in the draft 
SEIS.  For uncertain information and/or in the absence of more definitive 
information from NPPOs, estimates in the draft SEIS remain 
conservatively high. 
 
In the draft SEIS at page 25, a footnote in table 3–1 states that the “Other 
Countries” refers to “those countries for which compliance data are 
lacking and those countries strictly complying by heat treatment of wood 
packaging material.”  To assist the reader, the countries are listed by 
category in appendix E of the final SEIS.  “Other Countries” consists of 
the 139 countries reported to only heat treat WPM or use substitute 
packing material, and the 65 countries lacking compliance data and 
assumed to fumigate with methyl bromide.  The percentage of U.S. 
Customs entries in 2005 is also provided for each category.

A–12  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
fumigated with methyl bromide annually are not available for import 
entries to the United States so estimates for all countries other than 
Nicaragua are calculated using U.S. Customs entry.”  There is no evidence 
to suggest that U.S. Customs data are lacking reliability or accuracy.  
Further the U.S. Customs entry data is collected for all entries and no 
change in the collection of that data has occurred.  The general import data 
are not collected by Agricultural Specialists/Inspectors at the U.S. 
Customs Service, so the cited reference to vulnerability from foreign pests 
and diseases pertaining to agricultural specialists does not relate to the 
collection of overall import data contrary to the statement in this comment 
provided. 
 
Comment:  This comment questions the variation of methyl bromide 
production and consumption data between the draft SEIS and that cited by 
MBTOC and UNEP.   
 
Response:  The variation in data is expected because the years of data 
referenced in the comment are between 5 and 8 years old and much has 
changed in methyl bromide production and consumption since that time.  
Further, the MBTOC data, cited in the comment, includes all QPS uses, as 
opposed to the draft SEIS, which limited methyl bromide estimates to 
wood packaging material only.  Thus, the difference in methyl bromide 
usage relates to different overall uses.  As was discussed previously on 
pages 13 to 14 of this SEIS, the methyl bromide production (UNEP, 
MBT

 QPS uses, as 
opposed to the draft SEIS, which limited methyl bromide estimates to 
wood packaging material only.  Thus, the difference in methyl bromide 
usage relates to different overall uses.  As was discussed previously on 
pages 13 to 14 of this SEIS, the methyl bromide production (UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007) indicates 3,834 MT in 2005.  This compares favorably 
with the aggregate methyl bromide range estimate from 3,191 to 9,628 
MT per year in this SEIS.   
 
Comment:  “APHIS further fails to account for potential increase in usage 
based on the limited efficacy of the current methyl bromide fumigation 
schedule.”   
 
Response:  This comment assumes that the expressed concern of the IPPC 
contracting parties that the methyl bromide treatment schedule did not 
achieve the desired reduction in pest risk was a result of “APHIS’ 
estimates.”  It is stated on page 6 of the draft SEIS that the only IPPC 
approved revision since the initial methyl bromide fumigation treatment 
schedule of Annex I of ISPM 15 was to change the proposed minimum 
time required to maintain concentrations of methyl bromide within the 
fumigation enclosure.  Discussion of the lack of change in dosage rate 
indicates that methyl bromide usage would not change.  The revised 
treatment schedules are designed to eliminate pest risk without the need 
for additional usage of methyl bromide.  The FEIS, on pages 64 to 66, 
discusses the capacity for pest mitigation of ISPM 15 relative to other 
alternatives and this issue is not revisited in the SEIS.

treatment schedules are designed to eliminate pest risk without the need 
for additional usage of methyl bromide.  The FEIS, on pages 64 to 66, 
discusses the capacity for pest mitigation of ISPM 15 relative to other 
alternatives and this issue is not revisited in the SEIS.    
 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–13   
Comment:  The sixth comment suggests that APHIS makes no attempt to 
account for or estimate possible fraud in reporting, especially from China.  
This comment assumes that a high estimate for China, in the draft SEIS on 
page 19, must mean that there is massive fraud in reporting.  This 
comment presumes that some shippers are not treating rather than some 
are treating prior to loading or heat treating.   
 
Response:  Although one can use any of several speculations on the 
manner of or lack of compliance with ISPM 15, the draft SEIS was 
prepared to make reasonably accurate usage estimates for methyl bromide 
and not review the compliance history.  The issue of fraud in reporting, 
especially from China, was covered in the WPM FEIS on page 16 under 
this issue of compliance.  Further, compliance with recycling and repair 
does not automatically mean lack of proper treatment.

Comment:  NRDC suggests that APHIS has not regarded the methyl 
bromide estimate as related to their rulemaking.   
 
Response:  The estimates of methyl bromide usage have been an integral 
part of every EA and EIS that has been prepared for agency applications 
of this fumigant.  APHIS does not consider reevaluation and refinement of 
previous estimates to be a trite exercise, but seeks to continue to improve 
on the previous risk assessments.  In those import regulations where there 
are more than one available means to fulfill treatment requirements, there 
will always be uncertainty about how the exporters from other countries 
will decide to meet those requirements.  APHIS is primarily concerned 
that the decision can be informed in regards to potential risks from each 
treatment method or alternative, and there is no evidence that previous 
documentation was not adequate.     
 
Comment:  The draft supplemental EIS does not reflect current scientific 
information on methyl bromide’s risk to the ozone layer. 
 
Response:  As was pointed out in a previous comment response, the draft 
SEIS was prepared at a time when only the UNEP Executive Summary 
(released August 18, 2006) was available; however, the entire assessment, 
including supporting chapters (NOAA et al., 2007), was not released until 
February 2007 when the draft SEIS was at print.  Therefore, the draft SEIS 
did not have the complete information from which to adjust its analyses.  
However, APHIS has since recalculated the estimates and impacts in the 
final SEIS based upon this document and other more recent publications.

However, APHIS has since recalculated the estimates and impacts in the

As was pointed out in our response to earlier comments, the percentages 
cited by UNEP relate to their selection of the 1980 level of stratospheric 
ozone as the baseline for full recovery of the ozone layer.  Conditions in

the Antarctic stratosphere are projected to return to those preceding 1980 
by around 2065 (page xxxv of NOAA et al., 2007).  As other ozone-
depleting substances are phased out and degrade or are removed from the 
atmosphere, the level of stratospheric ozone will increasingly approach the 
1980 baseline level.  The remainder of ozone-depleting chemicals in use 
will either delay the recovery to that level or prevent recovery to higher 
concentrations than in 1980.  There was clear evidence that global ozone 
levels were already declining in the late 1970s due to anthropogenic 
releases of ozone-depleting substances (page 6.1 of NOAA et al., 2007).  
Just as the previously cited 1-percent effect from methyl bromide is 
presently outdated, the percentage reductions cited in table 1 will change 
as recovery of the ozone layer occurs, and better understanding of the 
atmospheric science occurs.  Those reductions in table 1 are cited as 
potential options for accelerating the recovery of the ozone layer to 1980

 from methyl bromide is 
presently outdated, the percentage reductions cited in table 1 will change 
as recovery of the ozone layer occurs, and better understanding of the 
atmospheric science occurs.  Those reductions in table 1 are cited as 
potential options for accelerating the recovery of the ozone layer to 1980 
baseline levels (page xxxvi of NOAA et al., 2007).  The reductions would 
occur in addition to the recovery that is already projected from the 
phaseout of other ozone-depleting substances.  Based upon current 
understanding, the percentages in reduction cited in table 1 will increase 
commensurate with any increases in stratospheric ozone from the present 
phaseout until full recovery of the ozone layer occurs (1980 baseline 
levels of ozone are reached), and will decrease commensurate with any 
decreases in consumption of the compound or compound group until 
complete phaseout occurs.  Table 1 reductions are only related to a 
hypothetical end to production and emissions after 2006; however, the 
numerical determinations in the table do provide a good snapshot of the 
overall impact from methyl bromide usage.    
 
It must be kept in mind that the impact from use of some ozone-depleting 
compounds extends for long periods after their use has ceased due to long 
half-lives in the atmosphere.  The half-life of methyl bromide is relatively 
short (0.7 year) and the benefits to ozone recovery (5 percent cited in  
table 1) from phaseout would occur within a few years; however, other 
reductions in use of ozone-depleting substances do not necessarily result 
in such rapid removal from the atmosphere.  In theory, recovery of the

table 1) from phaseout would occur within a few years; however, other 
reductions in use of ozone-depleting substances do not necessarily result 
in such rapid removal from the atmosphere.  In theory, recovery of the 
ozone layer should occur by 2065 with or without further restrictions on 
unregulated uses.  However, “the return of ozone to pre-1980 levels” by 
2065 is not certain due to changes in the atmosphere since 1980 (page 6.1 
of NOAA et al., 2007).  The influence of global warming agents and other 
compounds on atmospheric conditions creates uncertainty about the rate 
and time required for recovery of ozone from the various scenarios 
considered by UNEP.  APHIS does discuss and consider this information 
in the text of the final SEIS.      
 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–15   
Comment:  This comment suggests that the primary factor in increased 
QPS production relates to compliance with ISPM 15. 
 
Response:  In using reported information, one must take care in placing 
weight on numerical figures.  Although the UNEP, MBTOC report (2007) 
at page 58 attributes the increased consumption of methyl bromide in 2005 
for QPS usage largely to compliance with ISPM 15, some uses reported to 
UNEP were reclassified by EPA as QPS for the first time in 2005 (see 
pages 13 to 14 and 37 of the final SEIS).  In particular, the QPS reporting 
by the United States in 2005 reclassified some critical use exemptions as 
QPS based upon export preshipment requirements.  This amounted to 

Text Len: 1592
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, some uses reported to 
UNEP were reclassified by EPA as QPS for the first time in 2005 (see 
pages 13 to 14 and 37 of the final SEIS).  In particular, the QPS reporting 
by the United States in 2005 reclassified some critical use exemptions as 
QPS based upon export preshipment requirements.  This amounted to 
inclusion of an additional 1,209 MT of methyl bromide (which in previous 
years was part of critical use exemption reporting) listed as QPS in their 
2005 reporting to UNEP (EPA, OPP, 2005).  This 1,209 MT increase in 
QPS reporting by the United States in 2005 for articles other than WPM 
could account for over one-third of the total increase in QPS cited by 
UNEP (3,155 MT).  Such changes in classification for reporting purposes 
by various countries may even account for more of the increased 
reporting.  Although it is reasonable to expect some increased usage of 
methyl bromide to comply with ISPM 15, the UNEP document does not 
clearly break down how much increase related to different categories of 
QPS in 2005.  Their reporting has not required reporting the breakdown of 
QPS by category.  However, many countries were complying with ISPM 
15 in 2005 and those countries using methyl bromide to treat wood 
packing material would be expected to report greater usage of methyl 
bromide to UNEP.  Combining the quantity of methyl bromide associated 
with wood packing materials in 2004 (679 MT determined from page 12 
of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) with the 3,155 MT attributed to WPM in 2005 
gives a total amount of 3,834 MT annually.  This amount could be

 to UNEP.  Combining the quantity of methyl bromide associated 
with wood packing materials in 2004 (679 MT determined from page 12 
of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) with the 3,155 MT attributed to WPM in 2005 
gives a total amount of 3,834 MT annually.  This amount could be 
adjusted for the U.S. changes in reporting in 2005 to amount to 2,625 MT 
annually.  However, when the effort is made to account for all such 
changes, the association between numerical changes and specific uses is 
not clear.  The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for compliance with 
ISPM 15 in the final SEIS (page 37) ranges from 3,191 to 9,628 MT per 
year.  The UNEP numbers are not outside this projected range if one 
anticipates some increased usage in 2006 as additional countries comply 
with ISPM 15; however, there is no reason to assume that such increases 
would continue, particularly when most countries are not showing 
preference for fumigation with methyl bromide over the use of heat 
treatment or substitute packing materials.  To establish a clear trend in 
usage, the data need to be specific to methyl bromide treatment of WPM, 
and the occurrence needs to be based upon more than one data point.  Any 
long-term trend can not be established from the present data of UNEP or is 
at best tenuous.

increasing the initial methyl bromide charge cited by UNEP (MBTOC, 
2007) in the final SEIS.  Any effects from this occurrence and the 
retreatment, in places like Australia, should become evident in future 
reporting to UNEP.  The indication of under-representation of wood 
products as a proportion of QPS fumigation (page 287 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007) seems reasonably likely, given the other reporting problems 
described above and in the text.  Reported amounts are less than our 
methyl bromide estimates, so such statements indicating under-
representation of reported use of methyl bromide for wood products to 
UNEP are consistent with our analysis.   
 
APHIS is continuing to work with other countries to develop methods that 
are compatible with their packing needs as part of coordination with other 
countries through the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC).  It 
is desirable for those less developed countries and smaller WPM 
companies using methyl bromide to convert over to heat treatment or use 
substitute materials in their compliance.  APHIS is committed to work 
with the IPPC on decreasing pest risk in packing materials in a manner 
that lowers other environmental impacts.  Part of this commitment 
involves working on a draft International Standard for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) for “Develop

with the IPPC on decreasing pest risk in packing materials in a manner 
that lowers other environmental impacts.  Part of this commitment 
involves working on a draft International Standard for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) for “Developing A Strategy To Reduce Or Replace The 
Use of Methyl Bromide for Phytosanitary Purposes.”  This standard has 
been under review since June 2007 by the contracting parties to the IPPC.   
 
Comment:  The comment cites inconsistent and missing QPS usage data 
reported to UNEP regarding methyl bromide usage.   
 
Response:  This is exactly the reason that APHIS does not depend upon 
their reporting as the primary basis for quantitation, but uses it mainly as a 
cross-check of the information collected through NPPOs.   
 
This issue is partly covered in response to point 5 from the California 
Attorney General’s Office and others.  The breakdown by country is 
presented in appendix E by category.  Use of method 1 applies to the 
usage of methyl bromide by those 65 countries lacking compliance data 
that are assumed to fumigate with methyl bromide.  Method 2 strictly 
applies to China.  Method 3 applies to Canada, Mexico, and the 
22 countries providing some data about fumigating WPM with methyl 
bromide to comply with APHIS regulations.  Method 4 strictly applies to 
Hong Kong.  Method 5 applies only to Japan which indicated fumigation 
prior to assembly of WPM.  For China, Hong Kong, and the 65 countries

Hong Kong.  Method 5 applies only to Japan which indicated fumigation 
prior to assembly of WPM.  For China, Hong Kong, and the 65 countries 
analyzed under method 1 where compliance data are lacking, the analysis 
applied half of their WPM to heat treatment and half to fumigation with 
methyl bromide.  Method 4 applies to Hong Kong and involves 
“Treatment of Assembled WPM in Sealed Containers Before Loading of 
Cargo,” not treatment before assembly (see page D–5 of the draft SEIS.  
The basis for this method is explained on page 21 of the draft SEIS and

related to representative treatment from the origin of many shipments 
there.  These methods are designed to provide a conservatively high 
estimate for those countries where data are lacking.  Where more 
information was available, more refined calculations were used in the 
SEIS’ refinement of methyl bromide estimates. 
 
APHIS does acknowledge that there are alternate options to methyl 
bromide; however, APHIS has limited regulatory authority independent of 
formal justification to the IPPC.  Further, there are several issues to 
address prior to requiring alternative treatments to methyl bromide (e.g., 
cost comparisons, environmental impacts, durability, etc.).  Any shipping 
requirements implemented in this regard would need to continue to

address prior to requiring alternative treatments to methyl bromide (e.g., 
cost comparisons, environmental impacts, durability, etc.).  Any shipping 
requirements implemented in this regard would need to continue to 
facilitate trade and be equally feasible for both developed and developing 
countries. 
 
Comment:  Part of the comment suggests the use of recycle and recapture 
technologies by which methyl bromide emissions can be captured and 
removed prior to release following treatments.   
 
Response:  Recycle and recapture technologies may have the ability to 
reduce methyl bromide emissions; however, the cost of such systems must 
be assessed to determine the feasibility of such systems for all shipping 
countries.  This was discussed briefly on page 62 in the FEIS.  Also, the 
assessment of such systems would need to be initiated in a proposed 
rulemaking outside of this SEIS.  
 
Comment:  The comment also mentions Japan’s proposal to use a mixture 
to treat wood packaging material which includes sulfuryl fluoride, methyl 
isothiocyanate, and methyl iodide.   
 
Response:  There are many potential alternatives to methyl bromide; 
however, they have not been adopted for use in place of methyl bromide 
for various reasons.  Although sulfuryl fluoride may not pose the same 
harmful ozone depleting effects as methyl bromide, it may not provide the 
efficacy necessary to eliminate all life stages (including egg stage) for pest 
risks of concern.  Similarly, methyl isothiocyanate and methyl iodide 
require further efficacy data

for various reasons.  Although sulfuryl fluoride may not pose the same 
harmful ozone depleting effects as methyl bromide, it may not provide the 
efficacy necessary to eliminate all life stages (including egg stage) for pest 
risks of concern.  Similarly, methyl isothiocyanate and methyl iodide 
require further efficacy data to determine if they are sufficient candidates 
for the treatment of wood packaging material to prevent U.S. wood pests 
of concern (e.g., ALB).  In addition, the environmental characteristics of 
these pesticides need further consideration.  For example, sulfuryl fluoride 
is known to contribute to global warming on the order of 25,000 times the 
global warming potential of carbon dioxide (Dervos and Vassiliou, 2000 
as cited in Knight, 2004).  Contributing to another global problem 
(atmospheric warming) to reduce a different global impact (ozone 
depletion) is probably not an appropriate solution.  Moreover, this SEIS is 
limited to the refinement of methyl bromide estimates and, thus, the

Response:  The claim made in the paper expresses one opinion and has 
been reviewed by APHIS managers.   
 
Comment:  The comment also discusses treatment failure rates and 
technical justification for Australia’s standard.   
 
Response:  The pests of quarantine significance to Australia differ from 
those of concern to the United States, so it is difficult to ascertain what 
actually applies to APHIS regulations.     
 
Comment:  In their comment citing a study by Burgess (2005) and Allen 
(2001b), question is raised over the limited acceptable confirmation for 
treatments.  However, there are several requirements for ensuring that 
compliance with treatments are achieved (e.g., IPPC container markings).   
 
Response:  APHIS is concerned with compliance with our regulations and 
did consider this issue in early rulemaking.  This was part of the reason for 
conducting the compliance study of China cited on page 16 of the FEIS.  
Further, ongoing monitoring of pest interceptions allows for continuing 
assessment of how effective and how well treatment requirements are 
being adhered to.  APHIS, in early deliberations, recognized the potential 
for some fraud and continues to work with NPPOs of other countries to 
ensure that treatments of packing materials adhere to our regulatory 
requirements.

The burning of fossil fuels produces air pollution and carbon dioxide (C02), which is a

process, trces remove large quanii tics of cubon dioxide from the ahnosphcre and slore it in their

Inen a lrcc is cut down, 111e carbon it slored during its life cycle is retained within its 
ccllular structure. The h'westing of trces and manufacturing of forest products transfers the 
carbon from the forests Lo wood products likc pallets and containers. Those wood shpping 
platforms, store carbon for long periods of time. Altcmative materials - especially 
pctrochcn~ical byproducts - cannot compete with wood in this environnltntal arena.

fhe colwmus of thc international Plan1 Protection Organizations (PPO) was that there 
would be two allowsblc treatment methods that had been determine.. to be eMective in the 
elimination of invasivc species - heat treatment and fumigation with Mcthyl Bromide. At the 
request and urging of APHIS USDA, NWPCA was designated as the manaser of the fumigation 
program with the American Lumbcr Standards Committee (ALSC) taking on the supervising rolc 
Tor heat treatment. 
From the outset, NWPCA viewed the fumigation program as lirnitcd, and probably 
temporary, as far as United States wood packaging production is concemcd. The use of Methyl 
Bromide is necessary a1 this time for many of the less developed participating countries in the

’ JOINT SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
1
INTRODUCTION
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a procedural statute that requires an 
agency, before committing to a major federal action, to carefully and objectively analyze the
environmental consequences of the action and all reasonable alternatives to it.  APHIS concedes
that it failed to take this required “hard look” when it based its estimate of global methyl bromide 
usage that will result from the challenged Rule on an assumption that was not only unfounded, 
but flatly contradicted by a key document that the agency possessed at the time of its rulemaking, 
yet failed to review.  
To cure this material NEPA violation, APHIS proposes to revise its methyl bromide 
estimate and, depending on the outcome, prepare either an “environmental assessment” or a 
“supplemental” environmental impact statement (EIS) based on the revised estimate.  See Ltr.
from Michael J. Garcia to U.S. District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna (June 21, 2006).1  APHIS 
thus purports to “remedy” its baseless methyl bromide estimate by performing a new analysis 
now – and if the numbers work out the same, no harm, no foul.  APHIS will simply note its 
findings in an environmental assessment, which involves a more cursory analysis and less 
opportunity for public comment than a full EIS, and conclude that the agency’s decision to adopt
the Rule was right all along.  
This is not the process that NEPA prescribes.  First, correction of APHIS’s failure to

opportunity for public comment than a full EIS, and conclude that the agency’s decision to adopt
the Rule was right all along.  
This is not the process that NEPA prescribes.  First, correction of APHIS’s failure to 
properly evaluate the environmental consequences of an action in an EIS warrants the re-
evaluation of those environmental consequences in nothing short of a new EIS.2  Second, the 
   
1 APHIS also seeks an order declaring plaintiffs’ claims with regard to the methyl bromide issue mooted based on 
its concession and voluntary remand.  A claim is moot only when no effective relief for the alleged violation can be 
given.  See Fund for Animals v. Babbit, 89 F.3d 128, 133 (2d Cir. 1996); see also Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. 
Alexander, 303 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002).  Because plaintiffs challenge APHIS’s proposed remedy, the 
methyl bromide claim is not moot.
2 A supplemental EIS (SEIS) is actually the same as a new EIS.  Whether an environmental impact statement is 
deemed “supplemental” or “new” is inconsequential; both require a reconsideration of the decision to adopt the Rule

 this issue from the other faults in the EIS is improper.  Precedent dictates that 
the Court review the current EIS as a whole, rather than address its defects on a piecemeal basis.  
This ensures that on remand APHIS will address the full scope of the current EIS’s deficiencies, 
thereby promoting judicial and administrative efficiency, as well as minimizing the ability of the 
agency to paper over individual defects so as to adhere to its original decision.  Consequently, 
before imposing any remedy, the Court should examine the entire EIS and decide plaintiffs’ 
summary judgment motion, which has been fully briefed.  
APHIS’s concession also casts doubt on APHIS’s analysis of other issues in the EIS, and 
underscores plaintiffs’ concern that the EIS is merely a post-hoc rationalization of a regulation 
that APHIS had firmly committed to before conducting the required NEPA review.  The Court is 
thus justified in taking a more critical view of the remaining issues: APHIS’s failure (a) to 
evaluate the reasonable alternative of a multi-year phase-out of raw wood packaging and (b) to 
address how counterfeiting of treatment undermines the effectiveness of the current Rule, a 
problem that the phase-out alternative would obviously eliminate.
All of the analytical failures in the current EIS interact with one another.  A different 
methyl bromide usage estimate, for instance, might have given APHIS greater pause before 
discarding the option of phasing-in substitute packaging.  Likewise, a reasonable assessment of a
phase-in of substitutes might have lowered APHIS’s resistance to adopting practicable 
requirements that are both more effective against invasive pests and less damaging to the ozone 
layer.  In

discarding the option of phasing-in substitute packaging.  Likewise, a reasonable assessment of a
phase-in of substitutes might have lowered APHIS’s resistance to adopting practicable 
requirements that are both more effective against invasive pests and less damaging to the ozone 
layer.  In short, if APHIS had rationally conducted the “hard look” required by NEPA, the 
agency might have adopted a different rule under the Plant Protection Act.  
Once the Court determines the full scope of APHIS’s NEPA liability, plaintiffs 
     
based on the new or revised information.  The terms “SEIS” and “EIS” have been used interchangeably by the 
courts.  See Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 701 F.2d 1011, 1035 (2d Cir. 1983).

respectfully request that the Court order APHIS to prepare a new EIS that (a) estimates the likely 
increase in methyl bromide use to be expected under the Rule based on realistic assumptions, (b) 
evaluates the environmental impact of counterfeit marking, and (c) takes an objective look at a 
phase-out of raw wood packaging implemented over a reasonable range of time periods.  In 
addition, plaintiffs request that the Court order APHIS to re-evaluate, based on this new EIS, 
whether its current Rule, which tolerates both continued pest risk and depletion of the ozone 
layer indefinitely, is the best choice given the alternative of a phased transition to substitute 
packaging that eliminates both hazards.3

whether its current Rule, which tolerates both continued pest risk and depletion of the ozone 
layer indefinitely, is the best choice given the alternative of a phased transition to substitute 
packaging that eliminates both hazards.3  
ARGUMENT
I. APHIS’s Conceded Error in Estimating Methyl Bromide Usage Constitutes a NEPA 
Violation Requiring Preparation of a New EIS.
There is now no longer any question that APHIS violated NEPA with regard to the 
methyl bromide estimate. APHIS admits that its estimate was flawed because the agency relied 
on an unfounded assumption that methyl bromide fumigation would occur before, rather than 
after, cargo is loaded onto pallets and into shipping containers.  This assumption was also 
contradicted by a previously undisclosed 80-page report, the result of an APHIS inspection of 
methyl bromide fumigation operations in China in 1999.  See Ltr from Michael J. Garcia to U.S. 
District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna (June 21, 2006).  
APHIS’s failure to evaluate relevant data has serious consequences.  First, it completely 
undercuts NEPA’s “hard look” requirement.  NEPA “does not allow an agency to rely upon the 
conclusions and opinions of its staff … without providing both supporting analysis and data.”  
   
3 Plaintiffs do not intend to impede APHIS’s development of a revised methyl bromide estimate, which it says it has 
already begun.  Plaintiffs insist only that APHIS be barred from attempting to close out the issue of the adequacy of 
its methyl bromide estimate with

 analysis and data.”  
   
3 Plaintiffs do not intend to impede APHIS’s development of a revised methyl bromide estimate, which it says it has 
already begun.  Plaintiffs insist only that APHIS be barred from attempting to close out the issue of the adequacy of 
its methyl bromide estimate with a cursory environmental assessment conducted without the discipline required in a 
full EIS, specifically without soliciting and having to respond to public comments, without addressing in an 
integrated fashion all of the related defects in the current EIS, and without a meaningful opportunity for this Court’s 
review of the resultant product.

Sierra Club v. Eubanks, 335 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1076 (E.D. Cal. 2004) (citing Idaho Sporting 
Congress v. Thomas, 137 F.3d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir. 1998)). “Credible scientific evidence that 
contraindicates a proposed action must also be evaluated and disclosed.”  Id. (citing 40 C.F.R. § 
1502.9(b)).  “An agency’s hard look should include neither researching in a cursory manner nor 
sweeping negative evidence under the rug.”  Nat’l Audubon Soc’y v. Dep’t of Navy, 422 F.3d 
174, 194 (4th Cir. 2005).
Second, APHIS’s error has significant implications for human health and the 
environment. APHIS likely dramatically underestimated global methyl bromide usage under the 
Rule because post-loading fumigation uses a far greater amount of methyl bromide than pre-
loading fumigation.  If APHIS’

 194 (4th Cir. 2005).
Second, APHIS’s error has significant implications for human health and the 
environment. APHIS likely dramatically underestimated global methyl bromide usage under the 
Rule because post-loading fumigation uses a far greater amount of methyl bromide than pre-
loading fumigation.  If APHIS’s first global estimate (done in conjunction with a rule regarding 
wood products from Mexico) is correct, see Pls.’ Opening Br. at 18, then the current Rule has 
resulted in the global release of 400 times as much methyl bromide annually for quarantine uses 
as before the Rule.  Id. at 39.  
In light of these legal and environmental consequences, APHIS’s faulty methyl bromide 
analysis alone suffices to require a new EIS.  APHIS proposes an environmental assessment, and 
not an EIS, as a remedy if the agency deems the new estimate to be similar to the original one.  
This type of cursory documentation is insufficient to remedy APHIS’s fundamental – and likely 
pervasive – procedural error, especially after the agency has already committed to a rule and the 
danger of post-hoc rationalization exists.  An environmental assessment is a short analysis 
conducted at the beginning of the rulemaking process to determine whether the agency’s 
proposal will significantly affect the environment and thus require a full analysis of impacts and 
alternatives in an EIS. See, e.g., Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 546 (11th Cir. 
1996).  APHIS long ago determined that the Rule does significantly affect the environment,
5
largely because of the danger to the ozone layer posed by
Text Len: 1609
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 full analysis of impacts and 
alternatives in an EIS. See, e.g., Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 546 (11th Cir. 
1996).  APHIS long ago determined that the Rule does significantly affect the environment,
5
largely because of the danger to the ozone layer posed by methyl bromide, and thus that it was 
obligated to undertake an EIS.  Having conceded its failure to produce an accurate methyl 
bromide estimate, the required remedy is for APHIS to redo the EIS:  to take the required “hard 
look” at the methyl bromide issue (and other faults in the current EIS), provide a detailed 
analysis of its findings, solicit public comments, and reconsider the underlying decision.
II. The Court Should Evaluate the EIS as a Whole to Determine the Full Extent of the 
NEPA Violation Before Remanding the Rule for Reconsideration in a New EIS.
Even if APHIS were to agree to conduct an EIS, not merely an environmental 
assessment, regarding the revised methyl bromide estimate, a partial remand on this one issue 
without consideration of other defects in the current EIS (the failures to consider counterfeit 
marks and a transition to substitute packaging) is contrary to NEPA principles. By requiring a 
“hard look” at all reasonable alternatives and their environmental impacts, NEPA requires that 
alternatives and impacts be analyzed in relation to each other, not in isolation.4 A court should 
thus review the EIS as a whole, taking a “totality of the circumstances” approach.  See Nat’l 
Audobon Soc’y v. Dep’t of Navy, 422

 their environmental impacts, NEPA requires that 
alternatives and impacts be analyzed in relation to each other, not in isolation.4 A court should 
thus review the EIS as a whole, taking a “totality of the circumstances” approach.  See Nat’l 
Audobon Soc’y v. Dep’t of Navy, 422 F.3d 174, 186 (4th Cir. 2005) (“[A] court must view 
deficiencies in one portion of an EIS in light of how they affect the entire analysis.…[and] 
examine all of the various components of an agency’s environmental analysis in order to 
determine, on the whole, whether the agency has conducted the required ‘hard look.’”).
In conducting this review, a court is entitled to examine the EIS at issue with an 
especially critical eye. The failure to analyze information critical to the methyl bromide estimate 
undermines APHIS’s analytical credibility with regard to the other two NEPA issues.  It also

suggests that the current EIS was a post-hoc rationalization.  APHIS published the draft EIS in 
October 2002, six months after agreeing to the International Plant Protection Convention’s
methyl bromide treatment guidelines.  APHIS itself described the EIS as “unusually concise and 
subjective.”  Draft EIS at 4.  These factors call into question APHIS’s compliance with NEPA.  
A. APHIS’s Failure to Consider the Phase-Out Alternative Violates NEPA.
Although APHIS concedes the need for a new methyl bromide analysis, it adamantly 
refuses to do an analysis of the alternative that APHIS itself identified – a phase-out of raw wood 
in favor of substitute packaging over a reasonable transition period – that would both reduce the 
need for methyl bromide and increase the effectiveness of the regulation.  Both APHIS’s EIS and 
the Rule clearly show that the agency did not examine this option, in violation of NEPA’s 
requirement to examine all reasonable alternatives.  
As detailed in plaintiffs’ briefs, APHIS first identified the option of moving from raw 
wood packaging to substitutes over a reasonable transition period in a 1999 Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051 (Jan.
Text Len: 1488
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, in violation of NEPA’s 
requirement to examine all reasonable alternatives.  
As detailed in plaintiffs’ briefs, APHIS first identified the option of moving from raw 
wood packaging to substitutes over a reasonable transition period in a 1999 Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051 (Jan. 20, 1999).  Although the agency 
promised to seek public comment on that option and analyze the environmental effects of any 
alternatives in full compliance with NEPA, see id., it did not do so.  
This is apparent from comparing the Notice with the Rule.  The Rule’s preamble does 
have a section entitled “Phasing Out WPM in Favor of Manufactured Materials,” 69 Fed. Reg.
55,719, 55721-23 (Sept. 16, 2004), but the contents of this section demonstrate that APHIS 
actually ignored the phase-out option and considered only an immediate ban.  The agency 
repeated its conclusions that substitute packaging “would achieve the greatest possible reduction 
in risk from the introduction of pests and pathogens associated with WPM,” and that compared 
to the prescribed treatment methods, “use of alternative packing materials reduces risk even 
7
more.”  69 Fed. Reg. at 55721 (emphasis added).5 But rather than address the phase-out option, 
the remaining discussion is entirely limited to the asserted economic problems of banning wood 
packaging immediately.  
Even the very pages of the final EIS to which APHIS cites in its reply brief show 
precisely the opposite of APHIS’s contention that it actually evaluated the phase-out option.  
Some statements merely reiterated the problem with an immediate ban.  See

 entirely limited to the asserted economic problems of banning wood 
packaging immediately.  
Even the very pages of the final EIS to which APHIS cites in its reply brief show 
precisely the opposite of APHIS’s contention that it actually evaluated the phase-out option.  
Some statements merely reiterated the problem with an immediate ban.  See Final EIS at 78 
(referencing industry’s inability to “quickly tool up” to switch to substitute packaging) (emphasis 
added).  Other statements identified the need to evaluate a transitional period.  See id. (Substitute
packaging “would require a phase-in period”).  APHIS cannot bootstrap the mere identification
of needed analysis into an excuse for failing to undertake that analysis.6 Nor can APHIS excuse 
the failure to attempt any analysis of possible phase-out schedules merely by asserting that the 
analysis might be “difficult.”  Id. at A-5.7 And finally, APHIS cannot shift the responsibility for 
analyzing the phase-out option – an option that the agency itself identified and promised to 
assess in 1999 – onto the public commenters.8  
   
5  See also, Draft EIS at 37, 38 (substitute packaging would provide “substantially decreased risk from the 
introduction of pest organisms,” and “would considerably reduce inspection efforts and would largely eliminate pest 
risks from wood-feeding insects and diseases”).  The draft EIS also stated:  “None of the treatment methods have 
been shown to effectively eliminate all pests. “  Id. at 83.
6 APHIS also observed that under present conditions substitute packaging was “unlikely to be the predominant 
packing material

 and would largely eliminate pest 
risks from wood-feeding insects and diseases”).  The draft EIS also stated:  “None of the treatment methods have 
been shown to effectively eliminate all pests. “  Id. at 83.
6 APHIS also observed that under present conditions substitute packaging was “unlikely to be the predominant 
packing material for the foreseeable future.”  Id.  This states no more than the obvious:  that absent restrictions on 
raw wood packaging, substitutes will gain market share slowly.  It certainly does not constitute an analysis of what 
could be accomplished with a restriction on raw wood phased in over a reasonable transitional period.  That analysis 
is found nowhere in the remainder of the final EIS.  In the final EIS Appendix (A-5), APHIS refers back to the draft 
EIS.  But aside from identifying the need for a phase-in period, the draft EIS contained no analysis of how the option 
might be implemented or how long would be required.  Draft EISat 38.  It simply dropped the matter there. 
7 The appendix to the final EIS said only this:  “It is difficult for APHIS to specify a time period when the present 
ability of substitute packing manufacturers to supply the market indicates a need for extended growth of the 
industry. The compliance time is particularly difficult to project when the new regulations are specifically directed to 
address packing materials from foreign countries whose industries may be less able to adjust readily to proposed 
changes.”  Final EIS at A-5 (emphasis added).  But APHIS made no effort at all.
8 APHIS acknowledged that “some comments were received in response to the Advanced Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking…supporting the phasing out of SWPM.”  But

 whose industries may be less able to adjust readily to proposed 
changes.”  Final EIS at A-5 (emphasis added).  But APHIS made no effort at all.
8 APHIS acknowledged that “some comments were received in response to the Advanced Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking…supporting the phasing out of SWPM.”  But APHIS then sought to blame the commenters 
for not providing “substantive information that could contribute to establishing a specific time period for compliance 
changes.”  It is the agency’s duty to rigorously explore and objectively analyze all reasonable alternatives, and in 
this case, an alternative identified by the agency itself.  See 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(iii); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(a).

APHIS’s reply brief attempts a two-part excuse for the failure to evaluate the phase-out 
alternative.  First, APHIS asserts that the Rule provides an “appropriate” level of protection.  
Defs.’ Reply Br. at 4.9 Second, APHIS asserts a transition to substitutes is barred by the World 
Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
because it is not the least trade restrictive means of providing the “appropriate” level of 
protection.  Id.  Neither part of APHIS’s argument withstands inspection.

First, the treaty (and the related International Plant Protection Convention) expressly 
preserve each nation’s right to adopt domestic measures stricter than an international guideline if 
they are justified by sound science.  See Pls.’ Reply Br. at 18.  APHIS concedes that it “can 
always choose to revise its own measures unilaterally,” even if the international community does 
not agree.  See Defs.’ Reply Br. at 16.  Thus, APHIS errs in suggesting that a transition to 
substitutes is barred per se as trade restrictive. 
Second, APHIS’s assertion that the current level of protection is “appropriate” is 
groundless given the fact that the agency does not actually know how much protection the Rule
provides.  Rather, since APHIS has repeatedly admitted that substitutes would provide 
“substantially decreased risk” and “the greatest possible reduction in risk,” see page 7, supra, the 
agency should have shown some interest in whether it could do better. 
In short, to meet its “hard look” responsibilities under NEPA, APHIS should have 
assessed how phasing in substitutes over a period of time would mitigate the asserted costs of an 
immediate ban, how much more pest protection would be achieved, and how much less damage 
would be inflicted on the ozone layer.  Only after analyzing these three factors would APHIS be
in a position to determine what level of pest risk is “appropriate” and what pest protections are

“practicable” under the Plant Protection Act.10  
B. APHIS’s Failure to Address the Consequences of Counterfeit Treatment of 
Raw Wood Packaging Under the Rule Also Violates NEPA.  
APHIS overestimated the effectiveness of the Rule by failing to consider the problem of 
fraudulent certification – where raw wood packaging is marked as treated without actually 
having been treated.  See Compl. ¶¶ 7, 12, 68-70; Pls.’ Opening Br. at 2, 3, 19; Pls.’ Reply Br. at 
10.  APHIS assumed throughout its rulemaking that foreign shippers will properly implement the 
agency’s treatment methods, despite evidence that some fraudulently certify untreated raw wood 
packaging as having been treated, and that fraudulent certifications cannot be detected at U.S. 
ports. See Pls.’ Reply Br. at 13. The problem of fraudulent markings was identified in 
comments to the Rule, see AR-V.6, and has since been publicly acknowledged by agency 
personnel, see Compl. ¶¶ 68-70.  APHIS states only that it will target inspections on fraudulent 
certifiers, see Defs.’ Reply Br. at 11, but this presumes that the fraud is detectable.

Unfortunately, when pest outbreaks are found in our cities and forests, it will be far too late to 
connect the dots back to the guilty shippers.  
III. The Court Should Set a Schedule for Simultaneous Reconsideration on All Three 
NEPA Deficiencies.
Preparation of a new EIS is the proper remedy even when there is one defect in the EIS, 
see Natural Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., 421 F.3d 797, 810 n.26 (9th Cir. 2005) – here 
there are three. Rather than ruling and remanding on each deficiency, however, the most 
efficient path for the Court is to rule and remand on all simultaneously.  Avoiding piecemeal 
adjudication also saves the agency the time and expense of preparing multiple revisions of the 
EIS and the Rule.  More importantly, it promotes the “hard look” and reasoned decisionmaking

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ proposed order to dismiss part of plaintiffs’ 
complaint as moot should be denied.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court rule on their
summary judgment motion, require preparation of a new EIS to address all of the issues raised 
herein, and remand the Rule for reconsideration in light of that EIS.  Plaintiffs also request that 
the Court establish a timeline for review of the new EIS, suggesting that APHIS have no more 
than nine months to publish a draft EIS and proposed new rule for public comment and no more 
than 18 months to issue a final EIS and a new Rule.  Plaintiffs also request that the Court retain 
jurisdiction to satisfy itself that APHIS has properly remedied the defects in the existing EIS.

   Re: Draft Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement – 
February 2007, Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material 
Docket No. APHIS-2006-0152 
 
Dear Mr. Bergsten: 
 
 Thank you for extending the comment period on the draft supplement to the FEIS.  Since 
the original comment deadline, there has been a significant court decision and important new 
information has become available.  We submit these comments to supplement those filed April 
23, 2007. 
 
A. Natural Resources Defense Council v. USDA Requires Reconsideration of the 
Wood Packing Rule
 
On June 4, 2007, in Natural Resources Defense Council v. USDA, 05 Civ. 8005 (LMM), 
the District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled on behalf of NRDC and the four 
State plaintiffs that APHIS violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) “in the 
matter of its estimate of the amount of methyl bromide that will be released into the atmosphere 
by reason of the rule at issue.”  Slip op. at 20.  The Court stated that APHIS:   
 
has not complied with NEPA but rather acted arbitrarily and capriciously in that 
(i) its assumption that pre-loading fumigation will substantially replace post-
loading fumigation is flawed, (ii) that flaw affects the methyl bromide release 
findings of the FEIS in a significant way, and (iii) the relation of its much higher 
estimates in connection with the China Inter

 acted arbitrarily and capriciously in that 
(i) its assumption that pre-loading fumigation will substantially replace post-
loading fumigation is flawed, (ii) that flaw affects the methyl bromide release 
findings of the FEIS in a significant way, and (iii) the relation of its much higher 
estimates in connection with the China Interim Rule and the Mexico Rule to the 
present situation have not been considered adequately, or, if they have been, have 
not been adequately explained in the FEIS. 
 
Id. at 20-21.  The Court continued:  “APHIS is to prepare and circulate a supplemental 
Environmental Impact Statement including a corrected estimate of the amount of methyl bromide 
that will be released annually, taking into consideration the higher estimates reached in 
connection with the China Interim Rule and the Mexico Rule, and explaining its views on the 
environmental impact of such new information and how that affects its decision to proceed or not 
with the rule at issue now in effect.”  Id. at 21.   The Court instructed that:   
 

APHIS must, after considering its new methyl bromide release estimate, 
evaluate its rulemaking decision anew.  “Although an [Environmental Impact 
Statement] may be supplemented, the critical agency decision must, of course, be 
made after the supplement has been circulated, considered and discussed in the 
light of the alternatives, not before. Otherwise the process becomes a useless 
ritual, defeating the purpose of NEPA, and rather making a mockery of it.”  
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Callaway, 524 F.2d 79, 92 (2d Cir. 
1975).  The amount of methyl bromide that will be released is too

 alternatives, not before. Otherwise the process becomes a useless 
ritual, defeating the purpose of NEPA, and rather making a mockery of it.”  
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Callaway, 524 F.2d 79, 92 (2d Cir. 
1975).  The amount of methyl bromide that will be released is too significant a 
question to treat as a mere correctible inaccuracy to be made without considering 
the impact of new information.  A corrected methyl bromide estimate in a 
supplemental Environmental Impact Statement cannot be regarded as a matter 
wholly unrelated to APHIS’ rulemaking, as defendants may be suggesting. 
 
Id. at 21-22 (emphasis added, some citations omitted). 
 
 We believe fulfilling the Court’s remand requires a complete and adequate reassessment 
of the methyl bromide estimate, and then a complete re-evaluation of the underlying wood 
packing rule – in the Court’s words, APHIS “must . . . evaluate its rulemaking decision anew.”  
In our judgment, this new evaluation must include a fresh determination whether to change the 
treatment requirements of the rule in view of – 
 
• the magnitude of this unnecessary risk to the ozone layer,  
• the availability of ozone-safe treatment methods (heat treatment and alternative pesticides), 
• the demonstrated problems that compromise the effectiveness of the rule (pest survival after 
proper treatment, and the prevalence of fraudulent certification of treatment), and 
• the availability over a reasonable phase-in period of alternative packing materials that do not 
harbor invasive insect pests. 
 
Natural Resources Defense Council intends to appeal the District Court’s ruling 
regarding the adequacy of APHIS’
Text Len: 1679
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 rule (pest survival after 
proper treatment, and the prevalence of fraudulent certification of treatment), and 
• the availability over a reasonable phase-in period of alternative packing materials that do not 
harbor invasive insect pests. 
 
Natural Resources Defense Council intends to appeal the District Court’s ruling 
regarding the adequacy of APHIS’s consideration of the option of phasing in a requirement for 
the use of alternative packing materials.  We believe the Court erred in concluding that APHIS 
actually considered this option, id. at 15-16.  Further, the Court did not address at all our 
contention that APHIS overestimated the effectiveness of the chosen treatment method by, 
among other things, failing to address the impact of fraudulent treatment certification on the 
failure rate – the rate at which wood packing material will actually contain invasive pests. 
 
We believe the chances of reversing the District Court’s ruling on these points are high.  
Therefore we appeal to APHIS again to broaden the scope of its supplemental EIS and its 
reconsideration of the rule to address these issues – the treatment failure rate and the alternative 
of a transition to alternative packing material – properly now, without further delay.  It makes 
little sense to complete the preparation of a narrow supplemental EIS and reconsideration of the 
underlying rule addressing only the impact of a revised methyl bromide estimate, only to be 
required to undertake a broader EIS and a broader reconsideration of the rule a short time later.   
 
 
B. Risk to the Ozone Layer

bromide’s risk to the ozone layer.  First, we noted in our April 23rd comments

required to undertake a broader EIS and a broader reconsideration of the rule a short time later.   
 
 
B. Risk to the Ozone Layer  
 
 The draft supplemental EIS does not reflect current scientific information on methyl 
bromide’s risk to the ozone layer.  First, we noted in our April 23rd comments that the draft does 
not take into account the most up-to-date international scientific assessment, the World 
Meteorological Association and United Nations Environment Program’s “Scientific Assessment 
Of Ozone Depletion: 2006,”  available at 
http://ozone.unep.org/Assessment_Panels/SAP/Scientific_Assessment_2006/index.shtml. 
 
 The Scientific Assessment report concludes that the phase-out of ozone-depleting 
chemicals under the Montreal Protocol is beginning to work.  Atmospheric concentrations of 
anthropogenic ozone-destroying compounds are coming down.  However, the report states that 
the recovery of the ozone layer will take significantly longer than previously expected.  For 
instance, the Antarctic ozone hole – the most visible symbol of human-caused global 
environmental damage – will not disappear until 2065.  Id. at 21.   
 
Recovery even by this date, however, depends on rigorous enforcement of the Montreal 
Protocol, and that extended and expanded QPS uses of methyl bromide could delay or even 
prevent recovery of the ozone layer: 
 
Failure to comply with the Montreal Protocol would delay, or could even 
prevent, recovery of the ozone layer. Emissions associated with continued or 
expanded exemptions, QPS, process agents, and feedstocks may also delay 
recovery.

 of methyl bromide could delay or even 
prevent recovery of the ozone layer: 
 
Failure to comply with the Montreal Protocol would delay, or could even 
prevent, recovery of the ozone layer. Emissions associated with continued or 
expanded exemptions, QPS, process agents, and feedstocks may also delay 
recovery. 
 
Id. at 23 (emphasis in original).  APHIS has not considered the Scientific Assessment’s 
conclusion that “[e]missions associated with continued or expanded . . . QPS . . . may also delay 
recovery” of the ozone layer. 
 
APHIS’s key assertion – that methyl bromide usage in toto has contributed only a “a 1-
percent effect on stratospheric ozone,” and that methyl bromide use related to APHIS’s wood 
packing rule is only one tenth of that – is both incoherent and out-of-date.   
  
As we noted in the April 23rd comments, the Scientific Assessment reports that new 
research has shown bromine to be a significantly stronger ozone-depleter than previously 
thought:   
 
Bromine is now estimated to be approximately 60 times as effective as 
chlorine in global ozone depletion, on a per-atom basis. This value is larger 
than the effectiveness of 45 used in the 2002 Assessment. This increase in the 
effectiveness of bromine increases the Ozone Depletion Potential of bromine-
containing compounds, evaluated using the semi-empirical method that has been 
used in previous Assessments. 
 
Id. at 21 (emphasis in original).  The draft supplemental EIS reflects no consideration of the 
increase in

. This increase in the 
effectiveness of bromine increases the Ozone Depletion Potential of bromine-
containing compounds, evaluated using the semi-empirical method that has been 
used in previous Assessments. 
 
Id. at 21 (emphasis in original).  The draft supplemental EIS reflects no consideration of the 
increase in the scientific assessment of the ozone-destroying potency of methyl bromide. 
 
 APHIS’s “1-percent effect” assertion is based (inaccurately, we believe) to a 1998 
assessment. The 2006 assessment presents a different picture of the influence of methyl bromide 
in toto, and of QPS methyl bromide in particular.   
 
The Scientific Assessment report evaluated the most effective additional measures that 
could be taken to reduce ozone depletion and hasten recovery of the ozone layer.  The following 
table (reproduced from the Executive Summary at 22) indicates the available measures and the 
percentage reduction in atmospheric loading of ozone-depleting chemicals1 that would result. 
 
 
 
The total elimination of current levels of methyl bromide production at the end of 2006 
would reduce future loadings of ozone-depleting chemicals by 5%.  This is one of the most 
effective measures still available to reduce future ozone depletion. 
 
The report specifically examined the impact of exemptions for critical uses of methyl 
bromide, and for QPS use of methyl bromide.   The results indicate that QPS uses will have a 
much larger impact than acknowledged in the draft supplemental EIS – especially when the 
growth trend of those uses is taken into account.  The Scientific Assessment report first states:  
“The size of the methyl bromide

 methyl 
bromide, and for QPS use of methyl bromide.   The results indicate that QPS uses will have a 
much larger impact than acknowledged in the draft supplemental EIS – especially when the 
growth trend of those uses is taken into account.  The Scientific Assessment report first states:  
“The size of the methyl bromide critical use exemptions is similar to the estimated use of methyl 
bromide for QPS use.”  Id. at 23.  The report then states:   
 
>  If critical-use methyl bromide exemptions continue indefinitely at the 2006 level 
compared to a cessation of these exemptions in 2010 or 2015, midlatitude 
                                                 
1 The Scientific Assessment uses the metric of “equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine.”  This is a means of 
putting chlorinated and brominated compounds on a comparable scale. 
integrated equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine would increase by 4.7% or 
4.0%, respectively. 
 
>  If production of methyl bromide for QPS use were to continue at present levels 
and cease in 2015, midlatitude integrated equivalent effective stratospheric 
chlorine would decrease by 3.2% compared with the case of continued production 
at present levels. 
 
Id.  These paragraphs indicate that if QPS use continued indefinitely at its present rate, as 
compared with a phase-out by 2010 or 2015, something like a 4 to 4.7% increase in the 
atmospheric loading of ozone-destroying chemicals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 decrease by 3.2% compared with the case of continued production 
at present levels. 
 
Id.  These paragraphs indicate that if QPS use continued indefinitely at its present rate, as 
compared with a phase-out by 2010 or 2015, something like a 4 to 4.7% increase in the 
atmospheric loading of ozone-destroying chemicals will result.  Conversely, a substantial 
reduction in atmospheric loading would result if QPS use of methyl bromide could be ended by 
2015. 
 
The increase in the atmospheric loading of ozone-destroying chemicals will be worse 
than the Scientific Assessment anticipated because QPS use of methyl bromide is increasing in 
response to ISPM15.  As discussed below, there has already been a 31% increase in 2005 and a 
greater increase is expected in 2006, 2007, and subsequent years (see below).   
 
 C. Increasing QPS Methyl Bromide Production Driven by ISPM15 
 
The draft supplemental EIS makes no reference to the United Nations Environment 
Program, “2006 Report of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee:  2006 
Assessment,” available at  http://ozone.unep.org/Assessment_Panels/TEAP/Reports/ 
MBTOC/MBTOC-2006-Assessment%20Report.pdf.  The Methyl Bromide Technical Options 
Committee (MBTOC) is the technical body that reports to the Parties to the Montreal Protocol).   
 
The MBTOC Report presents data that global production of methyl bromide for 
quarantine and preshipment (QPS) purposes jumped sharply in 2005 because of ISPM15, and 
that further ISPM15-driven increases are expected in 2006 and 2007.

The MBTOC Report presents data that global production of methyl bromide for 
quarantine and preshipment (QPS) purposes jumped sharply in 2005 because of ISPM15, and 
that further ISPM15-driven increases are expected in 2006 and 2007.  In 2005, reported methyl 
bromide production for QPS was 13,815 metric tons, 37 percent of total reported global methyl 
bromide production.  Id. at 57.  MBTOC reports further that 2005 QPS production was 31 
percent higher than the 1999-2004 average.  Figure 3.16, id. at 58. 
 
 
 
 
The Report states:   
 
The use of MB for QPS has recently increased in a number of countries as a result of 
ISPM 15 ‘Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International 
Trade’ (IPPC, 2002) which came into force in various countries over the period 2004 
- 2006 (DAFF, 2007).  A further increase can be expected in QPS production for 
2006/7 with further implementation of ISPM 15 using methyl bromide. 
 
Id. at 58.  
 
The MBTOC report notes that a revised methyl bromide dosage schedule was adopted for 
ISPM15 in 2006.  Compared with the 2002 version of ISPM15, this did not change the initial 
methyl bromide concentrations needed, but raised both the exposure period and the retention of 
gas needed at the end of the fumigation, from 30% at 16 hours to 50% at 24 hours.  Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that some fumigators are increasing the initial charge of methyl b

methyl bromide concentrations needed, but raised both the exposure period and the retention of 
gas needed at the end of the fumigation, from 30% at 16 hours to 50% at 24 hours.  Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that some fumigators are increasing the initial charge of methyl bromide to 
compensate for leakage in order to meet the final concentration requirement, thus avoiding the 
need to retreat or top up concentrations during the fumigation.  Such practices were not required 
in 2005.  Id. at 291.  
 
The MBTOC also reports that independent evidence suggested the proportion of QPS 
fumigation on logs and wooden items may have been underrepresented.  Id. at 287.   
 
There is some evidence that methyl bromide usage is being driven even higher than one 
might have anticipated due to import country phytosanitary authorities being uncertain whether 
packing material was properly treated at the point of export.  At the most recent meeting of the 
Open Ended Working Group under the Montreal Protocol in Nairobi in June 2007, Australia 
reported that its phyotosanitary authority has been fumigating incoming shipments from Asian 
countries because they were uncertain whether the shipments were properly treated at the export 
end.2   While Australia said it is working to eliminate this double-treatment, APHIS has not 
accounted for the prevalence of the practice in this country or elsewhere.   
 
Similarly, many pallet users have decided to switch to all export compliant packaging 
because they don’t want to risk having a shipment stopped at a border or do not know where a 
load is headed when it is palletized.  Instead of keeping two inventories of

Similarly, many pallet users have decided to switch to all export compliant packaging 
because they don’t want to risk having a shipment stopped at a border or do not know where a 
load is headed when it is palletized.  Instead of keeping two inventories of pallets, many users 
have decided to treat everything.  This is especially true for companies with a significant amount 
of international shipments or fairly expensive products under load.  See Chaille Brindley, Major 
World Powers Move To Implement ISPM-15,  5/2/2005, available at 
http://www.palletenterprise.com/articledatabase/view.asp?articleID=1372 
 
Further, a 2004 IPPC report states:  “Exporting countries have tended to implement 
ISPM-15 in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the importing country for 
consignments containing SWPM. This implementation has stimulated the use of MB for QPS.

Returning to the overall trend, if the same 31 percent annual rate of increase in methyl 
bromide usage driven by ISPM15 is maintained in 2006 and 2007, then QPS production could 
top 20,000 metric tons by the end of 2007, nearly double the 1999-2004 average.  This is a very 
different picture from the false assurances presented in the draft supplemental EIS.  It would be a 
very serious step backwards in ozone layer protection.   
 
As a result of the strong growth in QPS usage driven by ISPM15, APHIS has no rational 
support for its assertion that QPS methyl bromide related to APHIS’s rule represents less than a 
tenth of a percent “effect” (presumably APHIS means increased atmospheric concentration of 
ozone-depleting chemicals).   
 
APHIS offers the soothing assertion that the increase in QPS use of methyl bromide is in 
some way offset by the reductions in other methyl bromide usage accomplished under the 
Montreal Protocol.  That supposed offset effect is not soothing to the Montreal Protocol Parties.

APHIS offers the soothing assertion that the increase in QPS use of methyl bromide is in 
some way offset by the reductions in other methyl bromide usage accomplished under the 
Montreal Protocol.  That supposed offset effect is not soothing to the Montreal Protocol Parties.  
Rather, the sharp rate of increase in methyl bromide use driven by ISPM15 has led the Parties to 
take steps to begin bringing QPS use under control.  The Montreal Protocol and the International 
Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) have begun coordination through their respective 
secretariats to get better data on ISPM15-driven usage of methyl bromide.  The Montreal Parties 
have adopted Decisions (a) requiring countries to report QPS production and use, (b) 
encouraging the use of heat treatment and alternative packing materials, and (c) encouraging the 
IPPC and domestic authorities to approve additional treatment methods.   
 
Further, some Montreal Protocol Parties have made formal proposals to amend the 
Protocol to end the total exemption for QPS and institute requirements to cap and reduce QPS 
production and use.  If APHIS allows QPS growth related to U.S. imports to continue growing, it 
is likely that the Meeting of the Parties will adopt such amendments in 2008.  In short, by 
carelessly promoting uncontrolled growth of methyl bromide production and use for ISPM15 
purposes, APHIS is courting the establishment of international regulatory limits on all QPS use.

 D. Inconsistent and Missing Data on QPS Production and Use 
 
We have already commented that APHIS’s data from which its estimates are derived are 
far from complete and riddled with omissions that preclude assessment of the completeness and 
accuracy of the QPS usage driven by APHIS’s rule.  Here is further evidence on this point.   
 
In 2006, an Expert Working Group on Alternatives to Methyl Bromide, operating under 
the IPPC, reported: 
 
Collection and reporting of QPS usage data 
The EWG noted that QPS usage data reported to the Parties to the Montreal 
Protocol through the Ozone Officer do not necessarily reflect an accurate picture 
of worldwide QPS usage of methyl bromide.  Collection methods are different in 
each country, difficult to do in many, not done in others, and poor at best when 
conducted.  Much of the usage is based on estimates only.  There is no 
standardized method or procedure that provides for accurate reporting of methyl 
bromide use under the QPS exemption.  The EWG discussed whether it should 
develop guidelines on how to collect and report accurate and detailed usage data.

 In light of this and prior comments on inconsistent and missing data, APHIS has no 
apparent rational basis for the assumptions underlying key elements of the equations set forth in 
Appendix D.  Appendix D, of course, is the underpinning of the estimates of methyl bromide 
usage presented in Tables 3-1 and 3-2 in the body of the draft.  Here are a number of specific 
comments regarding “Method 1” and “Method 2” – which dominate APHIS’s total estimates – 
as set forth in Appendix D: 
 
• At page D-4, “Method I” is described as applying to “Treatment of Assembled WPM 
in Tarped Containers After Loading of Cargo.”  It further states:  “Example of 
Method I – countries lacking information about fumigation of WPM where 
fumigation is assessed to occur after loading for 50% of the WPM that is fumigated.” 
These sentences are very confusing.  For which countries has APHIS used “Method 
I”?   Why has APHIS assumed that only 50% of the wood packing material from 
these countries is treated in tarped containers after loading? 
   
• Similar concerns arise with “Method 2,�

umigated.” 
These sentences are very confusing.  For which countries has APHIS used “Method 
I”?   Why has APHIS assumed that only 50% of the wood packing material from 
these countries is treated in tarped containers after loading? 
   
• Similar concerns arise with “Method 2,” described as applying to “Treatment of 
Assembled WPM in Sealed Containers After Loading of Cargo.”  This Method 
apparently was used for China.  It is unclear why APHIS has assumed, in “Example 
of Method 2,” that only 50% percent of the wood packing is fumigated.  
 
• What is the basis for APHIS’s assumption that for imports emanating from Hong 
Kong – a part of China – all WPM is treated in sealed containers before assembly and 
cargo loading? 
 
Without answers to these questions, and appropriate changes to APHIS’s calculations, Appendix 
D does not present a rational basis for the methyl bromide usage estimates presented in the body 
of the draft supplemental EIS. 
 
  E. Availability of ozone safe treatment methods 
 
APHIS has considered the option of requiring non-methyl bromide QPS treatment 
alternatives and phasing out methyl bromide.  Most countries that responded to a survey under 
the Montreal Protocol reported that methyl bromide alternatives were commercially available in 
their countries.  The totals presented in the report suggest that 65% of the MB currently used for 
QPS purposes could be replaced by technologies that are commercially available in the 
responding countries.  Developing country (Article 5) Parties estimated that 73% of QPS MB 
use could be

responding countries.  Developing country (Article 5) Parties estimated that 73% of QPS MB

reported that 46% could be replaced. S.C. Ogden, Preliminary Results Of An International 
Survey On The Use Methyl Bromide For Quarantine And Pre-Shipment, available at 
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/conference/lisboa/proceedings.pdf.  As summarized in

volume of methyl bromide consumed.”  MBTOC 2006, at 290.   
 
APHIS could drastically reduce or eliminate use of methyl bromide related to imports 
into this country by revising its domestic regulations to require the use of heat treatment in all 
circumstances, or at least in without a demonstration that heat treatment is infeasible in the 
exporting country.  Heat treatment is, of course, an approved treatment method under ISPM15.  
APHIS could require in its own rules the use of this ozone-safe alternative. 
 
The IPPC’s Environmental Working Group reports that major reductions in methyl 
bromide emissions can be achieved by capturing and destroying chemical vented during 
treatment.  The IPPC EWG states that recapture and recovery technologies could be quickly 
implemented and faster than getting new chemicals registered, the compliance with such 
technologies is minimal.  The EWG states, however, that: 
 
Recycle and recapture technology for methyl bromide use is not likely to be 
implemented voluntarily until there are economic incentives available that will 
foster implementation. . . . .Since there is no limit on the amount of methyl 
bromide that may be used for quarantine purposes, there are no provisions or 
allowances for credits for having utilized recapture technology base on the 
amount of methyl bromide emissions eliminated (recaptured).

The 2006 MBTOC Assessment states that:  “In the absence of regulations, companies 
reported they would not invest in the systems, because their competitors (who had not made the 
investment) would then have a cost advantage.” (2006 MBTOC Assessment Report, at.17.)  
APHIS could support making recovery and destruction a requirement under ISPM15.  
 
In addition, APHIS could aggressively seek to amend ISPM15 to approve the use of other 
pesticides.   The 2007 Progress Report of the Technological and Economic Assessment Panel 
reports:   
 
In Japan, sulfuryl fluoride (SF) plus methyl isothioscyanate (MITC) and methyl iodide 
(MI) have been registered for the treatment of timber and packaging materials for 
products intended for import to Japan.  The Japanese government submitted these 
treatments for consideration for inclusion in ISPM 15 (IPPC 2006) standard for 
quarantine treatments of wooden packaging materials.

ISPM15 itself notes a range of alternatives that could be further evaluated and approved 
as alternatives to methyl bromide and heat treatment.   
 
As a dominant party in the IPPC, APHIS has a responsibility to undertake the necessary 
testing and to move the process quickly so that these treatments can be approved if the data 
warrants.  Yet the draft supplemental EIS reveals no effort to explore and approve these 
alternatives that would obviate the need for methyl bromide. 
 
F. APHIS’s continued failure to confront evidence of compromised effectiveness – 
pest survival after proper treatment, and the prevalence of fraudulent certification 
 
While APHIS rarely defines what it means by “negligible risk” of failed treatment, that 
term has been defined in two cases that apply to wood.  “In the supplemental impact statement 
covering wood imports from New Zealand and Chile (USDA APHIS 1998a) and in the 
environmental assessment prepared for the emergency regulation pertaining to wood packaging 
from China (USDA APHIS 1998b), APHIS accepted a risk level of 3 to 5 percent.”  According 
to a paper presented at a USDA-sponsored research forum, “when a 3 to 5 percent risk is applied 
to the large volume of imports making up the three forest pest pathways, it translates to the 
probable arrival on our shores of hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of quarantine pests.”

Australia has exhibited a high level of concern about treatment failures.  Recent 
interception data collected by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has 
shown that timber pests continue to be detected in association with wood packaging material that 
purports to be ISPM15 compliant.  
During the 6793 surveillance inspections of wood packaging material displaying 
the ISPM 15 stamp (January 1 to November 30, 2005), 19522 crates, dunnage or 
pallets (pieces) were observed. “Of the 19522 pieces, 1823 or 9.34 % were found 
to be non-compliant with the ISPM 15 standard and 1749 or 8.96 % exhibited 
something of quarantine concern. Of this 8.96 % of ISPM 15 wood packaging for 
which quarantine concerns were identified, 86.4 % had bark, 5.7 % had fungi and 
mould, and 5.9 % had evidence of live insects. On the basis of total units of wood 
packaging material inspected, approximately 1 in 200 units had

something of quarantine concern. Of this 8.96 % of ISPM 15 wood packaging for 
which quarantine concerns were identified, 86.4 % had bark, 5.7 % had fungi and 
mould, and 5.9 % had evidence of live insects. On the basis of total units of wood 
packaging material inspected, approximately 1 in 200 units had live wood boring 
insects and 80 % of these insect detections were on wood packaging with bark. 
These figures are equivalent to Less than Container Load (LCL) survey data 
collected from 1997 to 1999 (Salvage 1999), except that the proportion of items 
with bark present has increased for ISPM 15 wood packaging material.”

Packaging Material to be Bark Free, at 16 available at

At present under ISPM 15, there is no accep table way to confirm that a certified 
treatement has been appropriately performed (Burgess, 2005).   
*  *  * 
Wood packaging material is difficult to monitor during quarantine inspection 
procedures. Even when high-risk packing is identified in a shipment, the inspection 
process is complicated by limited access to visible surfaces (most surfaces are not 
facing the inspector or the cargo is buried deep in a container) and the cryptic nature 
of many wood-inhabiting organisms. Late nt fungal infections are virtually 
impossible to detect through inspection of outer wood surfaces. (Allen 2001b.)

of many wood-inhabiting organisms. Late nt fungal infections are virtually 
impossible to detect through inspection of outer wood surfaces. (Allen 2001b.)  
Biosecurity Australia, 2006 at 17-18.  The Report continues at 20, 28, 41, and 98: 
 
USDA has released a final environmental impact statement on the importation of 
solid wood packing material that supports the adoption of the IPPC (2002) 
standard, although the document indicates some level of concern over the 
effectiveness of both the methyl bromide treatment and heat treatment (e.g. 
USDA 2003, pp 24, 51, 60 and 61).  
Reviews by Morrell (1995) and Viljoen and Banks (2002) demonstrate that 
moisture content and bark on wood following harvesting are related and impact 
upon methyl bromide uptake. There are also considerable differences between 
methyl bromide fumigation penetration in hardwood and softwood timbers (Ren 
et al. 1997, in Viljoen and Banks 2002). These differences, as well as the 
differences in gas penetration in green and dry timber, are not addressed by ISPM 
15, which treats all wood as similar and makes no allowance for operational 
effects.  
Pests that attack seasoned wood are more likely to enter the pathway after the 
ISPM 15 treatment and may continue to do so during the service life of the 
product. The presence of bark is not regarded as a significant contributing factor 
in attack by and survival of most invertebrate pests of seasoned wood, except in 
circumstances where the bark may offer additional protection for any life stages

 likely to enter the pathway after the 
ISPM 15 treatment and may continue to do so during the service life of the 
product. The presence of bark is not regarded as a significant contributing factor 
in attack by and survival of most invertebrate pests of seasoned wood, except in 
circumstances where the bark may offer additional protection for any life stages 
of these pests. The assessment also notes that there is no direction provided under 
ISPM 15 concerning storage and use of treated material. 
 In 2001, Australia reported that 22 % of inspected wood consignments coming 
from the USA and Canada had residual bark, and in 50 % of these live insects or 
nematodes were found in wood that retains some or all of its bark (especially if 
there are compliance issues relating to the ISPM 15 treatments.) “Preliminary data 
from AQIS’ current survey (AQIS unpublished data) demonstrates no overall 
improvement in interception rates of invertebrates as a result of the 
implementation of ISPM 15.”  
 
APHIS has not conducted any similar analysis.   
 
Nor has APHIS assessed the rate of treatment fraud – where wood packing material is 
stamped as having been treated with heat or methyl bromide, but in fact was treated with neither 
method.  Fraudulently certified wood packing material carries the full pest risk of untreated 
material.  If even a small percentage of shipments are fraudulently certified, the real failure rate 
is much higher than even the 3 to 5 percent risk referred to above.   
 
As noted above, the District Court opinion did not address the issue that plaintiffs raised 
regarding the failure to assess the risk of fraudulent certification.  This is a matter that will be 
taken up on appeal

acknowledge and remediate this gross failure in its EIA and the analysis supporting its rule.   
G. Conclusion 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments.  We urge APHIS to fully re-
evaluate all of its prior decisions in all respects.

coconut fruit with milk and husk from 
Mexico; pitaya from Mexico; melon and 
watermelon from certain countries in 
South America; watermelon, squash, 
cucumber, oriental melon, and grapes 
from the Republic of Korea. 
Before entering the United States, all 
of these fruits and vegetables are subject 
to inspection and disinfection at their 
port of first arrival to ensure that no 
plant pests are inadvertently brought 
into the United States. These 
precautions, along with other 
requirements, help ensure that these 
commodities do not introduce exotic 
plant pests, such as fruit flies, into the 
United States. 
The regulations require the use of 
certain information collection activities, 
including import permits, phytosanitary 
certificates, fruit fly monitoring records, 
and box labeling. 
We are asking the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) to 
approve our use of these information 
collection activities for an additional 3 
years. After approval of the burden

The purpose of this notice is to solicit 
comments from the public (as well as 
affected agencies) concerning our 
information collection. These comments 
will help us: 
(1) Evaluate whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
Agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(2) Evaluate the accuracy of our 
estimate of the burden of the 
information collection, including the 
validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; 
(3) Enhance the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information to be 
collected; and 
(4) Minimize the burden of the 
information collection on those who are 
to respond, through use, as appropriate, 
of automated, electronic, mechanical, 
and other collection technologies, e.g., 
permitting electronic submission of 
responses.

APHIS published in the Federal 
Register on September 16, 2004 (69 FR 
55719–55733, Docket No. 02–032–3), a 
final rule amending the regulations for 
the importation of unmanufactured 
wood articles to adopt an international 
standard entitled ‘‘Guidelines for 
Regulating Wood Packaging Material in 
International Trade.’’ The FEIS was 
prepared with regard to that final rule 
in compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.), and its implementing regulations. 
APHIS will base the SEIS on recently 
obtained, reliable data regarding how 
various countries have complied with 
the final rule and with the International 
Plant Protection Convention Guidelines 
(IPPC Guidelines) on which the final 
rule was based. These data include 
reports from different countries on 
whether cargo is routinely fumigated 
along with wood packaging material 
(WPM), which would result in more 
methyl bromide usage, or whether WPM 
is fumigated separately from cargo, 
which would result in less methyl 
bromide usage. We also have new data 
on the extent to which various countries 
have chosen to comply with the IPPC 
Guidelines by heat treating WPM rather 
than fumigating it. 
The SEIS will be prepared in

or the dissemination of plant pests within the
United States.
7 U.S.C. § 7112(a).
On September 16, 2004, the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (“APHIS”) of the United States Department of
Agriculture  amended, effective September 16, 2005, the regulations1
for the importation into the United States of unmanufactured wood
articles used as packaging for cargo.  69 Fed. Reg. 55719-55733
(Sept. 16, 2004) (codified in 7 CFR, Pt. 319, § 319.40 (2006)).2
In explaining the amended regulations, APHIS noted that
“[i]ntroductions into the United States of exotic plant pests such
as the pineshoot beetle . . . and the Asian longhorned beetle . . .
have been linked to the importation of [what the previous
regulations called ‘solid wood packing material’ or ‘SWPM’],” and
that “[t]hese and other plant pests that are carried by some
imported SWPM pose a serious threat to U.S. agriculture and to
natural, cultivated and urban forests.”  69 Fed. Reg. 5

 of [what the previous
regulations called ‘solid wood packing material’ or ‘SWPM’],” and
that “[t]hese and other plant pests that are carried by some
imported SWPM pose a serious threat to U.S. agriculture and to
natural, cultivated and urban forests.”  69 Fed. Reg. 55719.  The
amended “regulations restrict the importation of many types of wood
articles, including wooden packaging material such as pallets,
crates, boxes, and pieces of wood used to support or brace cargo.”
Id.  The standard embodied in the amended regulations “calls for

methyl bromide, in accordance with the [Guidelines for Regulating
Wood Packaging Material in International Trade, approved by the
Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the International
Plant Protection Convention on March 15, 2002], and marked with an
approved in ternational mark certifying treatment.”  Id.  The
regulations “will affect all persons using wood packaging material
in connection with importing goods into the United States.”  Id.
APHIS also noted that “Methyl bromide as a class I ozone-
depleting substance has been found to cause or contribute
significantly to harmful effects on the stratospheric ozone
layer. . . .”  69 Fed. Reg. 55721.

 also noted that “Methyl bromide as a class I ozone-
depleting substance has been found to cause or contribute
significantly to harmful effects on the stratospheric ozone
layer. . . .”  69 Fed. Reg. 55721.
Plaintiffs  -- the Natural Resources Defense Council,3
Inc., and the states of New York, California, Connecticut and
Illinois -- do not challenge specifics of the amended regulations,
but, rather, in essence, the failure of APHIS to properly consider
and weigh an unadopted alternative to heat treatment or fumigation
with methyl bromide:  “a phased transition away from raw wood
pallets and crates, replacing them with packing materials made of
substitute materials, such as processed wood, fiberboard, plywood,
and plastics, that are impervious to the insect pests.” (Pl. Mem.

APHIS, plaintiffs contend, has violated both the National
Environmental Protection Act (“NEPA”) and the PPA in failing to
consider the alternative they advocate.
Plaintiffs, jointly, move for summary judgment pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, while defendants cross-move for dismissal
pursuant to id. 12(b)(6) or, alternatively, summary judgment
pursuant to id. 56.  Whatever the form of the motions, in a case
seeking review of agency action:
“[T]he focal point for judicial review should be
the administrative record already in existence, not
some new recordmade initially in the reviewing
court.”  The task of the reviewing court is to
apply the appropriate [Administrative Procedure Act

agency decision based on the record the agency
presents to the reviewing court.

The parties are in agreement that this Court’s review of
the challenged action is governed by the APA.  (Pl. Mem. at 23;
Def. Mem. at 26.)
It is settled law that under the APA a reviewing
court may set aside an agency’s decision only if it
is found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with
law.”  A court may not substitute its judgment for
that of the agency, and, when a pa rticular
controversy requires an agency’s reconciliation of
conflicting and overlapping congressional policies,
a court “should hesitate to disturb the
administrative determination.”
A successful challenge to an agency’s decision
under the arbitrary and capricious standard must
clearly demonstrate that the agency “relied on
factors which Congress has not intended it to
consider, entirely failed to consider an important
aspect of the problem [or] offered an explanation
for its decision that runs counter to the evidence
before the agency, or is so implausible that it
could not be ascribed to a difference in view or
the product of agency expertise.”  A reviewing

The parties, in substance, agree that both the
introduction into the United States of destructive insect pests
such as the Asian longhorned beetle and the release into the air of
methyl bromide are seriously negative environmental events.
Plaintiffs urge that the best way to deal with both is the option
that would phase in a requirement that substitute or alternative
packing materials replace the wood materials the new rule as
promulgated will only regulate.
However, plaintiffs contend, even though APHIS
acknowledged the reasonableness of the option that plaintiffs
advocate  and indicated in its Advance notice of rulemaking that5
that option was to be considered (64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051 (Jan. 20,
1999)), and received substantial commentary on, and favoring, that
option, it nevertheless did not really consider the option, and so
failed to comply with NEPA’s mandate that an agency “[r]igorously
explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.”  40
CFR § 1502.14(a).  See also Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v.

described by plaintiffs, “was the ‘staw man’ option of an immediate

 Plaintiffs vigorously dispute APHIS’ estimate of the worldwide6
increase in methyl bromide usage that implementation of the rule will
entail, 384 to 4630 metric tons per year. (Def. Mem. at 25.) (See FEIS,
AR II.1, at 66-67.) At the close of the initial briefing of the parties’
motions, defendants advised the Court that one of the assumptions
underlying APHIS’ estimates was flawed: i.e., the assumption “that all
[methyl bromide] fumigation would occur ‘pre-loading,’ rather than ‘post-
loading.’” (Def. Mem. at 45.) “APHIS now concedes that the
justification for the [methyl bromide] estimate in the [FEIS] was flawed;
the agency erred in asserting that shippers in China eventually began to
fumigate all [wood packing material] prior to loading.”  (Letter,
A.U.S.A. Turner to Court, June 21, 2006, at 3.)  “Fumigating ‘post-

man” option, plaintiffs add, is not supported by the record.  (Id.
at 28-34.)
Plaintiffs also argue that the Final Environmental Impact
Statement (“FEIS”) and the new rule reflect “a highly skewed
analysis of the environmental impacts of meth yl bromide
fumigation.”  (Id. at 34.)  The estimates of the FEIS on which
APHIS acted, plaintiffs urge, are severely flawed, unsupported by
the record, and affected by inadequate conclusory assumptions.
(Id. at 34-40.)6
Plaintiffs argue, in addition, that APHIS has violated
the Plant Protection Act (“PPA”), emphasizing that the Act gives
the Secretary (and thus, by delegation, APHIS (see n.1, supra)),
authority “to prevent the introduction of plant pests into the
United States,” 7 U.S.C. § 7711(a) (emphasis added by plaintiffs),
and states that it is the Secretary’s responsibility to facilitate

commerce “in ways that will reduce, to the extent practible, as
determined by the Secretary, the risk of dissemination of plant
pests. . . .”  Id. § 7701(3) (emphasis added by plaintiffs).  The
PPA, plaintiffs argue, “requires APHIS to adopt the most effective
practicable alternative.  The statute does not authorize the agency
to set an arbitrary level of ‘acceptable’ pest risk, or ‘necessary’
pest protection, such that APHIS may reject more effective
alternative methods that are practicable.”  (Pl. Mem. at 41.)  In
the present situation, plaintiffs conclude, “APHIS itself
identifies an alternative that eliminates the risk [i.e., the
phase-in of substitute packing material as advocated by plaintiffs,
and] APHIS must fully and fairly evaluate that alternative to
determine if it is practicable, and if so, adopt it.”  (Id. at 42.)

also goes beyond them to explain why it chose to adopt “a set of

The PPA, enacted in 2000, provides that “[t]he Secretary
[of Agriculture] shall ensure that phytosanitary issues involving7

In the new rule, APHIS adopted what it described as “an

International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures: Guidelines for
Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade.  (“IPPC

Guidelines.

4.
The Court considers first plaintiffs’ argument that
APHIS, in adopting the new rule, violated the PPA.  The argument is
not persuasive.
Plaintiffs’ position, in essence, is that the PPA, in 7
U.S.C. §§ 7712(a) and 7701(3), requires APHIS to adopt the rule
that will most effectively reduce pest risk, and that that is the
end of the question.  (See Pl. Mem. at 40-42; Pl. Responsive Mem.
at 16-18; Section 3 of this Memorandum and Order, supra.)  That
view is both too narrow and not supported by the language of the
PPA.

that will most effectively reduce pest risk, and that that is the
end of the question.  (See Pl. Mem. at 40-42; Pl. Responsive Mem.
at 16-18; Section 3 of this Memorandum and Order, supra.)  That
view is both too narrow and not supported by the language of the
PPA.
In the first place, the Supreme Court has pointed out
that its decision in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp v. Natural
Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 558 (1978), “cuts sharply
against the . . . conclusion that an agency, in selecting a course
of action, must elevate environmental concerns over other
appropriate considerations.”  Strycker’s Bay Neighborhood Council,
Inc. v. Karlen, 444 U.S. 223, 227 (1980) (per curiam).
In the second place, the PPA mandates the consideration
of factors other than the environment.
7 U.S.C § 7701(3), on which plaintiffs explicitly rely,
states that “it is the responsibility of the Secretary to
facilitate exports, imports, and interstate commerce in

agricultural products and other commodities that pose a risk of
harboring plant pests or noxious weeds,” id., but goes on to add
that the Secretary is to do so “in ways that will reduce, to the
extent practicable, as determined by the Secretary, the risk of
dissemination of plan pests or noxious weeds.”  Id.  It is clear,
therefore, that in adopting the rule, the Secretary,

 noxious weeds,” id., but goes on to add
that the Secretary is to do so “in ways that will reduce, to the
extent practicable, as determined by the Secretary, the risk of
dissemination of plan pests or noxious weeds.”  Id.  It is clear,
therefore, that in adopting the rule, the Secretary, acting through
APHIS, in addition to reducing the risk of plant pests, is obliged
as well to consider the facilitation of commerce.  What is more,
the use of the phrase “to the extent practicable, as determined by
the Secretary,” id., makes it clear that, in considering the rule
and the alternatives, the Secretary, acting through APHIS, is given
room for “the application of agency expertise and discretion.”  See
Conservation Law Foundation v. Evans, 360 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.
2004).  Facilitation of commerce certainly entered into the
decision to adopt the new rule.  See 69 Fed. Reg. 55721
(“Alternative packing materials [involve] a cost that is currently
beyond the reach of exporters in many developing countries. . . .”)
and id. 55722 (“. . . prohibiting the use of unmanufactured wood as
a packaging material would have significant negative consequences
in economic and environmental arenas.  Wood is often the only
packaging material readily and cheaply available . . . in
developing countries that export basic products without elaborate
packaging.”)

 For a full description of the international background to APHIS’9
use of the IPPC Guidelines, see Def. Mem. at 3-6.
  Plaintiffs argue that APHIS need not have followed the IPPC
Guidelines in order to be consistent with international agreements
because the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (“SPS Agreement”) (AR VI.8), which,
among other things, seeks to protect trade by eliminating trade
protectionist actions, “allow[s] members to impose higher levels of
[phytosanitary] protection than required by international standards if
a member concludes (based on scientific and economic factors recognized
as valid under the Agreement) that the international standards do not
provide adequate protection.” (Def. Mem. at 5 (summarizing SPS
Agreement, Art. 3, cl. 1 [AR VI.8 at 2].)  However, the SPS Agreement
also “provides a safe harbor for measures that do conform to
international standards.” (Id. (summarizing SPS Agreement, Art. 3, cl.
2 [AR VI.8 at 2].) The “safe harbor” obtained by following the IPPC
Guidelines is certainly of value in facilitating trade by avoiding trade
disputes (see Def. Reply Mem. at 14-15), and the choice to follow the
IPPC Guidelines was well within the Secretary’s discretion.

Guidelines is certainly of value in facilitating trade by avoiding trade
disputes (see Def. Reply Mem. at 14-15), and the choice to follow the
IPPC Guidelines was well within the Secretary’s discretion.
12
Finally, the PPA requires the Secretary (“[t]he Secretary
shall. . . .”) to ensure that phytosanitary issues involving
imports and exports are . . . consistent with applicable
international agreements.”  7 U.S.C. § 7751(e).  As described
above, the new regulations are based on the IPPC Guidelines and are
fully consistent with applicable international agreements.9
In short, the PPA, as applied to the present dispute,
vests the Secretary with the duty of crafting a rule that will
reduce the risk of plant pests consistently with applicable
international agreements and at the same time facilitate
international commerce, and discretion to weigh the facts and
issues in so doing.  The record is clear that the Secretary, acting
through APHIS, did so in the present case.
Plaintiffs have not shown that the adoption by APHIS of
the new rule violated the PPA.

The purpose and basic requirements of NEPA were

Engineers, 701 F.2d 1011 (2d Cir. 1983):
As the Supreme Court has stated repeatedly,
although NEPA established “‘significant substantive
goals for the Nation,’” the balancing of the
substantive environmental issues is consigned to
the judgment of the executive agencies involved,
and the judicially reviewable duties that are
imposed on the agencies are “‘essentially
procedural.’”  “The only role for a court is to
insure that the agency has taken a ‘hard look’ at
environmental consequences; it cannot ‘interject
itself within the area of discretion of the
executive as to the choice of the act ion to be
taken.’”
The primary function of an environmental impact
statement under NEPA is “‘to insure a fully
informed and well-considered decision,’ [although]
not necessarily ‘a decision the judges of the Court
of Appeals or of [the Supreme] Court would have
reached had they been members of the decisionmaking
unit of the agency.’”  In order to fulfill its
role, the [Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”)]
must set forth sufficient information for the
general public to make an informed evaluation, and
for the decisionmaker to “consider fully the
environmental factors involved and to make a
reasoned decision after balancing the risks of harm
to the environment against the benefits to be
derived from the proposed action.”  In so doing,

for the decisionmaker to “consider fully the
environmental factors involved and to make a

to the environment against the benefits to be
derived from the proposed action.”  In so doing,
the EIS insures the integrity of the process of
decision by giving assurance that stubborn problems
or serious criticisms have not been “swept under
the rug.”  The “‘detailed statement’” required by
§ 102(2)(C) of NEPA [, 42 U.S.C. § 4 332(2)(C),]
thus “is the outward sign that environmental values

Here, in the FEIS (AR II.1.), APHIS, noting the “nature
and severity of the risk from the wood packing material
accompanying shipments in international trade,” stated that it
proposed “to adopt the IPPC Guidelines while it considers the need
for a more long-term and permanent solution to the [wood packing
material] problem.”  (FEIS at 3.)  It considered that and four
alternatives:
(1) No Action (no change in the current
regulation), (2) Extension of the Treatments in the
China Interim Rule to All Countries, (3) Adoption
of the IPPC Guidelines, (4) a Comprehensive Risk
Reduction Program, and (5) Substitute Packing
Materials Only.  Each of the alternatives consists
of specific component methods for the mitigation of
risk from [wood packing material].

15
(Id. at 9.)   The possible environmental consequences of the five10
alternatives are reviewed in the FEIS.
The FEIS acknowledges that “the prohibition of SWPM and
the requirement to switch to substitute packing materials would
result in substantially less pest and disease risk than any of the
other components considered in th is [F]EIS.”  Id. at 42.  The
effects of methyl bromide on the ozone layer are considered in
detail.  Id. at 54-57.  And the FEIS further acknow ledges that
“[]he logical response to address the issue of methyl bromide use
relative to ozone depletion potential is to promote the use of
alternate phytosanitary methods (such as substitute packing
materials) to deal with [solid wood packing materials] used in
international trade.”  Id. at 78.  For reasons summarized above,
however, APHIS did not adopt that approach. 
6.
Plaintiffs argue that there are three ways in which APHIS
failed to comply with NEPA.
First, plaintiffs contend that APHIS did not consider the
option of a phase-in of substitute materials, but only the “straw
man” of an immediate replacement of wooden with substitute packing
materials.  The record does not support this argument.

In its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in 1999,
APHIS pointed out that one option for dealing with the problems it
wished to address was the prohibition of the usual wood packaging
materials in favor of alternative materials such as processed wood
and nonwood materials.  Noting that such action could have an
undesirable effect on international trade, it added that “[t]his
effect could be mitigated by a phase-in period to allow shippers to
adjust to the prohibition. . . .” 64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051.  The
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (“DEIS”) of October 2002 (AR
II.2) discusses the substitute materials option (see DEIS at 12,
36-39, 73-77), and notes that substitute materials “may require a
phase-in period to allow the industry to adopt these materials to
the shipping processes.”  (DEIS at 37; see also id. at 75.)  The
FEIS notes that “[s]ubstitute packing materials would require a
phase-in period to allow the industry of the regulated countries to
adapt these materials to the shipping processes.”  (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 41; see also id. at 81.)
Second, plaintiffs urge that the FEIS “failed to examine
rationally the amount of ozone-destroying methyl bromide that will
be used due to the [new

 period to allow the industry of the regulated countries to
adapt these materials to the shipping processes.”  (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 41; see also id. at 81.)
Second, plaintiffs urge that the FEIS “failed to examine
rationally the amount of ozone-destroying methyl bromide that will
be used due to the [new] Rule.”  (Pl. Responsive Mem. at 1.)  In
support of this argument, plaintiffs identify two instances in
which APHIS had estimated ranges of amounts of methyl bromide that
would be released as a result of rulemaking that, plaintiffs argue,
Case 1:05-cv-08008-LMM     Document 16      Filed 06/04/2007     Page 16 of 22
17
are not consistent with the range of 384 to 4630 metric tons given
in the FEIS.  (FEIS [AR II.1] at 66-67.) 
The first instance relates to the China Interim Rule.
(See n.9, supra.)  In a September 18, 1998 Interim Rule and Request
for Comments, APHIS stated that it “estimates that, if China were
to comply with the interim rule by fumigating SWPM shipments with
methyl bromide, China could use between 1,040 and 12,565 metric
tons of methyl bromide annually.”  63 Fed. Reg. 50100, 50109.  This
range is referenced in the FEIS in the present case (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 29; 56), and noted to be based on “conservative assumptions.”
(Id.)  The FEIS explains that “[t]he actual [quarantine and
preshipment] usage from the China Interim

 50100, 50109.  This
range is referenced in the FEIS in the present case (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 29; 56), and noted to be based on “conservative assumptions.”
(Id.)  The FEIS explains that “[t]he actual [quarantine and
preshipment] usage from the China Interim Rule is known to be
considerably less than anticipated from the risk analysis due to
the analysis assumption that loaded cargo with SWPM would be
fumigated rather than fumigation of SWPM prior to cargo loading,”
while “[i]t is known that most shippers fumigate SWPM prior to
cargo loading to lower costs, avoid agricultural commodity
tolerance issues, and to prevent damage to sensitive commodities.”
(Id. at 56.) Defendants now concede that this last statement is
not correct.  (See n.6, supra.)
The second instance cited by plaintiffs is from a Final
Environmental Impact Statement of September 2002, relating to a
Rule for the Importation of Unmanufactured Wood Articles from
Mexico, with Consideration for Cumulative Impact of Methyl Bromide

Use (AR II.35), where it is noted that the rule t here under
consideration (affecting, it appears, trade between the United
States and Mexico only) “could result in potential releases to the
atmosphere ranging from 8,536 [metric tons] to 102,893 [metric
tons] per year based upon information from trade summaries.”  (Id.
at 65.)  While the Mexico Environmental Impact Statement is

 it appears, trade between the United
States and Mexico only) “could result in potential releases to the
atmosphere ranging from 8,536 [metric tons] to 102,893 [metric
tons] per year based upon information from trade summaries.”  (Id.
at 65.)  While the Mexico Environmental Impact Statement is
referenced in the FEIS in the present case (AR II.1 at 57, 90), the
estimated methyl bromide release figures do not appear to be set
forth there. 
Defendant initially argued that the Mexico Rule
Environmental Impact Statement analysis was a “worst-case scenario”
that assumed that all fumigation would occur post-loading “as the
China Interim Rule estimate assumed,” and pointed out that the
Mexico Rule Environmental Impact Statement “concluded that the
‘actual increase in methyl bromide usage would actually be closer
to one-twentieth’ of this ‘worst-case scenario’ amount, equating to
an additional release of 427 to 5,145 [metric tons] per year.”
(Def. Mem. at 45 (citing AR II.35 at 66).)
The Mexico Rule Environmental Impact Statement states
that:  “As was shown with the interim rule for China, SWPM is more
likely to be treated prior to use in loading the commodity, so the
actual increase in methyl bromide usage would actually be closer to
one-twentieth (1/20) of the projected usage in this assessment.”
(AR II.35 at 65-66 (footnote omitted).)

Two things appear from the Mexico Rule Environmental
Impact Statement:  first, that the assumption used to support the
low estimate of annual methyl bromide releases attributable to the
Mexico Rule is the same assumption that supports the low estimate
in the case of the China Interim Rule, and is derived from the
China Interim Rule assumption that most fumigation will occur pre-
loading(now conceded to be erroneous); and, second, that the
difference in the amount of methyl bromide releases between post-
loading fumigation and pre-loading fumigation, respectively, is
approximately 20 to 1.
Defendants have already stated a willingness, prompted by
the flawed assumption described in the government’s letter of
June 21, 2006 (see n.6, supra), to produce a supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement which will include a new methyl
bromide release estimate. (Gov’t Supp. Mem. at 1.)  That estimate
must also include consideration of the methyl bromide release
estimate contained in the Mexico Rule Final Environmental Impact
Statement of September 2002 discussed above.
Plaintiff’s third argument in support of its claim that
APHIS violated NEPA is that APHIS committed to the course of action
it finally took before undertaking an Environmental Impact
Statement and that “such predetermined conclusions are invalid as
a matter of law under NEPA.”  (Pl. Responsive Mem. at 2.)  This
argument is not persuasive.

It is true that at least as early as the DEIS of October
2002 APHIS was proposing to adopt the IPPC Guidelines (see DEIS [AR
II.2] at iii), which, in the FEIS, APHIS identified as its
“preferred alternative.” (FEIS [AR II.1] at 3.)  There is nothing
wrong,however, with an agency having a proposal or preferred
alternative in mind when it enters into the Environmental Impact
Statement process.  Indeed, NEPA contemplates that it will.  See 42
U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(1) (every recommendation or report on proposals
for major federal actions significantly affecting quality of human
environment to include statement on “proposed” action);  see also
40 CFR § 1502.14 (environmental impact statement to present
environmental impacts of “the proposal and the alternatives”).
For the reasons discussed above in this section of this
Memorandum and Order, the Court finds that APHIS has not violated
NEPA except in the matter of its estimate of the amount of methyl
bromide that will be released into the atmosphere by reason of the
rule at issue.  In that regard, however, APHIS (even though its

the amount of methyl bromide that will be released annually, taking
into consideration the higher estimates reached in connection with

Description of Calculations Used in the Supplemental Environmental 
Impact Statement for Estimation of Methyl Bromide Released From 
Fumigation of Wood Packaging Material 
 
The quantitative assessment of methyl bromide usage in the treatment of wood packing material 
(WPM) involves consideration of many factors with variable levels of definition and uncertainty.  
This appendix is prepared to assist the reader in better understanding the basis for the 
calculations and those factors that were considered in the development of the equation used to 
make methyl bromide estimates. 
  
The majority of NPPOs in the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) countries do not 
compile records for usage of methyl bromide specifically for treatment of WPM in compliance 
with International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 (ISPM 15) guidelines.  The 
most recent year with complete data on U.S. Customs entries of imported articles is 2005 and, 
therefore, all calculations use information for 2005 as the basis for quantification of methyl 
bromide associated with ISPM 15 compliance.  Other than the actual pounds of methyl bromide 
provided by the NPPOs for the country of Nicaragua (Hernandez, 2006), determinations of 
methyl bromide quantities in this supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) were 
calculated relative to the number of WPM units treated in 2005.  Data on the actual number of 
WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide in 2005 in

provided by the NPPOs for the country of Nicaragua (Hernandez, 2006), determinations of 
methyl bromide quantities in this supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) were 
calculated relative to the number of WPM units treated in 2005.  Data on the actual number of 
WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide in 2005 in the United States for export purposes in 
2005 have been tracked (Deomano, 2006a); however, the NPPOs of other countries lack data on 
the exact numbers of WPM units fumigated.  As part of the analyses for the China Interim Rule 
Environmental Assessment (EA), a comprehensive review of all U.S. Customs entries was 
conducted to ascertain the number of entries containing WPM.  The combined effort of 
reviewing entries by U.S. Customs and APHIS conservatively estimated that 30 percent of all 
entries were packed with WPM.  Use of this estimated percentage of entries containing WPM 
has been applied to calculations of the number of WPM units in all documentation since the 
China Interim Rule EA.  It was also recognized that individual U.S. Customs entries may pertain 
to a single pallet, a single container, or multiple containers.  In the absence of detailed 
information, the average U.S. Customs entry is viewed to pertain to one cargo container and 
calculations are based upon fumigation of WPM for that unit size.         
 
The general equation used in this SEIS for calculation of the metric tons (MT) of methyl bromide 
released from WPM fumigations in 2005 is as follows: 
 
MT of methyl bromide = (# of U.S. Customs entries with WPM) x
Text Len: 1585
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PM for that unit size.         
 
The general equation used in this SEIS for calculation of the metric tons (MT) of methyl bromide 
released from WPM fumigations in 2005 is as follows: 
 
MT of methyl bromide = (# of U.S. Customs entries with WPM) x (fraction of WPM entries 
fumigated with methyl bromide) x (lbs methyl bromide per entry) x (0.45359237 kg/lb) x 
(1 MT/1,000 kg) x (fraction of total methyl bromide applied that is vented from fumigation 
chamber)

The equation consists of two constants used for converting the weight in pounds to the weight in 
MT and of four variables: 
 
The derivation of the first variable, # of U.S. Customs entries with WPM, was described above.   
 
The second variable, the fraction of WPM entries fumigated with methyl bromide, is based upon 
information provided by the NPPOs of the country/countries being analyzed.   
 
The third variable, pounds of methyl bromide per entry, is dependent upon the manner in which 
the fumigations are conducted.  It is derived partly from information about the conduct of 
fumigations provided by the NPPOs of the country/countries being analyzed 
and from the quantity of methyl bromide required to fumigate WPM in that manner.  The 
mathematical derivation of this variable for different fumigation processes is provided

 fumigations are conducted.  It is derived partly from information about the conduct of 
fumigations provided by the NPPOs of the country/countries being analyzed 
and from the quantity of methyl bromide required to fumigate WPM in that manner.  The 
mathematical derivation of this variable for different fumigation processes is provided in the 
second paragraph that follows.   
 
The fourth variable, fraction of the total methyl bromide applied that is vented from the 
fumigation chamber, relates to the sorption of methyl bromide by WPM.  This sorption of methyl 
bromide precludes its release to the atmosphere and, therefore, poses no risk of damage to the 
ozone layer.  The percentage of methyl bromide vented from fumigations of durable goods, such 
as WPM, was determined to range from 69 to 79 percent of the total methyl bromide applied 
(UNEP, MBTOC, 1998); therefore, the original lower estimates apply a fraction of 0.69, and the 
original higher estimates apply a fraction of 0.79.  This percentage of methyl bromide vented 
from fumigations of durable goods was revised upward in a more recent document (page 69 of 
UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) to range from 76 to 88 percent of total methyl bromide applied, so 
present lower estimates apply a fraction of 0.76 and present higher estimates apply a fraction of 
0.88.   
  
The mathematical derivation of the third variable, pounds of methyl bromide per entry, is 
dependent upon how the fumigation of WPM with methyl bromide is conducted.  Although all 
treatments of WPM are conducted with from
Text Len: 1555
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 fraction of 0.76 and present higher estimates apply a fraction of 
0.88.   
  
The mathematical derivation of the third variable, pounds of methyl bromide per entry, is 
dependent upon how the fumigation of WPM with methyl bromide is conducted.  Although all 
treatments of WPM are conducted with from 3 to 4 pounds of methyl bromide per 1,000 cubic 
feet of space, the relative methyl bromide usage per unit treated may be increased by fumigating 
WPM that is already loaded with other cargo, as occurs at some locations in China, or decreased 
by fumigating the wood pieces prior to assembling the WPM unit, as occurs in Japan.  Most 
shippers neither fumigate the wood pieces prior to assembling WPM units nor load WPM with 
cargo prior to fumigation, but the methyl bromide estimates in this SEIS consider 
comprehensively the manner in which the WPM units are fumigated.   
 
There are five different methods of fumigation of WPM that have been commonly used and are 
considered in this SEIS.  If there is no information available about the manner in which WPM is 
being fumigated in a given country, the fumigation is presumed to occur in tarped containers 
after cargo is already loaded on the WPM.  This provides a conservatively high estimate for 
those countries where data are lacking.  Other methods are applied to countries where reliable 
information about compliance has been received.  The fumigation methods, quantities of methyl 
bromide associated with each method, and a representative example of calculations used in this 
SEIS for each method are as follows:

Range of lbs of methyl bromide/entry = 0.18 to 0.432 lbs 
 
Example of Method 5— Japan, where fumigation occurs prior to loading, for the 5 to 10% of 
WPM that is fumigated. 
 
Variables specific to this calculation: 
# of U.S. Customs entries with WPM = 742,134 entries 
Fraction of WPM entries fumigated with methyl bromide = 0.05 (low) to 0.1 (high)  
lbs methyl bromide per entry = 0.18 pounds (low) to 0.432 pounds (high) 
 
Lower estimate = 742,134 x 0.05 x 0.18 lbs x 0.45359237 kg/lb x 1 MT/1,000 kg x 0.76 = 2.3 MT 
 
Upper estimate = 742,134 x 0.1 x 0.432 lbs x 0.45359237 kg/lb x 1 MT/1,000 kg x 0.88 = 12.8 MT 
 
Other Factors Considered But Not Applied to Refine the Methyl 
Bromide Equation 
 
There are no hard figures for how much WPM is reused worldwide after cargo has been 
unloaded.  We know from life-cycle studies that some WPM can be reused for 8 to10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the loaded cargo (Deomano, 
2006b).  The United States does reuse treated pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are 
collected about how much WPM is reused.  Review of the present rate of reuse in the 
United States indicates that one of every

 8 to10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the loaded cargo (Deomano, 
2006b).  The United States does reuse treated pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are 
collected about how much WPM is reused.  Review of the present rate of reuse in the 
United States indicates that one of every two WPM units is recycled and reused for shipping 
another load of cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  Some countries are known to recycle more WPM than 
the United States; however, information about the actual rates of reuse by other countries is not 
readily available.  Accordingly, we did not apply this information to any refinements of the 
methyl bromide release model.  By disregarding this issue in the quantitative analysis, our 
calculated figures overestimate the number of WPM units treated by 50% or more.  The lower 
usage of methyl bromide associated with less frequent need to treat WPM is, therefore, not 
reflected in the present estimates of methyl bromide released or in previous estimates from the 
final environmental impact statement.  As information related to this topic becomes available, 
continuing refinements of the methyl bromide estimates may be made in the future to more 
closely reflect actual usage.   
 
Some commodities are not marketable if fumigated with methyl bromide; some agricultural 
commodities lack a tolerance for bromine residues; some commodities, such as leather, react 
with methyl bromide such that strong odors are imparted to the product; and some commodities, 
such as electronics, may be damaged by reaction with methyl bromide.  Treatment of such 
commodities is precluded from methods, such as methyl bromide fumigation after loading

 for bromine residues; some commodities, such as leather, react 
with methyl bromide such that strong odors are imparted to the product; and some commodities, 
such as electronics, may be damaged by reaction with methyl bromide.  Treatment of such 
commodities is precluded from methods, such as methyl bromide fumigation after loading, due 
to the loss of product.  When the assumption is made that the predominant method of fumigation 
in China occurs to WPM with cargo already loaded, it is known that the calculations from this 
E–6 Appendix E.  Calculations
Appendix E. Calculations  E–7  
assumption will overstate the release of methyl bromide.  This is clearly true for the early 
estimates made for the China interim rule and for the present analysis in this SEIS where this 
assumption was applied to China and other countries lacking information regarding their 
treatment methodology for ISPM 15 compliance.  Although there is no detailed data available to 
support a precise estimate of methyl bromide usage in our model, this approach does ensure that 
underestimation of potential release of methyl bromide from fumigations for China and these 
other countries does not occur in this model.

Methyl Bromide Labels 
Table 1 summarizes the differences between existing methyl bromide (MB) 
labels and MB manufactured after October 1, 2016. For more detailed 
information, refer to the Treatment Manual. 
Table 1  MB Label Comparison 
Existing MB Labels Instructions 2016 MB Labels Instructions 
1. Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) 
required when MB air concentrations are ≥5 ppm. 
No respirator requirements when air concentra-
tions are below 5 ppm. 
SCBA still required when MB air concentrations are ≥5 
ppm; however, when concentrations are between 1 and 
5 ppm, air-purifying respirators with a cartridge certified 
for protection from MB at concentrations up to 5 ppm 
(specifics are described in the label) must be worn (or 
SCBA). 
2. Only SCBA respirator users must be fit tested 
and fit checked. Fit testing for other respirator 
equipment were not discussed because they 
were not required. 
All respirator users must be fit tested, fit checked, and 
examined by a qualified medical practitioner to ensure 
physical ability to safely wear the style of respirator worn. 
3. MB detection devices (Draeger and other colori-
metric tubes) are permitted to have a detection 
limit of 5 ppm. 
MB detection devices must have a detection limit of 0.5 
ppm. CPHST recommends one labeled device for PPQ 
use,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

physical ability to safely wear the style of respirator worn. 
3. MB detection devices (Draeger and other colori-
metric tubes) are permitted to have a detection 
limit of 5 ppm. 
MB detection devices must have a detection limit of 0.5 
ppm. CPHST recommends one labeled device for PPQ 
use, the Rae® Systems MiniRae 3000. PPQ Field Opera-
tions Raleigh hub will distribute the devices to each State 
Plant Health Director for further distribution to PPQ field 
offices. 
4. Exposure to MB air concentrations between 1 
ppm and 5 ppm is not required to be monitored. 
Exposure to MB air concentrations must be monitored 
for persons not wearing respirators but working in an 
area where concentrations are between 1 and 5 ppm. 
These workers are subject to Work Time Restrictions of 1 
ppm over an 8 hour work period. The exposure time is 
reduced to 90 minutes when concentrations are between 
3 and 5 ppm. No monitoring required if concentrations 
fall below 1 ppm. 
5. When not wearing respiratory equipment, air con-
centration monitoring is performed as appropriate 
to ensure concentrations do not exceed 5 ppm. 
No respiratory equipment necessary. 
When air concentrations are between 1 and 5 ppm and 
respiratory equipment with cartridges are worn (i.e. not 
SCBA), then monitoring must be performed every hour 
(unless a continuous real-time detection device is 
installed) to ensure that concentrations do not exceed 5 
ppm.

6. The label does not require buffer zones. PPQ 
requires buffer zones of 30 feet during treatment 
and 200 feet during the first 10 minutes of aera-
tion. 
The label requires buffer zones. The contracted fumiga-
tor will determine and communicate to PPQ officers the 
buffer zones for each enclosure based upon EPA’s Buffer 
Zone Table. This table is calculated based on enclosure 
size, dosage, and height of exhaust stack. If the buffer 
zones fall within PPQ’s standard 30/200 ft buffer zone, 
then PPQ officers will continue to use PPQ’s existing buf-
fer zones, bearing in mind the new respirator require-
ments for lower air concentrations. 
7. Aeration for Section 18 Treatments: PPQ must 
ensure that aeration is conducted properly. Aera-
tion period ends when concentrations in the 
exhaust ducts fall to 5 ppm; no minimum aeration 
time is required. 
Aeration for Non-Section 18 Treatments: The 
fumigator is responsible for following aeration 
requirements. 
Aeration for Section 18 Treatments: PPQ must ensure 
that aeration is conducted properly. Aeration period ends 
when concentrations in the air space around the com-
modity fall to

time is required. 
Aeration for Non-Section 18 Treatments: The 
fumigator is responsible for following aeration 
requirements. 
Aeration for Section 18 Treatments: PPQ must ensure 
that aeration is conducted properly. Aeration period ends 
when concentrations in the air space around the com-
modity fall to 5 ppm AND a minimum of 4 hours for active 
aeration (mechanical fan) OR 12 hours for passive aera-
tion (no fan) has elapsed. 
Aeration for Non-Section 18 commodities: The fumi-
gator remains responsible for following aeration require-
ments.

Executive Summary 
 
The United States has faced an ongoing and increasing threat from 
harmful invasive alien species (pests and pathogens) found in the solid 
wood packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in 
international trade.  Coping with the risks posed by these pest and disease 
organisms has become an increasingly important issue for most countries 
as international trade expands.  The dynamic nature of international trade

 in the solid 
wood packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in 
international trade.  Coping with the risks posed by these pest and disease 
organisms has become an increasingly important issue for most countries 
as international trade expands.  The dynamic nature of international trade 
and our increasing knowledge of the pest and pathogen risks associated 
with WPM make it important for the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to continue 
to review and consider additional changes to the regulations, as needed.  
The final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was prepared in August 
2003 for the present WPM regulations.  This supplement to the WPM 
FEIS refines APHIS’ previous quantitative analysis of the expected 
environmental impact associated with international compliance with 
APHIS’ current WPM regulations.       
 
The final rule for importation of WPM (September 16, 2004, 69 Federal 
Register (FR) 55719, Docket No. 02–032–3) was promulgated to provide 
APHIS with a means to lower the pest risk associated with WPM

framework of international agreements to which the United States is a

Interim Rule (September 18, 1998, 63 FR 50099, Docket No. 98–087–1; 
amended December 17, 1998, 63 FR 69539, Docket No. 98–087–4), 
interceptions from other parts of the world continued to rise.  Serious 
environmental and economic threats posed from untreated WPM imparted 
a degree of urgency to the rulemaking process.  The mitigation strategy 
provided by the International Plant Protection Convention’s (IPPC) 
“Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International 
Trade” (International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 
(ISPM 15)) set an effective standard that was uniform and equitable to all 
nations.   
 
The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) and FEIS for WPM 
were published in October, 2002 and August, 2003, respectively.  One 
concern voiced during the comment process was over environmental risks 
associated with the usage of the fumigant, methyl bromide, as a treatment 
to mitigate pest risks.  Of particular concern was the potential of methyl 
bromide to deplete the atmosphere’s ozone layer.  Since no countries were 
yet obligated to comply with ISPM 15 guidelines at the time of 
preparation of the WPM FEIS, APHIS lacked quantitative data about 
actual worldwide usage of methyl bromide for this purpose.

iv.  Executive Summary  
Regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) 
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) 
provide that agencies may prepare supplements to a final EIS whenever 
“the agency determines that the purposes of the Act will be furthered by 
doing so.”  This supplement to the WPM FEIS focuses on preparing a 
more accurate methyl bromide estimate to ensure that the NEPA 
documentation adequately informs the decisionmaker and the public about 
the anticipated environmental impact of the WPM regulation.  Since the 
promulgation of WPM regulations by many countries to meet the ISPM 15 
guidelines, actual information is now available about how exporters in 
many countries comply with these regulations.  The specific information 
now available regarding how exporters in different countries actually 
comply with ISPM 15 is new information that is relevant to environmental 
concerns and bears upon the analysis of potential impacts of the actions 
associated with APHIS’ wood packaging rule.  Therefore, this specific 
information is used in this supplement to the WPM FEIS to refine the 
methyl bromide use estimates provided in the FEIS.  This supplementation 
will allow our analysis to more completely and accurately reflect the 
compliance that is occurring and the potential environmental impacts 
associated with that compliance.   
 
The quantitative range for the refined methyl bromide use estimate (822 to 
2,351 metric tons (MT) per year) is more narrow than the range 
determined in the WPM FEIS (384 to 4,630 MT per year), but it is 
encompassed within the range of the estimate from the WPM FEIS

The quantitative range for the refined methyl bromide use estimate (822 to 
2,351 metric tons (MT) per year) is more narrow than the range 
determined in the WPM FEIS (384 to 4,630 MT per year), but it is 
encompassed within the range of the estimate from the WPM FEIS.  
Although the refined estimates determined for this supplement more 
accurately portray the range of methyl bromide used for ISPM 15 
compliance than previous estimates, the dynamic nature of trade and 
compliance with trade-related regulations result in the ongoing need for 
review because this information reflects only the most recent information 
received.  The availability of information about compliance by exporters 
in some countries is still lacking and, for these countries, this supplement 
applies conservative assumptions designed to err in favor of 
overestimating their methyl bromide usage.  Through agreement with the 
provisions of the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer, many countries are gradually phasing out the uses of methyl 
bromide for which alternatives exist, including those uses for WPM.  
However, methyl bromide for quarantine and preshipment (QPS), as well 
as for critical uses, is expected to be needed for an extended period of 
time, such that review of the use of WPM is anticipated to continue at 
APHIS to ensure that future allotments do not exceed present projections.                          
 
Any future selection of alternatives, other than those presently enforced by

support a comprehensive risk reduction program or a phaseout of WPM to 
substitute packaging material, but the dynamic nature of trade and 
phytosanitary regulations may influence further development of the risk-
reducing strategies involved in these alternatives.  It is conceivable that 
future phytosanitary guidelines negotiated under the IPPC could provide 
the framework for further mitigating pest or pathogen risk through 
additional limitations on packaging materials.  In the meantime, APHIS 
must continue to address the phytosanitary risks by reducing the threat of 
invasive species in a manner that promotes the harmonization of 
international regulatory efforts and the facilitation of trade.

I.  Introduction 
 
A.  Background 
 
With the continual increase of worldwide trade, there has been a concern 
for an increasing threat from harmful invasive alien species (pests and 
pathogens) detected on materials used for trade.  Specifically, these 
harmful invasive alien species have been detected on solid wood 
packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in international 
trade.  Wooden pallets, crating, and dunnage can harbor environmentally

 concern 
for an increasing threat from harmful invasive alien species (pests and 
pathogens) detected on materials used for trade.  Specifically, these 
harmful invasive alien species have been detected on solid wood 
packaging material (WPM) that accompanies shipments in international 
trade.  Wooden pallets, crating, and dunnage can harbor environmentally 
and economically harmful species that use the wood as host material, feed 
upon it, or hitch a ride on it.  It is the role of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) to protect against harmful invasive alien species and to safely 
facilitate trade.  The regulations in 7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
319.40–1 through 319.40–11 contain provisions to mitigate plant pest 
risks presented by the importation of logs, lumber, or other 
unmanufactured wood articles.   
 
The regulations restrict the importation of many types of wood articles 
including wood packaging material such as pallets, crates, boxes, and 
pieces of wood used to support or brace cargo.  On September 16, 2005, a 
rule was implemented to enforce the USDA–APHIS import regulation for 
WPM (see appendix D).  The 2004 final rulemaking requires WPM, such 
as pallets, crates, and boxes, used in international trade to support or brace 
cargo, to be treated to prevent the introduction of harmful insects to U.S. 
agriculture and to natural, cultivated, and urban forest resources. 
 
WPM is often reused, recycled, or remanufactured.  The implementation 
of the final rule published on September 16, 2004, enabled companies to

agriculture and to natural, cultivated, and urban forest resources. 
 
WPM is often reused, recycled, or remanufactured.  The implementation 
of the final rule published on September 16, 2004, enabled companies to 
use WPM that complies with ISPM 15 guidelines promulgated by the 
International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) for import and export 
purposes.  Using WPM that has been treated and marked, in accordance 
with the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 
(ISPM 15) guidelines, assures the receiving country that the WPM present 
within a shipment has been treated. 
 
B.  Historical Perspective  
 
Forest ecosystem diversity, function, and productivity have been 
dramatically altered by the introduction of exotic insects and pathogens.  
Historically, outbreaks of the Asian longhorned beetle, (Anoplophora 
glabripennis (Motschulsky)), pine shoot beetle, (Tomicus piniperda (L.)), 
and the emerald ash borer, (Agrilus planipennis (Fairmaire)) have been

traced to importations of WPM.  The brief history of introduction into the 
United States for Asian longhorned beetle, pine shoot beetle, and emerald 
ash borer follows below. 
 
• Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) is a native of China and was first 
found in the United States 1996 in New York City and Amityville, 
NY (on Long Island).  Since then it has been found in Chicago, 
Summit, and Addison, Illinois

• Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) is a native of China and was first 
found in the United States 1996 in New York City and Amityville, 
NY (on Long Island).  Since then it has been found in Chicago, 
Summit, and Addison, Illinois.  Scientists believe that the beetle 
entered the United States via wooden crates and pallets used in 
shipping cargo from China.  The only way to get rid of ALB is to 
cut down, chip, and burn the infested trees.  Since 1996, more than 
3,000 trees have been destroyed to eradicate this pest in New York 
and Illinois (USDA, APHIS, 2006a). 
 
• Pine shoot beetle (PSB) was discovered at a Christmas tree farm 
near Cleveland, Ohio, in July 1992.  The only previous U.S. 
infestation of PSB occurred in New Jersey in 1913.  It is believed 
that PSB was probably introduced into the United States in 1992 
by foreign ships carrying PSB-infested wood as dunnage (USDA, 
APHIS, 2002c).  Since the 1992 introduction, PSB has been 
detected in 16 States.  Quarantines have been established in those 
States to restrict the movement of regulated articles in order to 
prevent the artificial spread of PSB. 
 
• Emerald ash borer (EAB) was identified as the causative agent in 
ash tree mortality and decline in Detroit, Michigan.  EAB was 
unknown in North America until June, 2002.  Since 2002, EAB has 
established infestations in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and 
Maryland.  Qu

• Emerald ash borer (EAB) was identified as the causative agent in 
ash tree mortality and decline in Detroit, Michigan.  EAB was 
unknown in North America until June, 2002.  Since 2002, EAB has 
established infestations in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and 
Maryland.  Quarantines have been established in those States 
which have become infested with EAB.  Under the quarantine, ash 
trees, branches, logs, and firewood are prohibited from movement 
from affected counties (USDA, APHIS, 2006b).  
 
Following APHIS’ confirmation of these and other pest risks associated 
with WPM, mitigating measures, risk analyses, and environmental 
analyses were developed to assist decisionmakers about how best to 
protect U.S. forests from such pest risks.  Environmental analyses for 
those rulemakings were necessary to address the potential environmental 
impacts associated with the implementation of each rulemaking.  The 
treatment of WPM, specifically, the options of heat treatment and methyl 
bromide fumigation, were assessed to consider potential impacts to the 
human environment, including public health.  Of importance in regard to 
methyl bromide fumigations is its capacity to damage the atmosphere’s 
ozone layer.   
I.  Introduction   3  
The WPM FEIS assessed the methyl bromide treatments for WPM and the 
potential environmental impacts of such compliance.  In addition, the 
FEIS and supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) entitled

Articles,” (USDA, APHIS, 1998a),

 FEIS assessed the methyl bromide treatments for WPM and the 
potential environmental impacts of such compliance.  In addition, the 
FEIS and supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) entitled 
“Importation of Logs, Lumber, and Other Unmanufactured Wood 
Articles,” (USDA, APHIS, 1998a), the environmental assessment (EA) for 
the China Interim Rule (USDA, APHIS, 1998b), and the FEIS entitled, 
“Rule for the Importation of Unmanufactured Wood Articles From 
Mexico, With Consideration for Cumulative Impact of Methyl Bromide 
Use” (USDA, APHIS, 2002a), also included analysis of methyl bromide 
usage and its impact to the environment.   
 
C.  Relationship to the Rulemaking Process 
 
This supplement to the WPM FEIS provides additional information for the 
decisionmaker to determine whether the previous decision to amend the 
regulations regarding importation of WPM should remain in force as is or 
whether further changes should be promulgated through the rulemaking 
process at this time.  This determination will be published in a Record of 
Decision (ROD) in the Federal Register after completion of the final SEIS.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepared a notice of 
availability of the draft SEIS which included provisions for a public 
comment period from March 9 to April 23, 2007 (March 9, 2007, 72 FR 
10749, Docket No. ER–FRL–6684–7).  Interested parties requested that 
APHIS extend the comment period to provide additional time for technical 
review, and APHIS granted an extension of the comment period until June 
25, 2007 (

comment period from March 9 to April 23, 2007 (March 9, 2007, 72 FR 
10749, Docket No. ER–FRL–6684–7).  Interested parties requested that 
APHIS extend the comment period to provide additional time for technical 
review, and APHIS granted an extension of the comment period until June 
25, 2007 (May 25, 2007, 72 FR 29294, Docket No. APHIS–2006–0152).  
APHIS received a total of four public comments on the draft SEIS.  Those 
comments are presented and the substantive issues from those comments 
are addressed in appendix A.  Any substantive comments on the final 
SEIS received by APHIS up to 30 days after publication by EPA of the 
notice of availability in the Federal Register will be considered before 
publication of the ROD (40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2)).  
 
Although there have been treatments for wood pests for many years, there 
was no programmatic effort to mitigate the associated pest risks of WPM 
until the China Interim Rule in 1998.  This rule consisted of two separate 
notices (September 18, 1998, 63 FR 50099, Docket No. 98–087–1 and an 
amendment on December 17, 1998, 63 FR 69539, Docket No. 98–087–4).  
The rule was promulgated to readily respond to the rapidly increasing pest 
risks to wood traced to importations of WPM from China and Hong Kong.  
The interim rule provided very little phase-in time due to the serious 
nature of the pest risks and the immediate need for mitigation of those 
risks.  The EA for the China Interim Rule (USDA, APHIS, 1998b)

 the rapidly increasing pest 
risks to wood traced to importations of WPM from China and Hong Kong.  
The interim rule provided very little phase-in time due to the serious 
nature of the pest risks and the immediate need for mitigation of those 
risks.  The EA for the China Interim Rule (USDA, APHIS, 1998b) was 
published in September, 1998.  The lack of a phase-in period was 
recognized in this EA prepared for the rule by applying the presumption 
that all imported WPM from China and Hong Kong would be fumigated

after loading.  Although this approach for estimation of methyl bromide 
usage was known to be conservatively high, initially it was not considered 
to be outside the possible range of application.  It was recognized that 
some heat treatment and more conservative usage of methyl bromide 
(treatment of WPM before loading) were anticipated in, at least, the long-
term, but the lack of historical data about actual compliance prevented 
calculation of a refined estimate of methyl bromide usage in the treatment 
of WPM to be imported from China and Hong Kong to the United States.    
 
Although the interceptions of invasive species in WPM from China and 
Hong Kong decreased subsequent to promulgation of the China Interim 
Rule, interceptions on WPM from other parts of the world continued to 
rise.  It was clear that the pest risk from these locations would also need to 
be mitigated.  Concurrent with APHIS’ deliberations on potential

Hong Kong decreased subsequent to promulgation of the China Interim 
Rule, interceptions on WPM from other parts of the world continued to 
rise.  It was clear that the pest risk from these locations would also need to 
be mitigated.  Concurrent with APHIS’ deliberations on potential 
regulatory options to address the pest risk from WPM from other 
countries, the international community, through the IPPC, became aware 
of the pests associated with WPM and began to consider comparable 
approaches to alleviate pest risks associated with international trade.  This 
international effort to address pest risks ultimately resulted in the 
guidelines negotiated for regulating WPM in international trade that were 
published by the IPPC Secretariat (2002) in ISPM 15.  The international 
negotiations and revisions of these guidelines are expected to continue.   
 
APHIS recognized that the ISPM 15 guidelines provided a firm basis for 
amendments to our regulations and, consequently, APHIS promulgated a 
final rule that established regulations for importation of WPM that were 
consistent with those guidelines negotiated in ISPM 15.  APHIS’ final rule 
on Importation of Wood Packaging Material was published on September 
16, 2004 (69 FR 55719, Docket No. 02–032–3), and was designed to 
provide mitigations for the potential pest risks from importation of WPM 
worldwide (see appendix D).  The regulations established by this final rule 
replaced those regulations promulgated under the China Interim Rule.   
 
Unlike the regulations imposed by the China Interim Rule, those countries 
whose WPM was subject to importation requirements under the final 
WPM rule were aware of the pending change in regulations and

worldwide (see appendix D).  The regulations established by this final rule 
replaced those regulations promulgated under the China Interim Rule.   
 
Unlike the regulations imposed by the China Interim Rule, those countries 
whose WPM was subject to importation requirements under the final 
WPM rule were aware of the pending change in regulations and were 
provided a phase-in period for compliance with those changes.  This 
phase-in period ensured that importers had time to prepare for the 
regulatory treatments of WPM.  Concurrent to this phase-in period, there 
were decreases in methyl bromide (phaseout) for many usages that were 
regulated under the Montreal Protocol.  Although quarantine treatments 
(including those for WPM) were not directly subject to phaseout under  
this international agreement, many countries began to work on alternate 
treatments for fumigation with methyl bromide (such as heat treatment of 
WPM) and some were permitting only heat treatment for WPM.  Although 
there were many factors that contributed to the estimates of methyl

bromide usage in the FEIS, the presumption that methyl bromide 
treatments of WPM would always be applied after the WPM was loaded 
with cargo did not realistically reflect actual usage.  The estimates of  
methyl bromide usage for alternatives presented in the FEIS for 
Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material (USDA, APHIS, 2003)  
sought to make allowance for methods, such as heat treatment and 
fumigation of methyl bromide, prior to loading with cargo.  The

 FEIS for 
Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material (USDA, APHIS, 2003)  
sought to make allowance for methods, such as heat treatment and 
fumigation of methyl bromide, prior to loading with cargo.  The 
characterization of compliance was, however, incomplete in that most 
countries, at that time, had not yet established their requirements for 
compliance with regulations of transported WPM.  Much of this 
supplement to the FEIS examines how countries have actually complied 
with WPM regulations since and, based on that examination, seeks to 
refine APHIS’ early estimates of methyl bromide usage to more accurately 
reflect actual release from fumigation treatments of WPM. 
 
The overall worldwide usage of methyl bromide continues to decline as 
the phaseout requirements of the Montreal Protocol are met by those 
countries that are signatories to this international agreement.  The 
worldwide consumption of methyl bromide was 63,960 MT in 1996 
compared to 36,866 MT in 2005 (United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP), (Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee 
(MBTOC), 2007).  This 42 percent reduction in usage of methyl bromide 
relates almost exclusively to compliance with the phaseout requirements 
of the Montreal Protocol.  It is known that some countries (most notably 
China) have increased their overall usage of methyl bromide, but those 
increases by individual countries have not changed the overall worldwide 
trend towards reduction in usage of methyl bromide.  Even China has 
committed to reduce emissions of methyl bromide from fumigations 
(UNEP, 2003; Beijing Times, 2003; Mercado, 1999).  The impetus for

 of methyl bromide, but those 
increases by individual countries have not changed the overall worldwide 
trend towards reduction in usage of methyl bromide.  Even China has 
committed to reduce emissions of methyl bromide from fumigations 
(UNEP, 2003; Beijing Times, 2003; Mercado, 1999).  The impetus for 
permitting fumigation of WPM with methyl bromide in the final WPM 
rule was to provide an economical means of compliance for those 
developing countries with limited resources to ensure their ability to 
export products loaded on WPM to the United States.  This approach also 
ensured that other countries would accept product shipments from the 
United States that meet the ISPM 15 guidelines.   
 
In accordance with applicable international agreements, APHIS does 
consider changes in its regulations governing phytosanitary issues in trade 
if those measures are transparent, technically justified, and no more 
restrictive of trade than necessary to achieve an appropriate level of 
phytosanitary protection.  This ensures that any changes in our regulations 
adhere to principles of the IPPC.  Should it become evident that the usage  
of methyl bromide fumigation in the treatment of WPM is no longer 
needed by developing countries in order to meet phytosanitary 
requirements (due to increased availability of substitute packaging 
materials and other treatment measures in all affected countries), and that

6  I.  Introduction   
the elimination of methyl bromide fumigation is “not more trade 
restrictive than required to achieve [an] appropriate level of sanitary or 
phytosanitary protection,” as is specified by provisions of the agreement 
on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS 
agreement) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), then APHIS will 
consider further rulemaking for WPM.  Presently, the usage of heat 
treatment of WPM is the only equivalent to fumigation with methyl 
bromide for shippers who depend upon WPM.  The continuing phaseout 
of methyl bromide favors expanded usage of heat treatment of WPM.  It is 
also possible, over time, that market forces may favor expanded use of 
substitute packaging materials such that methyl bromide fumigation of 
WPM may not be needed to ensure the unrestricted flow of trade.  
However, present trade heavily depends upon WPM, and fumigation with 
methyl bromide remains important enough for the shipping industry of 
some countries that circumstances do not justify immediate elimination of 
this treatment measure.  Therefore, APHIS will continue to monitor and 
review trade conditions to determine if there is any need for further 
rulemaking.

review trade conditions to determine if there is any need for further 
rulemaking.    
 
International guidelines, such as ISPM 15, are subject to ongoing review 
and negotiation among the contracting parties to the IPPC.  Changes to 
those guidelines do not necessarily require APHIS to promulgate rule 
changes, but any changes in phytosanitary requirements that APHIS 
intends to enforce on the shipping industry would require revisions to the 
present regulations.  Various negotiations to amend certain aspects of the 
ISPM 15 guidelines are in the process of review by IPPC contracting 
parties.  APHIS monitors these negotiations for potential substantive 
changes that could result in the need for further rulemaking.  Changes to 
the IPPC guidelines could also require environmental documentation to 
address the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) issues 
associated with those anticipated rule changes.  In particular, there has 
been some concern by IPPC contracting parties that the initial methyl 
bromide treatment schedule for WPM did not achieve the desired 
reduction in pest risk.  Any changes in application rate would certainly 
require supplemental environmental documentation.  Other potential 
treatment changes would need to be reviewed to determine whether they 
would result in any changes in environmental effects.   
 
Since the initial methyl bromide fumigation treatment schedule of Annex I 
of ISPM 15 (IPPC, 2006), there has been one revision approved by the 
IPPC (FAO, 2006).  This revision does not propose any changes in the  
dosage for specific temperatures; however, the proposed minimum 
concentrations of methyl bromide within the fumigation enclosure need to 
remain elevated for longer durations of time.  The

dosage for specific temperatures; however, the proposed minimum 
concentrations of methyl bromide within the fumigation enclosure need to

dosage or rate indicates that methyl bromide usage would not increase.  
The revised treatment schedules are designed to eliminate pest risk

without the need for additional usage of methyl bromide.  More recently, 
APHIS proposed an interim rule to amend the wood packaging regulations 
to reflect the revisions to the treatment schedule (June 1, 2007, 72 FR 
30460, Docket No. APHIS–2006–0129).  Recent review of this change in 
the treatment schedule indicates that retention of methyl bromide for these 
longer durations of time can be achieved with adherence to best practices; 
however, anecdotal evidence suggests that some fumigators are increasing 
the initial charge of methyl bromide to compensate for potential leakage to 
ensure adequate concentrations without the need to retreat or top up 
concentrations during the fumigation (page 291 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  Although the revised schedule does not require more usage and 
any adjustments to our methyl bromide usage estimates, APHIS will 
continue to keep track of such revisions to ISPM 15 and review the 
potential environmental impacts.

The WPM FEIS (USDA, APHIS, 2003) was prepared in order to consider 
the potential environmental impacts of the proposal and alternatives, in 
accordance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality’s 
(CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the 
NEPA.  The findings of that document are incorporated by reference in 
this SEIS and are summarized below.  Alternatives considered within the 
FEIS included (1) no action (no change in the current regulation),  
(2) extend the treatments in the China Interim Rule to all countries,  
(3) adoption of the IPPC “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging 
Material in International Trade” (the proposed alternative), (4) a 
comprehensive risk reduction program, and (5) substitute packaging 
materials only.  Each alternative contains an array of component control 
methods. 
 
Although each alternative (excluding no action) was determined to have 
the potential to lower pest risk associated with WPM, each alternative 
(including no action) has the potential for adverse environmental 
consequences.  Under NEPA, those consequences are the aggregate of 
their individual effectivenesses (efficacies) and the direct and indirect 
impacts (including cumulative impacts) of their component control 
methods.  The no action alternative would result in the greatest degree of 
risk from invasive species, with impacts from component control methods 
that would be expected to increase as international trade

  Under NEPA, those consequences are the aggregate of 
their individual effectivenesses (efficacies) and the direct and indirect 
impacts (including cumulative impacts) of their component control 
methods.  The no action alternative would result in the greatest degree of 
risk from invasive species, with impacts from component control methods 
that would be expected to increase as international trade increases.   
 
Extension of the treatments, in the China Interim Rule, to all countries 
would substantially reduce the pest risk from invasive species, but would 
have the greatest potential for adverse environmental impact from its 
component control methods.  Adoption of the IPPC guidelines also would

provide substantial reduction of pest risk, with substantial environmental 
impact from its component control methods.   
 
A comprehensive risk reduction program could provide substantial 
reduction of pest risk, with variable impact from its component control 
methods, depending upon which methods were selected.  It is not feasible 
to design different combinations of methods for compliance of various 
countries, at present.  Further, based upon the prevalence of pests within 
those countries, a determinative process to support such a practice would 
not be scientifically or economically practical.  For the comprehensive risk 
reduction program alternative to be practical and worthy of detailed 
consideration by APHIS, the array of approved treatments for this 
alternative would have to be universally applicable and available equally 
to all countries.   
 
Substitute packing materials only (prohibition of WPM), as suggested in 
the FEIS, would achieve the greatest reduction of pest risk with the least 
environmental impact from its component control methods, but would 
generate some impacts from the manufacturing process.  The capability of

 to be universally applicable and available equally 
to all countries.   
 
Substitute packing materials only (prohibition of WPM), as suggested in 
the FEIS, would achieve the greatest reduction of pest risk with the least 
environmental impact from its component control methods, but would 
generate some impacts from the manufacturing process.  The capability of 
industry to tool up to manufacture and switch to substitute packaging 
materials for such large shipping volumes would limit the feasibility or 
implementation of a switch over.  At present, the increased cost of 
substitute packaging materials relative to WPM and limited application of 
substitute packaging materials to niche markets do not provide the 
flexibility needed to fulfill the global trade needs. 
 
The potentially affected environment for the proposed action, as discussed 
in the FEIS, includes the United States (confronted with threats to its 
agricultural and environmental ecosystems), the other nations (which 
would sustain environmental impacts because of measures required by 
U.S. import requirements), and the Global Commons (which also could 
sustain environmental impacts because of measures required by U.S. 
import requirements).  Of particular concern is the potential effect of 
increased use of the fumigant methyl bromide, a chemical that has the 
capacity to damage the atmosphere’s ozone layer.  The stratospheric ozone 
layer shields life on our planet from the harmful effects of ultraviolet 
radiation.  The potential impact from increased usage of methyl bromide is  
mitigated by the availability of other treatments for WPM, the availability 
of other packaging materials, and the phaseout of many uses of ozone-
depleting chemicals (including methyl bromide other than those critical 
uses and quarantine and preship

 the harmful effects of ultraviolet 
radiation.  The potential impact from increased usage of methyl bromide is  
mitigated by the availability of other treatments for WPM, the availability 
of other packaging materials, and the phaseout of many uses of ozone-
depleting chemicals (including methyl bromide other than those critical 
uses and quarantine and preshipment (QPS) uses that are presently 
exempted).   
 
The rationale to adopt the IPPC guidelines, rather than selecting one of the 
other alternatives, involved a number of factors.  First, the serious 
environmental and economic threats imparted a degree of urgency to the 
I.  Introduction   9  
WPM rulemaking process.  Although APHIS continues to work on a long-
term resolution to the pest-risk problems associated with WPM, the 
agency needed an effective mitigation strategy capable of being 
implemented over the short term.  Data were available to support the 
effectiveness of the treatments approved under the IPPC guidelines against 
many pests of concern to APHIS; however, efficacy data for other 
treatment options were lacking.  There were substantial logistical and 
operational barriers associated with some of the alternatives, even though 
they may pose less environmental impact.   
 
APHIS remains committed to developing regulations that reduce the threat 
of invasive species yet which promote the harmonization of international 
mitigation efforts and the facilitation of trade.  The development of new 
regulations, therefore, depends upon technological progress and 
international negotiations to provide an efficient mechanism for 
addressing phytosanitary risks associated with WPM.  Thus, the FEIS 
considered environmental, economic, scientific, and social factors in an

 efforts and the facilitation of trade.  The development of new 
regulations, therefore, depends upon technological progress and 
international negotiations to provide an efficient mechanism for 
addressing phytosanitary risks associated with WPM.  Thus, the FEIS 
considered environmental, economic, scientific, and social factors in an 
effort to derive an appropriate and effective strategy for the regulation of 
imported WPM.

II.  Purpose and Need 
 
The purpose of this SEIS is to reevaluate and refine estimates of methyl 
bromide usage in the treatment of WPM.  This document is consistent 
with APHIS’ intent to further review WPM issues as more data and 
information are now available.  At the time that the methyl bromide 
estimates in the WPM FEIS were prepared, there was uncertainty due to 
the limited information available about compliance (see FEIS on pages  
A–7 to A–9).  Regulations promulgated by CEQ pursuant to NEPA 
provide that agencies may prepare supplements to a final EIS whenever 
“the agency determines that the purposes of the Act will be furthered by 
doing so.”  This SEIS has been prepared to refine the information 
provided in the FEIS in light of new information available and intended to

reviewing the refined information and determining if and how this 
information will impact the current rule.  The refined information may 
have any number of impacts to the current WPM rule including further 
deliberation, amendments to the current rule, or no changes to the current 
rule.

III.  Environmental Impact Analysis 
 
The focus of this SEIS is the refinement of methyl bromide estimates from 
compliance with APHIS’ WPM regulations.  The limited available data 
provided a rough predictive estimate in the FEIS.  More reliable 
information and more data on actual compliance have since been sought to 
improve the previous estimates to more accurately reflect actual methyl 
bromide usage in the treatment of WPM.  Although information continues 
to be collected about the treatment methods used by different countries to 
comply with ISPM 15, some data gaps continue to exist and some 
uncertainty remains.  Quality information does exist for the compliance 
treatments in some countries, but reporting in other countries is often 
limited, lacking, or compiled for overall consumption purposes (not

  Although information continues 
to be collected about the treatment methods used by different countries to 
comply with ISPM 15, some data gaps continue to exist and some 
uncertainty remains.  Quality information does exist for the compliance 
treatments in some countries, but reporting in other countries is often 
limited, lacking, or compiled for overall consumption purposes (not solely 
for WPM treatment).  There are a number of different ways that one can 
quantitatively calculate the release of methyl bromide to the atmosphere 
from compliance with ISPM 15.  These calculations can continue to be 
refined as more accurate and more complete information is received. 
 
Reporting of overall methyl bromide usage by many countries is sparse.  
The annual reporting requirements of the UNEP Secretariat for methyl 
bromide have increased the overall reporting and those requirements 
include a follow-up for data quality assurance.  Such reporting was 
reviewed for relative consistency with our findings.  All international 
reporting requirements relate to total methyl bromide production or 
consumption including both usage for QPS and usage for non-QPS 
purposes.  There has been no formal reporting mechanism established for 
specific QPS applications, such as treatment of WPM, until recently. 
Reporting of the QPS production of methyl bromide in 2004 amounted to 
10,660 MT (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The amount used for 
QPS treatment of wooden packing materials was determined to account 
for 6.4 percent of the overall QPS usage or 679 MT.  Data were, however, 
not received for 16 of the 70 parties reporting non-zero consumption of 
QPS methyl bromide.  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS

QPS treatment of wooden packing materials was determined to account 
for 6.4 percent of the overall QPS usage or 679 MT.  Data were, however, 
not received for 16 of the 70 parties reporting non-zero consumption of 
QPS methyl bromide.  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS 
purposes rose from 10,660 MT in 2004 to 13,815 MT in 2005, with the 
3,155 MT increase attributed by UNEP largely to implementation of ISPM 
15 for treatment of WPM (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  Other than usage by 
China to comply with the China Interim Rule, there was virtually no usage 
for WPM prior to 2005 when most countries promulgated WPM 
regulations; therefore, this 3,155 MT would largely be attributed to 
countries other than China and Hong Kong.  However, the QPS reporting 
to UNEP for allowances in 2005 included some changes in the use 
designations from 2004.  For example, some methyl bromide treatment 
uses classified as critical use exemptions in the United States in 2004 were 
reclassified in 2005 as QPS based upon export preshipment requirements 
(EPA, OPP, 2005).  The result of this reporting change was that 1,209 MT 
of the methyl bromide used in the United States in 2005 classified as QPS 
 
14  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
would have been classified as critical use exemptions in 2004 and prior 
years.  This 1,209 MT increase in QPS reporting by the United States in 
2005 for articles other than WPM accounts for over one-third of the total 
increase in QPS cited by UNEP (3,155 MT).  Such inconsistencies in 
reporting make

would have been classified as critical use exemptions in 2004 and prior 
years.  This 1,209 MT increase in QPS reporting by the United States in 
2005 for articles other than WPM accounts for over one-third of the total 
increase in QPS cited by UNEP (3,155 MT).  Such inconsistencies in 
reporting make any cause-effect relationship for numerical changes 
between individual years tenuous, at best.  The meaning and importance of 
this rough cumulative data is discussed further in this chapter in relation to 
the refined estimates with the recognition that the total methyl bromide 
attributed to WPM worldwide (3,155 MT and 679 MT = 3,834 MT) in 
2005 (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) may not accurately reflect actual usage for 
this purpose due to reporting inconsistencies that exist.        
 
An attempt was made in this SEIS to gather the best available information 
for the majority of WPM treatments.  This involved requesting compliance 
information for those countries that are most heavily involved in world 
trade.  For those countries with reliable compliance data, quantitative  
analysis was the most direct.  For those countries lacking compliance data, 
methyl bromide estimates were based upon projections of the highest 
likely usage.  For many of the larger trading countries, compliance data 
was available in a form that permitted accurate estimations.  Most of these 
countries provided a percentage of the number of units of WPM that were 
fumigated.  The annual estimates in this SEIS assess only a given year in 
time.  Trying to account for future increases in world trade and other 
external factors without clear market trends would be speculative, and no 
attempt has been made to factor this into

time.  Trying to account for future increases in world trade and other 
external factors without clear market trends would be speculative, and no 
attempt has been made to factor this into this analysis.  In addition, there 
are a wide range of chamber and tarpaulin enclosures that are used in 
methyl bromide fumigations.  Limited data are available about the relative 
frequency of use of each type of fumigation enclosure; therefore, 
representative fumigation methods were applied to each treatment scenario 
based upon the compliance data provided by the National Plant Protection 
Organization (NPPOs) contacted in each country.   
 
Cumulative methyl bromide usage data includes those WPM treatments 
associated with ISPM 15 compliance by the United States and other WPM 
treatments in world trade not directly related to APHIS’ WPM rule.  This 
includes those countries already subject to compliance treatments under 
the China Interim Rule.  This issue is addressed separately from other 
methyl bromide usage for QPS and non-QPS purposes.  
 
A.  Early Methyl Bromide Estimates for Wood and the 
China Interim Rule 
 
Estimates of the quantities of methyl bromide released from fumigation of 
wood products were first made for the EIS entitled Importation of Logs, 
Lumber, and Other Unmanufactured Wood Articles (USDA, APHIS, 
1998a).  The methods developed for that EIS were adjusted for use in

Lumber, and Other Unmanufactured Wood Articles (USDA, APHIS, 
1998a).  The methods developed for that EIS were adjusted for use in 
III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  15  
estimation of methyl bromide usage in the EA for China Interim Rule.  A 
large part of the quantitative analysis in the China Interim Rule EA 
(USDA, APHIS, 1998b) was tied to the presumption that the lack of 
phase-in time for Chinese exporters to prepare for compliance with the 
rule would result in most, if not all, WPM being fumigated with methyl 
bromide and all fumigations being conducted to WPM that was already 
loaded with cargo.  The capability of shippers to apply heat treatment, 
wood preservative treatments, or to treat WPM by fumigation with methyl 
bromide prior to cargo loading on such short notice was unknown.  Thus, 
the quantitative estimate for methyl bromide used in fumigation resulting 
from this rule was an intentionally high projection that presumed only 
fumigation of already loaded WPM.   
 
Although it was recognized that the shipping industry in China would 
gradually use other available methods, the rough estimate for methyl 
bromide usage calculated for the China Interim Rule was considered 
appropriate as an initial estimate with the recognition that the projected 
usage per unit of WPM would diminish as the industry compliance 
strategies developed.  Those early estimates disregarded issues such as 
treatment availability, reuse of WPM, lack of tolerances for methyl 
bromide of some agricultural commodities, lack

 usage calculated for the China Interim Rule was considered 
appropriate as an initial estimate with the recognition that the projected 
usage per unit of WPM would diminish as the industry compliance 
strategies developed.  Those early estimates disregarded issues such as 
treatment availability, reuse of WPM, lack of tolerances for methyl 
bromide of some agricultural commodities, lack of compatibility of some 
commodities (e.g., leather goods and electronic parts) with methyl 
bromide, and unique fumigation practices; the estimates also did not 
consider the rapidly increasing trade with China in any projections.  The 
result was an estimate that was higher than initial actual usage by China, 
but not necessarily unreasonable given the increasing trade (eightfold 
increase from 1997 to 2005) that has occurred since that time.  The 
potential quantity of methyl bromide determined in the EA for the China 
Interim Rule was estimated to range from 1,040 to 12,565 MT annually.  
However, the total methyl bromide produced in China in 2002 for all uses, 
including not only use on WPM but all QPS and non-QPS usage, 
amounted only to 3,175 MT (BeijingTimes, 2003; UNEP, 2003) therefore, 
the upper tail of this early estimate is clearly higher than the actual 
consumption that occurred in China.    
 
Another assumption in the EA was that the fumigations would occur 
primarily within containers covered by tarps, as is normally done for 
treatments of loaded cargo, to comply with APHIS regulations.  However, 
rather than tarping containers, many of those Chinese shippers who were 
fumigating containers with already loaded cargo were generally testing 
those containers for air

 that the fumigations would occur 
primarily within containers covered by tarps, as is normally done for 
treatments of loaded cargo, to comply with APHIS regulations.  However, 
rather than tarping containers, many of those Chinese shippers who were 
fumigating containers with already loaded cargo were generally testing 
those containers for airtightness, releasing methyl bromide directly into 
the closed containers, and often sealing those containers for shipment prior 
to complete aeration.  There were some initial human health concerns 
expressed by inspectors and workers about the lingering residues of 
methyl bromide in these containers from this practice.  The aeration of 
such containers has increased since that time to ensure the safety of those  
 
16  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
working with such containers.  This direct treatment of sealed containers 
did result in less use of methyl bromide than had been projected for 
fumigation of containers covered by tarps.  
 
The actual application rates analyzed for the China Interim Rule were 
based upon those in the APHIS treatment manual (USDA, APHIS, 1998d) 
at that time.  The application rates ranged from 3 to 5 pounds per 
1,000 cubic feet of space for a 16-hour period of time.  Subsequent  
analyses were based upon the application rates cited in ISPM 15, that is, 
3 to 4 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a 16-hour period of time.  
Although this usage rate of 5 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet contributed to a 
conservatively high methyl bromide estimate in the analysis of the EA for 
the China Interim Rule, the changes in trade and compliance by China and 
Hong

, 
3 to 4 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a 16-hour period of time.  
Although this usage rate of 5 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet contributed to a 
conservatively high methyl bromide estimate in the analysis of the EA for 
the China Interim Rule, the changes in trade and compliance by China and 
Hong Kong since that time are encompassed within that initial projected 
methyl bromide estimate.  
 
B.  Application of Early Estimates to Assess 
Cumulative Impacts 
 
Shortly after completion of the EA for the China Interim Rule, a draft EA 
was completed for the Proposed Rule for the Importation of Wood 
Articles from Mexico (USDA, APHIS, 1998c).  EPA, in its comments on 
this document, suggested the agency analyze potential cumulative impacts 
of methyl bromide for the quarantine uses required by APHIS.  This 
cumulative issue was then addressed through the preparation of an FEIS 
entitled “Rule for the Importation of Unmanufactured Wood Articles 
From Mexico, With Consideration for Cumulative Impact of Methyl 
Bromide Use” (USDA, APHIS, 2002a).  Most anticipated pending 
quarantine uses of methyl bromide, when added to the present usage, were 
considered to pose negligible cumulative risk; however, the pending 
worldwide regulation of WPM was considered to require closer review.  
This FEIS applied the conservative, quantitative methodology used in the 
China Interim Rule EA to project methyl bromide estimates for a global 
wood packaging rule that was first being analyzed in the DEIS for the 
importation of unmanufactured wood articles from Mexico.  The 
quantitative methyl bromide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WPM was considered to require closer review.  
This FEIS applied the conservative, quantitative methodology used in the 
China Interim Rule EA to project methyl bromide estimates for a global 
wood packaging rule that was first being analyzed in the DEIS for the 
importation of unmanufactured wood articles from Mexico.  The 
quantitative methyl bromide estimate using that methodology gave a 
potential range of 8,536 to 102,893 MT per year; however, the same 
paragraph discussed the conservative nature of this estimate and indicated 
that the actual increase of methyl bromide usage would be closer to one-
twentieth of those projected quantities.  This was the first recognition of 
the need to refine WPM methyl bromide estimates for methyl bromide 
usage to provide more realistic data for pending agency decisions.   
 
The Mexican Unmanufactured Wood DEIS also acknowledged the limited 
information about compliance with WPM treatment.  The DEIS 
recognized that fumigations are generally directed at the pest risks in the 
III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  17  
cargo being treated and there was no particular reason for treating cargo 
when the target organism was in the WPM.  However, the lack of 
available compliance data for WPM treatments made it difficult to project 
actual methyl bromide usage, and the decision was made to consider this 
issue more closely in the EIS for importation of WPM that was being 
worked on during and after completion of this Mexican Unmanufactured 
Wood EIS.

C.  Estimates From the Final Environmental Impact 
Statement 
 
The methyl bromide estimates prepared for the draft and final EIS for 
Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material (USDA, APHIS, 2002b; 
USDA, APHIS, 2003) involved a systematic review of potential usage to  
provide more realistic data for program decisions.  The limited data 
available did not provide a clear methodology that could be readily 
applied to worldwide compliance with WPM regulations.  The analysis 
did consider the influence of certain factors on likely compliance.  The 
factors included— 
  
• the size of a U.S. Customs entry,  
• the presence of WPM within a U.S. Customs entry,  
• the likely method of treatment (methyl bromide fumigation vs. heat 
treatment),  
• the manner of methyl bromide application,  
• the application rate, the amount of methyl bromide vented from the 
treatment stack by fumigation,  
• the compatibility of methyl bromide with associated cargo,  
• logistics and cost factors for shippers from other countries,  
• the potential reuse of treated WPM, and  
• implications of compliance method on international agreements.

Compliance Data

D.  Refined Methyl Bromide Estimation Based Upon 
Compliance Data 
 
We now have information about the manner in which many IPPC 
contracting parties actually comply with ISPM 15 and APHIS’ WPM rule; 
therefore, previous model assumptions are refined in this analysis to more 
accurately and completely assess potential methyl bromide release from 
compliance with the rule.  This analysis reflects information regarding 
compliance for calendar year 2005 which includes more than twice as 
many U.S. Customs entries as in the previous analysis (based on 1997 
data) due to recent increases in world trade.  This increase in world trade 
would normally be expected to result in, at least, a doubling in the 
estimated usage of methyl bromide to comply with ISPM 15 if compliance 
 
18  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
were consistent with earlier methyl bromide usage model assumptions.  
However, the information about actual compliance indicates greater usage 
of heat treatment than methyl bromide fumigation by most major trading 
countries.  In addition, regular treatment of WPM after cargo loading, 
which requires more extensive methyl bromide usage, has been verified to 
occur only for some U.S. Customs entries originating in China (USDA, 
APHIS, 1999).   
 
Treatment of WPM after cargo loading involves fumigation of up to 
20-fold more space than for treatment of WPM before cargo loading, thus, 
the usage of methyl bromide is commensurately greater for fumigations of 
WPM after cargo loading.  Although such methyl bromide fumigation of 
loaded cargo from China does increase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of WPM after cargo loading involves fumigation of up to 
20-fold more space than for treatment of WPM before cargo loading, thus, 
the usage of methyl bromide is commensurately greater for fumigations of 
WPM after cargo loading.  Although such methyl bromide fumigation of 
loaded cargo from China does increase the overall release of methyl 
bromide and associated concerns about potential impacts to stratospheric 
ozone, this usage is considerably less than the worldwide reductions of 
methyl bromide already made in compliance with the phaseout of methyl 
bromide required under the Montreal Protocol, and the impact of this 
WPM treatment with methyl bromide on ozone depletion is dwarfed by 
the effects of chlorofluorocarbons and other compounds with ozone-
depleting potentials that exceed methyl bromide.  QPS treatment of wood 
packaging materials in 2004 was determined to account for 6.4 percent of 
the overall QPS usage or 679 MT (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  
Reported increased production of methyl bromide for QPS purposes 
totaled 3,155 MT more in 2005, much of which was associated with 
worldwide ISPM 15 compliance (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The 
association of this increase with WPM was discussed earlier in this SEIS 
and is tenuous due to reporting inconsistencies (see pages 12 to 13).  
When one compares this roughly 3,834 MT usage increase to the reported 
27,094 MT reduction in methyl bromide consumption from 1996 to 2005 
(page 35 UNEP, MBTOC, 2007), it is clear that the WPM usage amounts 
are considerably less use than

 is tenuous due to reporting inconsistencies (see pages 12 to 13).  
When one compares this roughly 3,834 MT usage increase to the reported 
27,094 MT reduction in methyl bromide consumption from 1996 to 2005 
(page 35 UNEP, MBTOC, 2007), it is clear that the WPM usage amounts 
are considerably less use than the amounts being phased out.  As the 
phaseout provisions of the Montreal Protocol are met and the degradation 
of chlorofluorocarbons with long half-lives progresses, stratospheric ozone 
recovery will occur.   
 
Ongoing review in the 2006 Scientific Assessment (NOAA et al., 2007) 
indicates that the Montreal Protocol is working and there are some early 
signs of stratospheric ozone recovery (page xxxv, Executive Summary in 
NOAA et al., 2007).  The projected date for stratospheric ozone recovery 
to return to the 1980 baseline selected by UNEP as its milestone is 2065 if 
current trends continue (page xxxv of the Executive Summary).  This 
assessment further indicates that a number of potential regulatory options 
are available to accelerate the recovery of the ozone layer by phasing out 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) production and consumption.  The 
associated reduction in stratospheric ozone depletion relative to the full 
recovery of the 1980 baseline projected for phaseout of all methyl bromide

uses in 2005 (36,866 MT consumption) (page 16 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007) amounts to only 5 percent (NOAA et al., 2007).  This topic is 
discussed in more detail later in this chapter in regard to the refined 
methyl bromide estimates in this SEIS; however, the potential impact on 
stratospheric ozone from anthropogenic usage of methyl bromide does 
justify continuing agency efforts to seek more economical and efficacious 
alternatives to methyl bromide for phytosanitary treatment purposes, 
including those related to packaging material regulations. 
 
The refinements to the methyl bromide calculations in this supplement 
include a closer analysis of the manner in which individual countries 
actually comply with wood packaging regulations.  This involves more 
comprehensive analyses of information on— 
  
• how exporters in individual countries select their method of treatment 
(methyl bromide fumigation vs. heat treatment),  
• the manner of methyl bromide application,  
• the amount of methyl bromide vented from the fumigation,  
• the potential reuse of treated WPM, and  
• any implications of compliance method on international agreements.   
 
Each of these issues influence the amount of methyl bromide fumigation 
of WPM used in compliance with ISPM 15 and are used in the SEIS to 
refine the methyl bromide estimates to the extent possible.  Mathematical 
equations, representative calculations, and descriptions of ISPM 15 
compliance by country are described in detail in appendix E.

of WPM used in compliance with ISPM 15 and are used in the SEIS to 
refine the methyl bromide estimates to the extent possible.  Mathematical 
equations, representative calculations, and descriptions of ISPM 15 
compliance by country are described in detail in appendix E.           
 
Most calculations used to determine the estimates of methyl bromide 
usage resulting from compliance with APHIS’ WPM regulations in this 
SEIS rely upon U.S. Customs data related to import entries.  None of the 
NPPOs in the various countries provided any data about the actual 
quantity of WPM relative to other packaging materials for their exports; 
therefore, the previous estimate (30 percent) used to determine the number 
of U.S Customs entries with WPM in the FEIS was applied to the present 
calculations when information about actual numbers of treated units or the 
total amount of methyl bromide were unavailable.  There is some 
variability in the types of packaging material used worldwide; however, 
the earlier review of U.S. Customs entries investigated the packaging 
materials over a broad range of commodity import groups to ensure that 
the percentage accurately reflected the proportion of U.S. Customs import 
entries that use WPM. 
 
The descriptions of treatment methods used by exporters in a given 
country were determined primarily from the information provided by the  
NPPOs of various countries about how they comply with ISPM 15.  The 
effort to seek compliance data focused on those countries with larger trade

to the United States; however, information was sought for all major 
trading markets.  The questions posed to these authorities were designed to 
ascertain the amount of methyl bromide fumigation in compliance with 
ISPM 15.  Information was sought from the responding authorities 
regarding their usage of methyl bromide relative to their usage of heat 
treatment for compliance with ISPM 15, the manner in which such 
treatments are conducted, total methyl bromide usage where available, and  
any information about the quantity of WPM relative to other packaging 
materials.  The NPPOs contacted by APHIS responded as part of their 
ongoing cooperation with APHIS to facilitate common trade interests.  
Previous information about phytosanitary trade issues from these sources 
has been reliable.  Although some NPPOs were unable to provide detailed 
information for their respective country, the responses were sufficient for 
a thorough refinement of the earlier methyl bromide estimates.     
 
Certain countries have specific requirements that limit their exporters to 
heat treatment or substitute packaging materials.  This includes a number 
of countries in the European Union and closely associated countries.  The 
European Union has indicated their intent to eliminate all methyl bromide 
fumigation where other alternatives or substitutes are available and 
acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health (Regulation of 
the European Parliament and Council, 2000).  Some other countries treat 
WPM for export solely by heat treatment, most notably Thailand

European Union has indicated their intent to eliminate all methyl bromide 
fumigation where other alternatives or substitutes are available and 
acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health (Regulation of 
the European Parliament and Council, 2000).  Some other countries treat 
WPM for export solely by heat treatment, most notably Thailand 
(Unahawutti, 2006).  In recent years, the United States and Canada have 
been routinely treating WPM by heat treatment to eliminate pine wood 
nematode risk to meet phytosanitary requirements of the European Union 
and China.  This practice of heat treatment of softwoods used in packaging  
materials has continued and has expanded to cover most WPM for foreign 
destinations.  There is still, however, some fumigation of hardwoods with 
methyl bromide in the United States for use as WPM, but it is a relatively 
limited practice.   
 
Specific country authorities provided information about their use of heat 
treatment in compliance with ISPM 15.  The NPPO in Japan indicates that 
90 to 95 percent of their WPM for export is heat treated (Kani, 2006).  
Although most WPM for export from Korea is heat treated, exports to 
Norway and Russia are usually fumigated with methyl bromide, according 
to the NPPOs in those countries (Kim, 2006).  The NPPO in Chile, Marcos 
Beeche, states that 80 to 85 percent of their WPM for export is heat treated 
(Cohen, 2006).  The NPPO in Taiwan indicates that almost all of their 
WPM for export is heat treated and use of methyl bromide, for this 
purpose, is expected to be totally phased out in 2010 or 2015

WPM for export is heat treated and use of methyl bromide, for this

packing industry is subject to compliance with ISPM 15-related 
regulations promulgated by other countries; therefore, the Canadian NPPO 
was also contacted to get compliance information.  Canada has no

certification system for methyl bromide for exports of WPM; however, 
they do provide exporters with a phytosanitary certificate if fumigation 
with methyl bromide is the only alternative in specific situations (Thomas, 
2006).  Thus, Canada complies with ISPM 15 primarily through the use of 
heat treatment with limited fumigation allowed, as needed.  Although 
Mexico was not initially subject to APHIS’ wood packing rule, the 
requirements have been extended to Mexico separately (69 FR 
165:52409–52419).  The authority from the Mexican Forestry Health 
Office indicates that 92 percent of the WPM for export from Mexico is 
heat treated (Ramos, 2006).   
 
As is evident from the responses received, those countries whose NPPOs  
responded to our recent request for information about compliance with

treatment method used.  There were several countries that

As is evident from the responses received, those countries whose NPPOs  
responded to our recent request for information about compliance with 
ISPM 15 overwhelmingly indicated that heat treatment is the predominant 
treatment method used.  There were several countries that lacked adequate 
data to respond to our questions about ISPM 15 compliance.  In particular, 
Brazil has only collected data about overall methyl bromide usage, but not 
specific data for ISPM 15 compliance (Franz, 2006).  China lacks data 
about overall compliance with ISPM 15 (Chou, 2006).  The refinement of 
methyl bromide estimates for China in this SEIS relies upon data from a 
previous agency trip report (USDA, APHIS, 1999) that included visits to 
specific port and other treatment facilities of WPM in China.  There is an 
ongoing agency effort to continue to get accurate information about the 
compliance of other countries with ISPM 15; however, meaningful 
responses from the NPPOs of those countries for documentation have not 
yet been received.  For those countries that lack data about frequency of  
treatment method, the analysis applies heat treatment to half of the WPM 
and fumigation with methyl bromide to the other half of the WPM.  
Relevant information has been received for compliance from our most 
important trading partners.  As other authorities respond to our request for 
information, the quantitative value of the methyl bromide estimates can be 
refined accordingly.

 from our most

information, the quantitative value of the methyl bromide estimates can be 
refined accordingly.   
 
Although most calculations used to determine the estimates of methyl 
bromide usage resulting from compliance with APHIS’ WPM regulations 
in this SEIS are based upon U.S. Customs data related to import entries, 
one country (Nicaragua) provided information specific to WPM.  The 
response from the NPPO for the country of Nicaragua provided actual data 
that showed annual usage of 1,010.5 pounds for the first year of 
compliance with ISPM 15 regulations (Hernandez, 2006).   
Thus, the estimate for Nicaragua is based upon actual usage data.   
 
The data for methyl bromide treatment of WPM for export from the 
United States is maintained by the National Wooden Pallet and Container 
Association (NWPCA).  NWPCA tracks the number of WPM units that 
are fumigated each year.  In calendar year 2005, the United States

fumigated 855,047 WPM units for this purpose (Deomano, 2006a).  This 
NWPCA information is used in the determination of the cumulative 
methyl bromide estimates for the United States’ compliance with ISPM 
15.  Unlike the available export data from NWPCA, comparable data 
about the number of WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide annually 
are not available for import entries to the United States; therefore, 
estimates for

 is used in the determination of the cumulative 
methyl bromide estimates for the United States’ compliance with ISPM 
15.  Unlike the available export data from NWPCA, comparable data 
about the number of WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide annually 
are not available for import entries to the United States; therefore, 
estimates for all countries, other than Nicaragua, are calculated using U.S. 
Customs entry data. 
 
Although China has committed to eventually reduce their usage of methyl 
bromide (UNEP, 2003; Beijing Times, 2003, Mercado, 1999), the rate of  
reduction of this usage for treatment of WPM, over time, is likely to be 
tied to their propensity to continue to promote export trade.  The original 
estimate for the China Interim Rule was based upon analysis of already 
loaded WPM and projected an estimate ranging from 1,040 to 12,565 MT 
per year (USDA, APHIS, 1998b).  The comparable estimate for China, 
from the FEIS, was based upon analysis of WPM not already loaded and 
projected a range of 52 to 628 MT per year.  Subsequent review of the 
information from a trip report (USDA, APHIS, 1999) to China suggests 
that some ports are complying exactly as the FEIS suggests and other ports 
are continuing to treat containers of WPM with already loaded cargo as 
had been projected in the analysis for the China Interim Rule.  For 
example, the port at Tianjin requires the exporter to heat treat or fumigate 
WPM prior to loading of cargo.  On the other hand, Shanghai permits  
fumigation either before or after cargo loading.  At the ports of 

Text Len: 1577
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 with already loaded cargo as 
had been projected in the analysis for the China Interim Rule.  For 
example, the port at Tianjin requires the exporter to heat treat or fumigate 
WPM prior to loading of cargo.  On the other hand, Shanghai permits  
fumigation either before or after cargo loading.  At the ports of 
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, most of the WPM is fumigated prior to cargo 
loading; however, occasional fumigation of containers with loaded cargo 
occurs due to vessel departure constraints.  Most fumigations in Shenzhen 
are conducted at company sites rather than at port facilities.  There was no 
survey conducted at these company sites to determine the method of 
compliance with WPM regulations; therefore, no information is available 
about how the company sites in Shenzen fumigate packing material.   
 
While data on overall production and consumption of methyl bromide 
have been reported to UNEP by China (NOAA et al., 2007; UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007), it is unclear how much is applied to fumigation of WPM.  
The total methyl bromide production capacity of China=s three producers 
was 7,620 MT in 2002, but only 3,175 MT were produced that year 
(BeijingTimes, 2003; UNEP, 2003).  Recent response from the NPPO in 
China indicates their lack of any recent data compiled for the ongoing 
compliance with ISPM 15 (Chou, 2006).  Based upon the information 
obtained from the 1999 trip report and more recent contacts, this 
supplement conservatively refines the methyl bromide estimates based 
upon treatment directly into already loaded containers.  The methyl

 their lack of any recent data compiled for the ongoing 
compliance with ISPM 15 (Chou, 2006).  Based upon the information 
obtained from the 1999 trip report and more recent contacts, this 
supplement conservatively refines the methyl bromide estimates based 
upon treatment directly into already loaded containers.  The methyl 
bromide resulting from China’s compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule, 
using this conservative approach in this SEIS, ranges from 2,027 to

6,188 MT per year.  Relative to the 3,175 MT of methyl bromide produced 
by China in 2002 for all uses (Beijing Times, 2003; UNEP, 2003), this 
projected range for the methyl bromide estimate is clearly elevated.  In the 
absence of more definitive information from the Chinese NPPO, the 
methyl bromide estimates in our documentation for China will remain 
uncertain and conservatively high. 
 
Information about the manner in which methyl bromide fumigation 
treatments are conducted in given countries was received from responses 
submitted by most of the NPPOs in those countries contacted by APHIS.  
The majority of the countries that responded and permit fumigation of 
methyl bromide in compliance with ISPM 15 report that those fumigations 
occur to the WPM prior to cargo loading.  This includes responses from 
Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan 
(Kim, 2006; Morales, 2006; Cohen, 2006; Chen, 2006; Thomas, 2006; 
Ramos, 2006).  The majority of fumigation of WPM in Japan is applied to

 cargo loading.  This includes responses from 
Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan 
(Kim, 2006; Morales, 2006; Cohen, 2006; Chen, 2006; Thomas, 2006; 
Ramos, 2006).  The majority of fumigation of WPM in Japan is applied to 
lumber before actual assembly of the wood packaging unit (Kani, 2006).   
 
China is the only country where methyl bromide fumigation of loaded 
cargo is known to occur regularly.  The predominant manner of methyl 
bromide fumigation for other countries that permit its usage occurs prior 
to loading of cargo.  This is to be expected based upon the multiple factors 
discussed previously in the FEIS.  However, for calculation purposes, in  
this SEIS, the application of analysis based upon fumigation of WPM 
prior to cargo loading is restricted to only those countries for which 
adequate compliance information is available.  For conservative purposes, 
calculations for those other countries from which compliance data are 
lacking are subject to analysis based upon fumigation of already loaded 
cargo.  Our inquiries to the NPPOs focused on those countries with the 
greatest trade with the United States (those countries with the most U.S. 
Customs entries); therefore, a considerable proportion (greater than 71 
percent) of those entries from countries who permit methyl bromide 
fumigation are subject to analysis under the scenario for treatment of 
unloaded cargo.  
 
In addition to the issue of actual treatment (including or excluding cargo), 
the method of fumigation does influence the quantity of methyl bromide 
needed for treatment.  Although both chamber and tarp fumigations are

In addition to the issue of actual treatment (including or excluding cargo), 
the method of fumigation does influence the quantity of methyl bromide 
needed for treatment.  Although both chamber and tarp fumigations are 
used in the treatment of WPM, the decision was made to apply only tarp 
fumigations to the methyl bromide estimate calculations in the FEIS in the 
absence of complete data about the relative frequency of each type of 
fumigation.  This approach results in conservatively high projections; 
however, it provides a reasonable approximation for the variability in 
treatment methods.  More recently, we have learned that many Chinese 
exporters are using a unique and specific fumigation procedure that differs 
from the chamber and tarp fumigations used elsewhere.  This procedure is

discussed in section III.A. regarding the estimates for the China Interim 
Rule.  Rather than tarping containers, many of those Chinese shippers who 
were fumigating containers with already loaded cargo were conducting 
tests of those containers for airtightness, releasing methyl bromide directly 
into the closed containers, and sealing the entrance to those containers for 
fumigations. 
 
The practice of fumigating containers with already loaded cargo without 
tarping results in considerably less usage of methyl bromide than occurs if 
those containers are tarped for fumigation.  For example. the amount of 
methyl bromide required for fumigation

 and sealing the entrance to those containers for 
fumigations. 
 
The practice of fumigating containers with already loaded cargo without 
tarping results in considerably less usage of methyl bromide than occurs if 
those containers are tarped for fumigation.  For example. the amount of 
methyl bromide required for fumigation of a sealed 40-foot container in 
China amounts to only 9.6 to 12.8 pounds as compared to 16.2 to 21.6 
pounds for the standard tarp fumigation of the same container.  Likewise, 
the amount of methyl bromide required for fumigation of a sealed 20-foot 
container in China amounts to only 4.8 to 6.4 pounds as compared to 9 to 
12 pounds for the standard tarp fumigation of the same container.  
Although previous methyl bromide estimate calculations had not 
considered this factor, the refined assessment, in this SEIS, of the 
cumulative methyl bromide estimate for China applies their unique 
manner of fumigation for all methyl bromide projections.   
 
The methyl bromide estimates for countries where compliance data are 
lacking use those values for the standard tarp fumigation with already 
loaded cargo for 20 to 40-foot containers, as cited above.  The amount of 
methyl bromide used to treat WPM prior to loading varies with the amount 
of WPM.  The previous estimate in the FEIS considered that the quantity 
of methyl bromide required for treatment of a given WPM unit before 
cargo loading would amount to about one-twentieth of that for loaded 
cargo.  This amounts to a range of 0.45 to 1.08 pounds of methyl b

 varies with the amount 
of WPM.  The previous estimate in the FEIS considered that the quantity 
of methyl bromide required for treatment of a given WPM unit before 
cargo loading would amount to about one-twentieth of that for loaded 
cargo.  This amounts to a range of 0.45 to 1.08 pounds of methyl bromide 
per WPM unit for standard tarp fumigations of unloaded WPM.  This 
approach is used to project methyl bromide estimates for those countries 
who indicate treatment of WPM occurs prior to cargo loading.  Likewise, 
some exporters from China and Hong Kong have been fumigating 
unloaded WPM in chambers or containers.  This amounts to a range of 
0.24 to 0.64 pounds of methyl bromide per WPM unit for container 
fumigations of unloaded WPM.   
 
Although we know that China does fumigate unloaded WPM at certain 
ports, such as Tianjin (USDA, APHIS, 1999), our estimates for China are 
based upon fumigation of already loaded cargo, as previously mentioned.  
On the other hand, the estimates for Hong Kong are based upon 
fumigation of unloaded WPM using the above method.  Based upon 
records of U.S. Customs import entries, much of the cargo shipped from 
Hong Kong comes from southern parts of China, such as Guangzhou.  
These locations in southern China often move products by truck, and 
WPM treatment at Guangzhou occurs prior to loading for most shipments

 of China, such as Guangzhou.  
These locations in southern China often move products by truck, and 
WPM treatment at Guangzhou occurs prior to loading for most shipments 
III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  25  
(USDA, APHIS, 1999).  This manner of fumigation is more representative 
of the treatments applied to WPM from Hong Kong and more accurately 
estimates actual usage.      
 
In addition to the above approaches to methyl bromide fumigation of 
WPM, some WPM is constructed from wood that is fumigated prior to 
assembly.  This is the manner of treatment that occurs in Japan (Kani, 
2006).  Although it is known that this approach uses less methyl bromide,  
the quantity used in construction of the WPM varies.  Based upon review 
of methyl bromide treatments of other unmanufactured wood products, it  
is estimated that the methyl bromide usage for one container-sized 
treatment would cover 50 WPM units.  This amounts to a range of 0.18 to 
0.43 pounds of methyl bromide per WPM unit. 
 
The total quantity of methyl bromide emitted from a given fumigation is 
dependent upon the commodity being treated.  In the absence of good 
studies on sorption, the calculations in the draft and final WPM EIS 
applied an estimated 80 to 100 percent release of methyl bromide from the 
fumigation enclosure during venting after a treatment was completed.  
Actual studies have been done by UNEP to analyze the amount of methyl  
bromide sorbed to various commodities (UNEP, MBTOC, 1998; UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007).

lied an estimated 80 to 100 percent release of methyl bromide from the 
fumigation enclosure during venting after a treatment was completed.  
Actual studies have been done by UNEP to analyze the amount of methyl  
bromide sorbed to various commodities (UNEP, MBTOC, 1998; UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007).  Durable commodities, like WPM, were determined to 
adsorb certain quantities of fumigant.  The 1998 findings determined that  
the actual methyl bromide emitted from WPM and related commodities in 
fumigations amounted to a range of 69 to 79 percent of the total amount 
applied.  This information was used in refining the methyl bromide 
estimates to more closely determine potential impact to ozone from 
fumigations of WPM in the draft SEIS.  The more recent studies indicate 
that the percentage of methyl bromide emitted from durable commodities 
ranges from 76 to 88 percent of the total amount applied (page 16 of 
UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  This information was used to refine methyl 
bromide estimates in the final SEIS.       
 
The potential reuse of treated WPM is known to influence the amount of 
treatment of WPM for trade.  There are no hard figures for how much 
WPM is reused worldwide after cargo has been unloaded.  We know from 
life-cycle studies that some WPM can be reused for 8 to 10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the 
loaded cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  The United States does reuse treated 
pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are collected on how much 
WPM is reused.  Review of the present

life-cycle studies that some WPM can be reused for 8 to 10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the 
loaded cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  The United States does reuse treated 
pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are collected on how much 
WPM is reused.  Review of the present rate of reuse in the United States  
indicates that one of every two WPM units is recycled and reused for 
shipping another load of cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  Some countries are 
known to recycle more WPM than the United States.  However, 
information about the actual rates of reuse by other countries is not readily 
available.  Accordingly, we did not apply this information to any

refinements of the methyl bromide release model.  By disregarding this 
issue in the quantitative analysis, our calculated figures overestimate the  
number of WPM units treated by 50 percent or more.  The lower usage of 
methyl bromide associated with less frequent need to treat WPM is, 
therefore, not reflected in the present estimates of methyl bromide released  
or in any previous estimates in the FEIS or earlier documents.  It is 
expected that greater treatment will occur with initial ISPM 15 compliance 
due to the lack of treated WPM already in circulation, but the frequency of 
need to fumigate will decrease with reuse.  The lack of allowance for reuse 
in our analysis ensures that the methyl bromide estimates for initial 
compliance during the first year of enforcement are not understated, but

due to the lack of treated WPM already in circulation, but the frequency of 
need to fumigate will decrease with reuse.  The lack of allowance for reuse 
in our analysis ensures that the methyl bromide estimates for initial 
compliance during the first year of enforcement are not understated, but 
the extended use of treated WPM could indicate overestimation for future 
years.  As information related to this topic becomes available, continuing 
refinements of the methyl bromide estimates may be made in the future to 
more closely reflect actual usage.     
 
Implications of the compliance methods required by individual countries 
on international agreements and changes to international agreements affect  
the pest risks and the usage of methyl bromide.  Australia and New  
Zealand require all WPM to be debarked.  This requirement increases  
the effective control of some pests from methyl bromide and heat 
treatments (Biosecurity Australia, 2006).  The more rapid penetration of 
debarked wood, as compared to wood with bark, has not yet been 
suggested to justify changes to lower methyl bromide application rates, 
however, this topic may influence future regulations of WPM and other 
countries may require debarking of WPM to lower associated pest risks.  It 
is also unclear how debarking affects emissions of methyl bromide upon 
venting.   
 
Although U.S. trade with Australia and New Zealand is relatively limited, 
as compared to the global trade, this issue could be important if other 
countries choose to require debarking of WPM from foreign origins to 
meet their phytosanitary needs as well.  ISPM guidelines are subject to

Although U.S. trade with Australia and New Zealand is relatively limited, 
as compared to the global trade, this issue could be important if other 
countries choose to require debarking of WPM from foreign origins to 
meet their phytosanitary needs as well.  ISPM guidelines are subject to 
ongoing changes as various countries negotiate to ensure phytosanitary 
regulations meet their need to protect plant resources.  The present 
treatment schedule for methyl bromide fumigation, under ISPM 15, ranges 
from 3 to 4 lbs per 1000 cubic feet for 24 hours (FAO, 2006; IPPC 
Secretariat, 2005).  Future changes to the treatment schedule may not 
increase the application rate or necessitate the need for more usage of 
methyl bromide; however, APHIS continues to track proposed revisions to 
ensure that the potential impacts of all revisions to the international 
guidelines are considered.

some commodities, such as leather, react with methyl bromide such that 
strong odors are imparted to the product; and, some commodities, such as  
electronics, may be damaged by reaction with methyl bromide and, 
therefore, methyl bromide fumigation of such commodities is not 
permitted due to the loss of product.  This restriction on methyl bromide 
treatment limits fumigation of already loaded cargo to those commodities 
that can tolerate the chemical and residual effects of the treatment.

, methyl bromide fumigation of such commodities is not 
permitted due to the loss of product.  This restriction on methyl bromide 
treatment limits fumigation of already loaded cargo to those commodities 
that can tolerate the chemical and residual effects of the treatment.   
 
When the assumption is made that treatment of loaded cargo is the 
predominant method of fumigation in China, it is expected that the 
calculations from this assumption will overstate the methyl bromide 
estimate.  This was clearly true for the early estimates made for the China 
Interim Rule, and is true for the present analysis where this assumption 
was applied to China and to other countries lacking information regarding 
the manner of their treatment methodology for ISPM 15 compliance.  
Although there is no detailed data available to support a precise estimate 
of methyl bromide usage in our model, this approach helps to ensure that 
underestimation of potential release of methyl bromide from fumigations 
for China and these other countries does not occur for these estimates.  
 
World trade strongly influences how various countries comply with  
ISPM 15 guidelines.  China continues to use methyl bromide fumigation 
of loaded cargo to help facilitate more rapid export of their cargo for 
trading purposes.  The eightfold increase in U.S. Customs cargo entries 
from China from 1998 to 2005 shows their commitment to the promotion 
of trade with the United States.  Although other countries are also 
increasing their world trade, the overall increase in U.S. Customs entries is 
2.45-fold over the same time period.  As is clear from those responses 
received by APHIS from NPPOs of these other large trading partners, their

 promotion 
of trade with the United States.  Although other countries are also 
increasing their world trade, the overall increase in U.S. Customs entries is 
2.45-fold over the same time period.  As is clear from those responses 
received by APHIS from NPPOs of these other large trading partners, their 
countries are relying on heat treatment rather than methyl bromide 
fumigation for compliance with ISPM 15, and their changes in trade are 
not dramatically affecting their usage of methyl bromide.  Most countries 
have indicated that they plan to continue to decrease their usage of methyl 
bromide, particularly when there are effective alternate treatments 
available. 
 
E.  Impact Assessment of Refined Methyl Bromide 
Estimates  
 
Refined methyl bromide estimates have been calculated using the methods 
described in appendix E and section III.D of this SEIS to more accurately 
reflect actual compliance with ISPM 15 and APHIS’ Wood Packaging 
Rule.  The findings presented in table 3–1 show the estimated methyl 
bromide associated with direct compliance with APHIS’ rule to range 
from 822 to 2,351 MT annually.  This estimate excludes the ongoing 
compliance by China and Hong Kong with the China Interim Rule, which

2005, data for the compliance, under the IPPC alternative, have been 
collected and reviewed.  These values are comparable to those presented 
on pages 67 to 68 of the FEIS (384 to 4,630 MT annually); however, as 
would be expected with better data, the range for the estimate is projected 
to be narrower.  The broad range presented in the FEIS encompasses the 
more refined estimate in this supplement.  That indicates that the initial 
projections in the FEIS were representative of the potential methyl 
bromide usage that has actually occurred for those countries in compliance 
with APHIS’ wood packaging rule.   
 
The effect on stratospheric ozone from the estimated 822 to 2,351 MT of 
methyl bromide released annually from fumigations of WPM can be 
estimated by using similar methodology to that applied in previous 
documents.  However, just as there have been changes in WPM regulation 
compliance and trade that have affected usage, there have been changes in 
assessment methods as more information is gathered and there have been 
changes in the relative contribution of various ozone-depleting chemicals 
to the overall effects on the ozone layer as certain chemicals are phased 
out.  The ultimate recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer is dependent 
upon the reduction in release to the atmosphere of many chemicals.  Most 
of the primary ozone-depleting chemicals are presently regulated 
including many chlorofluorocarbons and bromines.  However, many 
substances such as greenhouse gases that

out.  The ultimate recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer is dependent 
upon the reduction in release to the atmosphere of many chemicals.  Most 
of the primary ozone-depleting chemicals are presently regulated 
including many chlorofluorocarbons and bromines.  However, many 
substances such as greenhouse gases that induce air temperature and 
circulation changes also affect the ozone layer.  Heating of the troposphere 
and cooling of the lower stratosphere associated with these gases has 
affected the ozone layer, particularly by the enhanced ozone destruction 
observed seasonally in the polar lower stratosphere (page 5.1, NOAA 
et al., 2007).  This variable is not factored into our assessment due to the 
present uncertainties over the regulation of greenhouse gases and the 
complex nonlinear effects that they cause to atmospheric temperature and 
ozone destruction in the stratosphere, particularly above polar regions. 
 
Previous APHIS EIS documents have applied the results of analysis of 
potential impacts from policy options cited in 1998 Scientific Assessment 
(pages 18-19 of NOAA et al., 1998) to the assessment of potential effects 
on stratospheric ozone.   The 1998 Scientific Assessment document 
indicated that “the equivalent effective chlorine loading above the 1980 
level” could be decreased by “about 1% by eliminating the global 
production of methyl bromide beginning in 2004.”  This NOAA document 
explained the uncertainty that exists and the dynamic changes in the ozone 
layer associated with the phaseout of various anthropogenic sources of 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS).  It should be remembered that the 
global consumption (not global production) of ODS releases the chemicals 
to the atmosphere and causes the depletion.

future usage, but it is not necessarily the best measure for potential impact.  
In particular, storage of methyl bromide for future usage has occurred 
periodically and consumption does not always mirror production.  This 
analysis was based upon 1996 data that indicated 71,425 MT of global 
annual methyl bromide production and 63,960 MT of global annual 
methyl bromide consumption that year (UNEP, MBTOC, 1998).  
However, as a rough measure, the relative contribution of methyl bromide 
to the ongoing ozone depletion (1 percent above the 1980 level) did 
provide a basis for policy discussion and a means to look more closely at 
potential effects from different uses including QPS treatment of WPM.   
 
Analyses comparable to the 1998 Scientific Assessment were presented in 
the 2006 Scientific Assessment (NOAA et al., 2007).  Although the 
Executive Summary of this scientific assessment was released on  
August 18, 2006, this assessment was not released in its entirety until 
February 2007 after the draft SEIS had already been sent to printing, so its

analyzes effects from the hypothetical elimination of all emissions by the 
end of 2006.  Based upon this, the comparable loading of methyl bromide 
(in equivalent effective chlorine units) above the 1980 level could be 
decreased by 5 percent by elimination of all production or all emissions.  
This is based upon 2005 data that indicated 37,923 MT of global annual 
methyl bromide production and 36,866 MT of global annual methyl 
bromide consumption that year (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The present 
assessment (in this final SEIS) uses the 2005 data (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) 
released in February 2007 and the 2006 scientific assessment of that data 
(NOAA et al., 2007) published March 15, 2007 as the basis for the 
determination of relative effect on the stratospheric ozone layer of 
compliance with WPM regulations involving methyl bromide fumigation.    
 
The relative loading or effect on stratospheric ozone for methyl bromide 
relative to the 1980 level shows an increase from 1 percent in the 1998 
assessment to 5 percent in the 2006 assessment.  This increase is a 
function of several factors including the reduction in effect from those 
ozone-depleting chemicals that are decreasing due to phasing out their 
usage, better understanding and modeling of ODS effects, and UNEP’s 
refinement of the ozone-depleting potential of ODS including methyl 
bromide.  The assessments prior to 2006 had projected long-term ozone

usage, better understanding and modeling of ODS effects, and UNEP’s 
refinement of the ozone-depleting potential of ODS including methyl 
bromide.  The assessments prior to 2006 had projected long-term ozone 
changes based upon linear trends, but the phaseout of ODS by the mid-
1990s required adjustments to the two-dimensional and three-dimensional 
models in the 2006 Scientific Assessment to more accurately reflect actual 
changes in stratospheric ozone that result from the non-linear changes in 
ODS burden that have resulted from the phaseout (page 3.5 of NOAA 
et al., 2007).  It is also noteworthy that this increased percentage occurs 
during the same period of time when there is a 42 percent reduction in 
worldwide consumption of methyl bromide (63,960 MT in 1996 to  
 
30  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
36,866 MT in 2005).  This 2006 assessment projects conditions in the 
Antarctic stratosphere to return to those preceding 1980 by around 2065 
(page xxxv, Executive Summary of NOAA et al., 2007).  The assessment 
indicates a number of potential options for accelerating the recovery of the 
ozone layer by eliminating ODS production and consumption.  The 
options are presented in Table 1 (page xxxvi, Executive Summary of 
NOAA et al., 2007) and include the 5 percent reduction associated with 
methyl bromide mentioned earlier in this paragraph.  The accelerated 
recovery of the ozone layer from these table 1 options covers only a  
49.2 percent overall increase in the ozone recovery, but is cumulative with 
those increases in ozone resulting from the reductions of other ODS that

methyl bromide mentioned earlier in this paragraph.  The accelerated 
recovery of the ozone layer from these table 1 options covers only a  
49.2 percent overall increase in the ozone recovery, but is cumulative with 
those increases in ozone resulting from the reductions of other ODS that 
have already been phased out and that are projected to result in the pre-
1980 levels by around 2065.  This series of hypothetical projections is 
based upon the contention that the 1980 level of stratospheric ozone is the 
condition under which complete recovery has occurred.  However, the 
2006 Scientific Assessment in the first line of the summary on page 6.1 
indicates that global ozone levels were already declining in the late 1970’s 
due to anthropogenic releases of ODSs (NOAA et al., 2007).   
 
As important as it is to reach a milestone like the ozone levels in 1980, it 
does not guarantee full recovery of the ozone layer.  In fact, the further 
discussion of this issue on page 6.1 of the 2006 Scientific Assessment 
(NOAA et al., 2007) describes the effects of equivalent effective 
stratospheric chlorine (EESC) by saying that “the return of ozone to  
pre-1980 levels may not occur at the same time as the return of EESC to 
pre-1980 levels, and in fact may never occur because of changes in the 
atmosphere since 1980 that are not caused by ODSs.”   This is a reference 
in part to the increase in greenhouse gases responsible for global warming 
of the atmosphere that was discussed previously.  Despite limits in the

, and in fact may never occur because of changes in the 
atmosphere since 1980 that are not caused by ODSs.”   This is a reference 
in part to the increase in greenhouse gases responsible for global warming 
of the atmosphere that was discussed previously.  Despite limits in the 
potential reductions of ozone depletion, the continuing phaseout of ODSs 
is contributing to stratospheric ozone recovery (page xxxv, Executive 
Summary in NOAA et al., 2007), and continued efforts to reduce usage of 
ODSs such as methyl bromide will benefit that recovery.  It is, however, 
clear from review of the 2006 Scientific Assessment that the QPS uses of 
methyl bromide and uses of other ODSs which are not yet part of the 
worldwide phaseout are not the sole factors that need to be addressed to 
ensure complete recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer.   
 
One factor in the long recovery period is the continued action of ODS 
compounds that have long half-lives.  The chlorofluorocarbons have long 
half-lives in the atmosphere that contribute substantially to the long 
recovery period of the stratospheric ozone.  Those ODS compounds with 
half-lives of 50 to 60 years are a primary factor in the projection of the 
long recovery of Antarctic stratospheric ozone to pre-1980 values by 
2065.  Unlike these ODS compounds which are likely to take 75 to 90 
years for 75 percent reductions in their contribution to ozone depletion,

III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  31  
methyl bromide has a half-life of 0.7 year in the atmosphere (table 1–4 of 
NOAA et al., 2007).  Methyl bromide, therefore, would be expected to 
have comparable reduction in effects upon stratospheric ozone within less 
than 2 years of phase-out due to its more rapid breakdown.  As the 
stratospheric ozone layer recovers (the ppt of ozone approach the 1980 
milestone level) and the phased-out ODS chemicals cease to persist in the 
atmosphere, the ozone depletion from the remaining uses (based upon this 
1980 milestone) can be expected to constitute increasing percentages of 
recovery of stratospheric ozone.  The percentage contribution of individual 
chemicals or cumulative contribution to ozone depletion from all 
remaining uses not phased out could exceed 100 percent recovery because  
the 1980 milestone includes allowance for some ozone depletion of natural 
origin and for a certain amount of ozone depletion from ongoing 
anthropogenic uses (levels before 1980) that the atmosphere is considered  
to be able to handle without adverse effects to the stratospheric ozone 
layer.  Although alternatives to methyl bromide are continuing to be 
sought and there has been at least a 42 percent  reduction in usage since 
1996 based upon UNEP reporting, future anthropogenic usage of methyl 
bromide is anticipated to continue with gradual reductions after the non-
QPS phaseout is completed for all countries by about 2015.

bromide is anticipated to continue with gradual reductions after the non-
QPS phaseout is completed for all countries by about 2015.           
 
The 2006 Scientific Assessment as part of its models revises the global 
ozone depletion potential on a per-atom basis for bromine from 45 times 
as effective as chlorine (previous assessment in 2002) to 60 times as 
effective as chlorine (page xxxv, Executive Summary of NOAA et al., 
2007).  This factor results in an estimated 33 percent increase in ozone 
depletion associated with methyl bromide over that projected for previous 
assessments.  Such corrections to their estimates are important to assessing 
potential risk outcomes that accurately reflect actual impacts.  This factor 
has been subject to ongoing review and revision in each updated version 
of the UNEP scientific assessment, so it can be anticipated that future 
bases for ozone depletion potential may change again as more complete 
data are collected about the interactions of stratospheric gases.  In that this 
corrected factor is included in the 2006 Scientific Assessment for the 
impacts of methyl bromide, the change is applied in this final SEIS which 
uses their most recent assessment as the basis for determination of effects 
on stratospheric ozone.  
 
Based upon the 2006 scientific assessment finding (NOAA et al., 2007), 
the effect of methyl bromide usage in compliance with APHIS’ wood 
packaging rule (822 to 2,351 MT) after 2006 is projected to pose a 
potential range of 0.1 to 0.32 percent effect on annual depletion of

the effect of methyl bromide usage in compliance with APHIS’ wood 
packaging rule (822 to 2,351 MT) after 2006 is projected to pose a 
potential range of 0.1 to 0.32 percent effect on annual depletion of 
stratospheric ozone above the 1980 baseline (total recovery).  The 
implementation of this alternative, as demonstrated in this risk analysis, is 
causing depletion of the ozone layer commensurate to that anticipated in 
the FEIS.  Therefore, no substantial changes to impacts on human health 
 
32  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
or to the environment are anticipated as a result of continuing 
implementation of this alternative.  With the ongoing phaseout of most 
usage of methyl bromide (that are projected  to contribute up to a  
5-percent effect on stratospheric ozone annually above the 1980 baseline), 
the continuing usage from compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule (which is 
less than one-fifteenth of the total methyl bromide usage) is more than 
compensated by the continuing overall reductions in usage.

refined methyl bromide estimates generated from quantitative analyses in 
this WPM SEIS.  
 
There would be no new mandatory methyl bromide usage under the no 
action alternative for WPM so this alternative involves no direct effects on 
methyl bromide usage per se.  Therefore, the direct effects of the no action 
alternative involve no immediate increase in effects on stratospheric

ozone.  However, those treatments associated with the China Interim Rule 
would continue.  This continuing usage is part of the aggregate impacts of 
methyl bromide usage.  The application rate required under the China 
Interim Rule is slightly higher than ISPM 15, so the projected methyl 
bromide estimate is elevated commensurate with the potential increased 
usage.  Under the no action alternative, and based on the refined methyl 
bromide estimates, it is estimated that the potential usage of methyl 
bromide in China and Hong Kong would continue to range from 2,486 to 
7,

 than ISPM 15, so the projected methyl 
bromide estimate is elevated commensurate with the potential increased 
usage.  Under the no action alternative, and based on the refined methyl 
bromide estimates, it is estimated that the potential usage of methyl 
bromide in China and Hong Kong would continue to range from 2,486 to 
7,676 MT annually.  The impact of this alternative above the 1980 
baseline is projected to pose an annual 0.34 to 1.0 percent effect on 
stratospheric ozone.  This issue is discussed further in the comparison of 
aggregate impacts in part 3 of this section.  
 
Refined estimates were made for the alternative to extend those treatments 
used in the China Interim Rule worldwide.  The estimated methyl bromide 
associated with compliance with this alternative ranges from 910 to 
2,612 MT annually.  This refined estimate is encompassed by the broader 
range determined in the FEIS (see page 62 of the FEIS) for the methyl 
bromide estimate (427 to 5,145 MT annually).  The effect on stratospheric 
ozone from the estimated 910 to 2,612 MT of methyl bromide released 
annually from fumigations using rates applicable to the China Interim 
Rule is projected to pose a potential effect above the 1980 baseline of 
0.12 to 0.3 percent on stratospheric ozone annually.  This represents a 
slightly greater effect on the stratospheric ozone layer than was projected 
for the preferred alternative using APHIS’ wood packaging rule, however, 
not a substantially greater impact.  It is, nonetheless, best to select 
effective treatments that pose the least adverse environmental impacts, and 
APHIS’ wood packaging rule poses less damage

not a substantially greater impact.  It is, nonetheless, best to select 
effective treatments that pose the least adverse environmental impacts, and 
APHIS’ wood packaging rule poses less damage to ozone than would 
result from worldwide application of the China Interim Rule.   
 
The comprehensive risk reduction program provides the maximum 
flexibility to select methods and treatments that are the most effective at 
eliminating all potential pest risks.  Since a comprehensive risk reduction 
program uses a combination of methods, and it is unclear exactly how 
frequently specific methods will be selected, the potential environmental  
consequences vary considerably with the frequency of methods employed.  
It is not reasonable to speculate on the methyl bromide estimate with such 
potential variability.  The potential human health and environmental 
consequences from this alternative are expected to be comparable to those 
described in the WPM FEIS. 
 
Substitute packaging material that poses no potential risk of ozone 
depletion was considered in the FEIS as a possible alternative to WPM.  
This alternative would not require the use of heat treatment or fumigation

The WPM FEIS did a qualitative review of aggregate consequences of 
each alternative.  The aggregate consequences of methyl bromide usage in 
compliance with ISPM 15 relate to the cumulative impact of all usage 
associated with the guidelines.  Cumulative impact, as defined in NEPA 
(40 CFR 1508.7), is the “impact on the environment which results from 
the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and 
reasonably foreseeable future actions.”  Most of the potential cumulative 
impacts associated with ongoing methyl bromide usage for quarantine and 
other purposes were discussed in detail in the FEIS for the Importation of 
Mexican Unmanufactured Wood (USDA, APHIS, 2002a).  That document 
determined that most anticipated future quarantine treatments are not 
expected to pose significant effects to the stratospheric ozone layer, but it 
did analyze the more substantial usage of methyl bromide from the 
pending regulations being contemplated for the regulation of WPM 
worldwide.  The Mexican Unmanufactured Wood FEIS roughly analyzed 
this issue based upon the set manner of compliance as was initially 
anticipated for the China Interim Rule.  The lack of compliance data 
resulted in a projected estimate that was intentionally conservatively high.  
We now have data about how countries are complying with ISPM 15, and 
a more refined aggregate assessment of methyl bromide estimates and 
impacts associated with global WPM regulations is presented here.

We now have data about how countries are complying with ISPM 15, and 
a more refined aggregate assessment of methyl bromide estimates and

The cumulative usage of methyl bromide associated with regulations 
designed to meet the guidelines in ISPM 15 consists of methyl bromide 
usage from countries in compliance with APHIS’ wood packaging rule, 
countries’ compliance with the comparable regulations of other countries, 
and compliance of the United States with the regulations of these other 
countries.  The previous section compares methyl bromide estimates for  
alternatives in regard to the direct compliance of other countries with 
APHIS’ wood packaging rule.  Comparable estimates have been prepared 
for those countries that were already subject to APHIS regulations under 
the China Interim Rule (China and Hong Kong), and methyl bromide 
estimates are made for those countries (including the United States) that 
are not subject to APHIS’ regulations but must comply with the wood 
packaging regulations of other countries.  These estimates for compliance 
with ISPM 15 guidelines are provided below in table 3–2.   
 
The only country projected to have considerable usage of methyl bromide 
for compliance is China.  The original China estimate for the China 
Interim Rule projected a methyl bromide estimate ranging from 1,040 to 
12,565 MT annually (USDA, APHIS, 1998b).  The reported 2002 total

methyl bromide production capacity of China=s three producers was 
7,620 MT; however, their actual production was only 3,175 MT for all 
uses (Beijing Times, 2003; UNEP, 2003).  Although fumigation of WPM 
uses substantial amounts of methyl bromide, much of the usage reported in 
2002 was for other uses, including preshipment and other quarantine 
treatments.  Although some increased consumption has probably occurred 
between 2002 and 2005, the methyl bromide estimates (2,232 to 6,893 MT 
per year) determined in this SEIS for China are within the range of 
possible usage, but the upper tail of the distribution is probably high.  
Based upon this estimate the ongoing use in China is projected to pose a 
potential effect to stratospheric ozone above the 1980 baseline of 0.3 to 
0.93 percent annually.  The methyl bromide estimates for compliance of 
other countries with ISPM 15 are associated with considerably lower 
effects to stratospheric ozone than result from the compliance of China. 
 
In assessing the overall cumulative impact, it is important to add all 
contributing sources of methyl bromide to those determined as direct 
impacts from the imposed regulations.  The data for the United States 
estimate are based upon actual units fumigated with methyl bromide in 
2005 and, thereby, provide a relatively accurate cumulative estimate.  
Estimates for the other countries are determined by using U.S. Customs 
entries.  The data regarding methyl bromide estimates for Canada and 
Mexico pertain to their usage for export to other countries based upon

Estimates for the other countries are determined by using U.S. Customs 
entries.  The data regarding methyl bromide estimates for Canada and 
Mexico pertain to their usage for export to other countries based upon 
information about their manner of compliance with ISPM 15. 
The methyl bromide estimates presented in the previous section 
comparing alternatives (section III.D.2.) provide numerical estimates for 
compliance with APHIS’ regulations and the China Interim Rule 
alternative; however, all these countries must comply with ISPM 15 
regulations of countries other than the United States, as well as APHIS’ 
wood packaging rule.  The lack of reliable data about the amount of world 
trade among countries other than the United States and associated WPM 
 
36  III.  Environmental Impact Analysis   
with that trade makes any cumulative analysis speculative and therefore, 
the aggregate methyl bromide estimates and effects for each alternative in 
this SEIS are limited to the relative effects of imports to and exports from 
the United States.   
 
The aggregate methyl bromide usage associated with the no action 
alternative is equal to that of China and Hong Kong in compliance with 
the China Interim Rule.  There would be no other methyl bromide usage in 
compliance with this alternative.  The potential cumulative methyl 
bromide estimate for WPM treatment associated with the no action 
alternative ranges from 2,486 to 7,676 MT annually.  This estimate is 
projected to pose potential effects to stratospheric ozone above the 1980 
levels that range from 0.34 to 1.

 bromide usage in 
compliance with this alternative.  The potential cumulative methyl 
bromide estimate for WPM treatment associated with the no action 
alternative ranges from 2,486 to 7,676 MT annually.  This estimate is 
projected to pose potential effects to stratospheric ozone above the 1980 
levels that range from 0.34 to 1.0 percent annually.  The elevated estimate 
is the result of the manner of treatment applied to China compliance 
(fumigation of sealed containers after cargo loading) and the higher 
application rate of methyl bromide for the China Interim Rule.  The upper 
end of the projections for all cumulative estimates are not realistic based 
upon reported production and consumption data from China.  It is clear 
that the upper end of range is conservatively high.  The potential aggregate 
impact of this alternative is lower because it includes only methyl bromide 
fumigations in China and Hong Kong.  Consequently, cumulative human 
health and environmental consequences from methyl bromide usage under 
this alternative are slightly lower. 
 
The aggregate projection of all methyl bromide estimates for compliance 
with ISPM 15 (preferred alternative), based upon the above described 
analytical reasoning (overall compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule and 
reciprocal compliance by the United States), ranges from 3,191 to 
9,628 MT per year.  This estimate is projected to pose a potential effect on 
stratospheric ozone above the 1980 levels that ranges from 0.43 to 
1.3 percent annually.   The implementation of this alternative, as 
demonstrated in this risk analysis, shows potential depletion of the ozone 
layer commensurate to that anticipated in the FEIS.  Therefore, no 
substantial changes to

stratospheric ozone above the 1980 levels that ranges from 0.43 to 
1.3 percent annually.   The implementation of this alternative, as 
demonstrated in this risk analysis, shows potential depletion of the ozone 
layer commensurate to that anticipated in the FEIS.  Therefore, no 
substantial changes to impacts on human health or to the environment are 
anticipated as a result of continuing implementation of this alternative.  
With the ongoing phaseout of most usage of methyl bromide (that has 
resulted in a  27,094 MT reduction in use of methyl  bromide from 1996 to 
2005), the continuing usage from compliance with APHIS’ WPM rule is 
more than compensated by the overall reductions in usage that continue to 
occur. 
 
The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for compliance with ISPM 15 
(3,191 to 9, 628 MT per year) for 2005 can be compared to the figures 
reported by UNEP for treatment of WPM.  Reporting of all QPS 
production of methyl bromide in 2004 amounted to 10,660 MT (page 12 
of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The category for QPS treatment of wooden  
III.  Environmental Impact Analysis  37  
packing materials was determined to account for 6.4 percent of the overall  
QPS usage or 679 MT.  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS 
purposes rose from 10,660 MT in 2004 to 13,815 MT in 2005, with the 
3,155 MT increase attributed largely to implementation of ISPM 15 for 
treatment of wood packaging material (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  The association of this increase with WPM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reported production of methyl bromide for QPS 
purposes rose from 10,660 MT in 2004 to 13,815 MT in 2005, with the 
3,155 MT increase attributed largely to implementation of ISPM 15 for 
treatment of wood packaging material (page 12 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  The association of this increase with WPM was discussed earlier 
in this SEIS and is tenuous due to reporting inconsistencies (see pages  
13–14 of this SEIS).  Combining the two rough UNEP totals gives an 
aggregate WPM usage of 3,834 MT annually.  This usage value is towards 
the lower end of the range of the methyl bromide estimate (3,191 to 9,628 
MT per year) determined in this SEIS, but reporting to UNEP by member 
countries is often incomplete or delayed as discussed previously.  If one 
assumes that the complete implementation of compliance with ISPM 15 
for some countries was delayed until 2006, then the reported consumption 
data to UNEP in 2005 may not reflect actual usage from complete 
compliance.  However, most major trading countries were in compliance 
in 2005 and those countries did report usage to UNEP.  Any increased 
annual usage in 2006 to comply with ISPM 15 is unlikely to exceed the 
upper aggregate methyl bromide estimate (9,628 MT) determined for 
ISPM 15 compliance in this SEIS.          
 
The comparable aggregate projection for methyl bromide estimates in 
compliance with worldwide extension of the China Interim Rule, based 
upon this same analytical reasoning, provides a range of 3,443 to 
10,698 MT per year.  Similar issues of uncertainty to those expressed 
about the cumulative China compliance are

The comparable aggregate projection for methyl bromide estimates in 
compliance with worldwide extension of the China Interim Rule, based 
upon this same analytical reasoning, provides a range of 3,443 to 
10,698 MT per year.  Similar issues of uncertainty to those expressed 
about the cumulative China compliance are also applicable here.  This 
estimate is projected to pose a potential effect on stratospheric ozone 
above the 1980 levels that ranges from 0.47 to 1.5 percent annually.  
Although the aggregate impact from methyl bromide usage associated 
with this alternative is greater than for the preferred alternative, any 
potential impacts of this alternative would be counterbalanced in similar 
manner to that of the preferred alternative by the reductions in usage from 
the continuing phaseout of other uses. 
 
Aggregate methyl bromide estimates are not prepared for the remaining 
two alternatives.  As discussed in the comparison of alternatives section of 
this document, it is not reasonable to attempt to project an aggregate 
methyl bromide estimate for usage under the comprehensive risk reduction 
program alternative with the wide variability of methods.  Further, the 
alternative use of substitute packaging materials involves no fumigation 
with methyl bromide.

A–2  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
I.  Introduction 
 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) thanks all who 
reviewed the “Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material Draft 
Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement—February 
2007” (draft SEIS) and provided their comments on this document.  
APHIS welcomes public involvement and considers public perspectives in 
its decision processes.   
  
Copies of the draft SEIS were provided to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Federal Activities for their review and 
to announce availability of the draft supplement to the public.  EPA 
prepared a notice of availability of the draft SEIS which included 
provision for a public comment period from March 9 to April 23, 2007 
(March 9, 2007, 72 FR 10749, Docket No. ER-FRL-6684-7).  Interested 
parties requested that APHIS extend the comment period to provide 
additional time for technical review in writing (see page 1 footnote of 
public comment sent from State of California) and verbally (EPA, Office 
of Federal Activities).  APHIS granted an extension of the public comment 
period until June

FRL-6684-7).  Interested 
parties requested that APHIS extend the comment period to provide 
additional time for technical review in writing (see page 1 footnote of 
public comment sent from State of California) and verbally (EPA, Office 
of Federal Activities).  APHIS granted an extension of the public comment 
period until June 25, 2007 (May 25, 2007, 72 FR 29294, Docket No. 
APHIS–2006–0152).  The four public comments (including any 
attachments) that were received on the draft SEIS are available for review 
at the APHIS Reading Room and are reproduced in the third section of 
this appendix.   
 
Although this supplement focuses on the estimates of methyl bromide 
usage, there are a number of other technical issues related to the 
regulations that were expressed in the comment letters submitted to 
APHIS.  Those issues are addressed, along with the primary focus, to the 
extent that their potential environmental impact affects agency decisions 
to be made.  Comments from individual respondents are addressed and 
summarized, as provided in 40 CFR 1503.4.  The comment summaries are 
designed to concisely cover the issues and provide responses that clarify 
agency perspectives in the second section of this appendix.  Numerical 
changes related to use of methyl bromide are discussed here as well as in 
changes to the text from the draft SEIS and changes in appendix E.

II.  Summarization of Comments and 
 Responses 
 
For the ease of presentation and thoroughness of coverage, the issues from 
the comment responses are discussed in the order of their submission to 
APHIS and in the order of their occurrence within the individual 
comment.  The four review comments, in order of their receipt by APHIS, 
were sent from the National Wooden Pallet and Container Association 
(NWPCA), the State of California Department of Justice (on behalf of 
three States and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)), NRDC, 
and EPA, Office of Federal Activities.  With the limited number of 
responses received by APHIS, the topics are discussed focusing in greater 
detail on the technical issues within this SEIS to cover specific examples, 
where possible.  Some references provided in response letters lacked 
complete citations for which APHIS made an effort to locate the source 
documents, but not all cited literature references could be located.  The 
responses are complete to the extent that the analysts were able to find and 
review the documentation cited.  To minimize repetition of information, 
reference is made to the discussion of topics in the text, in response to 
other comments, and to previous environmental documentation for the 
Rule.

 to the discussion of topics in the text, in response to 
other comments, and to previous environmental documentation for the 
Rule.         
 A.  National Wooden Pallet and Container Association 
 
NWPCA’s comment is generally supportive of APHIS review and 
decisions. 
 
Comment:  NWPCA states that the draft SEIS continues to suggest that 
substitute packing materials have fewer environmental consequences.  
This cited statement refers strictly to the environmental impacts from 
component control methods themselves, and also indicates in the last 
phrase that there are unquantified impacts from the manufacturing 
processes of substitute packing materials. The FEIS does a thorough 
analysis of environmental impacts of wood packaging materials and 
substitute packaging materials, including plastics.  The FEIS does mention 
and provide reference to support issues including biodegradation, reuse, 
and recycling; however, this comment does raise additional issues not 
covered in the FEIS with specific regard to environmental impacts from 
the use of substitute packaging material including fire hazards of plastics 
versus wood packaging materials, and reduction of pest infestations in 
wood packaging materials since the adoption of the new pest elimination 
standards imposed by the industry.   
 
Response:  Although the new information presented in their comment 
regarding environmental impacts is valid, the associated impacts further 
justify APHIS’ analyses in support of this rulemaking.  In that the scope of 
 
A–4  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
the SEIS is limited to the refinement of methyl bromide estimates, further 
assessment of these other impacts is not presented. 
 
Comment:  NWPCA suggested to APHIS a domestic standard for wood

 analyses in support of this rulemaking.  In that the scope of 
 
A–4  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
the SEIS is limited to the refinement of methyl bromide estimates, further 
assessment of these other impacts is not presented. 
 
Comment:  NWPCA suggested to APHIS a domestic standard for wood 
in response to infestations of EAB and Sirex wood wasp.  NWPCA 
suggested to USDA that all new or repaired wood packaging materials be 
treated, which would become a domestic standard compatible with 
international requirements.   
 
Response:  APHIS appreciates the interest of NWPCA in pest risk 
reduction of WPM for domestic use; however, this suggestion is beyond 
the scope of the SEIS and would most appropriately be addressed in a 
separate rulemaking specific to such an action. 
 
Although NWPCA states that “any suggestion or implication that 
substitute packing materials are environmentally advantageous for 
eradicating invasive species is totally unacceptable, impractical, and 
contrary to harmonized international law,” assessing the environmental 
impacts of all reasonable alternatives associated with this rulemaking is 
required to fulfill the requirements of NEPA. 
 
B.  Comments from the California Attorney General’s 
 Office, Illinois Attorney General’s Office, 
 Connecticut Attorney General’s Office, and NRDC 
 
Response:  Contrary to the perspective expressed in the first sentence of 
this comment letter, APHIS had reviewed and applied considerable factual 
information in the preparation of the original estimates of methyl bromide 
fumigation usage.  All information provided in the SEIS is supported by 
credible and peer reviewed sources that are referenced

, and NRDC 
 
Response:  Contrary to the perspective expressed in the first sentence of 
this comment letter, APHIS had reviewed and applied considerable factual 
information in the preparation of the original estimates of methyl bromide 
fumigation usage.  All information provided in the SEIS is supported by 
credible and peer reviewed sources that are referenced in the document.  
All credible sources of pertinent information relevant to the scope of the 
SEIS at the time of preparing the document were incorporated and utilized 
to support discussions and claims made within the document.   
 
Preparers of the SEIS are aware of the fact that the 2006 Scientific 
Assessment (NOAA et al., 2007) was finalized and released to the public 
in February, shortly after the draft SEIS was published; thus, the UNEP 
document was not available as a source for the draft SEIS.  However, the 
findings of this UNEP document are discussed and referenced in the final 
SEIS.    
 
The development of methods to apply the factual information to estimates 
of methyl bromide has occurred over a number of years and was discussed 
in some detail on pages 11 to 15 of the draft SEIS.  Independent of how 
much data was applied to the analysis of the original regulation, the 
determination of how much usage occurs from a given method (relative to  
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–5   
other available methods) was expected to be uncertain until compliance 
data were available from the industry and for those countries subject to 
quarantine requirements.  The monitoring of compliance with a given 
regulation is part of the ongoing regulatory process that allows APHIS to 
review and revise risk reduction strategies.  This compliance monitoring

other available methods) was expected to be uncertain until compliance 
data were available from the industry and for those countries subject to 
quarantine requirements.  The monitoring of compliance with a given 
regulation is part of the ongoing regulatory process that allows APHIS to 
review and revise risk reduction strategies.  This compliance monitoring 
involves collecting information that can be applied to supplement previous 
documentation when previous data are limited.  This is exactly what the 
SEIS does in its reevaluation and refinement of the methyl bromide 
estimates of the use in treatment of wood packing material.  The long-term 
resolution to the pest risk problems associated with wood packing material 
referred to on page v of the final EIS requires establishment of a baseline 
level of phytosanitary protection from which to determine the need for 
further refinement of wood packing material regulations.  Therefore, the 
SEIS constitutes another step in the ongoing review process at APHIS to 
develop a long-term resolution of the pest risks associated with wood 
packing materials.            
 
Response to Further Comment:  Although ALB is a quarantine wood 
pest that was introduced on Staten Island near port facilities, the fact that 
the source (e.g., port, natural spread, human movement of wood from 
adjacent infestations, or hitchhiking beetles) of this introduction is 
unknown makes it a poor justification that a more effective alternative 
than treated WPM should be required.  The suggestion that APHIS could 
have prevented the introduction of ALB on Staten Island by promulgating 
different regulations requires assumptions about the movement of ALB 
that have not been substantiated.

than treated WPM should be required.  The suggestion that APHIS could 
have prevented the introduction of ALB on Staten Island by promulgating 
different regulations requires assumptions about the movement of ALB 
that have not been substantiated.    
 
Comment:  In its first point, the comment letter claims that APHIS 
“improperly hides the environmental impacts of the increased methyl 
bromide use for fumigation by combining it with the potential reduction of 
methyl bromide for other purposes.”   
 
Response:  The data for methyl bromide estimates and environmental 
impacts from the wood packing regulation and each alternative were 
clearly presented on pages 24 to 30 of the draft SEIS.  The effects are 
assessed independent of the other potential reductions in methyl bromide 
use that have occurred as a result of the phaseout.  The direct impact of the 
Rule (from page 32) is projected to result in methyl bromide usage of 822 
to 2,351 MT annually that poses a potential range of 0.1 to 0.32 percent 
effect on annual depletion of stratospheric ozone above the 1980 baseline.   
 
The 42 percent reduction (27,094 MT) in worldwide consumption of 
methyl bromide over the last 10 years, from 63,960 MT in 1996 to 
36,866 MT in 2005, shows the effectiveness of the ongoing overall 
phaseout of methyl bromide (UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  It is clear that the 
projected increases in usage of methyl bromide from the Rule do not

projected increases in usage of methyl bromide from the Rule do not 
increase usage to the extent that the usage is reduced by the phaseout.  If 
1.  Point 1 
 
A–6  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
one combines cumulative data for methyl bromide production associated 
with all wood packing material, as reported by UNEP (pages 13 to 14 of 
this SEIS), the total worldwide usage of methyl bromide attributed to 
WPM in 2005 amounts to only 3,834 MT annually.  This WPM 
application clearly involves less increased usage than the 27,094 MT 
reduction related to the phaseout; however, the impact to the stratospheric 
ozone from such continuing usage should not be interpreted to be 
negligible.  Nonetheless, it is clear that the relative contribution to the 
overall impact on the ozone layer is greater from other uses of methyl 
bromide and uses of other ozone-depleting substances. 
 
Comment:  Also, the first point suggests that the impact of other changes 
in use of methyl bromide and other ozone-depleting substances not 
associated with wood packing material need not be considered in the 
determination of impacts to overall stratospheric ozone in this EIS.   
 
Response:  The cumulative impact analysis under NEPA requires 
consideration of the influence of these other ozone-depleting substances 
on the stratospheric ozone layer.  The selection of the 1980 level of 
stratospheric ozone as the baseline for full

 the 
determination of impacts to overall stratospheric ozone in this EIS.   
 
Response:  The cumulative impact analysis under NEPA requires 
consideration of the influence of these other ozone-depleting substances 
on the stratospheric ozone layer.  The selection of the 1980 level of 
stratospheric ozone as the baseline for full recovery of the ozone layer 
(NOAA et al., 2007; UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) is a worthy milestone; 
nevertheless, it does not guarantee full recovery of the ozone layer.  The 
2006 Scientific Assessment in the first line of the summary on page 6.1 
indicates that global ozone levels were already declining in the late 1970s 
due to anthropogenic releases of ozone-depleting substances (NOAA et 
al., 2007).  Although this same document projects conditions in the 
Antarctic stratosphere to return those preceding 1980 by around 2065 
(page xxxv of the Executive Summary of NOAA et al., 2007), that 
projection does not take into account the potential options for accelerating 
or hindering the recovery of the ozone layer (including phaseouts of QPS 
usage of methyl bromide and other presently unregulated uses of ozone-
depleting substances) shown in their table 1.  Independent of the milestone 
selected for the ozone layer recovery, use of other ozone-depleting 
substances will either increase or decrease effects to stratospheric ozone.  
Pages 29 to 32 in this final SEIS discuss the limitations of this type of 
projection.  The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for all compliance 
with ISPM 15 determined in this SEIS ranges from 3,191 to 9,628 MT 
annually (see page 37).

 effects to stratospheric ozone.  
Pages 29 to 32 in this final SEIS discuss the limitations of this type of 
projection.  The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for all compliance 
with ISPM 15 determined in this SEIS ranges from 3,191 to 9,628 MT 
annually (see page 37).   
 
As indicated in the previous paragraph, the determination of effects on 
ozone are calculated relative to the 1980 baseline for stratospheric ozone 
levels.  As other ozone-depleting substances are phased out and degrade 
(including some substances with long half-lives), the elimination of the 
remaining uses will be associated with increasingly greater potential to 
recover the remaining ozone to the 1980 baseline level, so the potential 
effect as a percentage is subject to change over time, particularly as the 
impacts of the phaseout increase the stratospheric ozone levels.  This 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–7   
indicates that the potential effect on stratospheric ozone from the same 
usage of methyl bromide this year as in the previous 10 years would 
contribute to a higher percentage of depletion above the 1980 baseline 
than previously.  The UNEP Scientific Assessments of Ozone Depletion 
continue to track the recovery and science of ozone depletion.  The 
Executive Summary for the WHO/UNEP “Scientific Assessment of Ozone 
Depletion: 2006” was released August 18, 2006; however, the entire 
assessment, including supporting chapters (NOAA et al., 2007), was not 
available until February 2007.  The draft SEIS was in the process of being

available until February 2007.  The draft SEIS was in the process of being 
printed in February at the time of release of their complete assessment; 
consequently, the complete information was not available to update the 
draft SEIS.  However, APHIS has since recalculated impacts in the final 
SEIS to account for the determined 33 percent increase in effectiveness 
(from 45 to 60) of bromine relative to chlorine in global ozone depletion 
potential on a per-atom basis.  In addition, other refinements to the 
calculations from this scientific assessment and from the 2006 UNEP, 
MBTOC assessment (published March 15, 2007) were made to update the 
methyl bromide estimates and their potential impacts based upon the 
present state of the ozone layer.  Based upon the above discussion, it is 
anticipated that further refinements will continue as the science improves 
and recovery of the ozone layer progresses. 
 
Comment:  The second comment suggests that the incomplete 
compliance data precludes the ability of APHIS to reach a viable 
conclusion.   
 
Response:  It is noteworthy that APHIS had considerably less data upon 
which to base their risk calculations and environmental assessment at the 
time of the China Interim Rule and other previous wood regulations than 
we have now.  Appendix E of the final SEIS has been expanded to clarify 
methods and the compliance data reported to APHIS.  The calculations 
have consistently been designed to avoid underestimation of methyl 
bromide usage, and the reporting that has been submitted to UNEP has

im Rule and other previous wood regulations than 
we have now.  Appendix E of the final SEIS has been expanded to clarify 
methods and the compliance data reported to APHIS.  The calculations 
have consistently been designed to avoid underestimation of methyl 
bromide usage, and the reporting that has been submitted to UNEP has 
been within or below the range determined by our calculations.  In the 
assessment of China in the draft and final SEIS, the analyses intentionally 
selected the fumigation of already loaded cargo as the treatment for 
calculations to ensure that the methyl bromide estimate was not 
underestimated for this country.  In addition, it adjusted the analysis to 
account for their practice of sealing containers for fumigation rather than 
tarping containers that is more conventionally practiced elsewhere.  
Knowledge of this practice in China would not have been determined if 
APHIS did not continue to monitor their compliance and seek more 
complete information about their methyl bromide usage during the last 
few years.  This practice was discussed on pages 20 to 21 of the draft SEIS 
and is discussed on page 24 of the final SEIS.

A–8  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
The reported methyl bromide consumption from China to UNEP in 2005 
(table 3.13 on page 53 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) amounted to 841 MT for 
regulated uses, so a noteworthy amount of their consumption is not used 
for QPS.  Of the 13,815 MT of methyl bromide used for QPS worldwide 
in 2005, only 978 MT of methyl bromide are estimated to be used for 
durable goods such as wood packaging material (table 3

OC, 2007) amounted to 841 MT for 
regulated uses, so a noteworthy amount of their consumption is not used 
for QPS.  Of the 13,815 MT of methyl bromide used for QPS worldwide 
in 2005, only 978 MT of methyl bromide are estimated to be used for 
durable goods such as wood packaging material (table 3.15 on page 57 of 
UNEP, MBTOC, 2007).  The projected methyl bromide estimates for 
wood packing material for China in the final SEIS range from 2,232 to 
6,893 MT which exceeds the UNEP data by a substantial margin.  From 
the usage reported to UNEP, there is no clear basis to suggest that 
substantially greater usage occurs through imports or remaining stock.  
The total production of methyl bromide in 2005 was 37,923 MT (table 3.2 
on page 31 of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007); however, the overall consumption 
was 36,866 MT of methyl bromide in 2005 (page 57 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007).  This indicates only about 1,000 MT not consumed in the same 
year as production.  This is comparable to remaining stocks from other 
recent years.  The reported quantities do not suggest that large stocks or 
imports are being used to meet ISPM 15 in China.  
 
The final EIS, on page 16, discusses inspections of WPM and the results 
of monitoring.  APHIS, in its consideration of the China Interim Rule, 
took into consideration the existence of some fraudulent certification by 
focusing early inspection on WPM from China.  The compliance study in 
1998, cited on page 16 of the final EIS, found China to lack treatment in

, discusses inspections of WPM and the results 
of monitoring.  APHIS, in its consideration of the China Interim Rule, 
took into consideration the existence of some fraudulent certification by 
focusing early inspection on WPM from China.  The compliance study in 
1998, cited on page 16 of the final EIS, found China to lack treatment in 
only 0.7 to 0.9 percent of the shipments and incorrect treatment in only 
0.05 to 0.2 percent of the shipments.  Although comparable studies have 
not been reported for more recent years, there is no inspection data to 
suggest that their compliance has either improved or declined.   
 
Other than compliance since the China Interim Rule, the final SEIS has a 
lack of compliance data for 65 other countries that account for about 
3.6 percent of the U.S. Customs entries in 2005.  This list, along with the 
compliance information for other countries, are described in part of 
appendix E of the final SEIS.  Fumigation of WPM from these countries is 
assumed to occur by tarping containers with already loaded cargo.  As 
with the China calculations, this results in a conservatively high estimate 
for methyl bromide for these countries.  The remainder of the countries 
that export to the United States have either provided complete information 
about their manner of compliance or sufficient data were available 
regarding their compliance provided by them or from UNEP reporting to 
prepare an informed analysis.

Comment:  The third comment suggests that APHIS, in the draft SEIS, 
precludes substitute packaging consideration.   
 
Response:  On page 5 of the  draft SEIS, it states, “In accordance with 
applicable international agreements, APHIS does consider in its 
3.  Point 3 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–9   
regulations governing phytosanitary issues in trade if those measures are 
transparent, technically justified, and no more restrictive of trade than 
necessary to achieve an appropriate level of phytosanitary protection. 
…Should it become evident that the us age of methyl bromide fumigation 
in the treatment of WPM is no longer needed by developing countries in 
order to meet phytosanitary requirements (due to increased availability of 
substitute packaging materials and other treatment measures in all affected 
countries), and that the elimination of methyl bromide fumigation is ‘not 
more trade restrictive than required to achieve [an] appropriate level of 
sanitary or phytosanitary protection,’ as is specified by provisions of the 
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreements of the World Trade Organization, 
then APHIS will consider further rulemaking for WPM (e.g., substitute 
packaging).  Thus, the claim made in the above stated comment 
inaccurately suggests that APHIS interprets “no more restrictive” to mean 
that the usage of an alternative method must be widespread for a switch to 
be permitted.

then APHIS will consider further rulemaking for WPM (e.g., substitute 
packaging).  Thus, the claim made in the above stated comment 
inaccurately suggests that APHIS interprets “no more restrictive” to mean 
that the usage of an alternative method must be widespread for a switch to 
be permitted.   
 
As stated in the text on page 5 of the draft SEIS (and quoted above), 
APHIS considers any alternative (including substitute packaging) for 
regulation presented in this rulemaking to be “more trade restrictive” if it 
is not feasible for equitable implementation in all countries and 
particularly for those developing countries whose trade could be restricted 
by the implementation.  Further, the costs of the alternative limited to 
substitute packaging materials (e.g., plastics) in these developing countries 
are likely to exceed those in developed countries due to costs of importing 
the raw materials for manufacturing or of those packing materials already 
constructed.  
 
Contrary to the view that APHIS can impose any regulations that it wants, 
the IPPC requires that new regulations be technically justified first.  The 
quarantine pests (bark beetles) of concern to Australia and New Zealand 
do not necessarily mirror those of concern to APHIS, nor do their methods 
necessarily achieve the same level of phytosanitary protection for every 
country.  The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service has not yet 
submitted their technical justification for required debarking.  In the 
absence of their technical justification, the NPPOs of other countries are 
not obligated to apply the more stringent applications proposed.

absence of their technical justification, the NPPOs of other countries are

The scope of the draft SEIS was to reevaluate and refine the methyl 
bromide estimates from the FEIS.  The refinement of methyl bromide 
estimates was initiated because of the availability of new information, and 
this refinement was promised in the FEIS.  The assessment of the 
alternative to phaseout methyl bromide and adopt the use of alternative 
packaging materials has not changed substantially.  The lack of definition 
for the phaseout/phase-in period, suggested from comments, show the 
limited basis available for regulatory decisionmaking.  Cost aspects related 
to this rulemaking were thoroughly assessed in the associated regulatory

impact analysis (USDA, APHIS, 2004).  The fact that substitute packing 
materials make up only about 5 percent of the U.S. market for packing 
materials (FEIS on pages 41 and 80) and plastic pallets only comprise 
8 percent of the European pallet market indicates that such materials are 
not and, for the foreseeable future, will not be the dominant share of the 
market in developed countries, let alone developing countries.  It is to the 
benefit of industry groups, such as RPM Technologies, to provide 
optimistic projections about future market share to their customers and 
stockholders; however, sound decisions for enforceable regulations require 
consideration of all information, including contrary information from the 
wood packing industry (see public comments from NWPCA).  Many

benefit of industry groups, such as RPM Technologies, to provide 
optimistic projections about future market share to their customers and 
stockholders; however, sound decisions for enforceable regulations require 
consideration of all information, including contrary information from the 
wood packing industry (see public comments from NWPCA).  Many 
developing countries still depend on wood packaging materials for pallets 
due to the low cost and accessibility of wood.  Thus, the assumed increase 
in plastic pallet market share and use is not sufficient to suggest that 
plastic pallet use should be adopted as standard packaging material 
worldwide, because it is not a feasible alternative for many nations. 
 
Comment:  The fourth comment states that the draft SEIS did not 
adequately identify and discuss the worldwide and collateral effects of the 
WPM rule.  The comment indicates a lack of satisfaction with the point in 
time estimates referred to in the draft SEIS at page 11.   
 
Response:  Information was sought by APHIS for methyl bromide usage 
and methods of treatment from NPPOs of certain countries.  Conservative 
estimates were used to account for information that was not available for 
some countries.  The SEIS does make reference to and incorporates the 
increase of trade since the FEIS into its refined methyl bromide 
calculations.  The draft SEIS states, on page iv of the Executive Summary, 
that “although the refined estimates determined for this supplement more 
accurately portray the range of methyl bromide used for ISPM 15 
compliance than previous estimates, the dynamic nature of trade and 
compliance with trade-related regulations result in the ongoing need for 
review because this information reflects only the most recent information 
received.  The availability of

that “although the refined estimates determined for this supplement more 
accurately portray the range of methyl bromide used for ISPM 15 
compliance than previous estimates, the dynamic nature of trade and 
compliance with trade-related regulations result in the ongoing need for 
review because this information reflects only the most recent information 
received.  The availability of information about compliance by exporters 
in some countries is still lacking, and for these countries, this supplement 
applies conservative assumptions designed to err in favor of 
overestimating their methyl bromide usage.”  Thus, the draft SEIS takes 
into consideration the issues mentioned in this comment and addresses 
them in the document appropriately. 
 
It is noteworthy that other analytical documents making projections use 
data for specific points in time for their projections.  For example, the 
2006 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion selected the end of 2006 
as their point for projections of elimination of emissions from ozone-
depleting substances (page xxxvi of NOAA et al., 2007).  No effort was 
made by the UNEP scientists to quantitatively speculate on how 
anthropogenic use will or will not change with human activity after 2006, 
4.  Point 4 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–11   
so it is likewise not appropriate for the SEIS to attempt to estimate future 
anthropogenic use beyond present data.   
 
Comment:  The comment also expressed concern with the discussion of 
collateral impact analysis, as mentioned on page 29 of the draft SEIS.   
 
Response:  As was indicated in the draft SEIS at page 29, “The lack of

Comment:  The comment also expressed concern with the discussion of 
collateral impact analysis, as mentioned on page 29 of the draft SEIS.   
 
Response:  As was indicated in the draft SEIS at page 29, “The lack of 
reliable data about the amount of world trade among countries other than 
the United States and associated WPM with that trade makes any 
cumulative analysis speculative and, therefore, the aggregate methyl 
bromide estimates and effects for each alternatives in this SEIS are limited 
to the relative effects of imports to and exports from the United States.”   
If one looks at the cumulative data for the methyl bromide associated with 
all wood packing material as reported by UNEP (MBTOC, 2007) and 
discussed on pages 13 to 14 of this SEIS, the potential annual worldwide 
usage amounts to 3,834 MT in 2005.  Comparing this figure to the 
conservative aggregate projection in this SEIS (3,191 to 9,628 MT per 
year) indicates that the additional usage by other countries is covered 
within the overall range projection.  For export from countries such as 
South Korea, there was usage allowance projected to account for 
uncertainty (see table 3–1).    
 
Comment:  This comment suggests that APHIS did not provide adequate 
information to make a fair assessment of the accuracy of methyl bromide 
estimates.   
 
Response:  The draft SEIS, on pages 17 to 22, provides questions asked of 
foreign NPPOs, their responses for methyl bromide and heat treatment 
usage, their method of application to wood packaging materials, and the 
country that the information represents.  The information obtained from 
foreign NPPOs

Response:  The draft SEIS, on pages 17 to 22, provides questions asked of 
foreign NPPOs, their responses for methyl bromide and heat treatment 
usage, their method of application to wood packaging materials, and the 
country that the information represents.  The information obtained from 
foreign NPPOs was used to refine methyl bromide estimates in the draft 
SEIS.  For uncertain information and/or in the absence of more definitive 
information from NPPOs, estimates in the draft SEIS remain 
conservatively high. 
 
In the draft SEIS at page 25, a footnote in table 3–1 states that the “Other 
Countries” refers to “those countries for which compliance data are 
lacking and those countries strictly complying by heat treatment of wood 
packaging material.”  To assist the reader, the countries are listed by 
category in appendix E of the final SEIS.  “Other Countries” consists of 
the 139 countries reported to only heat treat WPM or use substitute 
packing material, and the 65 countries lacking compliance data and 
assumed to fumigate with methyl bromide.  The percentage of U.S. 
Customs entries in 2005 is also provided for each category.    
  
As mentioned in the draft SEIS at page 18, “unlike the available export

A–12  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
fumigated with methyl bromide annually are not available for import 
entries to the United States so estimates for all countries other than 
Nicaragua are calculated using U.S. Customs entry.”  There is no evidence 
to suggest that U.S. Customs data are lacking reliability or accuracy.  
Further the U.S. Customs entry data is collected for all entries and no 
change in the collection of that data has occurred.  The general import data 
are not collected by Agricultural Specialists/Inspectors at the U.S. 
Customs Service, so the cited reference to vulnerability from foreign pests 
and diseases pertaining to agricultural specialists does not relate to the 
collection of overall import data contrary to the statement in this comment 
provided. 
 
Comment:  This comment questions the variation of methyl bromide 
production and consumption data between the draft SEIS and that cited by 
MBTOC and UNEP.   
 
Response:  The variation in data is expected because the years of data 
referenced in the comment are between 5 and 8 years old and much has 
changed in methyl bromide production and consumption since that time.  
Further, the MBTOC data, cited in the comment, includes all QPS uses, as 
opposed to the draft SEIS, which limited methyl bromide estimates to 
wood packaging material only.  Thus, the difference in methyl bromide 
usage relates to different overall uses.  As was discussed previously on 
pages 13 to 14 of this SEIS, the methyl bromide production (UNEP,

 QPS uses, as 
opposed to the draft SEIS, which limited methyl bromide estimates to

pages 13 to 14 of this SEIS, the methyl bromide production (UNEP, 
MBTOC, 2007) indicates 3,834 MT in 2005.  This compares favorably 
with the aggregate methyl bromide range estimate from 3,191 to 9,628 
MT per year in this SEIS.   
 
Comment:  “APHIS further fails to account for potential increase in usage 
based on the limited efficacy of the current methyl bromide fumigation 
schedule.”   
 
Response:  This comment assumes that the expressed concern of the IPPC 
contracting parties that the methyl bromide treatment schedule did not 
achieve the desired reduction in pest risk was a result of “APHIS’ 
estimates.”  It is stated on page 6 of the draft SEIS that the only IPPC 
approved revision since the initial methyl bromide fumigation treatment 
schedule of Annex I of ISPM 15 was to change the proposed minimum 
time required to maintain concentrations of methyl bromide within the 
fumigation enclosure.  Discussion of the lack of change in dosage rate 
indicates that methyl bromide usage would not change.  The revised 
treatment schedules are designed to eliminate pest risk without the need 
for additional usage of methyl bromide.  The FEIS, on pages 64 to 66, 
discusses the capacity for pest mitigation of ISPM 15 relative to other 
alternatives and this issue is not revisited in the SEIS.

Appendix A.  Public Comments A–13   
Comment:  The sixth comment suggests that APHIS makes no attempt to 
account for or estimate possible fraud in reporting, especially from China.  
This comment assumes that a high estimate for China, in the draft SEIS on 
page 19, must mean that there is massive fraud in reporting.  This 
comment presumes that some shippers are not treating rather than some 
are treating prior to loading or heat treating.   
 
Response:  Although one can use any of several speculations on the 
manner of or lack of compliance with ISPM 15, the draft SEIS was 
prepared to make reasonably accurate usage estimates for methyl bromide 
and not review the compliance history.  The issue of fraud in reporting, 
especially from China, was covered in the WPM FEIS on page 16 under 
this issue of compliance.  Further, compliance with recycling and repair 
does not automatically mean lack of proper treatment.

Comment:  NRDC suggests that APHIS has not regarded the methyl 
bromide estimate as related to their rulemaking.   
 
Response:  The estimates of methyl bromide usage have been an integral 
part of every EA and EIS that has been prepared for agency applications 
of this fumigant.  APHIS does not consider reevaluation and refinement of 
previous estimates to be a trite exercise, but seeks to continue to improve 
on the previous risk assessments.  In those import regulations where there 
are more than one available means to fulfill treatment requirements, there 
will always be uncertainty about how the exporters from other countries 
will decide to meet those requirements.  APHIS is primarily concerned 
that the decision can be informed in regards to potential risks from each 
treatment method or alternative, and there is no evidence that previous 
documentation was not adequate.     
 
Comment:  The draft supplemental EIS does not reflect current scientific 
information on methyl bromide’s risk to the ozone layer. 
 
Response:  As was pointed out in a previous comment response, the draft 
SEIS was prepared at a time when only the UNEP Executive Summary 
(released August 18, 2006) was available; however, the entire assessment, 
including supporting chapters (NOAA et al., 2007), was not released until 
February 2007 when the draft SEIS was at print.  Therefore, the draft SEIS 
did not have the complete information from which to adjust its analyses.  
However, APHIS has since recalculated the estimates and impacts in the 
final SEIS based upon this document and other more recent publications.

However, APHIS has since recalculated the estimates and impacts in the 
final SEIS based upon this document and other more recent publications.   
 
As was pointed out in our response to earlier comments, the percentages 
cited by UNEP relate to their selection of the 1980 level of stratospheric 
ozone as the baseline for full recovery of the ozone layer.  Conditions in 
6.  Point 6  
1.  Risk to the 
 Ozone Layer 
 
A–14  Appendix A.  Public Comments 
the Antarctic stratosphere are projected to return to those preceding 1980 
by around 2065 (page xxxv of NOAA et al., 2007).  As other ozone-
depleting substances are phased out and degrade or are removed from the 
atmosphere, the level of stratospheric ozone will increasingly approach the 
1980 baseline level.  The remainder of ozone-depleting chemicals in use 
will either delay the recovery to that level or prevent recovery to higher 
concentrations than in 1980.  There was clear evidence that global ozone 
levels were already declining in the late 1970s due to anthropogenic 
releases of ozone-depleting substances (page 6.1 of NOAA et al., 2007).  
Just as the previously cited 1-percent effect from methyl bromide is 
presently outdated, the percentage reductions cited in table 1 will change 
as recovery of the ozone layer occurs, and better understanding of the 
atmospheric science occurs.  Those reductions in table 1 are cited as 
potential options for accelerating the recovery of the ozone layer to 1980 
baseline levels (page xxxvi of NOAA

 from methyl bromide is 
presently outdated, the percentage reductions cited in table 1 will change 
as recovery of the ozone layer occurs, and better understanding of the 
atmospheric science occurs.  Those reductions in table 1 are cited as 
potential options for accelerating the recovery of the ozone layer to 1980 
baseline levels (page xxxvi of NOAA et al., 2007).  The reductions would 
occur in addition to the recovery that is already projected from the 
phaseout of other ozone-depleting substances.  Based upon current 
understanding, the percentages in reduction cited in table 1 will increase 
commensurate with any increases in stratospheric ozone from the present 
phaseout until full recovery of the ozone layer occurs (1980 baseline 
levels of ozone are reached), and will decrease commensurate with any 
decreases in consumption of the compound or compound group until 
complete phaseout occurs.  Table 1 reductions are only related to a 
hypothetical end to production and emissions after 2006; however, the 
numerical determinations in the table do provide a good snapshot of the 
overall impact from methyl bromide usage.    
 
It must be kept in mind that the impact from use of some ozone-depleting 
compounds extends for long periods after their use has ceased due to long 
half-lives in the atmosphere.  The half-life of methyl bromide is relatively 
short (0.7 year) and the benefits to ozone recovery (5 percent cited in  
table 1) from phaseout would occur within a few years; however, other 
reductions in use of ozone-depleting substances do not necessarily result 
in such rapid removal from the atmosphere.  In theory, recovery of the

table 1) from phaseout would occur within a few years; however, other 
reductions in use of ozone-depleting substances do not necessarily result 
in such rapid removal from the atmosphere.  In theory, recovery of the 
ozone layer should occur by 2065 with or without further restrictions on 
unregulated uses.  However, “the return of ozone to pre-1980 levels” by 
2065 is not certain due to changes in the atmosphere since 1980 (page 6.1 
of NOAA et al., 2007).  The influence of global warming agents and other 
compounds on atmospheric conditions creates uncertainty about the rate 
and time required for recovery of ozone from the various scenarios 
considered by UNEP.  APHIS does discuss and consider this information 
in the text of the final SEIS.      
 
Appendix A.  Public Comments A–15   
Comment:  This comment suggests that the primary factor in increased 
QPS production relates to compliance with ISPM 15. 
 
Response:  In using reported information, one must take care in placing 
weight on numerical figures.  Although the UNEP, MBTOC report (2007) 
at page 58 attributes the increased consumption of methyl bromide in 2005 
for QPS usage largely to compliance with ISPM 15, some uses reported to 
UNEP were reclassified by EPA as QPS for the first time in 2005 (see 
pages 13 to 14 and 37 of the final SEIS).  In particular, the QPS reporting

, some uses reported to 
UNEP were reclassified by EPA as QPS for the first time in 2005 (see 
pages 13 to 14 and 37 of the final SEIS).  In particular, the QPS reporting 
by the United States in 2005 reclassified some critical use exemptions as 
QPS based upon export preshipment requirements.  This amounted to 
inclusion of an additional 1,209 MT of methyl bromide (which in previous 
years was part of critical use exemption reporting) listed as QPS in their 
2005 reporting to UNEP (EPA, OPP, 2005).  This 1,209 MT increase in 
QPS reporting by the United States in 2005 for articles other than WPM 
could account for over one-third of the total increase in QPS cited by 
UNEP (3,155 MT).  Such changes in classification for reporting purposes 
by various countries may even account for more of the increased 
reporting.  Although it is reasonable to expect some increased usage of 
methyl bromide to comply with ISPM 15, the UNEP document does not 
clearly break down how much increase related to different categories of 
QPS in 2005.  Their reporting has not required reporting the breakdown of 
QPS by category.  However, many countries were complying with ISPM 
15 in 2005 and those countries using methyl bromide to treat wood 
packing material would be expected to report greater usage of methyl 
bromide to UNEP.  Combining the quantity of methyl bromide associated 
with wood packing materials in 2004 (679 MT determined from page 12 
of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) with the 3,155 MT attributed to WPM in 2005 
gives a total amount of 3,834 MT annually.  This amount could be

 to UNEP.  Combining the quantity of methyl bromide associated 
with wood packing materials in 2004 (679 MT determined from page 12 
of UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) with the 3,155 MT attributed to WPM in 2005 
gives a total amount of 3,834 MT annually.  This amount could be 
adjusted for the U.S. changes in reporting in 2005 to amount to 2,625 MT 
annually.  However, when the effort is made to account for all such 
changes, the association between numerical changes and specific uses is 
not clear.  The aggregate methyl bromide estimate for compliance with 
ISPM 15 in the final SEIS (page 37) ranges from 3,191 to 9,628 MT per 
year.  The UNEP numbers are not outside this projected range if one 
anticipates some increased usage in 2006 as additional countries comply 
with ISPM 15; however, there is no reason to assume that such increases 
would continue, particularly when most countries are not showing 
preference for fumigation with methyl bromide over the use of heat 
treatment or substitute packing materials.  To establish a clear trend in 
usage, the data need to be specific to methyl bromide treatment of WPM, 
and the occurrence needs to be based upon more than one data point.  Any 
long-term trend can not be established from the present data of UNEP or is 
at best tenuous.

increasing the initial methyl bromide charge cited by UNEP (MBTOC, 
2007) in the final SEIS.  Any effects from this occurrence and the 
retreatment, in places like Australia, should become evident in future 
reporting to UNEP.  The indication of under-representation of wood 
products as a proportion of QPS fumigation (page 287 of UNEP, MBTOC, 
2007) seems reasonably likely, given the other reporting problems 
described above and in the text.  Reported amounts are less than our 
methyl bromide estimates, so such statements indicating under-
representation of reported use of methyl bromide for wood products to 
UNEP are consistent with our analysis.   
 
APHIS is continuing to work with other countries to develop methods that 
are compatible with their packing needs as part of coordination with other 
countries through the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC).  It 
is desirable for those less developed countries and smaller WPM 
companies using methyl bromide to convert over to heat treatment or use 
substitute materials in their compliance.  APHIS is committed to work 
with the IPPC on decreasing pest risk in packing materials in a manner 
that lowers other environmental impacts.  Part of this commitment 
involves working on a draft International Standard for Phytosanitary

with the IPPC on decreasing pest risk in packing materials in a manner 
that lowers other environmental impacts.  Part of this commitment 
involves working on a draft International Standard for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) for “Developing A Strategy To Reduce Or Replace The 
Use of Methyl Bromide for Phytosanitary Purposes.”  This standard has 
been under review since June 2007 by the contracting parties to the IPPC.   
 
Comment:  The comment cites inconsistent and missing QPS usage data 
reported to UNEP regarding methyl bromide usage.   
 
Response:  This is exactly the reason that APHIS does not depend upon 
their reporting as the primary basis for quantitation, but uses it mainly as a 
cross-check of the information collected through NPPOs.   
 
This issue is partly covered in response to point 5 from the California 
Attorney General’s Office and others.  The breakdown by country is 
presented in appendix E by category.  Use of method 1 applies to the 
usage of methyl bromide by those 65 countries lacking compliance data 
that are assumed to fumigate with methyl bromide.  Method 2 strictly 
applies to China.  Method 3 applies to Canada, Mexico, and the 
22 countries providing some data about fumigating WPM with methyl 
bromide to comply with APHIS regulations.  Method 4 strictly applies to 
Hong Kong.  Method 5 applies only to Japan which indicated fumigation 
prior to assembly of WPM.  For China, Hong Kong, and the 65 countries

22 countries providing some data about fumigating WPM with methyl

Hong Kong.  Method 5 applies only to Japan which indicated fumigation 
prior to assembly of WPM.  For China, Hong Kong, and the 65 countries 
analyzed under method 1 where compliance data are lacking, the analysis 
applied half of their WPM to heat treatment and half to fumigation with 
methyl bromide.  Method 4 applies to Hong Kong and involves 
“Treatment of Assembled WPM in Sealed Containers Before Loading of 
Cargo,” not treatment before assembly (see page D–5 of the draft SEIS.  
The basis for this method is explained on page 21 of the draft SEIS and

related to representative treatment from the origin of many shipments 
there.  These methods are designed to provide a conservatively high 
estimate for those countries where data are lacking.  Where more 
information was available, more refined calculations were used in the 
SEIS’ refinement of methyl bromide estimates. 
 
APHIS does acknowledge that there are alternate options to methyl 
bromide; however, APHIS has limited regulatory authority independent of 
formal justification to the IPPC.  Further, there are several issues to 
address prior to requiring alternative treatments to methyl bromide (e.g., 
cost comparisons, environmental impacts, durability, etc.).  Any shipping 
requirements implemented in this regard would need to continue to

formal justification to the IPPC.  Further, there are several issues to 
address prior to requiring alternative treatments to methyl bromide (e.g., 
cost comparisons, environmental impacts, durability, etc.).  Any shipping 
requirements implemented in this regard would need to continue to 
facilitate trade and be equally feasible for both developed and developing 
countries. 
 
Comment:  Part of the comment suggests the use of recycle and recapture 
technologies by which methyl bromide emissions can be captured and 
removed prior to release following treatments.   
 
Response:  Recycle and recapture technologies may have the ability to 
reduce methyl bromide emissions; however, the cost of such systems must 
be assessed to determine the feasibility of such systems for all shipping 
countries.  This was discussed briefly on page 62 in the FEIS.  Also, the 
assessment of such systems would need to be initiated in a proposed 
rulemaking outside of this SEIS.  
 
Comment:  The comment also mentions Japan’s proposal to use a mixture 
to treat wood packaging material which includes sulfuryl fluoride, methyl 
isothiocyanate, and methyl iodide.   
 
Response:  There are many potential alternatives to methyl bromide; 
however, they have not been adopted for use in place of methyl bromide 
for various reasons.  Although sulfuryl fluoride may not pose the same 
harmful ozone depleting effects as methyl bromide, it may not provide the 
efficacy necessary to eliminate all life stages (including egg stage) for pest 
risks of concern.  Similarly, methyl isothiocyanate and methyl iodide

for various reasons.  Although sulfuryl fluoride may not pose the same 
harmful ozone depleting effects as methyl bromide, it may not provide the 
efficacy necessary to eliminate all life stages (including egg stage) for pest 
risks of concern.  Similarly, methyl isothiocyanate and methyl iodide 
require further efficacy data to determine if they are sufficient candidates 
for the treatment of wood packaging material to prevent U.S. wood pests 
of concern (e.g., ALB).  In addition, the environmental characteristics of 
these pesticides need further consideration.  For example, sulfuryl fluoride 
is known to contribute to global warming on the order of 25,000 times the 
global warming potential of carbon dioxide (Dervos and Vassiliou, 2000 
as cited in Knight, 2004).  Contributing to another global problem 
(atmospheric warming) to reduce a different global impact (ozone 
depletion) is probably not an appropriate solution.  Moreover, this SEIS is 
limited to the refinement of methyl bromide estimates and, thus, the

held by APHIS would translate to the probable arrival in the United States 
of many quarantine pests.   
 
Response:  The claim made in the paper expresses one opinion and has 
been reviewed by APHIS managers.   
 
Comment:  The comment also discusses treatment failure rates and 
technical justification for Australia’s standard.   
 
Response:  The pests of quarantine significance to Australia differ from 
those of concern to the United States, so it is difficult to ascertain what 
actually applies to APHIS regulations.     
 
Comment:  In their comment citing a study by Burgess (2005) and Allen 
(2001b), question is raised over the limited acceptable confirmation for 
treatments.  However, there are several requirements for ensuring that 
compliance with treatments are achieved (e.g., IPPC container markings).   
 
Response:  APHIS is concerned with compliance with our regulations and 
did consider this issue in early rulemaking.  This was part of the reason for 
conducting the compliance study of China cited on page 16 of the FEIS.  
Further, ongoing monitoring of pest interceptions allows for continuing 
assessment of how effective and how well treatment requirements are 
being adhered to.  APHIS, in early deliberations, recognized the potential 
for some fraud and continues to work with NPPOs of other countries to 
ensure that treatments of packing materials adhere to our regulatory 
requirements.

Thc National Wooden Pallet and Container Association (NWPCA) is the largest

membership base is in the U.S., wc have members in 29 other countries. 
Wood palleks and containers are the most environmentally rcsponsihle shipping and

Wooden pallets transport \vcll over 85 percent of evcry manufactured product that is 
bagged, crated, boxed or othc~wise packaged and shipped throughout the entirc world. Thcy are 
indispensable to global commerce. 
Obviously our membcrs have a major stake in cnsuring the perpctualion of America's

that al~arrntivr: Inaterials to wood packaging would have fewcr environmental conscqumces. 
These statements are made without any references to scienlilic evidmce to support them. One 
suclr slatcmenl is as follows: 
"Subslimte packaging materials only (prohibition of WPM)', as suggested in the FEIS, 
would achieve the greatcst ~eciuction ofpcst risk with the lcast environmcntal impact

The burning of fossil fuels produces air pollution and carbon dioxide (C02), which is a 
'

- 
 atmosphere, rclease oxygcn back, and usc the carbon to produce wood and leaves. Through this 
process, trces remove large quanii tics of cubon dioxide from the ahnosphcre and slore it in their 
cells. 
Inen a lrcc is cut down, 111e carbon it slored during its life cycle is retained within its 
ccllular structure. The h'westing of trces and manufacturing of forest products transfers the 
carbon from the forests Lo wood products likc pallets and containers. Those wood shpping 
platforms, store carbon for long periods of time. Altcmative materials - especially 
pctrochcn~ical byproducts - cannot compete with wood in this environnltntal arena. 
The wood pallet and coritai~ler industry ha successfully adopted and put into pr-ctice 
effective pest elimination standards. Through monitoring by a variety of PPOs around the world 
wc know there have becn few infestations since the international standard has bcen put in place

standard long heforc it look effecl. This knowledge transfer sprcad bcyond the industry to 
include wood pallet 'and container uscrs and industry suppliers so the response to the new 
nleasure was quick, efficient and operational from the earliest days or the treatrnenl programs. 
fhe colwmus of thc international Plan1 Protection Organizations (PPO) was that there 
would be two allowsblc treatment methods that had been determine.. to be eMective in the 
elimination of invasivc species - heat treatment and fumigation with Mcthyl Bromide. At the 
request and urging of APHIS USDA, NWPCA was designated as the manaser of the fumigation 
program with the American Lumbcr Standards Committee (ALSC) taking on the supervising rolc 
Tor heat treatment. 
From the outset, NWPCA viewed the fumigation program as lirnitcd, and probably 
temporary, as far as United States wood packaging production is concemcd. The use of Methyl 
Bromide is necessary a1 this time for many of the less developed participating countries in the

NWPCA wclcomes a replacenlent ibr Mcthyl Bromide. Currently, it is an accepted 
international lrcatmenl method and remains necessary for some industry members in the U.S. 
and a number of countries worldwide. We encourage and support the development of effective, 
efficient, workable treatment options that would be environmentally responsible alternatives to 
fumigation. When such an alternative becomes viable. NWPCA will educate our industry on its 
effxtive use. However, any suggcstion or implication that the use of alternative materials is 
environmentally adv.antageou as u means of eradicating invasivc species is totally unacceptable, 
impractical and contrary to a harmonized international rule.

’ JOINT SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
1
INTRODUCTION
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a procedural statute that requires an 
agency, before committing to a major federal action, to carefully and objectively analyze the
environmental consequences of the action and all reasonable alternatives to it.  APHIS concedes
that it failed to take this required “hard look” when it based its estimate of global methyl bromide 
usage that will result from the challenged Rule on an assumption that was not only unfounded, 
but flatly contradicted by a key document that the agency possessed at the time of its rulemaking, 
yet failed to review.  
To cure this material NEPA violation, APHIS proposes to revise its methyl bromide 
estimate and, depending on the outcome, prepare either an “environmental assessment” or a 
“supplemental” environmental impact statement (EIS) based on the revised estimate.  See Ltr.
from Michael J. Garcia to U.S. District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna (June 21, 2006).1  APHIS 
thus purports to “remedy” its baseless methyl bromide estimate by performing a new analysis 
now – and if the numbers work out the same, no harm, no foul.  APHIS will simply note its 
findings in an environmental assessment, which involves a more cursory analysis and less 
opportunity for public comment than a full EIS, and conclude that the agency’s decision to adopt
the Rule was right all along.  
This is not the process that NEPA prescribes.  First, correction of APHIS’s failure to 
properly evaluate the environmental consequences of an action

 involves a more cursory analysis and less 
opportunity for public comment than a full EIS, and conclude that the agency’s decision to adopt
the Rule was right all along.  
This is not the process that NEPA prescribes.  First, correction of APHIS’s failure to 
properly evaluate the environmental consequences of an action in an EIS warrants the re-
evaluation of those environmental consequences in nothing short of a new EIS.2  Second, the 
   
1 APHIS also seeks an order declaring plaintiffs’ claims with regard to the methyl bromide issue mooted based on 
its concession and voluntary remand.  A claim is moot only when no effective relief for the alleged violation can be 
given.  See Fund for Animals v. Babbit, 89 F.3d 128, 133 (2d Cir. 1996); see also Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. 
Alexander, 303 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002).  Because plaintiffs challenge APHIS’s proposed remedy, the 
methyl bromide claim is not moot.
2 A supplemental EIS (SEIS) is actually the same as a new EIS.  Whether an environmental impact statement is 
deemed “supplemental” or “new” is inconsequential; both require a reconsideration of the decision to adopt the Rule

 this issue from the other faults in the EIS is improper.  Precedent dictates that 
the Court review the current EIS as a whole, rather than address its defects on a piecemeal basis.  
This ensures that on remand APHIS will address the full scope of the current EIS’s deficiencies, 
thereby promoting judicial and administrative efficiency, as well as minimizing the ability of the 
agency to paper over individual defects so as to adhere to its original decision.  Consequently, 
before imposing any remedy, the Court should examine the entire EIS and decide plaintiffs’ 
summary judgment motion, which has been fully briefed.  
APHIS’s concession also casts doubt on APHIS’s analysis of other issues in the EIS, and 
underscores plaintiffs’ concern that the EIS is merely a post-hoc rationalization of a regulation 
that APHIS had firmly committed to before conducting the required NEPA review.  The Court is 
thus justified in taking a more critical view of the remaining issues: APHIS’s failure (a) to 
evaluate the reasonable alternative of a multi-year phase-out of raw wood packaging and (b) to 
address how counterfeiting of treatment undermines the effectiveness of the current Rule, a 
problem that the phase-out alternative would obviously eliminate.
All of the analytical failures in the current EIS interact with one another.  A different 
methyl bromide usage estimate, for instance, might have given APHIS greater pause before 
discarding the option of phasing-in substitute packaging.  Likewise, a reasonable assessment of a
phase-in of substitutes might have lowered APHIS’s resistance to adopting practicable 
requirements that are both more effective against invasive pests and less damaging to the ozone 
layer.  In

 usage estimate, for instance, might have given APHIS greater pause before 
discarding the option of phasing-in substitute packaging.  Likewise, a reasonable assessment of a
phase-in of substitutes might have lowered APHIS’s resistance to adopting practicable 
requirements that are both more effective against invasive pests and less damaging to the ozone 
layer.  In short, if APHIS had rationally conducted the “hard look” required by NEPA, the 
agency might have adopted a different rule under the Plant Protection Act.  
Once the Court determines the full scope of APHIS’s NEPA liability, plaintiffs 
     
based on the new or revised information.  The terms “SEIS” and “EIS” have been used interchangeably by the 
courts.  See Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 701 F.2d 1011, 1035 (2d Cir. 1983).

respectfully request that the Court order APHIS to prepare a new EIS that (a) estimates the likely 
increase in methyl bromide use to be expected under the Rule based on realistic assumptions, (b) 
evaluates the environmental impact of counterfeit marking, and (c) takes an objective look at a 
phase-out of raw wood packaging implemented over a reasonable range of time periods.  In 
addition, plaintiffs request that the Court order APHIS to re-evaluate, based on this new EIS, 
whether its current Rule, which tolerates both continued pest risk and depletion of the ozone 
layer indefinitely, is the best choice given the alternative of a phased transition to substitute 
packaging that eliminates both hazards.3

IS to re-evaluate, based on this new EIS, 
whether its current Rule, which tolerates both continued pest risk and depletion of the ozone 
layer indefinitely, is the best choice given the alternative of a phased transition to substitute 
packaging that eliminates both hazards.3  
ARGUMENT
I. APHIS’s Conceded Error in Estimating Methyl Bromide Usage Constitutes a NEPA 
Violation Requiring Preparation of a New EIS.
There is now no longer any question that APHIS violated NEPA with regard to the 
methyl bromide estimate. APHIS admits that its estimate was flawed because the agency relied 
on an unfounded assumption that methyl bromide fumigation would occur before, rather than 
after, cargo is loaded onto pallets and into shipping containers.  This assumption was also 
contradicted by a previously undisclosed 80-page report, the result of an APHIS inspection of 
methyl bromide fumigation operations in China in 1999.  See Ltr from Michael J. Garcia to U.S. 
District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna (June 21, 2006).  
APHIS’s failure to evaluate relevant data has serious consequences.  First, it completely 
undercuts NEPA’s “hard look” requirement.  NEPA “does not allow an agency to rely upon the 
conclusions and opinions of its staff … without providing both supporting analysis and data.”  
   
3 Plaintiffs do not intend to impede APHIS’s development of a revised methyl bromide estimate, which it says it has 
already begun.  Plaintiffs insist only that APHIS be barred from attempting to close out the issue of the adequacy of 
its methyl bromide estimate with

 analysis and data.”  
   
3 Plaintiffs do not intend to impede APHIS’s development of a revised methyl bromide estimate, which it says it has 
already begun.  Plaintiffs insist only that APHIS be barred from attempting to close out the issue of the adequacy of 
its methyl bromide estimate with a cursory environmental assessment conducted without the discipline required in a 
full EIS, specifically without soliciting and having to respond to public comments, without addressing in an 
integrated fashion all of the related defects in the current EIS, and without a meaningful opportunity for this Court’s 
review of the resultant product.

Sierra Club v. Eubanks, 335 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1076 (E.D. Cal. 2004) (citing Idaho Sporting 
Congress v. Thomas, 137 F.3d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir. 1998)). “Credible scientific evidence that 
contraindicates a proposed action must also be evaluated and disclosed.”  Id. (citing 40 C.F.R. § 
1502.9(b)).  “An agency’s hard look should include neither researching in a cursory manner nor 
sweeping negative evidence under the rug.”  Nat’l Audubon Soc’y v. Dep’t of Navy, 422 F.3d 
174, 194 (4th Cir. 2005).
Second, APHIS’s error has significant implications for human health and the 
environment. APHIS likely dramatically underestimated global methyl bromide usage under the 
Rule because post-loading fumigation uses a far greater amount of methyl bromide than pre-
loading fumigation.  If APHIS’

 194 (4th Cir. 2005).
Second, APHIS’s error has significant implications for human health and the 
environment. APHIS likely dramatically underestimated global methyl bromide usage under the 
Rule because post-loading fumigation uses a far greater amount of methyl bromide than pre-
loading fumigation.  If APHIS’s first global estimate (done in conjunction with a rule regarding 
wood products from Mexico) is correct, see Pls.’ Opening Br. at 18, then the current Rule has 
resulted in the global release of 400 times as much methyl bromide annually for quarantine uses 
as before the Rule.  Id. at 39.  
In light of these legal and environmental consequences, APHIS’s faulty methyl bromide 
analysis alone suffices to require a new EIS.  APHIS proposes an environmental assessment, and 
not an EIS, as a remedy if the agency deems the new estimate to be similar to the original one.  
This type of cursory documentation is insufficient to remedy APHIS’s fundamental – and likely 
pervasive – procedural error, especially after the agency has already committed to a rule and the 
danger of post-hoc rationalization exists.  An environmental assessment is a short analysis 
conducted at the beginning of the rulemaking process to determine whether the agency’s 
proposal will significantly affect the environment and thus require a full analysis of impacts and 
alternatives in an EIS. See, e.g., Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 546 (11th Cir. 
1996).  APHIS long ago determined that the Rule does significantly affect the environment,
5
largely because of the danger to the ozone layer posed by

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 full analysis of impacts and 
alternatives in an EIS. See, e.g., Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 546 (11th Cir. 
1996).  APHIS long ago determined that the Rule does significantly affect the environment,
5
largely because of the danger to the ozone layer posed by methyl bromide, and thus that it was 
obligated to undertake an EIS.  Having conceded its failure to produce an accurate methyl 
bromide estimate, the required remedy is for APHIS to redo the EIS:  to take the required “hard 
look” at the methyl bromide issue (and other faults in the current EIS), provide a detailed 
analysis of its findings, solicit public comments, and reconsider the underlying decision.
II. The Court Should Evaluate the EIS as a Whole to Determine the Full Extent of the 
NEPA Violation Before Remanding the Rule for Reconsideration in a New EIS.
Even if APHIS were to agree to conduct an EIS, not merely an environmental 
assessment, regarding the revised methyl bromide estimate, a partial remand on this one issue 
without consideration of other defects in the current EIS (the failures to consider counterfeit 
marks and a transition to substitute packaging) is contrary to NEPA principles. By requiring a 
“hard look” at all reasonable alternatives and their environmental impacts, NEPA requires that 
alternatives and impacts be analyzed in relation to each other, not in isolation.4 A court should 
thus review the EIS as a whole, taking a “totality of the circumstances” approach.  See Nat’l 
Audobon Soc’y v. Dep’t of Navy, 422

 their environmental impacts, NEPA requires that 
alternatives and impacts be analyzed in relation to each other, not in isolation.4 A court should 
thus review the EIS as a whole, taking a “totality of the circumstances” approach.  See Nat’l 
Audobon Soc’y v. Dep’t of Navy, 422 F.3d 174, 186 (4th Cir. 2005) (“[A] court must view 
deficiencies in one portion of an EIS in light of how they affect the entire analysis.…[and] 
examine all of the various components of an agency’s environmental analysis in order to 
determine, on the whole, whether the agency has conducted the required ‘hard look.’”).
In conducting this review, a court is entitled to examine the EIS at issue with an 
especially critical eye. The failure to analyze information critical to the methyl bromide estimate 
undermines APHIS’s analytical credibility with regard to the other two NEPA issues.  It also

suggests that the current EIS was a post-hoc rationalization.  APHIS published the draft EIS in 
October 2002, six months after agreeing to the International Plant Protection Convention’s
methyl bromide treatment guidelines.  APHIS itself described the EIS as “unusually concise and 
subjective.”  Draft EIS at 4.  These factors call into question APHIS’s compliance with NEPA.  
A. APHIS’s Failure to Consider the Phase-Out Alternative Violates NEPA.
Although APHIS concedes the need for a new methyl bromide analysis, it adamantly 
refuses to do an analysis of the alternative that APHIS itself identified – a phase-out of raw wood 
in favor of substitute packaging over a reasonable transition period – that would both reduce the 
need for methyl bromide and increase the effectiveness of the regulation.  Both APHIS’s EIS and 
the Rule clearly show that the agency did not examine this option, in violation of NEPA’s 
requirement to examine all reasonable alternatives.  
As detailed in plaintiffs’ briefs, APHIS first identified the option of moving from raw 
wood packaging to substitutes over a reasonable transition period in a 1999 Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051 (Jan.
Text Len: 1488
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, in violation of NEPA’s 
requirement to examine all reasonable alternatives.  
As detailed in plaintiffs’ briefs, APHIS first identified the option of moving from raw 
wood packaging to substitutes over a reasonable transition period in a 1999 Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051 (Jan. 20, 1999).  Although the agency 
promised to seek public comment on that option and analyze the environmental effects of any 
alternatives in full compliance with NEPA, see id., it did not do so.  
This is apparent from comparing the Notice with the Rule.  The Rule’s preamble does 
have a section entitled “Phasing Out WPM in Favor of Manufactured Materials,” 69 Fed. Reg.
55,719, 55721-23 (Sept. 16, 2004), but the contents of this section demonstrate that APHIS 
actually ignored the phase-out option and considered only an immediate ban.  The agency 
repeated its conclusions that substitute packaging “would achieve the greatest possible reduction 
in risk from the introduction of pests and pathogens associated with WPM,” and that compared 
to the prescribed treatment methods, “use of alternative packing materials reduces risk even 
7
more.”  69 Fed. Reg. at 55721 (emphasis added).5 But rather than address the phase-out option, 
the remaining discussion is entirely limited to the asserted economic problems of banning wood 
packaging immediately.  
Even the very pages of the final EIS to which APHIS cites in its reply brief show 
precisely the opposite of APHIS’s contention that it actually evaluated the phase-out option.  
Some statements merely reiterated the problem with an immediate ban.  See

 entirely limited to the asserted economic problems of banning wood 
packaging immediately.  
Even the very pages of the final EIS to which APHIS cites in its reply brief show 
precisely the opposite of APHIS’s contention that it actually evaluated the phase-out option.  
Some statements merely reiterated the problem with an immediate ban.  See Final EIS at 78 
(referencing industry’s inability to “quickly tool up” to switch to substitute packaging) (emphasis 
added).  Other statements identified the need to evaluate a transitional period.  See id. (Substitute
packaging “would require a phase-in period”).  APHIS cannot bootstrap the mere identification
of needed analysis into an excuse for failing to undertake that analysis.6 Nor can APHIS excuse 
the failure to attempt any analysis of possible phase-out schedules merely by asserting that the 
analysis might be “difficult.”  Id. at A-5.7 And finally, APHIS cannot shift the responsibility for 
analyzing the phase-out option – an option that the agency itself identified and promised to 
assess in 1999 – onto the public commenters.8  
   
5  See also, Draft EIS at 37, 38 (substitute packaging would provide “substantially decreased risk from the 
introduction of pest organisms,” and “would considerably reduce inspection efforts and would largely eliminate pest 
risks from wood-feeding insects and diseases”).  The draft EIS also stated:  “None of the treatment methods have 
been shown to effectively eliminate all pests. “  Id. at 83.
6 APHIS also observed that under present conditions substitute packaging was “unlikely to be the predominant 
packing material

 and would largely eliminate pest 
risks from wood-feeding insects and diseases”).  The draft EIS also stated:  “None of the treatment methods have 
been shown to effectively eliminate all pests. “  Id. at 83.
6 APHIS also observed that under present conditions substitute packaging was “unlikely to be the predominant 
packing material for the foreseeable future.”  Id.  This states no more than the obvious:  that absent restrictions on 
raw wood packaging, substitutes will gain market share slowly.  It certainly does not constitute an analysis of what 
could be accomplished with a restriction on raw wood phased in over a reasonable transitional period.  That analysis 
is found nowhere in the remainder of the final EIS.  In the final EIS Appendix (A-5), APHIS refers back to the draft 
EIS.  But aside from identifying the need for a phase-in period, the draft EIS contained no analysis of how the option 
might be implemented or how long would be required.  Draft EISat 38.  It simply dropped the matter there. 
7 The appendix to the final EIS said only this:  “It is difficult for APHIS to specify a time period when the present 
ability of substitute packing manufacturers to supply the market indicates a need for extended growth of the 
industry. The compliance time is particularly difficult to project when the new regulations are specifically directed to 
address packing materials from foreign countries whose industries may be less able to adjust readily to proposed 
changes.”  Final EIS at A-5 (emphasis added).  But APHIS made no effort at all.
8 APHIS acknowledged that “some comments were received in response to the Advanced Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking…supporting the phasing out of SWPM.”  But

 whose industries may be less able to adjust readily to proposed 
changes.”  Final EIS at A-5 (emphasis added).  But APHIS made no effort at all.
8 APHIS acknowledged that “some comments were received in response to the Advanced Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking…supporting the phasing out of SWPM.”  But APHIS then sought to blame the commenters 
for not providing “substantive information that could contribute to establishing a specific time period for compliance 
changes.”  It is the agency’s duty to rigorously explore and objectively analyze all reasonable alternatives, and in 
this case, an alternative identified by the agency itself.  See 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(iii); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(a).

APHIS’s reply brief attempts a two-part excuse for the failure to evaluate the phase-out 
alternative.  First, APHIS asserts that the Rule provides an “appropriate” level of protection.  
Defs.’ Reply Br. at 4.9 Second, APHIS asserts a transition to substitutes is barred by the World 
Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
because it is not the least trade restrictive means of providing the “appropriate” level of 
protection.  Id.  Neither part of APHIS’s argument withstands inspection.  
First, the treaty (and the related International Plant Protection Convention) expressly 
preserve each nation’s right to adopt domestic measures stricter than an international guideline if 
they are justified by sound science.  See Pls.’ Reply Br. at 18.  APHIS concedes that it “can

’s argument withstands inspection.  
First, the treaty (and the related International Plant Protection Convention) expressly 
preserve each nation’s right to adopt domestic measures stricter than an international guideline if 
they are justified by sound science.  See Pls.’ Reply Br. at 18.  APHIS concedes that it “can 
always choose to revise its own measures unilaterally,” even if the international community does 
not agree.  See Defs.’ Reply Br. at 16.  Thus, APHIS errs in suggesting that a transition to 
substitutes is barred per se as trade restrictive. 
Second, APHIS’s assertion that the current level of protection is “appropriate” is 
groundless given the fact that the agency does not actually know how much protection the Rule
provides.  Rather, since APHIS has repeatedly admitted that substitutes would provide 
“substantially decreased risk” and “the greatest possible reduction in risk,” see page 7, supra, the 
agency should have shown some interest in whether it could do better. 
In short, to meet its “hard look” responsibilities under NEPA, APHIS should have 
assessed how phasing in substitutes over a period of time would mitigate the asserted costs of an 
immediate ban, how much more pest protection would be achieved, and how much less damage 
would be inflicted on the ozone layer.  Only after analyzing these three factors would APHIS be
in a position to determine what level of pest risk is “appropriate” and what pest protections are

“practicable” under the Plant Protection Act.10  
B. APHIS’s Failure to Address the Consequences of Counterfeit Treatment of 
Raw Wood Packaging Under the Rule Also Violates NEPA.  
APHIS overestimated the effectiveness of the Rule by failing to consider the problem of 
fraudulent certification – where raw wood packaging is marked as treated without actually 
having been treated.  See Compl. ¶¶ 7, 12, 68-70; Pls.’ Opening Br. at 2, 3, 19; Pls.’ Reply Br. at 
10.  APHIS assumed throughout its rulemaking that foreign shippers will properly implement the 
agency’s treatment methods, despite evidence that some fraudulently certify untreated raw wood 
packaging as having been treated, and that fraudulent certifications cannot be detected at U.S. 
ports. See Pls.’ Reply Br. at 13. The problem of fraudulent markings was identified in 
comments to the Rule, see AR-V.6, and has since been publicly acknowledged by agency 
personnel, see Compl. ¶¶ 68-70.  APHIS states only that it will target inspections on fraudulent 
certifiers, see Defs.’ Reply Br. at 11, but this presumes that the fraud is detectable.

personnel, see Compl. ¶¶ 68-70.  APHIS states only that it will target inspections on fraudulent 
certifiers, see Defs.’ Reply Br. at 11, but this presumes that the fraud is detectable.  
Unfortunately, when pest outbreaks are found in our cities and forests, it will be far too late to 
connect the dots back to the guilty shippers.  
III. The Court Should Set a Schedule for Simultaneous Reconsideration on All Three 
NEPA Deficiencies.
Preparation of a new EIS is the proper remedy even when there is one defect in the EIS, 
see Natural Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., 421 F.3d 797, 810 n.26 (9th Cir. 2005) – here 
there are three. Rather than ruling and remanding on each deficiency, however, the most 
efficient path for the Court is to rule and remand on all simultaneously.  Avoiding piecemeal 
adjudication also saves the agency the time and expense of preparing multiple revisions of the 
EIS and the Rule.  More importantly, it promotes the “hard look” and reasoned decisionmaking 
   
10 As plaintiffs have shown, the Plant Protection Act does not give APHIS carte blanche to deem pest risks 
“appropriate” or “acceptable” when there are more effective “practicable” measures available.  See Pls.’ Reply Br. at

the new EIS as another post-hoc justification of its original decision.11  
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ proposed order to dismiss part of plaintiffs’ 
complaint as moot should be denied.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court rule on their
summary judgment motion, require preparation of a new EIS to address all of the issues raised 
herein, and remand the Rule for reconsideration in light of that EIS.  Plaintiffs also request that 
the Court establish a timeline for review of the new EIS, suggesting that APHIS have no more 
than nine months to publish a draft EIS and proposed new rule for public comment and no more 
than 18 months to issue a final EIS and a new Rule.  Plaintiffs also request that the Court retain 
jurisdiction to satisfy itself that APHIS has properly remedied the defects in the existing EIS.

   Re: Draft Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement – 
February 2007, Importation of Solid Wood Packing Material 
Docket No. APHIS-2006-0152 
 
Dear Mr. Bergsten: 
 
 Thank you for extending the comment period on the draft supplement to the FEIS.  Since 
the original comment deadline, there has been a significant court decision and important new 
information has become available.  We submit these comments to supplement those filed April 
23, 2007. 
 
A. Natural Resources Defense Council v. USDA Requires Reconsideration of the 
Wood Packing Rule
 
On June 4, 2007, in Natural Resources Defense Council v. USDA, 05 Civ. 8005 (LMM), 
the District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled on behalf of NRDC and the four 
State plaintiffs that APHIS violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) “in the 
matter of its estimate of the amount of methyl bromide that will be released into the atmosphere 
by reason of the rule at issue.”  Slip op. at 20.  The Court stated that APHIS:   
 
has not complied with NEPA but rather acted arbitrarily and capriciously in that 
(i) its assumption that pre-loading fumigation will substantially replace post-
loading fumigation is flawed, (ii) that flaw affects the methyl bromide release 
findings of the FEIS in a significant way, and (iii) the relation of its much higher 
estimates in connection with the China Inter

 acted arbitrarily and capriciously in that 
(i) its assumption that pre-loading fumigation will substantially replace post-
loading fumigation is flawed, (ii) that flaw affects the methyl bromide release 
findings of the FEIS in a significant way, and (iii) the relation of its much higher 
estimates in connection with the China Interim Rule and the Mexico Rule to the 
present situation have not been considered adequately, or, if they have been, have 
not been adequately explained in the FEIS. 
 
Id. at 20-21.  The Court continued:  “APHIS is to prepare and circulate a supplemental 
Environmental Impact Statement including a corrected estimate of the amount of methyl bromide 
that will be released annually, taking into consideration the higher estimates reached in 
connection with the China Interim Rule and the Mexico Rule, and explaining its views on the 
environmental impact of such new information and how that affects its decision to proceed or not 
with the rule at issue now in effect.”  Id. at 21.   The Court instructed that:   
 

APHIS must, after considering its new methyl bromide release estimate, 
evaluate its rulemaking decision anew.  “Although an [Environmental Impact 
Statement] may be supplemented, the critical agency decision must, of course, be 
made after the supplement has been circulated, considered and discussed in the 
light of the alternatives, not before. Otherwise the process becomes a useless 
ritual, defeating the purpose of NEPA, and rather making a mockery of it.”  
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Callaway, 524 F.2d 79, 92 (2d Cir. 
1975).  The amount of methyl bromide that will be released is too

 alternatives, not before. Otherwise the process becomes a useless 
ritual, defeating the purpose of NEPA, and rather making a mockery of it.”  
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Callaway, 524 F.2d 79, 92 (2d Cir. 
1975).  The amount of methyl bromide that will be released is too significant a 
question to treat as a mere correctible inaccuracy to be made without considering 
the impact of new information.  A corrected methyl bromide estimate in a 
supplemental Environmental Impact Statement cannot be regarded as a matter 
wholly unrelated to APHIS’ rulemaking, as defendants may be suggesting. 
 
Id. at 21-22 (emphasis added, some citations omitted). 
 
 We believe fulfilling the Court’s remand requires a complete and adequate reassessment 
of the methyl bromide estimate, and then a complete re-evaluation of the underlying wood 
packing rule – in the Court’s words, APHIS “must . . . evaluate its rulemaking decision anew.”  
In our judgment, this new evaluation must include a fresh determination whether to change the 
treatment requirements of the rule in view of – 
 
• the magnitude of this unnecessary risk to the ozone layer,  
• the availability of ozone-safe treatment methods (heat treatment and alternative pesticides), 
• the demonstrated problems that compromise the effectiveness of the rule (pest survival after 
proper treatment, and the prevalence of fraudulent certification of treatment), and 
• the availability over a reasonable phase-in period of alternative packing materials that do not 
harbor invasive insect pests. 
 
Natural Resources Defense Council intends to appeal the District Court’s ruling 
regarding the adequacy of APHIS’
Text Len: 1679
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 rule (pest survival after 
proper treatment, and the prevalence of fraudulent certification of treatment), and 
• the availability over a reasonable phase-in period of alternative packing materials that do not 
harbor invasive insect pests. 
 
Natural Resources Defense Council intends to appeal the District Court’s ruling 
regarding the adequacy of APHIS’s consideration of the option of phasing in a requirement for 
the use of alternative packing materials.  We believe the Court erred in concluding that APHIS 
actually considered this option, id. at 15-16.  Further, the Court did not address at all our 
contention that APHIS overestimated the effectiveness of the chosen treatment method by, 
among other things, failing to address the impact of fraudulent treatment certification on the 
failure rate – the rate at which wood packing material will actually contain invasive pests. 
 
We believe the chances of reversing the District Court’s ruling on these points are high.  
Therefore we appeal to APHIS again to broaden the scope of its supplemental EIS and its 
reconsideration of the rule to address these issues – the treatment failure rate and the alternative 
of a transition to alternative packing material – properly now, without further delay.  It makes 
little sense to complete the preparation of a narrow supplemental EIS and reconsideration of the 
underlying rule addressing only the impact of a revised methyl bromide estimate, only to be 
required to undertake a broader EIS and a broader reconsideration of the rule a short time later.   
 
 
B. Risk to the Ozone Layer  
 
 The draft supplemental EIS does not reflect current scientific information on methyl 
bromide’s risk to the ozone layer.  First, we noted in our April 23rd comments

required to undertake a broader EIS and a broader reconsideration of the rule a short time later.   
 
 
B. Risk to the Ozone Layer  
 
 The draft supplemental EIS does not reflect current scientific information on methyl 
bromide’s risk to the ozone layer.  First, we noted in our April 23rd comments that the draft does 
not take into account the most up-to-date international scientific assessment, the World 
Meteorological Association and United Nations Environment Program’s “Scientific Assessment 
Of Ozone Depletion: 2006,”  available at 
http://ozone.unep.org/Assessment_Panels/SAP/Scientific_Assessment_2006/index.shtml. 
 
 The Scientific Assessment report concludes that the phase-out of ozone-depleting 
chemicals under the Montreal Protocol is beginning to work.  Atmospheric concentrations of 
anthropogenic ozone-destroying compounds are coming down.  However, the report states that 
the recovery of the ozone layer will take significantly longer than previously expected.  For 
instance, the Antarctic ozone hole – the most visible symbol of human-caused global 
environmental damage – will not disappear until 2065.  Id. at 21.   
 
Recovery even by this date, however, depends on rigorous enforcement of the Montreal 
Protocol, and that extended and expanded QPS uses of methyl bromide could delay or even 
prevent recovery of the ozone layer: 
 
Failure to comply with the Montreal Protocol would delay, or could even 
prevent, recovery of the ozone layer. Emissions associated with continued or 
expanded exemptions, QPS, process agents, and feedstocks may also delay 
recovery.

prevent recovery of the ozone layer: 
 
Failure to comply with the Montreal Protocol would delay, or could even 
prevent, recovery of the ozone layer. Emissions associated with continued or 
expanded exemptions, QPS, process agents, and feedstocks may also delay 
recovery. 
 
Id. at 23 (emphasis in original).  APHIS has not considered the Scientific Assessment’s 
conclusion that “[e]missions associated with continued or expanded . . . QPS . . . may also delay 
recovery” of the ozone layer. 
 
APHIS’s key assertion – that methyl bromide usage in toto has contributed only a “a 1-
percent effect on stratospheric ozone,” and that methyl bromide use related to APHIS’s wood 
packing rule is only one tenth of that – is both incoherent and out-of-date.   
  
As we noted in the April 23rd comments, the Scientific Assessment reports that new 
research has shown bromine to be a significantly stronger ozone-depleter than previously 
thought:   
 
Bromine is now estimated to be approximately 60 times as effective as 
chlorine in global ozone depletion, on a per-atom basis. This value is larger 
than the effectiveness of 45 used in the 2002 Assessment. This increase in the 
effectiveness of bromine increases the Ozone Depletion Potential of bromine-
containing compounds, evaluated using the semi-empirical method that has been 
used in previous Assessments. 
 
Id. at 21 (emphasis in original).  The draft supplemental EIS reflects no consideration of the 
increase in

. This increase in the 
effectiveness of bromine increases the Ozone Depletion Potential of bromine-
containing compounds, evaluated using the semi-empirical method that has been 
used in previous Assessments. 
 
Id. at 21 (emphasis in original).  The draft supplemental EIS reflects no consideration of the 
increase in the scientific assessment of the ozone-destroying potency of methyl bromide. 
 
 APHIS’s “1-percent effect” assertion is based (inaccurately, we believe) to a 1998 
assessment. The 2006 assessment presents a different picture of the influence of methyl bromide 
in toto, and of QPS methyl bromide in particular.   
 
The Scientific Assessment report evaluated the most effective additional measures that 
could be taken to reduce ozone depletion and hasten recovery of the ozone layer.  The following 
table (reproduced from the Executive Summary at 22) indicates the available measures and the 
percentage reduction in atmospheric loading of ozone-depleting chemicals1 that would result. 
 
 
 
The total elimination of current levels of methyl bromide production at the end of 2006 
would reduce future loadings of ozone-depleting chemicals by 5%.  This is one of the most 
effective measures still available to reduce future ozone depletion. 
 
The report specifically examined the impact of exemptions for critical uses of methyl 
bromide, and for QPS use of methyl bromide.   The results indicate that QPS uses will have a 
much larger impact than acknowledged in the draft supplemental EIS – especially when the 
growth trend of those uses is taken into account.  The Scientific Assessment report first states:  
“The size of the methyl bromide

 methyl 
bromide, and for QPS use of methyl bromide.   The results indicate that QPS uses will have a 
much larger impact than acknowledged in the draft supplemental EIS – especially when the 
growth trend of those uses is taken into account.  The Scientific Assessment report first states:  
“The size of the methyl bromide critical use exemptions is similar to the estimated use of methyl 
bromide for QPS use.”  Id. at 23.  The report then states:   
 
>  If critical-use methyl bromide exemptions continue indefinitely at the 2006 level 
compared to a cessation of these exemptions in 2010 or 2015, midlatitude 
                                                 
1 The Scientific Assessment uses the metric of “equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine.”  This is a means of 
putting chlorinated and brominated compounds on a comparable scale. 
integrated equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine would increase by 4.7% or 
4.0%, respectively. 
 
>  If production of methyl bromide for QPS use were to continue at present levels 
and cease in 2015, midlatitude integrated equivalent effective stratospheric 
chlorine would decrease by 3.2% compared with the case of continued production 
at present levels. 
 
Id.  These paragraphs indicate that if QPS use continued indefinitely at its present rate, as 
compared with a phase-out by 2010 or 2015, something like a 4 to 4.7% increase in the 
atmospheric loading of ozone-destroying chemicals

 decrease by 3.2% compared with the case of continued production 
at present levels. 
 
Id.  These paragraphs indicate that if QPS use continued indefinitely at its present rate, as 
compared with a phase-out by 2010 or 2015, something like a 4 to 4.7% increase in the 
atmospheric loading of ozone-destroying chemicals will result.  Conversely, a substantial 
reduction in atmospheric loading would result if QPS use of methyl bromide could be ended by 
2015. 
 
The increase in the atmospheric loading of ozone-destroying chemicals will be worse 
than the Scientific Assessment anticipated because QPS use of methyl bromide is increasing in 
response to ISPM15.  As discussed below, there has already been a 31% increase in 2005 and a 
greater increase is expected in 2006, 2007, and subsequent years (see below).   
 
 C. Increasing QPS Methyl Bromide Production Driven by ISPM15 
 
The draft supplemental EIS makes no reference to the United Nations Environment 
Program, “2006 Report of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee:  2006 
Assessment,” available at  http://ozone.unep.org/Assessment_Panels/TEAP/Reports/ 
MBTOC/MBTOC-2006-Assessment%20Report.pdf.  The Methyl Bromide Technical Options 
Committee (MBTOC) is the technical body that reports to the Parties to the Montreal Protocol).   
 
The MBTOC Report presents data that global production of methyl bromide for 
quarantine and preshipment (QPS) purposes jumped sharply in 2005 because of ISPM15, and 
that further ISPM15-driven increases are expected in 2006 and 2007.

The MBTOC Report presents data that global production of methyl bromide for 
quarantine and preshipment (QPS) purposes jumped sharply in 2005 because of ISPM15, and 
that further ISPM15-driven increases are expected in 2006 and 2007.  In 2005, reported methyl 
bromide production for QPS was 13,815 metric tons, 37 percent of total reported global methyl 
bromide production.  Id. at 57.  MBTOC reports further that 2005 QPS production was 31 
percent higher than the 1999-2004 average.  Figure 3.16, id. at 58. 
 
 
 
 
The Report states:   
 
The use of MB for QPS has recently increased in a number of countries as a result of 
ISPM 15 ‘Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International 
Trade’ (IPPC, 2002) which came into force in various countries over the period 2004 
- 2006 (DAFF, 2007).  A further increase can be expected in QPS production for 
2006/7 with further implementation of ISPM 15 using methyl bromide. 
 
Id. at 58.  
 
The MBTOC report notes that a revised methyl bromide dosage schedule was adopted for 
ISPM15 in 2006.  Compared with the 2002 version of ISPM15, this did not change the initial 
methyl bromide concentrations needed, but raised both the exposure period and the retention of 
gas needed at the end of the fumigation, from 30% at 16 hours to 50% at 24 hours.  Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that some fumigators are increasing the initial charge of methyl b

 2002 version of ISPM15, this did not change the initial 
methyl bromide concentrations needed, but raised both the exposure period and the retention of 
gas needed at the end of the fumigation, from 30% at 16 hours to 50% at 24 hours.  Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that some fumigators are increasing the initial charge of methyl bromide to 
compensate for leakage in order to meet the final concentration requirement, thus avoiding the 
need to retreat or top up concentrations during the fumigation.  Such practices were not required 
in 2005.  Id. at 291.  
 
The MBTOC also reports that independent evidence suggested the proportion of QPS 
fumigation on logs and wooden items may have been underrepresented.  Id. at 287.   
 
There is some evidence that methyl bromide usage is being driven even higher than one 
might have anticipated due to import country phytosanitary authorities being uncertain whether 
packing material was properly treated at the point of export.  At the most recent meeting of the 
Open Ended Working Group under the Montreal Protocol in Nairobi in June 2007, Australia 
reported that its phyotosanitary authority has been fumigating incoming shipments from Asian 
countries because they were uncertain whether the shipments were properly treated at the export 
end.2   While Australia said it is working to eliminate this double-treatment, APHIS has not 
accounted for the prevalence of the practice in this country or elsewhere.   
 
Similarly, many pallet users have decided to switch to all export compliant packaging 
because they don’t want to risk having a shipment stopped at a border or do not know where a 
load is headed when it is palletized.  Instead of keeping two inventories of

Similarly, many pallet users have decided to switch to all export compliant packaging 
because they don’t want to risk having a shipment stopped at a border or do not know where a 
load is headed when it is palletized.  Instead of keeping two inventories of pallets, many users 
have decided to treat everything.  This is especially true for companies with a significant amount 
of international shipments or fairly expensive products under load.  See Chaille Brindley, Major 
World Powers Move To Implement ISPM-15,  5/2/2005, available at 
http://www.palletenterprise.com/articledatabase/view.asp?articleID=1372 
 
Further, a 2004 IPPC report states:  “Exporting countries have tended to implement 
ISPM-15 in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the importing country for 
consignments containing SWPM. This implementation has stimulated the use of MB for QPS.

Alternatives to Methyl Bromide - Lisbon, Portugal, 27-30 September 2004, available at 
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/conference/lisboa/proceedings.pdf. 
  
Returning to the overall trend, if the same 31 percent annual rate of increase in methyl 
bromide usage driven by ISPM15 is maintained in 2006 and 2007, then QPS production could 
top 20,000 metric tons by the end of 2007, nearly double the 1999-2004 average.  This is a very 
different picture from the false assurances presented in the draft supplemental EIS.  It would be a 
very serious step backwards in ozone layer protection.   
 
As a result of the strong growth in QPS usage driven by ISPM15, APHIS has no rational 
support for its assertion that QPS methyl bromide related to APHIS’s rule represents less than a 
tenth of a percent “effect” (presumably APHIS means increased atmospheric concentration of 
ozone-depleting chemicals).   
 
APHIS offers the soothing assertion that the increase in QPS use of methyl bromide is in 
some way offset by the reductions in other methyl bromide usage accomplished under the 
Montreal Protocol.  That supposed offset effect is not soothing to the Montreal Protocol Parties.  
Rather, the

APHIS offers the soothing assertion that the increase in QPS use of methyl bromide is in 
some way offset by the reductions in other methyl bromide usage accomplished under the 
Montreal Protocol.  That supposed offset effect is not soothing to the Montreal Protocol Parties.  
Rather, the sharp rate of increase in methyl bromide use driven by ISPM15 has led the Parties to 
take steps to begin bringing QPS use under control.  The Montreal Protocol and the International 
Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) have begun coordination through their respective 
secretariats to get better data on ISPM15-driven usage of methyl bromide.  The Montreal Parties 
have adopted Decisions (a) requiring countries to report QPS production and use, (b) 
encouraging the use of heat treatment and alternative packing materials, and (c) encouraging the 
IPPC and domestic authorities to approve additional treatment methods.   
 
Further, some Montreal Protocol Parties have made formal proposals to amend the 
Protocol to end the total exemption for QPS and institute requirements to cap and reduce QPS 
production and use.  If APHIS allows QPS growth related to U.S. imports to continue growing, it 
is likely that the Meeting of the Parties will adopt such amendments in 2008.  In short, by 
carelessly promoting uncontrolled growth of methyl bromide production and use for ISPM15 
purposes, APHIS is courting the establishment of international regulatory limits on all QPS use.

 D. Inconsistent and Missing Data on QPS Production and Use 
 
We have already commented that APHIS’s data from which its estimates are derived are 
far from complete and riddled with omissions that preclude assessment of the completeness and 
accuracy of the QPS usage driven by APHIS’s rule.  Here is further evidence on this point.   
 
In 2006, an Expert Working Group on Alternatives to Methyl Bromide, operating under 
the IPPC, reported: 
 
Collection and reporting of QPS usage data 
The EWG noted that QPS usage data reported to the Parties to the Montreal 
Protocol through the Ozone Officer do not necessarily reflect an accurate picture 
of worldwide QPS usage of methyl bromide.  Collection methods are different in 
each country, difficult to do in many, not done in others, and poor at best when 
conducted.  Much of the usage is based on estimates only.  There is no 
standardized method or procedure that provides for accurate reporting of methyl 
bromide use under the QPS exemption.  The EWG discussed whether it should 
develop guidelines on how to collect and report accurate and detailed usage data.

 In light of this and prior comments on inconsistent and missing data, APHIS has no 
apparent rational basis for the assumptions underlying key elements of the equations set forth in 
Appendix D.  Appendix D, of course, is the underpinning of the estimates of methyl bromide 
usage presented in Tables 3-1 and 3-2 in the body of the draft.  Here are a number of specific 
comments regarding “Method 1” and “Method 2” – which dominate APHIS’s total estimates – 
as set forth in Appendix D: 
 
• At page D-4, “Method I” is described as applying to “Treatment of Assembled WPM 
in Tarped Containers After Loading of Cargo.”  It further states:  “Example of 
Method I – countries lacking information about fumigation of WPM where 
fumigation is assessed to occur after loading for 50% of the WPM that is fumigated.” 
These sentences are very confusing.  For which countries has APHIS used “Method 
I”?   Why has APHIS assumed that only 50% of the wood packing material from 
these countries is treated in tarped containers after loading? 
   
• Similar concerns arise with “Method 2,�

umigated.” 
These sentences are very confusing.  For which countries has APHIS used “Method 
I”?   Why has APHIS assumed that only 50% of the wood packing material from 
these countries is treated in tarped containers after loading? 
   
• Similar concerns arise with “Method 2,” described as applying to “Treatment of 
Assembled WPM in Sealed Containers After Loading of Cargo.”  This Method 
apparently was used for China.  It is unclear why APHIS has assumed, in “Example 
of Method 2,” that only 50% percent of the wood packing is fumigated.  
 
• What is the basis for APHIS’s assumption that for imports emanating from Hong 
Kong – a part of China – all WPM is treated in sealed containers before assembly and 
cargo loading? 
 
Without answers to these questions, and appropriate changes to APHIS’s calculations, Appendix 
D does not present a rational basis for the methyl bromide usage estimates presented in the body 
of the draft supplemental EIS. 
 
  E. Availability of ozone safe treatment methods 
 
APHIS has considered the option of requiring non-methyl bromide QPS treatment 
alternatives and phasing out methyl bromide.  Most countries that responded to a survey under 
the Montreal Protocol reported that methyl bromide alternatives were commercially available in 
their countries.  The totals presented in the report suggest that 65% of the MB currently used for 
QPS purposes could be replaced by technologies that are commercially available in the 
responding countries.  Developing country (Article 5) Parties estimated that 73% of QPS MB 
use could be

 The 2006 MBTOC assessment reports that:  “On a global basis, there are technically 
effective and approved treatments available for more than half current QPS treatments by 
volume of methyl bromide consumed.”  MBTOC 2006, at 290.   
 
APHIS could drastically reduce or eliminate use of methyl bromide related to imports 
into this country by revising its domestic regulations to require the use of heat treatment in all 
circumstances, or at least in without a demonstration that heat treatment is infeasible in the 
exporting country.  Heat treatment is, of course, an approved treatment method under ISPM15.  
APHIS could require in its own rules the use of this ozone-safe alternative. 
 
The IPPC’s Environmental Working Group reports that major reductions in methyl 
bromide emissions can be achieved by capturing and destroying chemical vented during 
treatment.  The IPPC EWG states that recapture and recovery technologies could be quickly 
implemented and faster than getting new chemicals registered, the compliance with such 
technologies is minimal.  The EWG states, however, that: 
 
Recycle and recapture technology for methyl bromide use is not likely to be 
implemented voluntarily until there are economic incentives available that will 
foster implementation. . . . .Since there is no limit on the amount of methyl 
bromide that may be used for quarantine purposes, there are no provisions or 
allowances for credits for having utilized recapture technology base on the 
amount of methyl bromide emissions eliminated (recaptured).

The 2006 MBTOC Assessment states that:  “In the absence of regulations, companies 
reported they would not invest in the systems, because their competitors (who had not made the 
investment) would then have a cost advantage.” (2006 MBTOC Assessment Report, at.17.)  
APHIS could support making recovery and destruction a requirement under ISPM15.  
 
In addition, APHIS could aggressively seek to amend ISPM15 to approve the use of other 
pesticides.   The 2007 Progress Report of the Technological and Economic Assessment Panel 
reports:   
 
In Japan, sulfuryl fluoride (SF) plus methyl isothioscyanate (MITC) and methyl iodide 
(MI) have been registered for the treatment of timber and packaging materials for 
products intended for import to Japan.  The Japanese government submitted these 
treatments for consideration for inclusion in ISPM 15 (IPPC 2006) standard for 
quarantine treatments of wooden packaging materials.

as alternatives to methyl bromide and heat treatment.

ISPM15 itself notes a range of alternatives that could be further evaluated and approved 
as alternatives to methyl bromide and heat treatment.   
 
As a dominant party in the IPPC, APHIS has a responsibility to undertake the necessary 
testing and to move the process quickly so that these treatments can be approved if the data 
warrants.  Yet the draft supplemental EIS reveals no effort to explore and approve these 
alternatives that would obviate the need for methyl bromide. 
 
F. APHIS’s continued failure to confront evidence of compromised effectiveness – 
pest survival after proper treatment, and the prevalence of fraudulent certification 
 
While APHIS rarely defines what it means by “negligible risk” of failed treatment, that 
term has been defined in two cases that apply to wood.  “In the supplemental impact statement 
covering wood imports from New Zealand and Chile (USDA APHIS 1998a) and in the 
environmental assessment prepared for the emergency regulation pertaining to wood packaging 
from China (USDA APHIS 1998b), APHIS accepted a risk level of 3 to 5 percent.”  According 
to a paper presented at a USDA-sponsored research forum, “when a 3 to 5 percent risk is applied 
to the large volume of imports making up the three forest pest pathways, it translates to the 
probable arrival on our shores of hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of quarantine pests.”

Australia has exhibited a high level of concern about treatment failures.  Recent 
interception data collected by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has 
shown that timber pests continue to be detected in association with wood packaging material that 
purports to be ISPM15 compliant.  
During the 6793 surveillance inspections of wood packaging material displaying 
the ISPM 15 stamp (January 1 to November 30, 2005), 19522 crates, dunnage or 
pallets (pieces) were observed. “Of the 19522 pieces, 1823 or 9.34 % were found 
to be non-compliant with the ISPM 15 standard and 1749 or 8.96 % exhibited 
something of quarantine concern. Of this 8.96 % of ISPM 15 wood packaging for 
which quarantine concerns were identified, 86.4 % had bark, 5.7 % had fungi and 
mould, and 5.9 % had evidence of live insects. On the basis of total units of wood 
packaging material inspected, approximately 1 in 200 units had

something of quarantine concern. Of this 8.96 % of ISPM 15 wood packaging for 
which quarantine concerns were identified, 86.4 % had bark, 5.7 % had fungi and 
mould, and 5.9 % had evidence of live insects. On the basis of total units of wood 
packaging material inspected, approximately 1 in 200 units had live wood boring 
insects and 80 % of these insect detections were on wood packaging with bark. 
These figures are equivalent to Less than Container Load (LCL) survey data 
collected from 1997 to 1999 (Salvage 1999), except that the proportion of items 
with bark present has increased for ISPM 15 wood packaging material.”

Packaging Material to be Bark Free, at 16 available at 
http://www.daff.gov.au/_data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12361/2006-13a.pdf. 
At present under ISPM 15, there is no accep table way to confirm that a certified 
treatement has been appropriately performed (Burgess, 2005).   
*  *  * 
Wood packaging material is difficult to monitor during quarantine inspection 
procedures. Even when high-risk packing is identified in a shipment, the inspection 
process is complicated by limited access to visible surfaces (most surfaces are not 
facing the inspector or the cargo is buried deep in a container) and the cryptic nature 
of many wood-inhabiting organisms. Late nt fungal infections are virtually 
impossible to detect through inspection of outer wood surfaces. (Allen 2001b.)

facing the inspector or the cargo is buried deep in a container) and the cryptic nature 
of many wood-inhabiting organisms. Late nt fungal infections are virtually 
impossible to detect through inspection of outer wood surfaces. (Allen 2001b.)  
Biosecurity Australia, 2006 at 17-18.  The Report continues at 20, 28, 41, and 98: 
 
USDA has released a final environmental impact statement on the importation of 
solid wood packing material that supports the adoption of the IPPC (2002) 
standard, although the document indicates some level of concern over the 
effectiveness of both the methyl bromide treatment and heat treatment (e.g. 
USDA 2003, pp 24, 51, 60 and 61).  
Reviews by Morrell (1995) and Viljoen and Banks (2002) demonstrate that 
moisture content and bark on wood following harvesting are related and impact 
upon methyl bromide uptake. There are also considerable differences between 
methyl bromide fumigation penetration in hardwood and softwood timbers (Ren 
et al. 1997, in Viljoen and Banks 2002). These differences, as well as the 
differences in gas penetration in green and dry timber, are not addressed by ISPM 
15, which treats all wood as similar and makes no allowance for operational 
effects.  
Pests that attack seasoned wood are more likely to enter the pathway after the 
ISPM 15 treatment and may continue to do so during the service life of the 
product. The presence of bark is not regarded as a significant contributing factor 
in attack by and survival of most invertebrate pests of seasoned wood, except in 
circumstances where the bark may offer additional protection for any life stages

 likely to enter the pathway after the 
ISPM 15 treatment and may continue to do so during the service life of the 
product. The presence of bark is not regarded as a significant contributing factor 
in attack by and survival of most invertebrate pests of seasoned wood, except in 
circumstances where the bark may offer additional protection for any life stages 
of these pests. The assessment also notes that there is no direction provided under 
ISPM 15 concerning storage and use of treated material. 
 In 2001, Australia reported that 22 % of inspected wood consignments coming 
from the USA and Canada had residual bark, and in 50 % of these live insects or 
nematodes were found in wood that retains some or all of its bark (especially if 
there are compliance issues relating to the ISPM 15 treatments.) “Preliminary data 
from AQIS’ current survey (AQIS unpublished data) demonstrates no overall 
improvement in interception rates of invertebrates as a result of the 
implementation of ISPM 15.”  
 
APHIS has not conducted any similar analysis.   
 
Nor has APHIS assessed the rate of treatment fraud – where wood packing material is 
stamped as having been treated with heat or methyl bromide, but in fact was treated with neither 
method.  Fraudulently certified wood packing material carries the full pest risk of untreated 
material.  If even a small percentage of shipments are fraudulently certified, the real failure rate 
is much higher than even the 3 to 5 percent risk referred to above.   
 
As noted above, the District Court opinion did not address the issue that plaintiffs raised 
regarding the failure to assess the risk of fraudulent certification.  This is a matter that will be 
taken up on appeal

As noted above, the District Court opinion did not address the issue that plaintiffs raised 
regarding the failure to assess the risk of fraudulent certification.  This is a matter that will be 
taken up on appeal.  Without waiting to be ordered to do so, however, APHIS should 
acknowledge and remediate this gross failure in its EIA and the analysis supporting its rule.   
G. Conclusion 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments.  We urge APHIS to fully re-
evaluate all of its prior decisions in all respects.

South America; watermelon, squash, 
cucumber, oriental melon, and grapes 
from the Republic of Korea. 
Before entering the United States, all 
of these fruits and vegetables are subject 
to inspection and disinfection at their 
port of first arrival to ensure that no 
plant pests are inadvertently brought 
into the United States. These 
precautions, along with other 
requirements, help ensure that these 
commodities do not introduce exotic 
plant pests, such as fruit flies, into the 
United States. 
The regulations require the use of 
certain information collection activities, 
including import permits, phytosanitary 
certificates, fruit fly monitoring records, 
and box labeling. 
We are asking the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) to 
approve our use of these information

The purpose of this notice is to solicit 
comments from the public (as well as 
affected agencies) concerning our 
information collection. These comments 
will help us: 
(1) Evaluate whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
Agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(2) Evaluate the accuracy of our 
estimate of the burden of the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) intends to prepare a 
supplemental environmental impact 
statement (SEIS) for the Importation of 
Solid Wood Packing Material Final 
Environmental Impact Statement, 
August 2003 (FEIS). The purpose of the 
SEIS is to reevaluate and refine the 
estimates of methyl bromide usage 
associated with the alternatives 
considered in the FEIS.

considered in the FEIS. 
APHIS published in the Federal 
Register on September 16, 2004 (69 FR 
55719–55733, Docket No. 02–032–3), a 
final rule amending the regulations for 
the importation of unmanufactured 
wood articles to adopt an international 
standard entitled ‘‘Guidelines for 
Regulating Wood Packaging Material in 
International Trade.’’ The FEIS was 
prepared with regard to that final rule 
in compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.), and its implementing regulations. 
APHIS will base the SEIS on recently 
obtained, reliable data regarding how 
various countries have complied with 
the final rule and with the International 
Plant Protection Convention Guidelines 
(IPPC Guidelines) on which the final 
rule was based. These data include 
reports from different countries on 
whether cargo is routinely fumigated 
along with wood packaging material 
(WPM), which would result in more 
methyl bromide usage, or whether WPM 
is fumigated separately from cargo, 
which would result in less methyl 
bromide usage. We also have new data 
on the extent to which various countries 
have chosen to comply with the IPPC 
Guidelines by heat treating WPM rather 
than fumigating it. 
The SEIS will be prepared in 
accordance with: (1) NEPA, (2) 
regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality for

or the dissemination of plant pests within the
United States.
7 U.S.C. § 7112(a).
On September 16, 2004, the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (“APHIS”) of the United States Department of
Agriculture  amended, effective September 16, 2005, the regulations1
for the importation into the United States of unmanufactured wood
articles used as packaging for cargo.  69 Fed. Reg. 55719-55733
(Sept. 16, 2004) (codified in 7 CFR, Pt. 319, § 319.40 (2006)).2
In explaining the amended regulations, APHIS noted that
“[i]ntroductions into the United States of exotic plant pests such
as the pineshoot beetle . . . and the Asian longhorned beetle . . .
have been linked to the importation of [what the previous
regulations called ‘solid wood packing material’ or ‘SWPM’],” and
that “[t]hese and other plant pests that are carried by some
imported SWPM pose a serious threat to U.S. agriculture and to
natural, cultivated and urban forests.”  69 Fed. Reg. 5

regulations called ‘solid wood packing material’ or ‘SWPM’],” and
that “[t]hese and other plant pests that are carried by some
imported SWPM pose a serious threat to U.S. agriculture and to
natural, cultivated and urban forests.”  69 Fed. Reg. 55719.  The
amended “regulations restrict the importation of many types of wood
articles, including wooden packaging material such as pallets,
crates, boxes, and pieces of wood used to support or brace cargo.”
Id.  The standard embodied in the amended regulations “calls for

wood packaging material to be either heat treated or fumigated with
methyl bromide, in accordance with the [Guidelines for Regulating
Wood Packaging Material in International Trade, approved by the
Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the International
Plant Protection Convention on March 15, 2002], and marked with an
approved in ternational mark certifying treatment.”  Id.  The
regulations “will affect all persons using wood packaging material
in connection with importing goods into the United States.”  Id.
APHIS also noted that “Methyl bromide as a class I ozone-
depleting substance has been found to cause or contribute
significantly to harmful effects on the stratospheric ozone
layer. . . .”  69 Fed. Reg. 55721.

 also noted that “Methyl bromide as a class I ozone-
depleting substance has been found to cause or contribute
significantly to harmful effects on the stratospheric ozone
layer. . . .”  69 Fed. Reg. 55721.
Plaintiffs  -- the Natural Resources Defense Council,3
Inc., and the states of New York, California, Connecticut and
Illinois -- do not challenge specifics of the amended regulations,
but, rather, in essence, the failure of APHIS to properly consider
and weigh an unadopted alternative to heat treatment or fumigation
with methyl bromide:  “a phased transition away from raw wood
pallets and crates, replacing them with packing materials made of
substitute materials, such as processed wood, fiberboard, plywood,
and plastics, that are impervious to the insect pests.” (Pl. Mem.
at 1.)  That alternative, they urge, would at the same time afford
the greatest protection against insect pests and also minimize the

APHIS to reconsider its environmental impact analysis in light of

APHIS, plaintiffs contend, has violated both the National
Environmental Protection Act (“NEPA”) and the PPA in failing to
consider the alternative they advocate.
Plaintiffs, jointly, move for summary judgment pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, while defendants cross-move for dismissal
pursuant to id. 12(b)(6) or, alternatively, summary judgment
pursuant to id. 56.  Whatever the form of the motions, in a case
seeking review of agency action:
“[T]he focal point for judicial review should be
the administrative record already in existence, not
some new recordmade initially in the reviewing
court.”  The task of the reviewing court is to
apply the appropriate [Administrative Procedure Act
(“APA”)] standard of review, 5 U.S.C. § 706, to the
agency decision based on the record the agency
presents to the reviewing court.

The parties are in agreement that this Court’s review of
the challenged action is governed by the APA.  (Pl. Mem. at 23;
Def. Mem. at 26.)
It is settled law that under the APA a reviewing
court may set aside an agency’s decision only if it
is found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with
law.”  A court may not substitute its judgment for
that of the agency, and, when a pa rticular
controversy requires an agency’s reconciliation of
conflicting and overlapping congressional policies,
a court “should hesitate to disturb the
administrative determination.”
A successful challenge to an agency’s decision
under the arbitrary and capricious standard must
clearly demonstrate that the agency “relied on
factors which Congress has not intended it to
consider, entirely failed to consider an important
aspect of the problem [or] offered an explanation
for its decision that runs counter to the evidence
before the agency, or is so implausible that it
could not be ascribed to a difference in view or
the product of agency expertise.”  A reviewing
court may neither weigh alternatives available to
the agency and then determine which is the more
reasonable, nor resolve conflicts in the testimony

The parties, in substance, agree that both the
introduction into the United States of destructive insect pests
such as the Asian longhorned beetle and the release into the air of
methyl bromide are seriously negative environmental events.
Plaintiffs urge that the best way to deal with both is the option
that would phase in a requirement that substitute or alternative
packing materials replace the wood materials the new rule as
promulgated will only regulate.
However, plaintiffs contend, even though APHIS
acknowledged the reasonableness of the option that plaintiffs
advocate  and indicated in its Advance notice of rulemaking that5
that option was to be considered (64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051 (Jan. 20,
1999)), and received substantial commentary on, and favoring, that
option, it nevertheless did not really consider the option, and so
failed to comply with NEPA’s mandate that an agency “[r]igorously
explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.”  40
CFR § 1502.14(a).  See also Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v.

 Plaintiffs vigorously dispute APHIS’ estimate of the worldwide6
increase in methyl bromide usage that implementation of the rule will
entail, 384 to 4630 metric tons per year. (Def. Mem. at 25.) (See FEIS,
AR II.1, at 66-67.) At the close of the initial briefing of the parties’
motions, defendants advised the Court that one of the assumptions
underlying APHIS’ estimates was flawed: i.e., the assumption “that all
[methyl bromide] fumigation would occur ‘pre-loading,’ rather than ‘post-
loading.’” (Def. Mem. at 45.) “APHIS now concedes that the
justification for the [methyl bromide] estimate in the [FEIS] was flawed;
the agency erred in asserting that shippers in China eventually began to
fumigate all [wood packing material] prior to loading.”  (Letter,
A.U.S.A. Turner to Court, June 21, 2006, at 3.)  “Fumigating ‘post-

man” option, plaintiffs add, is not supported by the record.  (Id.
at 28-34.)
Plaintiffs also argue that the Final Environmental Impact
Statement (“FEIS”) and the new rule reflect “a highly skewed
analysis of the environmental impacts of meth yl bromide
fumigation.”  (Id. at 34.)  The estimates of the FEIS on which
APHIS acted, plaintiffs urge, are severely flawed, unsupported by
the record, and affected by inadequate conclusory assumptions.
(Id. at 34-40.)6
Plaintiffs argue, in addition, that APHIS has violated
the Plant Protection Act (“PPA”), emphasizing that the Act gives
the Secretary (and thus, by delegation, APHIS (see n.1, supra)),
authority “to prevent the introduction of plant pests into the
United States,” 7 U.S.C. § 7711(a) (emphasis added by plaintiffs),
and states that it is the Secretary’s responsibility to facilitate

commerce “in ways that will reduce, to the extent practible, as
determined by the Secretary, the risk of dissemination of plant
pests. . . .”  Id. § 7701(3) (emphasis added by plaintiffs).  The
PPA, plaintiffs argue, “requires APHIS to adopt the most effective
practicable alternative.  The statute does not authorize the agency
to set an arbitrary level of ‘acceptable’ pest risk, or ‘necessary’
pest protection, such that APHIS may reject more effective
alternative methods that are practicable.”  (Pl. Mem. at 41.)  In
the present situation, plaintiffs conclude, “APHIS itself
identifies an alternative that eliminates the risk [i.e., the
phase-in of substitute packing material as advocated by plaintiffs,
and] APHIS must fully and fairly evaluate that alternative to
determine if it is practicable, and if so, adopt it.”  (Id. at 42.)

International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures: Guidelines for
Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade.  (“IPPC
Guidelines.”)  (AR III.39.)  APHIS followed, in substance, those
Guidelines.

The Court considers first plaintiffs’ argument that
APHIS, in adopting the new rule, violated the PPA.  The argument is
not persuasive.
Plaintiffs’ position, in essence, is that the PPA, in 7
U.S.C. §§ 7712(a) and 7701(3), requires APHIS to adopt the rule
that will most effectively reduce pest risk, and that that is the
end of the question.  (See Pl. Mem. at 40-42; Pl. Responsive Mem.
at 16-18; Section 3 of this Memorandum and Order, supra.)  That
view is both too narrow and not supported by the language of the
PPA.

at 16-18; Section 3 of this Memorandum and Order, supra.)  That
view is both too narrow and not supported by the language of the
PPA.
In the first place, the Supreme Court has pointed out
that its decision in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp v. Natural
Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 558 (1978), “cuts sharply
against the . . . conclusion that an agency, in selecting a course
of action, must elevate environmental concerns over other
appropriate considerations.”  Strycker’s Bay Neighborhood Council,
Inc. v. Karlen, 444 U.S. 223, 227 (1980) (per curiam).
In the second place, the PPA mandates the consideration
of factors other than the environment.
7 U.S.C § 7701(3), on which plaintiffs explicitly rely,
states that “it is the responsibility of the Secretary to
facilitate exports, imports, and interstate commerce in

agricultural products and other commodities that pose a risk of
harboring plant pests or noxious weeds,” id., but goes on to add
that the Secretary is to do so “in ways that will reduce, to the
extent practicable, as determined by the Secretary, the risk of
dissemination of plan pests or noxious weeds.”  Id.  It is clear,
therefore, that in adopting the rule, the Secretary,

 noxious weeds,” id., but goes on to add
that the Secretary is to do so “in ways that will reduce, to the
extent practicable, as determined by the Secretary, the risk of
dissemination of plan pests or noxious weeds.”  Id.  It is clear,
therefore, that in adopting the rule, the Secretary, acting through
APHIS, in addition to reducing the risk of plant pests, is obliged
as well to consider the facilitation of commerce.  What is more,
the use of the phrase “to the extent practicable, as determined by
the Secretary,” id., makes it clear that, in considering the rule
and the alternatives, the Secretary, acting through APHIS, is given
room for “the application of agency expertise and discretion.”  See
Conservation Law Foundation v. Evans, 360 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.
2004).  Facilitation of commerce certainly entered into the
decision to adopt the new rule.  See 69 Fed. Reg. 55721
(“Alternative packing materials [involve] a cost that is currently
beyond the reach of exporters in many developing countries. . . .”)
and id. 55722 (“. . . prohibiting the use of unmanufactured wood as
a packaging material would have significant negative consequences
in economic and environmental arenas.  Wood is often the only
packaging material readily and cheaply available . . . in
developing countries that export basic products without elaborate
packaging.”)

 For a full description of the international background to APHIS’9
use of the IPPC Guidelines, see Def. Mem. at 3-6.
  Plaintiffs argue that APHIS need not have followed the IPPC
Guidelines in order to be consistent with international agreements
because the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (“SPS Agreement”) (AR VI.8), which,
among other things, seeks to protect trade by eliminating trade
protectionist actions, “allow[s] members to impose higher levels of
[phytosanitary] protection than required by international standards if
a member concludes (based on scientific and economic factors recognized
as valid under the Agreement) that the international standards do not
provide adequate protection.” (Def. Mem. at 5 (summarizing SPS
Agreement, Art. 3, cl. 1 [AR VI.8 at 2].)  However, the SPS Agreement
also “provides a safe harbor for measures that do conform to
international standards.” (Id. (summarizing SPS Agreement, Art. 3, cl.
2 [AR VI.8 at 2].) The “safe harbor” obtained by following the IPPC
Guidelines is certainly of value in facilitating trade by avoiding trade
disputes (see Def. Reply Mem. at 14-15), and the choice to follow the
IPPC Guidelines was well within the Secretary’s discretion.

Guidelines is certainly of value in facilitating trade by avoiding trade
disputes (see Def. Reply Mem. at 14-15), and the choice to follow the
IPPC Guidelines was well within the Secretary’s discretion.
12
Finally, the PPA requires the Secretary (“[t]he Secretary
shall. . . .”) to ensure that phytosanitary issues involving
imports and exports are . . . consistent with applicable
international agreements.”  7 U.S.C. § 7751(e).  As described
above, the new regulations are based on the IPPC Guidelines and are
fully consistent with applicable international agreements.9
In short, the PPA, as applied to the present dispute,
vests the Secretary with the duty of crafting a rule that will
reduce the risk of plant pests consistently with applicable
international agreements and at the same time facilitate
international commerce, and discretion to weigh the facts and
issues in so doing.  The record is clear that the Secretary, acting
through APHIS, did so in the present case.
Plaintiffs have not shown that the adoption by APHIS of
the new rule violated the PPA.

5.
The purpose and basic requirements of NEPA were
classically summed up in Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of
Engineers, 701 F.2d 1011 (2d Cir. 1983):
As the Supreme Court has stated repeatedly,
although NEPA established “‘significant substantive
goals for the Nation,’” the balancing of the
substantive environmental issues is consigned to
the judgment of the executive agencies involved,
and the judicially reviewable duties that are
imposed on the agencies are “‘essentially
procedural.’”  “The only role for a court is to
insure that the agency has taken a ‘hard look’ at
environmental consequences; it cannot ‘interject
itself within the area of discretion of the
executive as to the choice of the act ion to be
taken.’”
The primary function of an environmental impact
statement under NEPA is “‘to insure a fully
informed and well-considered decision,’ [although]
not necessarily ‘a decision the judges of the Court
of Appeals or of [the Supreme] Court would have
reached had they been members of the decisionmaking
unit of the agency.’”  In order to fulfill its
role, the [Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”)]
must set forth sufficient information for the
general public to make an informed evaluation, and
for the decisionmaker to “consider fully the
environmental factors involved and to make a
reasoned decision after balancing the risks of harm
to the environment against the benefits to be
derived from the proposed action.”  In so doing,

for the decisionmaker to “consider fully the

to the environment against the benefits to be
derived from the proposed action.”  In so doing,
the EIS insures the integrity of the process of
decision by giving assurance that stubborn problems
or serious criticisms have not been “swept under
the rug.”  The “‘detailed statement’” required by
§ 102(2)(C) of NEPA [, 42 U.S.C. § 4 332(2)(C),]
thus “is the outward sign that environmental values

Here, in the FEIS (AR II.1.), APHIS, noting the “nature
and severity of the risk from the wood packing material
accompanying shipments in international trade,” stated that it
proposed “to adopt the IPPC Guidelines while it considers the need
for a more long-term and permanent solution to the [wood packing
material] problem.”  (FEIS at 3.)  It considered that and four
alternatives:
(1) No Action (no change in the current
regulation), (2) Extension of the Treatments in the
China Interim Rule to All Countries, (3) Adoption
of the IPPC Guidelines, (4) a Comprehensive Risk
Reduction Program, and (5) Substitute Packing
Materials Only.  Each of the alternatives consists
of specific component methods for the mitigation of
risk from [wood packing material].

15
(Id. at 9.)   The possible environmental consequences of the five10
alternatives are reviewed in the FEIS.
The FEIS acknowledges that “the prohibition of SWPM and
the requirement to switch to substitute packing materials would
result in substantially less pest and disease risk than any of the
other components considered in th is [F]EIS.”  Id. at 42.  The
effects of methyl bromide on the ozone layer are considered in
detail.  Id. at 54-57.  And the FEIS further acknow ledges that
“[]he logical response to address the issue of methyl bromide use
relative to ozone depletion potential is to promote the use of
alternate phytosanitary methods (such as substitute packing
materials) to deal with [solid wood packing materials] used in
international trade.”  Id. at 78.  For reasons summarized above,
however, APHIS did not adopt that approach. 
6.
Plaintiffs argue that there are three ways in which APHIS
failed to comply with NEPA.
First, plaintiffs contend that APHIS did not consider the
option of a phase-in of substitute materials, but only the “straw
man” of an immediate replacement of wooden with substitute packing
materials.  The record does not support this argument.

-in of substitute materials, but only the “straw

materials.  The record does not support this argument.
Case 1:05-cv-08008-LMM     Document 16      Filed 06/04/2007     Page 15 of 22
16
In its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in 1999,
APHIS pointed out that one option for dealing with the problems it
wished to address was the prohibition of the usual wood packaging
materials in favor of alternative materials such as processed wood
and nonwood materials.  Noting that such action could have an
undesirable effect on international trade, it added that “[t]his
effect could be mitigated by a phase-in period to allow shippers to
adjust to the prohibition. . . .” 64 Fed. Reg. 3049, 3051.  The
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (“DEIS”) of October 2002 (AR
II.2) discusses the substitute materials option (see DEIS at 12,
36-39, 73-77), and notes that substitute materials “may require a
phase-in period to allow the industry to adopt these materials to
the shipping processes.”  (DEIS at 37; see also id. at 75.)  The
FEIS notes that “[s]ubstitute packing materials would require a
phase-in period to allow the industry of the regulated countries to
adapt these materials to the shipping processes.”  (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 41; see also id. at 81.)
Second, plaintiffs urge that the FEIS “failed to examine
rationally the amount of ozone-destroying methyl bromide that will
be used due to the [new
Text Len: 1469
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 period to allow the industry of the regulated countries to
adapt these materials to the shipping processes.”  (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 41; see also id. at 81.)
Second, plaintiffs urge that the FEIS “failed to examine
rationally the amount of ozone-destroying methyl bromide that will
be used due to the [new] Rule.”  (Pl. Responsive Mem. at 1.)  In
support of this argument, plaintiffs identify two instances in
which APHIS had estimated ranges of amounts of methyl bromide that
would be released as a result of rulemaking that, plaintiffs argue,
Case 1:05-cv-08008-LMM     Document 16      Filed 06/04/2007     Page 16 of 22
17
are not consistent with the range of 384 to 4630 metric tons given
in the FEIS.  (FEIS [AR II.1] at 66-67.) 
The first instance relates to the China Interim Rule.
(See n.9, supra.)  In a September 18, 1998 Interim Rule and Request
for Comments, APHIS stated that it “estimates that, if China were
to comply with the interim rule by fumigating SWPM shipments with
methyl bromide, China could use between 1,040 and 12,565 metric
tons of methyl bromide annually.”  63 Fed. Reg. 50100, 50109.  This
range is referenced in the FEIS in the present case (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 29; 56), and noted to be based on “conservative assumptions.”
(Id.)  The FEIS explains that “[t]he actual [quarantine and
preshipment] usage from the China Interim

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 50100, 50109.  This
range is referenced in the FEIS in the present case (FEIS [AR II.1]
at 29; 56), and noted to be based on “conservative assumptions.”
(Id.)  The FEIS explains that “[t]he actual [quarantine and
preshipment] usage from the China Interim Rule is known to be
considerably less than anticipated from the risk analysis due to
the analysis assumption that loaded cargo with SWPM would be
fumigated rather than fumigation of SWPM prior to cargo loading,”
while “[i]t is known that most shippers fumigate SWPM prior to
cargo loading to lower costs, avoid agricultural commodity
tolerance issues, and to prevent damage to sensitive commodities.”
(Id. at 56.) Defendants now concede that this last statement is
not correct.  (See n.6, supra.)
The second instance cited by plaintiffs is from a Final
Environmental Impact Statement of September 2002, relating to a
Rule for the Importation of Unmanufactured Wood Articles from
Mexico, with Consideration for Cumulative Impact of Methyl Bromide
Case 1:05-cv-08008-LMM     Document 16      Filed 06/04/2007     Page 17 of 22

Use (AR II.35), where it is noted that the rule t here under
consideration (affecting, it appears, trade between the United
States and Mexico only) “could result in potential releases to the
atmosphere ranging from 8,536 [metric tons] to 102,893 [metric
tons] per year based upon information from trade summaries.”  (Id.
at 65.)  While the Mexico Environmental Impact Statement is
referenced in the

 it appears, trade between the United
States and Mexico only) “could result in potential releases to the
atmosphere ranging from 8,536 [metric tons] to 102,893 [metric
tons] per year based upon information from trade summaries.”  (Id.
at 65.)  While the Mexico Environmental Impact Statement is
referenced in the FEIS in the present case (AR II.1 at 57, 90), the
estimated methyl bromide release figures do not appear to be set
forth there. 
Defendant initially argued that the Mexico Rule
Environmental Impact Statement analysis was a “worst-case scenario”
that assumed that all fumigation would occur post-loading “as the
China Interim Rule estimate assumed,” and pointed out that the
Mexico Rule Environmental Impact Statement “concluded that the
‘actual increase in methyl bromide usage would actually be closer
to one-twentieth’ of this ‘worst-case scenario’ amount, equating to
an additional release of 427 to 5,145 [metric tons] per year.”
(Def. Mem. at 45 (citing AR II.35 at 66).)
The Mexico Rule Environmental Impact Statement states
that:  “As was shown with the interim rule for China, SWPM is more
likely to be treated prior to use in loading the commodity, so the
actual increase in methyl bromide usage would actually be closer to
one-twentieth (1/20) of the projected usage in this assessment.”
(AR II.35 at 65-66 (footnote omitted).)

19
Two things appear from the Mexico Rule Environmental
Impact Statement:  first, that the assumption used to support the
low estimate of annual methyl bromide releases attributable to the
Mexico Rule is the same assumption that supports the low estimate
in the case of the China Interim Rule, and is derived from the
China Interim Rule assumption that most fumigation will occur pre-
loading(now conceded to be erroneous); and, second, that the
difference in the amount of methyl bromide releases between post-
loading fumigation and pre-loading fumigation, respectively, is
approximately 20 to 1.
Defendants have already stated a willingness, prompted by
the flawed assumption described in the government’s letter of
June 21, 2006 (see n.6, supra), to produce a supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement which will include a new methyl
bromide release estimate. (Gov’t Supp. Mem. at 1.)  That estimate
must also include consideration of the methyl bromide release
estimate contained in the Mexico Rule Final Environmental Impact
Statement of September 2002 discussed above.
Plaintiff’s third argument in support of its claim that
APHIS violated NEPA is that APHIS committed to the course of action
it finally took before undertaking an Environmental Impact
Statement and that “such predetermined conclusions are invalid as
a matter of law under NEPA.”  (Pl. Responsive Mem. at 2.)  This
argument is not persuasive.

it finally took before undertaking an Environmental Impact
Statement and that “such predetermined conclusions are invalid as
a matter of law under NEPA.”  (Pl. Responsive Mem. at 2.)  This
argument is not persuasive.

It is true that at least as early as the DEIS of October
2002 APHIS was proposing to adopt the IPPC Guidelines (see DEIS [AR
II.2] at iii), which, in the FEIS, APHIS identified as its
“preferred alternative.” (FEIS [AR II.1] at 3.)  There is nothing
wrong,however, with an agency having a proposal or preferred
alternative in mind when it enters into the Environmental Impact
Statement process.  Indeed, NEPA contemplates that it will.  See 42
U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(1) (every recommendation or report on proposals
for major federal actions significantly affecting quality of human
environment to include statement on “proposed” action);  see also
40 CFR § 1502.14 (environmental impact statement to present
environmental impacts of “the proposal and the alternatives”).
For the reasons discussed above in this section of this
Memorandum and Order, the Court finds that APHIS has not violated
NEPA except in the matter of its estimate of the amount of methyl
bromide that will be released into the atmosphere by reason of the
rule at issue.  In that regard, however, APHIS (even though its

Description of Calculations Used in the Supplemental Environmental 
Impact Statement for Estimation of Methyl Bromide Released From 
Fumigation of Wood Packaging Material 
 
The quantitative assessment of methyl bromide usage in the treatment of wood packing material 
(WPM) involves consideration of many factors with variable levels of definition and uncertainty.  
This appendix is prepared to assist the reader in better understanding the basis for the 
calculations and those factors that were considered in the development of the equation used to 
make methyl bromide estimates. 
  
The majority of NPPOs in the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) countries do not 
compile records for usage of methyl bromide specifically for treatment of WPM in compliance 
with International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 (ISPM 15) guidelines.  The 
most recent year with complete data on U.S. Customs entries of imported articles is 2005 and, 
therefore, all calculations use information for 2005 as the basis for quantification of methyl 
bromide associated with ISPM 15 compliance.  Other than the actual pounds of methyl bromide 
provided by the NPPOs for the country of Nicaragua (Hernandez, 2006), determinations of 
methyl bromide quantities in this supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) were 
calculated relative to the number of WPM units treated in 2005.  Data on the actual number of 
WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide in 2005 in

provided by the NPPOs for the country of Nicaragua (Hernandez, 2006), determinations of 
methyl bromide quantities in this supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) were 
calculated relative to the number of WPM units treated in 2005.  Data on the actual number of 
WPM units fumigated with methyl bromide in 2005 in the United States for export purposes in 
2005 have been tracked (Deomano, 2006a); however, the NPPOs of other countries lack data on 
the exact numbers of WPM units fumigated.  As part of the analyses for the China Interim Rule 
Environmental Assessment (EA), a comprehensive review of all U.S. Customs entries was 
conducted to ascertain the number of entries containing WPM.  The combined effort of 
reviewing entries by U.S. Customs and APHIS conservatively estimated that 30 percent of all 
entries were packed with WPM.  Use of this estimated percentage of entries containing WPM 
has been applied to calculations of the number of WPM units in all documentation since the 
China Interim Rule EA.  It was also recognized that individual U.S. Customs entries may pertain 
to a single pallet, a single container, or multiple containers.  In the absence of detailed 
information, the average U.S. Customs entry is viewed to pertain to one cargo container and 
calculations are based upon fumigation of WPM for that unit size.         
 
The general equation used in this SEIS for calculation of the metric tons (MT) of methyl bromide 
released from WPM fumigations in 2005 is as follows: 
 
MT of methyl bromide = (# of U.S. Customs entries with WPM) x
Text Len: 1585
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PM for that unit size.         
 
The general equation used in this SEIS for calculation of the metric tons (MT) of methyl bromide 
released from WPM fumigations in 2005 is as follows: 
 
MT of methyl bromide = (# of U.S. Customs entries with WPM) x (fraction of WPM entries 
fumigated with methyl bromide) x (lbs methyl bromide per entry) x (0.45359237 kg/lb) x 
(1 MT/1,000 kg) x (fraction of total methyl bromide applied that is vented from fumigation 
chamber)

The equation consists of two constants used for converting the weight in pounds to the weight in 
MT and of four variables: 
 
The derivation of the first variable, # of U.S. Customs entries with WPM, was described above.   
 
The second variable, the fraction of WPM entries fumigated with methyl bromide, is based upon 
information provided by the NPPOs of the country/countries being analyzed.   
 
The third variable, pounds of methyl bromide per entry, is dependent upon the manner in which 
the fumigations are conducted.  It is derived partly from information about the conduct of 
fumigations provided by the NPPOs of the country/countries being analyzed 
and from the quantity of methyl bromide required to fumigate WPM in that manner.  The 
mathematical derivation of this variable for different fumigation processes is provided

 fumigations are conducted.  It is derived partly from information about the conduct of 
fumigations provided by the NPPOs of the country/countries being analyzed 
and from the quantity of methyl bromide required to fumigate WPM in that manner.  The 
mathematical derivation of this variable for different fumigation processes is provided in the 
second paragraph that follows.   
 
The fourth variable, fraction of the total methyl bromide applied that is vented from the 
fumigation chamber, relates to the sorption of methyl bromide by WPM.  This sorption of methyl 
bromide precludes its release to the atmosphere and, therefore, poses no risk of damage to the 
ozone layer.  The percentage of methyl bromide vented from fumigations of durable goods, such 
as WPM, was determined to range from 69 to 79 percent of the total methyl bromide applied 
(UNEP, MBTOC, 1998); therefore, the original lower estimates apply a fraction of 0.69, and the 
original higher estimates apply a fraction of 0.79.  This percentage of methyl bromide vented 
from fumigations of durable goods was revised upward in a more recent document (page 69 of 
UNEP, MBTOC, 2007) to range from 76 to 88 percent of total methyl bromide applied, so 
present lower estimates apply a fraction of 0.76 and present higher estimates apply a fraction of 
0.88.   
  
The mathematical derivation of the third variable, pounds of methyl bromide per entry, is 
dependent upon how the fumigation of WPM with methyl bromide is conducted.  Although all 
treatments of WPM are conducted with from
Text Len: 1555
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 fraction of 0.76 and present higher estimates apply a fraction of 
0.88.   
  
The mathematical derivation of the third variable, pounds of methyl bromide per entry, is 
dependent upon how the fumigation of WPM with methyl bromide is conducted.  Although all 
treatments of WPM are conducted with from 3 to 4 pounds of methyl bromide per 1,000 cubic 
feet of space, the relative methyl bromide usage per unit treated may be increased by fumigating 
WPM that is already loaded with other cargo, as occurs at some locations in China, or decreased 
by fumigating the wood pieces prior to assembling the WPM unit, as occurs in Japan.  Most 
shippers neither fumigate the wood pieces prior to assembling WPM units nor load WPM with 
cargo prior to fumigation, but the methyl bromide estimates in this SEIS consider 
comprehensively the manner in which the WPM units are fumigated.   
 
There are five different methods of fumigation of WPM that have been commonly used and are 
considered in this SEIS.  If there is no information available about the manner in which WPM is 
being fumigated in a given country, the fumigation is presumed to occur in tarped containers 
after cargo is already loaded on the WPM.  This provides a conservatively high estimate for 
those countries where data are lacking.  Other methods are applied to countries where reliable 
information about compliance has been received.  The fumigation methods, quantities of methyl 
bromide associated with each method, and a representative example of calculations used in this 
SEIS for each method are as follows:

Other Factors Considered But Not Applied to Refine the Methyl 
Bromide Equation 
 
There are no hard figures for how much WPM is reused worldwide after cargo has been 
unloaded.  We know from life-cycle studies that some WPM can be reused for 8 to10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the loaded cargo (Deomano, 
2006b).  The United States does reuse treated pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are 
collected about how much WPM is reused.  Review of the present rate of reuse in the 
United States indicates that one of every

 8 to10 separate 
shipments before the wood is no longer durable enough to handle the loaded cargo (Deomano, 
2006b).  The United States does reuse treated pallets that meet ISPM 15 criteria and data are 
collected about how much WPM is reused.  Review of the present rate of reuse in the 
United States indicates that one of every two WPM units is recycled and reused for shipping 
another load of cargo (Deomano, 2006b).  Some countries are known to recycle more WPM than 
the United States; however, information about the actual rates of reuse by other countries is not 
readily available.  Accordingly, we did not apply this information to any refinements of the 
methyl bromide release model.  By disregarding this issue in the quantitative analysis, our 
calculated figures overestimate the number of WPM units treated by 50% or more.  The lower 
usage of methyl bromide associated with less frequent need to treat WPM is, therefore, not 
reflected in the present estimates of methyl bromide released or in previous estimates from the 
final environmental impact statement.  As information related to this topic becomes available, 
continuing refinements of the methyl bromide estimates may be made in the future to more 
closely reflect actual usage.   
 
Some commodities are not marketable if fumigated with methyl bromide; some agricultural 
commodities lack a tolerance for bromine residues; some commodities, such as leather, react 
with methyl bromide such that strong odors are imparted to the product; and some commodities, 
such as electronics, may be damaged by reaction with methyl bromide.  Treatment of such 
commodities is precluded from methods, such as methyl bromide fumigation after loading

 for bromine residues; some commodities, such as leather, react 
with methyl bromide such that strong odors are imparted to the product; and some commodities, 
such as electronics, may be damaged by reaction with methyl bromide.  Treatment of such 
commodities is precluded from methods, such as methyl bromide fumigation after loading, due 
to the loss of product.  When the assumption is made that the predominant method of fumigation 
in China occurs to WPM with cargo already loaded, it is known that the calculations from this 
E–6 Appendix E.  Calculations
Appendix E. Calculations  E–7  
assumption will overstate the release of methyl bromide.  This is clearly true for the early 
estimates made for the China interim rule and for the present analysis in this SEIS where this 
assumption was applied to China and other countries lacking information regarding their 
treatment methodology for ISPM 15 compliance.  Although there is no detailed data available to 
support a precise estimate of methyl bromide usage in our model, this approach does ensure that 
underestimation of potential release of methyl bromide from fumigations for China and these 
other countries does not occur in this model.

Methyl Bromide Labels 
Table 1 summarizes the differences between existing methyl bromide (MB) 
labels and MB manufactured after October 1, 2016. For more detailed 
information, refer to the Treatment Manual. 
Table 1  MB Label Comparison 
Existing MB Labels Instructions 2016 MB Labels Instructions 
1. Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) 
required when MB air concentrations are ≥5 ppm. 
No respirator requirements when air concentra-
tions are below 5 ppm. 
SCBA still required when MB air concentrations are ≥5 
ppm; however, when concentrations are between 1 and 
5 ppm, air-purifying respirators with a cartridge certified 
for protection from MB at concentrations up to 5 ppm 
(specifics are described in the label) must be worn (or 
SCBA). 
2. Only SCBA respirator users must be fit tested 
and fit checked. Fit testing for other respirator 
equipment were not discussed because they 
were not required. 
All respirator users must be fit tested, fit checked, and 
examined by a qualified medical practitioner to ensure 
physical ability to safely wear the style of respirator worn. 
3. MB detection devices (Draeger and other colori-
metric tubes) are permitted to have a detection 
limit of 5 ppm. 
MB detection devices must have a detection limit of 0.5 
ppm. CPHST recommends one labeled device for PPQ 
use,

physical ability to safely wear the style of respirator worn. 
3. MB detection devices (Draeger and other colori-
metric tubes) are permitted to have a detection 
limit of 5 ppm. 
MB detection devices must have a detection limit of 0.5 
ppm. CPHST recommends one labeled device for PPQ 
use, the Rae® Systems MiniRae 3000. PPQ Field Opera-
tions Raleigh hub will distribute the devices to each State 
Plant Health Director for further distribution to PPQ field 
offices. 
4. Exposure to MB air concentrations between 1 
ppm and 5 ppm is not required to be monitored. 
Exposure to MB air concentrations must be monitored 
for persons not wearing respirators but working in an 
area where concentrations are between 1 and 5 ppm. 
These workers are subject to Work Time Restrictions of 1 
ppm over an 8 hour work period. The exposure time is 
reduced to 90 minutes when concentrations are between 
3 and 5 ppm. No monitoring required if concentrations 
fall below 1 ppm. 
5. When not wearing respiratory equipment, air con-
centration monitoring is performed as appropriate 
to ensure concentrations do not exceed 5 ppm. 
No respiratory equipment necessary. 
When air concentrations are between 1 and 5 ppm and 
respiratory equipment with cartridges are worn (i.e. not 
SCBA), then monitoring must be performed every hour 
(unless a continuous real-time detection device is 
installed) to ensure that concentrations do not exceed 5 
ppm.

6. The label does not require buffer zones. PPQ 
requires buffer zones of 30 feet during treatment 
and 200 feet during the first 10 minutes of aera-
tion. 
The label requires buffer zones. The contracted fumiga-
tor will determine and communicate to PPQ officers the 
buffer zones for each enclosure based upon EPA’s Buffer 
Zone Table. This table is calculated based on enclosure 
size, dosage, and height of exhaust stack. If the buffer 
zones fall within PPQ’s standard 30/200 ft buffer zone, 
then PPQ officers will continue to use PPQ’s existing buf-
fer zones, bearing in mind the new respirator require-
ments for lower air concentrations. 
7. Aeration for Section 18 Treatments: PPQ must 
ensure that aeration is conducted properly. Aera-
tion period ends when concentrations in the 
exhaust ducts fall to 5 ppm; no minimum aeration 
time is required. 
Aeration for Non-Section 18 Treatments: The 
fumigator is responsible for following aeration 
requirements. 
Aeration for Section 18 Treatments: PPQ must ensure 
that aeration is conducted properly. Aeration period ends 
when concentrations in the air space around the com-
modity fall to

time is required. 
Aeration for Non-Section 18 Treatments: The 
fumigator is responsible for following aeration 
requirements. 
Aeration for Section 18 Treatments: PPQ must ensure 
that aeration is conducted properly. Aeration period ends 
when concentrations in the air space around the com-
modity fall to 5 ppm AND a minimum of 4 hours for active 
aeration (mechanical fan) OR 12 hours for passive aera-
tion (no fan) has elapsed. 
Aeration for Non-Section 18 commodities: The fumi-
gator remains responsible for following aeration require-
ments.
