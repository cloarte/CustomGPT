 Invasion: The morphometrics of the South African population agreed with those reported for D. destructor: 6 to 11 lateral incisures, a rounded tail tip, and a long post-uterine sac relative to the vulva-anus distance (De Waele et al., 1989).DeWaele et al. (1989)andWendt et al. (1995), give detailed descriptions of the adult females and males (larvae not described). The following description is given byWendt et al. (1995): Female: Head flattened, about 1.3 µm high and 6.4 - 7.3 µm wide, not offset from, but narrower than rest of body. SEM shows labial area with pore-like stoma opening surrounded by six outer labial sense organs and two large, medial lips, each with a pair of cephalic sensillae. Outline of labial area and head region hexagonal. Amphidial aperture elliptical, directed towards stomal opening. First head annule discontinuous, caused by position of amphidial apertures. Apart from labial disc, four lip annuli in lip region. Stylet delicate, knobs distinct, separated, sloping backwards; shaft about 60% of total stylet length. Median bulb with crescentic valves. Basal bulb overlapping intestine. Postvulval uterine sac 50 -143 (79.2+-21) µm long, comprising about 8% of total body length or 37 - 85% of vulva-anus distance and equal to 1.5 - 3.7 times vulval body diameter. Egg measurements: 45 - 60

Egg measurements: 45 - 60 µm x 20.5 - 33.5 µm. Tail elongate-conoid, tapering in posterior one-third to a finely rounded terminus. Male: Bursa 33 - 60 (47+-8.6) µm long, leptoderan, covering 48-66% of tail length. Spicule arcuate ventrad, slightly cephalated.

 Reproduccion: The biology of D. africanus is very closely related to that of the groundnut plant. The nematode apparently survives in the soil, on fungi and the roots of groundnut and alternate hosts and weeds, in very low numbers until the groundnut pegs appear in the soil (around 8 weeks after sowing). Hereafter the nematode penetrates the immature pod at its connection with the peg, entering the exocarp and moving either longitudinally in this cell layer towards the beak-end of the pod (hence the pod discolouration), or through the mesocarp into the endocarp of the hull (shell) ( Venter et al., 1995 ). It then migrates to the seed micropyle from where it invades the seed testa and embryo (giving rise to the seed symptoms). The nematode has not been found within the cotyledons of the seed ( Jones and De Waele, 1990 ).The nematode reproduces within the pod and seed, and at 28

 ( Venter et al., 1995 ). It then migrates to the seed micropyle from where it invades the seed testa and embryo (giving rise to the seed symptoms). The nematode has not been found within the cotyledons of the seed ( Jones and De Waele, 1990 ).The nematode reproduces within the pod and seed, and at 28°C the life-cycle from adult to adult is 6 to 7 days (De Waele and Wilken, 1990).As physiological maturity approaches (from 17 to 21 weeks after sowing, varying between cultivars) the relative number of eggs and anhydrobiotes in the pod and seed tissues increases ( Venter et al., 1995 ).Post harvest, the nematode is able to survive in planting seed, which may be symptomless, and in the field soil in the absence of host plants, or in hulls buried in the soil, for at least 28 to 32 weeks ( Basson et al., 1993 ). This is long enough to survive the dry winter season in South Africa.With the first spring rains the eggs hatch and anhydrobiotes rehydrate. Basson et al. (1993) showed that rehydrated soil populations of D. africanus are able to invade the next crop of groundnut and cause damage. Although relatively few nematodes survive in whole stored seed at 10°C, the surviving nematode population is also able to build up to levels capable of causing damage to the next crop ( Basson et al., 1993 ).
 Sintomas: D. africanus does not cause visible lesions on the roots of groundnuts, but affects the appearance, and sometimes the weight and untimely germination, of the pods and seeds ( Venter et al., 1991 ). Infected hulls also show greyish-black to brown necrotic tissue at the point of connection with the peg, and in broad

 Sintomas: D. africanus does not cause visible lesions on the roots of groundnuts, but affects the appearance, and sometimes the weight and untimely germination, of the pods and seeds ( Venter et al., 1991 ). Infected hulls also show greyish-black to brown necrotic tissue at the point of connection with the peg, and in broad bands along the longitudinal veins. Infected seeds are usually shrunken with dark brown to black micropyles and yellow to dark flaccid testae with dark vascular strands. The embryos may also become darkly discoloured ( Jones and De Waele, 1990 ).No symptoms are visible on the roots of alternate hosts ( Basson et al., 1990 ) or the tubers of potatoes (De Waele et al., 1991).
