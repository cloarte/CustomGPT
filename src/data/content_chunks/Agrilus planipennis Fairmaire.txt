DO NOT MOVE
FIREWOOD!
Exotic pests like the emerald ash borer 
can be spread when infested firewood is 
transported to new areas.
• Do not bring firewood from 
home.
• Use local sources of firewood.
• If you have brought firewood 
from home, DON’T take it 
with you, DON’T leave it–
BURN IT!
REPORT!

emerald ash borer,

The emerald ash borer, 
Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, a 
beetle native to Asia, was first 
detected in Michigan in 2002. 
Evidence suggests that the beetle 
was established in Michigan 
for years prior to its discovery. 
Emerald ash borer (EAB) has 
since been detected in many 
states, and also in Ontario and 
Quebec, Canada. In addition 
to spreading by natural means, 
EAB can be transported to new areas in infested

Evidence suggests that the beetle 
was established in Michigan

Emerald ash borer (EAB) has 
since been detected in many 
states, and also in Ontario and 
Quebec, Canada. In addition 
to spreading by natural means, 
EAB can be transported to new areas in infested 
firewood, timber, and nursery stock. This beetle 
has been responsible for the loss of millions of 
ash trees in North America.
Actual Size
Host:
In North America,
EAB is known to 
infest all species of 
ash
(Fraxinus spp.).
Ash can be 
recognized by 
the presence 
of compound 
leaves which are 
arranged opposite of 
one another on the 
branches.
Biology:
Eggs are laid between layers of bark and in bark 
crevices. Larvae hatch in about one week and 
bore into the tree where they feed on the inner 
bark and phloem, creating “S”-shaped galleries. 
Larvae go through four feeding stages, and 
then excavate a pupal chamber in the 
fall, where they will overwinter as 
prepupae.
Pupation occurs in late spring, and 
adults begin to emerge through
“D”-shaped exit holes in May and early 
June. Adults will remain active until the 
end of
 summer.
Not EAB:
This commonly encountered beetle, the 
six-spotted green tiger beetle, Cicindela 
sexguttata, is often mistaken for EAB due 
to its similar appearence. It is a predator 
of small insects and is frequently found on

Not EAB:
This commonly encountered beetle, the 
six-spotted green tiger beetle, Cicindela 
sexguttata, is often mistaken for EAB due 
to its similar appearence. It is a predator 
of small insects and is frequently found on 
hiking trails. There are other insects often 
mistaken for EAB.
Symptoms and Signs:
New infestations are difficult to detect, as 
damage to the tree may not be apparent for up 
to three years. Symptoms of an infestation can 
include branch dieback in the upper crown, 
excessive epicormic branching on the tree trunk,  
and vertical bark splits. Woodpecker damage is 
sometimes apparent.
Other Stressors:
Ash may also be stressed by 
drought, diseases such as ash 
yellows, and by native wood-
boring insects like the redheaded 
ash borer, Neoclytus acuminatus
(Fabricius) which creates a
round emergence hole.
