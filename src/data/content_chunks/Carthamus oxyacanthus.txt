 Invasion: Carthamus oxyacanthusis an herb that grows annually. Its seed germination is not even and takes 6 to 15 days and even more. The plant goes through different stages viz., rosette, elongation, branching, flowering, fruiting and drying. The rosette stage lasts for about 25 to 30 days and the plant reaches 50% flowering in 90 to 127 days and maturity in 120 to 165 days after germination.C. oxyacanthusis a short to medium short plant, growing to an average height of 30 to 90 cm. The branches usually develop from the base of the stem. The primary capsule is located at the top of the stem, while the side branches of secondary, tertiary, and higher orders develop from the stem. Each branch ends with a capsule. The leaves are sessile, spiny and oblanceolate. The rosette stage leaves and the one at the bottom of the stem are big, dentate, long (10-15 cm), and narrow while those on the branches are small (3-7 cm), oblong or oblong-lanceolate, light green and pinnatifid. The bottom leaves have longer spines than those on the branches. Spines are sharp

olate. The rosette stage leaves and the one at the bottom of the stem are big, dentate, long (10-15 cm), and narrow while those on the branches are small (3-7 cm), oblong or oblong-lanceolate, light green and pinnatifid. The bottom leaves have longer spines than those on the branches. Spines are sharp, yellow and appear along the margin and tip of the leaf. A single plant can produce about 27-110 capsules. Capsules are small (1-2 cm in diameter), conical, spiny and shatter seeds upon reaching maturity. Outer involucre bracts are spiny. Each capsule produces 2-15 seeds, which are small, obovoid, weighing 0.6-2 g per 100 seeds. They have no pappus and are naked, containing 25-28% oil (Kheradnam and Bassiri, 1978;Anjani, 2010;Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015). Its oil is considered an alternative to safflower oil (Banergy et al., 1999). About 1-7 g of seed yield per plant has been reported. The seed coat is hard and shiny; brown, dark brown, tan, black, grey, and white seed coat with or without mottling was reported (Bassiri and Kheradnam, 1976;Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015).Bassiri and Kheradnam (1976)have observed that white seeds had better geminated than coloured seeds, probably due to thinner coats, and the black seeds had lower germination than mottled gray seeds.

 Reproduccion: Genetics Carthamus oxyacanthus is a diploid plant with 24 chromosomes ( Ashri and Knowles, 1960 ). Karyotypic analysis revealed that this species had nine pairs of metacentric (m) and three pairs of submetacentric (sm) chromosomes, and the longest two sm pairs had satellites ( Carapetian and Zarei, 2005b ; Jayaramu and Chatterji, 1986 ). It can naturally hybridize with C. tinctorius if their flowering periods overlap ( McPherson et al., 2004 ; Mayerhofer et al., 2011 ). Close genetic relationship between C. oxyacanthus and C. tinctorius was reported based on cytogenetic, and chloroplast and nuclear DNA studies ( Ashri and Knowles, 1960 ; Bassir, 1977; Pillai et al., 1981 ; Sehegal et al., 2008; Ambreen et al., 2015 ). Significant genetic diversity for agro-morphological traits have been reported ( Abdollah and Kheradnam, 1976 ; Anjani, 2010 ; Gupta et al., 2021 ; Sabzalian et al., 2010 ). Higher seed yields are associated with greater height of branching, number of branches and capsules, and seed weight in this species (Anjani, 2005b). The genome size (2C) of C. oxyacanthus is between 2.4-2.62 pg ( Garnatje et al., 2006 ; Sardouei-Nasab et al., 2023 ).

 capsules, and seed weight in this species (Anjani, 2005b). The genome size (2C) of C. oxyacanthus is between 2.4-2.62 pg ( Garnatje et al., 2006 ; Sardouei-Nasab et al., 2023 ). High molecular genetic variability within C. oxyacanthus has been reported at DNA level using different molecular markers ( Sabzalian et al., 2009 ; Bagmohammadi et al., 2012 ; Talebi et al., 2012 ; Majidi and Zadhoush, 2014 ; Mokhtari et al., 2018 ). Linkage maps were developed using the cross between C. tinctorius and C. oxyacanthus . These maps are being used to track C. oxyacanthus genome introgressed into C. tinctorius . Anjani et al. (2018) identified SSR markers linked to Fusarium wilt ( Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. carthami ) resistance and used them in marker-assisted selection for wilt resistance in safflower ( Carthamus tinctorius x C. oxyacanthus ) interspecific offspring. Carthamus oxyacanthus has been used for the genetic improvement of safflower. It was identified as a source of cytoplasmic male sterility. Anjani (2005b) developed the cytoplasmic-genic male sterility in safflower from a cross between C. oxyacanthus and C. tinctorius . It is a source of resistance to safflower fly ( Ashri, 1971 ; Sabzalian et al., 2010 ), rust, Fusarium wilt and Alternaria leaf spot ( Zimmer and Urie, 1969 ; Anjani and Nageswar Rao, 2000; Pallavi et al., 2007 ; Anjani et al., 2016 ; Anjani et al., 2018 ).

Resistance to these diseases and safflower fly ( Acanthiophilus helianthi ) was successfully introgressed from C. oxyacanthus into safflower ( Zimmer and Urie, 1969 ; Anjani and Prasad, 2005 ; Karami et al., 2017 ; Anjani et al., 2018 ). Soraya et al. (2021) have suggested that the presence of flavonoid and phenolic compounds, and the absence of the colour component cyanidin-3-glucoside in the dark brown seed coat might have played a role in resistance to the safflower fly in brown-seeded C. oxyacanthus . Cultivated safflower has been also improved for seed yield traits by introgressing high number of capsules and branches per plant from wild safflower ( Anjani, 2010 ; 2016). Reproductive Biology Carthamus oxyacanthus reproduces by seed. It is predominantly self-pollinated but about 10% of outcrossing occurs through insects predominantly bees ( Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015 ; Ahmad et al., 2007; 2010 ; Engel et al., 2019 ; Rehman et al., 2020 ). The flowering head is called the capitula or capsule. The corolla is light yellow or lemon-yellow at full bloom and turns yellow at the drying stage. Flowering continues for 25-35 days; it begins at the main axis and then continues toward the branches. Flowering in a capsule starts at the margin of the head and proceeds inward over 3-5 days. An individual capsule contains 15-20 tubular,

 the capitula or capsule. The corolla is light yellow or lemon-yellow at full bloom and turns yellow at the drying stage. Flowering continues for 25-35 days; it begins at the main axis and then continues toward the branches. Flowering in a capsule starts at the margin of the head and proceeds inward over 3-5 days. An individual capsule contains 15-20 tubular, bisexual, light yellow or lemon-yellow florets. Each floret has five corolla lobes and five stamens. Stamens are united to form an anther tube. The stigma and the style grow through the anther tube. The ovary is located at the base of the floret. The stigma gets pollinated by its own pollen and is studded with pollen when exerts out of the anther tube. The pollen grain is sub-prolate in shape and has a sub echinate pattern ( Jafari and Ghanbarian, 2007 ). Intra- and interspecific outcrossing under natural conditions is possible. Out-crossing is mainly by bees which facilitate plant-to-plant movement of pollen. The interspecific hybrids were morphologically and phenologically intermediate to both the parents when C. tinctorius was a female parent and C. oxyacanthus was a male parent. Germination of these hybrids was 32-100% and uniform ( Anjani, 2010 ; Mayerhofer et al., 2011 ). The F 1 hybrids of C. oxyacanthus (♀) and C. tinctorius (♂) predominantly resembled C. oxyacanthus in morphology and phenology (Anjani, self-observation). Cultivated safflower was improved for higher seed yield, and resistance to Fusarium wilt, rust and Alternaria leaf spot through introgressing resistance, and seed yield traits such as high number of branches and capsules, and basal branching from C. oxyacanthus ( Anj

Cultivated safflower was improved for higher seed yield, and resistance to Fusarium wilt, rust and Alternaria leaf spot through introgressing resistance, and seed yield traits such as high number of branches and capsules, and basal branching from C. oxyacanthus ( Anjani and Nadeswar Rao, 2000 ; Anjani et al., 2016 ). Physiology and Phenology Carthamus oxyacanthus is found growing in areas having precipitation as low as 27 mm and as high as 1500 mm, and 45-50°C highest temperature and -20-2.5°C lowest temperature at 76-2700 m altitude. It is found in summer, winter, bimodal and uniform rain regimes. It grows on sandy, sandy loam, sandy clay, loam and saline soils having 8.15-10.34 mm hos/cm salinity levels ( Bassiri and Kheradnam, 1976 ). C. oxyacanthus might be a possible source of drought tolerance with 0.1-0.6 stress tolerance index or -0.21-1.1 stress susceptibility index under moisture stress conditions. Seed yield under drought conditions had a significantly high positive association with stress tolerance, stress susceptibility index, stress tolerance index ( Majidi et al., 2011 ). Erdal et al. (2021) observed that C. oxyacanthus activated photochemical efficiency and the defence systems, protected membrane stability and water status during drought stress, and fully recovered when re-watered. The study on photosynthetic characteristics of C. oxyacanthus , showed that the net photosynthesis reported in wild safflower was between 62-65 µmol m -2 s -1 , the transpiration rate was between 7-9 µmol m -2 s -1 , and the water use efficiency was between 6.7-8.

 and fully recovered when re-watered. The study on photosynthetic characteristics of C. oxyacanthus , showed that the net photosynthesis reported in wild safflower was between 62-65 µmol m -2 s -1 , the transpiration rate was between 7-9 µmol m -2 s -1 , and the water use efficiency was between 6.7-8.8 µmol m -2 s -1 /µmol m -2 s -1 . The germination of C. oxyacanthus seeds is low and not consistent but soaking the seeds for 1 day resulted in a doubling of the germination percentage ( Kheradnam and Bassiri, 1980 ). The aqueous extract of its seeds showed a negative impact on the germination of both C. oxyacanthus and lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ). This reduction in germination may be due to the high osmotic pressure caused by the presence of ions, salts, or other materials in the extracts. Kheradnam and Bassiri (1980) have also noted that the extracts from embryos had a more significant effect on germination than those from the hulls. Wild safflower exhibited an allelopathic effect on the germination of wheat ( Hassan et al., 2020 ) and had no effect on C henopodium album , Lepidium didymum , Phalaris canariensis and Rumex dentatus which are noxious weeds of wheat ( Siyar et al., 2018 ). Its seed germination and seedling growth were affected by the allelopathic effect of aqueous extracts of the leaves of Prosopis juliflora and Eucalyptus camaldulensis , and extract of bark of Acacia arabica [ Acacia nilotica ] ( Hassan et al., 2008 ; Hesammi, 2012 ).

Chemical composition Seeds and leaves C. oxyacanthus have good nutritional and medicinal value. The seeds contain moisture (5-6%), crude fat (25-27%), crude protein (9-12%), carbohydrates (36-39%) and ash (3-4%), and are rich in four amino acids: arginine, glycine, valine and leucine ( Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015 ). Seed oil content varies from 22-27%. The fatty acids composition of seed is linoleic acid (66-78%), oleic acid (15-16%), palmitic acid (4-7%) and stearic acid (1.13-1.19%) (Carpetian and Zarei, 2005; Al Fadal and Al-Ferdan, 2015). C. oxyacanthus seeds and leaves contain several trace elements such as Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P and Zn (Al Fadal and Al-Ferdan, 2015). Two major pigments, carthamidin and carthamin are found in flowers. Seeds and flowers have compounds like glycosides, serotonin, flavonoids and sterols (Souri et al., 2004 ; Hassan et al., 2010 ; Chakradhari et al., 2020 ). Its biochemical components can alter the smell, taste, and/or colour of meat and milk. Velasco et al. (2005) have reported high γ -tocopherol seeds (>85%) in one of the accessions of C. oxyacanthus .

(2005) have reported high γ -tocopherol seeds (>85%) in one of the accessions of C. oxyacanthus . Its oil was suggested as an alternative to safflower oil ( Banergy et al., 1999 ), and can be utilized as a possible biodiesel feedstock ( Zadeh et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Sadia et al., 2013 ). Environmental Requirements Temperature is an important factor for C. oxyacanthus seed germination. The optimum temperature for seed germination of the wild safflower was 15-20°C. The seeds will not germinate if the temperature is <5°C and ≥35°C. The germination rate of seeds will drastically reduce at temperatures below 10°C and above 30°C ( Tanveer et al., 2012 ; Nazari et al., 2018 ; Fakhhrrad et al., 2019 ). Chilling of the seed for a month at 0°C reduces the emergence of the seed. Bassiri and Kheradnam (1976) reported that seed scarification had improved germination. Drought stress had no effect on oil content and quality ( Nazari et al., 2016 ). Wild safflower adapts to climate change and the cardinal temperatures of this species may also change in accordance with the new conditions.

co et al. (2005) have reported high γ -tocopherol seeds (>85%) in one of the accessions of C. oxyacanthus . Its oil was suggested as an alternative to safflower oil ( Banergy et al., 1999 ), and can be utilized as a possible biodiesel feedstock ( Zadeh et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Sadia et al., 2013 ). Environmental Requirements Temperature is an important factor for C. oxyacanthus seed germination. The optimum temperature for seed germination of the wild safflower was 15-20°C. The seeds will not germinate if the temperature is <5°C and ≥35°C. The germination rate of seeds will drastically reduce at temperatures below 10°C and above 30°C ( Tanveer et al., 2012 ; Nazari et al., 2018 ; Fakhhrrad et al., 2019 ). Chilling of the seed for a month at 0°C reduces the emergence of the seed. Bassiri and Kheradnam (1976) reported that seed scarification had improved germination. Drought stress had no effect on oil content and quality ( Nazari et al., 2016 ). Wild safflower adapts to climate change and the cardinal temperatures of this species may also change in accordance with the new conditions.

 Invasion: Carthamus oxyacanthusis an herb that grows annually. Its seed germination is not even and takes 6 to 15 days and even more. The plant goes through different stages viz., rosette, elongation, branching, flowering, fruiting and drying. The rosette stage lasts for about 25 to 30 days and the plant reaches 50% flowering in 90 to 127 days and maturity in 120 to 165 days after germination.C. oxyacanthusis a short to medium short plant, growing to an average height of 30 to 90 cm. The branches usually develop from the base of the stem. The primary capsule is located at the top of the stem, while the side branches of secondary, tertiary, and higher orders develop from the stem. Each branch ends with a capsule. The leaves are sessile, spiny and oblanceolate. The rosette stage leaves and the one at the bottom of the stem are big, dentate, long (10-15 cm), and narrow while those on the branches are small (3-7 cm), oblong or oblong-lanceolate, light green and pinnatifid. The bottom leaves have longer spines than those on the branches. Spines are sharp

olate. The rosette stage leaves and the one at the bottom of the stem are big, dentate, long (10-15 cm), and narrow while those on the branches are small (3-7 cm), oblong or oblong-lanceolate, light green and pinnatifid. The bottom leaves have longer spines than those on the branches. Spines are sharp, yellow and appear along the margin and tip of the leaf. A single plant can produce about 27-110 capsules. Capsules are small (1-2 cm in diameter), conical, spiny and shatter seeds upon reaching maturity. Outer involucre bracts are spiny. Each capsule produces 2-15 seeds, which are small, obovoid, weighing 0.6-2 g per 100 seeds. They have no pappus and are naked, containing 25-28% oil (Kheradnam and Bassiri, 1978;Anjani, 2010;Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015). Its oil is considered an alternative to safflower oil (Banergy et al., 1999). About 1-7 g of seed yield per plant has been reported. The seed coat is hard and shiny; brown, dark brown, tan, black, grey, and white seed coat with or without mottling was reported (Bassiri and Kheradnam, 1976;Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015).Bassiri and Kheradnam (1976)have observed that white seeds had better geminated than coloured seeds, probably due to thinner coats, and the black seeds had lower germination than mottled gray seeds.

 Reproduccion: Genetics Carthamus oxyacanthus is a diploid plant with 24 chromosomes ( Ashri and Knowles, 1960 ). Karyotypic analysis revealed that this species had nine pairs of metacentric (m) and three pairs of submetacentric (sm) chromosomes, and the longest two sm pairs had satellites ( Carapetian and Zarei, 2005b ; Jayaramu and Chatterji, 1986 ). It can naturally hybridize with C. tinctorius if their flowering periods overlap ( McPherson et al., 2004 ; Mayerhofer et al., 2011 ). Close genetic relationship between C. oxyacanthus and C. tinctorius was reported based on cytogenetic, and chloroplast and nuclear DNA studies ( Ashri and Knowles, 1960 ; Bassir, 1977; Pillai et al., 1981 ; Sehegal et al., 2008; Ambreen et al., 2015 ). Significant genetic diversity for agro-morphological traits have been reported ( Abdollah and Kheradnam, 1976 ; Anjani, 2010 ; Gupta et al., 2021 ; Sabzalian et al., 2010 ). Higher seed yields are associated with greater height of branching, number of branches and capsules, and seed weight in this species (Anjani, 2005b). The genome size (2C) of C. oxyacanthus is between 2.4-2.62 pg ( Garnatje et al., 2006 ; Sardouei-Nasab et al., 2023 ).

High molecular genetic variability within C. oxyacanthus has been reported at DNA level using different molecular markers ( Sabzalian et al., 2009 ; Bagmohammadi et al., 2012 ; Talebi et al., 2012 ; Majidi and Zadhoush, 2014 ; Mokhtari et al., 2018 ). Linkage maps were developed using the cross between C. tinctorius and C. oxyacanthus . These maps are being used to track C. oxyacanthus genome introgressed into C. tinctorius . Anjani et al. (2018) identified SSR markers linked to Fusarium wilt ( Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. carthami ) resistance and used them in marker-assisted selection for wilt resistance in safflower ( Carthamus tinctorius x C. oxyacanthus ) interspecific offspring. Carthamus oxyacanthus has been used for the genetic improvement of safflower. It was identified as a source of cytoplasmic male sterility. Anjani (2005b) developed the cytoplasmic-genic male sterility in safflower from a cross between C. oxyacanthus and C. tinctorius . It is a source of resistance to safflower fly ( Ashri, 1971 ; Sabzalian et al., 2010 ), rust, Fusarium wilt and Alternaria leaf spot ( Zimmer and Urie, 1969 ; Anjani and Nageswar Rao, 2000; Pallavi et al., 2007 ; Anjani et al., 2016 ; Anjani et al., 2018 ).

Resistance to these diseases and safflower fly ( Acanthiophilus helianthi ) was successfully introgressed from C. oxyacanthus into safflower ( Zimmer and Urie, 1969 ; Anjani and Prasad, 2005 ; Karami et al., 2017 ; Anjani et al., 2018 ). Soraya et al. (2021) have suggested that the presence of flavonoid and phenolic compounds, and the absence of the colour component cyanidin-3-glucoside in the dark brown seed coat might have played a role in resistance to the safflower fly in brown-seeded C. oxyacanthus . Cultivated safflower has been also improved for seed yield traits by introgressing high number of capsules and branches per plant from wild safflower ( Anjani, 2010 ; 2016). Reproductive Biology Carthamus oxyacanthus reproduces by seed. It is predominantly self-pollinated but about 10% of outcrossing occurs through insects predominantly bees ( Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015 ; Ahmad et al., 2007; 2010 ; Engel et al., 2019 ; Rehman et al., 2020 ). The flowering head is called the capitula or capsule. The corolla is light yellow or lemon-yellow at full bloom and turns yellow at the drying stage. Flowering continues for 25-35 days; it begins at the main axis and then continues toward the branches. Flowering in a capsule starts at the margin of the head and proceeds inward over 3-5 days. An individual capsule contains 15-20 tubular,

 the capitula or capsule. The corolla is light yellow or lemon-yellow at full bloom and turns yellow at the drying stage. Flowering continues for 25-35 days; it begins at the main axis and then continues toward the branches. Flowering in a capsule starts at the margin of the head and proceeds inward over 3-5 days. An individual capsule contains 15-20 tubular, bisexual, light yellow or lemon-yellow florets. Each floret has five corolla lobes and five stamens. Stamens are united to form an anther tube. The stigma and the style grow through the anther tube. The ovary is located at the base of the floret. The stigma gets pollinated by its own pollen and is studded with pollen when exerts out of the anther tube. The pollen grain is sub-prolate in shape and has a sub echinate pattern ( Jafari and Ghanbarian, 2007 ). Intra- and interspecific outcrossing under natural conditions is possible. Out-crossing is mainly by bees which facilitate plant-to-plant movement of pollen. The interspecific hybrids were morphologically and phenologically intermediate to both the parents when C. tinctorius was a female parent and C. oxyacanthus was a male parent. Germination of these hybrids was 32-100% and uniform ( Anjani, 2010 ; Mayerhofer et al., 2011 ). The F 1 hybrids of C. oxyacanthus (♀) and C. tinctorius (♂) predominantly resembled C. oxyacanthus in morphology and phenology (Anjani, self-observation). Cultivated safflower was improved for higher seed yield, and resistance to Fusarium wilt, rust and Alternaria leaf spot through introgressing resistance, and seed yield traits such as high number of branches and capsules, and basal branching from C. oxyacanthus ( Anj

Cultivated safflower was improved for higher seed yield, and resistance to Fusarium wilt, rust and Alternaria leaf spot through introgressing resistance, and seed yield traits such as high number of branches and capsules, and basal branching from C. oxyacanthus ( Anjani and Nadeswar Rao, 2000 ; Anjani et al., 2016 ). Physiology and Phenology Carthamus oxyacanthus is found growing in areas having precipitation as low as 27 mm and as high as 1500 mm, and 45-50°C highest temperature and -20-2.5°C lowest temperature at 76-2700 m altitude. It is found in summer, winter, bimodal and uniform rain regimes. It grows on sandy, sandy loam, sandy clay, loam and saline soils having 8.15-10.34 mm hos/cm salinity levels ( Bassiri and Kheradnam, 1976 ). C. oxyacanthus might be a possible source of drought tolerance with 0.1-0.6 stress tolerance index or -0.21-1.1 stress susceptibility index under moisture stress conditions. Seed yield under drought conditions had a significantly high positive association with stress tolerance, stress susceptibility index, stress tolerance index ( Majidi et al., 2011 ). Erdal et al. (2021) observed that C. oxyacanthus activated photochemical efficiency and the defence systems, protected membrane stability and water status during drought stress, and fully recovered when re-watered. The study on photosynthetic characteristics of C. oxyacanthus , showed that the net photosynthesis reported in wild safflower was between 62-65 µmol m -2 s -1 , the transpiration rate was between 7-9 µmol m -2 s -1 , and the water use efficiency was between 6.7-8.

 and fully recovered when re-watered. The study on photosynthetic characteristics of C. oxyacanthus , showed that the net photosynthesis reported in wild safflower was between 62-65 µmol m -2 s -1 , the transpiration rate was between 7-9 µmol m -2 s -1 , and the water use efficiency was between 6.7-8.8 µmol m -2 s -1 /µmol m -2 s -1 . The germination of C. oxyacanthus seeds is low and not consistent but soaking the seeds for 1 day resulted in a doubling of the germination percentage ( Kheradnam and Bassiri, 1980 ). The aqueous extract of its seeds showed a negative impact on the germination of both C. oxyacanthus and lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ). This reduction in germination may be due to the high osmotic pressure caused by the presence of ions, salts, or other materials in the extracts. Kheradnam and Bassiri (1980) have also noted that the extracts from embryos had a more significant effect on germination than those from the hulls. Wild safflower exhibited an allelopathic effect on the germination of wheat ( Hassan et al., 2020 ) and had no effect on C henopodium album , Lepidium didymum , Phalaris canariensis and Rumex dentatus which are noxious weeds of wheat ( Siyar et al., 2018 ). Its seed germination and seedling growth were affected by the allelopathic effect of aqueous extracts of the leaves of Prosopis juliflora and Eucalyptus camaldulensis , and extract of bark of Acacia arabica [ Acacia nilotica ] ( Hassan et al., 2008 ; Hesammi, 2012 ).

Chemical composition Seeds and leaves C. oxyacanthus have good nutritional and medicinal value. The seeds contain moisture (5-6%), crude fat (25-27%), crude protein (9-12%), carbohydrates (36-39%) and ash (3-4%), and are rich in four amino acids: arginine, glycine, valine and leucine ( Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015 ). Seed oil content varies from 22-27%. The fatty acids composition of seed is linoleic acid (66-78%), oleic acid (15-16%), palmitic acid (4-7%) and stearic acid (1.13-1.19%) (Carpetian and Zarei, 2005; Al Fadal and Al-Ferdan, 2015). C. oxyacanthus seeds and leaves contain several trace elements such as Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P and Zn (Al Fadal and Al-Ferdan, 2015). Two major pigments, carthamidin and carthamin are found in flowers. Seeds and flowers have compounds like glycosides, serotonin, flavonoids and sterols (Souri et al., 2004 ; Hassan et al., 2010 ; Chakradhari et al., 2020 ).

Its seed germination and seedling growth were affected by the allelopathic effect of aqueous extracts of the leaves of Prosopis juliflora and Eucalyptus camaldulensis , and extract of bark of Acacia arabica [ Acacia nilotica ] ( Hassan et al., 2008 ; Hesammi, 2012 ). Chemical composition Seeds and leaves C. oxyacanthus have good nutritional and medicinal value. The seeds contain moisture (5-6%), crude fat (25-27%), crude protein (9-12%), carbohydrates (36-39%) and ash (3-4%), and are rich in four

abica [ Acacia nilotica ] ( Hassan et al., 2008 ; Hesammi, 2012 ). Chemical composition Seeds and leaves C. oxyacanthus have good nutritional and medicinal value. The seeds contain moisture (5-6%), crude fat (25-27%), crude protein (9-12%), carbohydrates (36-39%) and ash (3-4%), and are rich in four amino acids: arginine, glycine, valine and leucine ( Al Fadal and Al-Fredan, 2015 ). Seed oil content varies from 22-27%. The fatty acids composition of seed is linoleic acid (66-78%), oleic acid (15-16%), palmitic acid (4-7%) and stearic acid (1.13-1.19%) (Carpetian and Zarei, 2005; Al Fadal and Al-Ferdan, 2015). C. oxyacanthus seeds and leaves contain several trace elements such as Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P and Zn (Al Fadal and Al-Ferdan, 2015). Two major pigments, carthamidin and carthamin are found in flowers. Seeds and flowers have compounds like glycosides, serotonin, flavonoids and sterols (Souri et al., 2004 ; Hassan et al., 2010 ; Chakradhari et al., 2020 ). Its biochemical components can alter the smell, taste, and/or colour of meat and milk. Velasco et al. (2005) have reported high γ -tocopherol seeds (>85%) in one of the accessions of C. oxyacanthus . Its oil was suggested as an alternative to safflower oil ( Banergy et al., 1999 ), and can be utilized as a possible biodiesel feedstock ( Zadeh et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Sad

co et al. (2005) have reported high γ -tocopherol seeds (>85%) in one of the accessions of C. oxyacanthus . Its oil was suggested as an alternative to safflower oil ( Banergy et al., 1999 ), and can be utilized as a possible biodiesel feedstock ( Zadeh et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Sadia et al., 2013 ). Environmental Requirements Temperature is an important factor for C. oxyacanthus seed germination. The optimum temperature for seed germination of the wild safflower was 15-20°C. The seeds will not germinate if the temperature is <5°C and ≥35°C. The germination rate of seeds will drastically reduce at temperatures below 10°C and above 30°C ( Tanveer et al., 2012 ; Nazari et al., 2018 ; Fakhhrrad et al., 2019 ). Chilling of the seed for a month at 0°C reduces the emergence of the seed. Bassiri and Kheradnam (1976) reported that seed scarification had improved germination. Drought stress had no effect on oil content and quality ( Nazari et al., 2016 ). Wild safflower adapts to climate change and the cardinal temperatures of this species may also change in accordance with the new conditions.
