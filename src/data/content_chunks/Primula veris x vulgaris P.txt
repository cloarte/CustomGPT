Primula veris x vulgaris (P. x polyantha)Miller - False Oxlip  -Primulaceae© Graham Day© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)Where cowslips (Primula veris) and primroses (P. vulgaris) grow together they frequently hybridise. Cowslips are only native in the Carboniferous limestone districts of Northern Ireland, so the distribution of the hybrid in the wild reflects this. Outside this Carboniferous limestone area, cowslips are commonly grown in gardens so that the hybrid is occasionally reported from gardens well away from the cowslip's native populations. The hybrid is called the false oxlip because it resembles oxlip (P. elatior) - a species not found in Ireland.All names:Primula veris x vulgaris (P. x polyantha)Miller;Primula x polyanthaMiller;Primula veris x vulgaris;Primula x variabilisGoupil, non Bast.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
