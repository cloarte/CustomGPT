Plant Notes:  Scarlet Rose Mallow is a native herbaceous perennial member of the Hibiscus family (Malvaceae). In Alabama it is found in the southern portions of the state. It grows in swamps, along black water streams, and in bogs. In Alabama it is listed as an S1 species (typically 5 or fewer occurrences, very few remaining individuals, acres, or miles of stream, or some factor of its biology making it especially vulnerable in the state). Scarlet Rose Mallow grows to a height of six to eight feet. There are usually multiple stems from the base. The stems are glabrous and glaucous. The leaves are alternate, petiolate, glabrous, palmately lobed with five to seven lobes, and have unevenly serrate margins. Large red five-petaled flowers are produced throughout the summer months. The flowers are axillary and solitary. The flowers have a pink or white spot at the base of each petal. The fruit is a capsule. Scarlet Rose Mallow is an old garden favorite. It can be grown throughout the state, but requires mulching for winter protection in the northern parts of Alabama. Scarlet Rose Mallow prefers wet soils and full sun, though once established it can grow on drier sites. It can even grow in shallow water. Scarlet Rose Mallow is often available from nurseries, or it can be grown from seed or cuttings. Several cultivars such as “
