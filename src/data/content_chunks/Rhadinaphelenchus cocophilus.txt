 Invasion: The following morphological description is after CIH (1975).FemaleBody about 1 mm long and very slender (a=60-96), arcuate to nearly straight when relaxed; cuticle thin, marked with transverse striae 0.6-1 µm apart; lateral fields with four incisures and a faint median line suggesting a fifth incisure, occupying 0.25 of body-width (Goodey, 1960); deirids and phasmids absent. Lip region smooth, high, anteriorly flattened with rather straight sides, slightly narrower than body; head frame-work prominent, sclerotized. Spear 11-13 µm long, attenuated knobbed at base but knobs may be obscure, especially on immature specimens (Thorne, 1961); anterior part less than half spear length and sharply pointed; protrudor muscles of spear prominent, attached to basal plate of labial frame-work.

Esser says in litt. that a vulval flap as illustrated byGoodey (1960)may or not be present. Of 12 females he examined, one possibly possessed a vulval flap. Vagina thick-walled, slightly curved as it leads inwards to a distance of about 0.5 of body-width. Anterior gonad well developed, outstretched; oocytes in a row. Postvulval uterine sac elongate, extending to about 0.75 of vulva-anus distance, often with a few large spheroid sperms. Rectum about 1.5 anal body-widths long; anus distinct. Tail elongate-subcylindrical with a rounded, unstriated terminus, 10-17 anal body-widths long.MaleBody ventrally arcuate, more strongly curved in tail region. Head, spear and oespohagus as in female. Testis single, anteriorly outstretched, with spermatogonia in a row. Spicules paired, small; dorsal limb 9-11 µm long with an elongated rounded apex and ending distally before the ventral limb whose distal end appears to recurve to join the dorsal limb so that the entire spicule appears notched distally; the ventral element has a distinct rostrum proximally and appears to be connected to the dorsal limb through a transverse bar with a central hole for passage of nerves.

No gubernaculum, but dorsal wall of spicule pouch is thickened to form an apophysis. Tail strongly curved ventrally (may form 1.5 circles), subcylindrical in anterior half, then conoid to a pointed terminus. Bursa (or caudal alae) terminal, prominent in dorsal or ventral view (not easily detectable in lateral view as it does not project beyond tail contour) with finely striated margins, enveloping distal 0.4-0.5 of tail. There are two pairs of distinct ventro-submedian papillae near base of bursa and a pre-anal pair, about 0.5 of the spicule length anterior to cloaca; a fourth pair of ventro-lateral papillae behind the cloaca has been reported byThorne (1961)andNickle (1970)but these are very obscure and often not detectable.LarvaeLarvae have high, dome-shaped heads, not offset from body. Tails of second- and third-stage larvae have conoid or sharply mucronate tips, and those of fourth-stage larvae have dimorphic tips: in female larvae they are rounded as in the female, and in male larvae sharply drawn out.

 Reproduccion: The vector of R. cocophilus is the palm weevil, Rhynchophorus palmarum , and the biology and life cycle of R. cocophilus is intimately associated with the weevil. Weevil size was said to be an indicator of vector status, but recent evidence suggests that this is not the case ( Gerber and Giblin-Davis, 1990 ). Experimentally, it has also been shown that red ring disease can be caused by the nematodes entering the plant through the root system. Larvae of R. palmarum feed by burrowing through coconut stems and, when this occurs in trees which are infected with R. cocophilus , the larvae can become inoculated with the nematode. Adult weevils emerging from trees infected with R. cocophilus carry the nematode to new sites. R. cocophilus enters the haemocoel of weevil larvae via the gut tract; in adult weevils, R. cocophilus can be found in the gut, body cavity and the region of the ovipositor. In coconut tissues, R. cocophilus invades parenchyma tissue in the roots, stems and leaves, and also artificially infested nuts. At first, the nematodes occur as intercellular parasites in newly invaded tissue but later they can be found both intercellularly and intracellularly. In many cases, lysigenous cavities are formed in which large numbers of nematodes are found. One gram of such tissue can contain as many of 10 000 nematodes.

The heaviest losses due to R. cocophilus occur at the end of the wet season and in the first 2-3 months of the dry season (December to March) in Trinidad. R. cocophilus inoculated into the mesocarp of coconuts have a life cycle, from egg to egg, of 9-10 days. R. cocophilus infestation occurs more commonly in trees 2.5-10 years old, with greatest incidence in those 4-7 years old.

 Sintomas: Young coconut palms easily succumb to R. cocophilus attack. There is no record of any tree, once affected, having recovered. The disease occurs more commonly in trees 2.5-10 years old, with greatest incidence in those 4-7 years old. Occasionally, a palm as young as 1.5 or as old as 20 years or more may be attacked. The symptoms described are those for palms of the tall cultivar of coconuts or 'typica' which grow in the West Indian islands. These symptoms differ somewhat in the dwarf variety 'nana' and also some panama talls. Chlorosis first appears at the tips of the oldest leaves and spreads towards their bases but, occasionally, the younger leaves may be affected first.

 brown lower leaves may break across the petiole of the lower part of the rachis, or they may become partly dislodged at the base and hang down. Nuts are shed prematurely, either simultaneously with the development of leaf symptoms, or slightly before. The crown often topples over, about 4-6 weeks after symptoms first appear, due to associated severe damage caused internally by the larvae of the palm weevil. However, the trunk remains standing in the field for several months until it decays. At the onset of symptoms, the chlorotic yellow appearance of the leaves around the stem is sometimes indistinguishable from those of trees growing under conditions of poor drainage or during intense drought. The most characteristic symptoms are the internal lesions. In a cross-section of the stem, they appear as an orange to brick-red coloured ring, 2-4 cm wide, and at a distance of 3-5 cm from the periphery. In longitudinal section, the reddened tissue may appear as two united bands joined in the bole forming a 'U'-shape. Lesions at the upper end of the stem in the vicinity of the crown are discrete, appearing first as streaks and then as dots. The meristematic tissue in the bud remains white and apparently healthy. There is no putrefaction of the bud associated with R. cocophilus attack. In the roots, the normally white soft cortex becomes orange to faint red in colour, and has a dry and flaky texture when diseased. In the leaves, a solid core of mottled tissue, dull red to brown in colour, extends from the leaf-base up to 75 cm in the petioles. The disease is not recognizable externally in its very early stages. The roots, stems and leaf petioles are already infested and there is full development of internal symptoms before the first external symptoms become visible.

In the dwarf cultivars, the red colour gives way to shades of brown. Thus, instead of a red ring internally, there is a brown band. The discrete spots are also brown and the yellow discoloration of the leaves is not often apparent. Generally, the leaves become dried and brown, beginning at the tips of the leaflets and progressing downwards. The yellow dwarf cultivars respond in the same way as the green and the crosses between talls and dwarfs, or between Panama tall and any dwarf. They show a browning instead of a characteristic reddening of the leaves and stem tissue. The heaviest losses due to R. cocophilus occur at the end of the wet season and in the first 2-3 months of the dry season (December to March) in Trinidad.
