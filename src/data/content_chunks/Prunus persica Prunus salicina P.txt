Biosecurity Advice 2017-23 - Final report for the extension of nectarines import risk analysis to peaches, plums and apricots from China
8 November 2017
This Biosecurity Advice notifies stakeholders of the release of the final report for the extension of the nectarines import risk analysis to peaches, plums and apricots from China.
The final report recommends that the importation of fresh Chinese peaches (Prunus persica), plums (Prunus salicina and P. domestica) and apricots (Prunus armeniaca) to Australia be permitted, subject to a range of biosecurity conditions.
The final report takes into account submissions and comments by stakeholders on a draft report released on 1 August 2017.
On 1 August 2017 Biosecurity Advice 2017/14 announced the release of the draft report for a 30 day stakeholder consultation period.
This Biosecurity Advice notifies stakeholders of the release of the Final report for the extension of nectarines import risk analysis to peaches, plums and apricots from China. Comments from stakeholders on the draft report were taken into consideration in preparing the final report.
The department conducted a risk analysis for nectarines from China and the Final report for the non-regulated analysis of existing policy for fresh nectarine fruit from China (Final Report for Chinese Nectarines) was released in April 2016. The department recommends extending the import policy for nectarines from China to include other stone fruit (peaches, plums and apricots) from China. This risk analysis builds on the Final Report for Chinese Nectarines and should be read in conjunction with the Final Report for Chinese Nectarines.
The final report identified 20 pests of quarantine concern for peaches, plums and apricots. Among these 20 pests, 19 were identified as quarantine pests for nectarines in the Final

aches, plums and apricots) from China. This risk analysis builds on the Final Report for Chinese Nectarines and should be read in conjunction with the Final Report for Chinese Nectarines.
The final report identified 20 pests of quarantine concern for peaches, plums and apricots. Among these 20 pests, 19 were identified as quarantine pests for nectarines in the Final Report for Chinese Nectarines. The review identified an additional mealybug species, Phenacoccus aceris (apple mealybug), as being a potential quarantine pest for the three stone fruit commodities that was not assessed in the Final Report for Chinese Nectarines. It was found that Phenacoccus aceris may also be associated with nectarine fruit and therefore should be considered to be a quarantine pest for all stone fruit, including nectarines. The Final Report for Chinese Nectarines recommended measures for mealybugs and equivalent measures are also recommended for this additional mealybug. Phenacoccus aceris has also been assessed for USA stone fruit and Chinese apples and the measures are equivalent to those recommended in the previous risk analyses.
Given that the quarantine pests for these stone fruit and Chinese nectarines are the same, equivalent measures recommended for the importation of Chinese nectarines are also recommended for Chinese peaches, plums and apricots. The recommended measures include:
visual inspection and remedial action for leaf rollers, mealybugs, a spider mite, and thrips
area freedom or fruit treatment (cold disinfestations or irradiation) for fruit flies
area freedom or fruit treatment (methyl bromide fumigation or irradiation) or a systems approach approved by the department for spotted wing drosophila
area freedom or area of low pest prevalence or fruit treatment (methyl bromide fumigation or irradiation) or a systems approach approved by the department for fruit borers
