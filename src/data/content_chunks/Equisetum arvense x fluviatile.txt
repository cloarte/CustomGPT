Equisetum arvense x fluviatile (E. x litorale)Kuehl. ex Rupr. - Shore Horsetail  -Equisetaceae© John Wilde© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This is the naturally-occurring cross between two of our commonestEquisetumspecies:Equisetum arvensexE. fluviatile. It will grow in either very wet conditions, when it looks likeE. fluviatile, or drier situations, when it looks likeE. arvense! Although rarer than either of these species, it is by no means uncommon and can be found far away from one or both parents, having spread or persisted by means of its creeping underground rhizomes. This hybrid is intermediate in character between its two parents and can be distinguished by looking carefully at the diameter of the central hollow in the shoots and the number and depth of the grooves of the main stem. It is apparently more frequent in Ireland than in most other parts of Europe.All names:Equisetum arvense x fluviatile (E. x litorale)Kuehl. ex Rupr.;Equisetum x litoraleKuehl. ex Rupr.;Equisetum arvense x fluviatileNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
