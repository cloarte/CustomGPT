1. Reagent Name: Negative Guinea Pig Serum 
2. Strain or Source: Not Applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 550 (07) 
4. Fill Date: April 19, 2007 
5. Expiration Date: August 31, 2028 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: IRP 550 serves as the negative control serum when quantitating the 
tetanus antitoxin titer of guinea pig serum by ELISA. 
7. Instructions for Use: When testing the potency of guinea pig tetanus antitoxin by 
ELISA, as described in Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) 217, dilute the serum 1:4,000 in 
PBS/milk/Tween diluent (0.015 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, 1% nonfat dry milk, 
0.05% Tween 20). The test dilution is prepared by adding 0.1 mL of well mixed IRP 550 to 
9.9 mL of PBS/milk/Tween diluent. The serum is further diluted to 1:4,000 by adding 0.1 mL of 
the 1:100 dilution to 3.9 mL of PBS/milk/Tween diluent.

9.9 mL of PBS/milk/Tween diluent. The serum is further diluted to 1:4,000 by adding 0.1 mL of 
the 1:100 dilution to 3.9 mL of PBS/milk/Tween diluent. 
8. Test of Reagent: 
Determination of Absorbance Values - Absorbance values of less than 0.05 were recorded when 
IRP 550 was tested by ELISA as described in SAM 217. 
Sterility test - The serum was tested for sterility and found to be free of viable bacteria and fungi 
according to procedures outlined in title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.26. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: Two-mL glass vials containing 1.2 mL of 
serum. 
10. Storage Conditions: Store at -20°C or lower. Once the serum has been thawed store at 
4°± 2°C.

12. Origin and Passage History: Not applicable. 
13. Method of Preparation: Serum was collected from 500-800 gram nonvaccinated female 
and male guinea pigs (purchased from Small Stock and Charles River Laboratories). The serum 
was passed through a sterile Millipore filtration unit containing a 0.22-
i
nto sterile vials, and stored at -20°C.
