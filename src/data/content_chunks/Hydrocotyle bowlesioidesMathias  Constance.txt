Plant Notes:  Largeleaf Marsh Pennywort is an introduced herbaceous perennial in the Ginseng family (Araliaceae). It is native to Costa Rica and Panama.

If often occurs on sites associated with disturbance, and is possibly spread with sod. Thus far it has not invaded natural habitats. Largeleaf Marsh Pennywort is a creeping perennial forming large patches. The taproot is slightly swollen and fleshy. The stems are decumbent, green in color, densely pubescent, and root at the nodes. Leaves are alternate, petiolate, ovate to reniform in outline, densely pubescent with white hairs, with 5-7 triangular lobes and crenate to entire margins. Flowers are produced in 2-16 flowered umbels opposite the leaves. Individual flowers are sessile or short pedicellate with 5 very small, triangular, greenish-white petals. The fruit is a dry ribbed mericarp. Largeleaf Marsh Pennywort resembles Hoary Bowlesia (Bowlesia incana Ruiz & Pavón), but differs in having simple rather than stellate pubescence.—A. Diamond  ;
