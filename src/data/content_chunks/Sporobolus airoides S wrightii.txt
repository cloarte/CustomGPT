Alkali sacaton is a native bunchgrass found from South Dakota west toWashington and south into Mexico. It is densely-tufted and long-lived, witherect, solid stems about 3 feet tall. Basal foliage is abundant, the leavesbeing up to 18 inches long and 0.25 inch wide. Roots are fibrous anddeep-penetrating. The grass will grow on moist, alkaline soils, hence the name,but also occurs on other soil types. It is palatable while succulent butbecomes tough and unpalatable when ripe. Hay is of fair quality if cut early.Propagation is by seed, which is usually harvested from native stands.
Sacaton is a more robust grower than alkali sacaton and is more southern inits range, being native from West Texas to Arizona and south into Mexico. Thestems reach to 6 feet and are firm and bard. It is less drought resistant thanalkali sacaton. It furnishes useful grazing both while succulent and in winter,and is useful for hay if cut while young. It is rarely planted but is a usefulgrass in its native range.
