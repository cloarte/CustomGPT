Plant Notes:  Wild Geranium is a native herbaceous perennial in the Geranium family (Geraniaceae). It can be found throughout much of Alabama. Wild Geranium occurs in rich hardwood forests, on slopes, in ravines, and along streams. It is a perennial with a long woody rhizome. Stems are up to 2 feet in height, usually unbranched below the inflorescence, pubescent, and green in color. Leaves are alternate and basal, petiolate, deeply palmately 3-5 lobed, serrate, and pubescent. The leaves at the base of the inflorescence are sessile and opposite. The flowers are produced in a cyme of 2-5 flowers. Each flower has 5 green sepals and 5 purple to pink petals. The fruit is a capsule with 5 sections each containing a single seed. The sections of the capsule are joined to an elongate column and resemble a Heron or Egret’s head. Another common name from plants in this genus is Cranesbill. The sections of the column curl backwards when the seed are mature and fling the seed some distance. Wild Geranium is a popular wildflower and is often available in the nursery trade. It prefers an organic rich soil with full to partial sun.--A. Diamond  ;
