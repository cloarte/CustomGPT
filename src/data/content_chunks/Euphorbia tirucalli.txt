Probably most familiar as a subtropical and tropical ornamental, aveloz has
recently made popular headlines as a potential "cancer cure" and more
important, as an energy source.  Growing in rather arid zones as well as more
mesophytic zones, the species makes a good living fence post.  A large shrub,
Euphorbia tirucalli,
is used as a hedge in Brazil.  According to Calvin,
these plants grow well in dry regions or land that is not suitable for growing
food.  He estimates that the plants might be capable of producing between 10
and 50 barrels of oil per acre.  Cut near the ground, they would be run through
a mill like a cane crushing mill, while the plants would regrow from the
stumps.  Crude obtained from these plants would run $3.00 to $10.00 per barrel.
Calvin discussed this concept with Petrobas, the Brazilian national petroleum
company, which is investigating.  Calvin's most exciting statement, if true,
would be a boon to Brazil and the United States.  "He estimates, assuming a
yield of 40 barrels per acre (100 barrels per hectare) that an area the size of
Arizona would be necessary to meet current requirements for gasoline" (in the
U.S.).  (Science 194: 46, 1976).  The latex is toxic to

Arizona would be necessary to meet current requirements for gasoline" (in the
U.S.).  (Science 194: 46, 1976).  The latex is toxic to fish and rats.
Africans regard the tree as a mosquito repellent.  In Ganjium, rice boiled with
the latex is used as an avicide.  Aqueous wood extracts are antibiotic against
Staphylococcus aureus
.  The wood, weighing 34 pounds per cu. ft., is
used for rafters, toys, and veneer.  The charcoal derived therefrom can be used
in gun powder.  Since the latex contains rubber, whole plant harvesting seems
most advisable from an energy point-of-view (if the tree coppices well) with
rubber, petroleum, alcohol as energy products, and resins, which may find use
in the linoleum, oil skin, and leather industries.  In Brazil,
Euphorbia
gymnoclada,
very similar to
tirucalli
(both are called aveloz), is
much used for firewood.  One cu. m. of wood yields 2 kg latex with the fibrous
residue usable for paper pulp.

E. tirucalli,
known as aveloz, have local notoriety as cancer "cures," and
often find their way into the U.S. press as cancer cures.  I fear they are more
liable to cause than cure cancer.  Still the following types of cancer are
popularly believed in Brazil to be alleviated by aveloz: cancer, cancroids,
epitheliomas, sarcomas, tumors, and warts.  Hartwell (1969) mentions
E.
tirucalli
as a "folk remedy" for cancers, excrescences, tumors, and warts
in such diverse places as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malabar and Malaya.  The
rubefacient, vesicant latex is used as an application for asthma, cough,
earache, neuralgia, rheumatism, toothache, and warts in India.  In small doses
it is purgative, but in large doses it is an acrid irritant, and emetic.  A

decoction of the tender branches as also that of the root is administered in
colic and gastralgia.  The ashes are applied as caustic to open abscesses.  In
Tanganyika, the latex is used for sexual impotence (but users should recall
"the latex produces so intense a reaction ... as to produce temporary blindness
lasting for several days."  In Zimbabwe, one African male is said to have died
of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis after swallowing the latex to cure sterility.)
The root is used as an emetic for snakebite.  In Malabar and the Moluccas, the
latex is used as an emetic and antisyphilitic.  In Malaya, the stems are boiled
for fomenting painful places.  The pounded stem is applied to scurf and
swelling.  In the Dutch Indies, pounded stems are used as a poultice for
extracting thorns.  The root infusion is used for aching bones, a poultice of
the root or leaves for nose ulcers and hemorrhoids.  The wood decoction is used
for leprosy and for paralysis of the hands and feet following childbirth.
Javanese use the latex for skin complaints and rub the latex over the skin for
bone fractures.

The latex contains 53.8–79.9% water and water solubles and 2.8–3.8% caoutchouc.

Ecology
Ranging from Tropical Thorn to Moist through Subtropical Thorn to Moist Forest
Life Zones, the milkbush is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 2.5 to
40 dm (mean of 6 cases = 11), and estimated to tolerate annual temperature of
21 to 28°C, and pH of 6 to 8.5.  Calvin suggests that it grows well where
annual precipitation is 2.5 to 5 dm and where there is no frost.  Ive seen it
as a cultivar in almost every tropical site I have visited.
Cultivation
According to Melvin Calvin,
Euphorbia tirucalli
"will grow in the same
soils sugarcane will grow in, even without irrigation" (Gogerty, 1977).  Calvin
notes that 5 cm cuttings take readily and increased one-thousand fold in one
growing season, attaining more than 50 cm height in the first growing season
(Calvin, 1980).

notes that 5 cm cuttings take readily and increased one-thousand fold in one
growing season, attaining more than 50 cm height in the first growing season
(Calvin, 1980).
Harvesting
Harvested in 1978, the 5 cm cuttings that grew to more than 50 cm, weighed
roughly 2 kg and produced the equivalent of 15 barrels of oil per acre.  It
could be mowed, or possibly after reaching full size, tapped (Calvin, 1980).
For energy purposes, Calvin suggests they be "cut near the ground and run
through a crushing mill in much the same fashion as if done with sugarcane...
The plants themselves would regrow from the stumps, so replanting might be
necessary only once every 20 years or so."  (Maugh, 1976).
Yields and Economics
As early as 1941, French scientists (Steinheil, 1941) reported yields of 3 MT
oil per hectare from a similar Moroccan species,
Euphorbia resinifera
(10,000 liters latex/ha).  In 1976, Calvin "optimistically estimates that the
cost of crude hydrocarbons obtained in this manner would be somewhere between
$13 and $10 per barrel.  The oil furthermore, would be practically free of
sulphur and other contaminants." (Maugh, 1976).  California associates of
Calvin have since projected $150 to $200 per barrel for
Euphorbia
oil.
Philip Leakey, from Kenya, claims to be getting 400 MT biomass (fresh weight =
85% moisture) per ha in Kenyan areas with a rainfall of ca 20 inches per year.

Philip Leakey, from Kenya, claims to be getting 400 MT biomass (fresh weight =
85% moisture) per ha in Kenyan areas with a rainfall of ca 20 inches per year.
I can see 60 MT DM in a several year old stand but do not think Dr. Leakey
meant to imply that these were annual yields.  Leakey claims to be getting,
now, 20 MT/ha charcoal from similar plantations, renewably.  Such figures, if
replicated, should be very encouraging to arid land inhabitants (Philip Leakey,
personal communication, September 28, 1981).
Energy
Back in 1976, Melvin Calvin was quoted as saying the plants might be capable of
producing 10 and 50 barrels of oil per acre per year (Maugh, 1976).  Back in
1977, Melvin Calvin was quoted as saying, "A cultivated field would yield the
equivalent of 2 to 20 barrels of crude oil per acre per year, possibly for as
little as $3 per barrel.  OPEC oil costs three times that much." (Gogerty,
1977).  Back in 1979, Calvin was quoted as saying the growth was 1,000 fold
when 5 cm cuttings were inserted in the field.  Calculations by a Japanese
firm, based on plantings in Okinawa, showed the possibility of producing 5–10
barrels of oil per acre per year.  Calvin (1980), however, quotes these same
sources as 10–20 barrels per acre.
