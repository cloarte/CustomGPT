 Invasion: The height of C. iria plants varies from 8 to 60 cm. The roots are numerous, short and yellowish-red. The culms are tufted, triangular, glabrous, green and 0.6-3.0 mm thick. The leaves are linear-lanceolate, usually all shorter than the culm, 1-8 mm wide, flat, and scabrid on the margin and major ribs; leaf sheaths are green to reddish-brown, membraneous and envelope the culm at the base. The inflorescence is simple or compound, usually open, 1-20 cm long and 1-20 cm wide, with groups of spikes which are either sessile or on 0.5-15.0 cm long peduncles (rays). Inflorescence bracts (involucre) are leafy, three to five (occasionally seven), the lower one longer than the inflorescence, 5-30 cm long, 1-6 mm wide. The spikes are sessile or almost so, elongate, and rather dense. Spikelets are erect-spreading, crowded, 6-24-flowered, 2-13 mm long, 1.5-2.0 mm wide, golden to yellowish-green. Glumes are broad-ovate,

Spikelets are erect-spreading, crowded, 6-24-flowered, 2-13 mm long, 1.5-2.0 mm wide, golden to yellowish-green. Glumes are broad-ovate, 1.0-1.6 mm long, golden-brown. There are two or three stamens. The style is 3-branched. The fruit is a small achene (nutlet), 1.0-1.5 mm long, 0.6-0.7 mm wide, obovate, triangular in cross section, dark-brown to almost black; the surface is almost smooth. These descriptions are based onHaines and Lye (1983)andHolm et al. (1977).

 Reproduccion: C. iria is an annual sedge, sometimes behaving as a perennial. It propagates from seed (achenes or nutlets); a large plant can produce up to 5000 progeny ( Holm et al., 1977 ). Forty percent of fresh seeds can germinate immediately and most dormant seeds can germinate only following a short period of after-ripening ( Chozin and Nakagawa, 1988 ). Storage in darkness at low temperature, or in submerged soil, causes seeds to enter secondary dormancy. Light is required for optimum germination but germination in darkness, in upland soil, can be stimulated by alternating temperatures (20/35°C). Seeds of C. iria germinate at 15-40°C but an alternating temperature regime of 20/30°C is optimum. Seeds germinate well on the soil surface but few emerge from depths below 1 cm ( Chozin and Nak

Seeds germinate well on the soil surface but few emerge from depths below 1 cm ( Chozin and Nakagawa, 1988 ). C. iria is somewhat less able to germinate under water than C. difformis. Civico and Moody (1979) show that it may germinate under 1 cm of water but early development is suppressed at depths of 2.5 cm or more.Chromosome numbers vary in C. iria (n=56, 64) and intraspecific variation in genotype and phenotype occurs ( Bir et al., 1992 ). Natural hybridization can occur between C. iria and C. microiria ( Chozin and Yasuda, 1991 ) to produce progeny of new-type plants of similar dormancy to the parents, showing clear segregation in spikelet characteristics and floret morphology. C. iria has Kranz-type leaf anatomy and, like C. rotundus, has two layers of bundle sheath cells ( Lin et al., 1982 ). This is indicative of C4 photosynthesis which is generally not a characteristic of weeds growing in wet habitats.
