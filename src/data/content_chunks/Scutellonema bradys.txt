Lip region knob-like, offset by a constriction, with a labial disc and 6 to 8 (usually 7) annules lacking longitudinal striations. Cephalic sclerotization strong. Spear well developed with large oval to rounded basal knobs bearing flattened, indented or irregular anterior surfaces; anterior tapering portion a little less than half spear length.

Oesophageal glands elongate, overlapping intestine dorsally and dorso-laterally; nucleus of dorsal gland anterior to those of subventrals. Ovaries paired, with oocytes in 1 or 2 rows. Spermathecae rounded, sometimes oval, usually packed with sperms. Vulva a transverse slit with conspicuous cuticular thickenings towards ends (? = 'vaginal glands' ofSher, 1964). Epiptygma inconspicuous. Intestine partially overlapping rectum. Tail variable with obtusely rounded striated terminus and 13 - 20 annules. Phasmids about 4 µm diameter, with pore-like aperture, at or up to 6 annules anterior to anal level (Siddiqi, 1972).Male: Abundant. Similar to female except for sexual dimorphism. Testis outstretched; spermagonia in 3-4 rows; sperms about 4 µm in diameter. Bursa large, crenate, enclosing tail. Spicules slightly cephalated and ventrally arcuate, with large distal flanges. Capitulum (= telamon) prominent, about 10 µm long. Phasmids usually just postanal. Cuticular, non-protoplasmic terminal portion of tail 11-16 µm long (Siddiqi, 1972).

 Reproduccion: S. bradys is a migratory endoparasite of roots and tubers and will also be present in soils around host plants. In yams, S. bradys invades the young, developing tubers through the tissues of the tuber growing point, alongside emerging roots and shoots, through roots and also through cracks or damaged areas in the tuber skin ( Bridge, 1972 ). Nematodes feed intracellularly in yam tuber tissues resulting in rupture of cell walls, loss of cell contents and the formation of cavities ( Goodey, 1935 ; Bridge, 1973 ; Adesiyan et al., 1975a ). They are mainly confined to the sub-dermal, peridermal and underlying parenchymatous tissues in the outer 1-2 cm of tuber. S. bradys continues to feed and reproduce in yams stored after harvesting. Populations can increase 9 to 14-fold in D. rotundata tubers over a 5 to 6 month storage period, and 5 to 8-fold in D. alata and D. cayenensis respectively over the same period ( Bridge, 1973 ; Adesiyan, 1977 ). In tubers with partial dry rot, more nematodes are found in the oldest, apical portions, adjacent to the stems ( Adesiyan, 1977 ).
 Sintomas: S. bradys causes a characteristic disease of yam (Dioscorea spp.) tubers known as 'dry rot disease'. Dry rot of yams occurs in the outer 1 to 2 cm of tubers directly associated with S. bradys. The initial stage of dry rot consists of cream and light-yellow lesions below the outer skin of the tuber.

 Sintomas: S. bradys causes a characteristic disease of yam (Dioscorea spp.) tubers known as 'dry rot disease'. Dry rot of yams occurs in the outer 1 to 2 cm of tubers directly associated with S. bradys. The initial stage of dry rot consists of cream and light-yellow lesions below the outer skin of the tuber. There are no external symptoms at this stage. As the disease progresses it spreads into the tuber, normally to a maximum depth of 2 cm but sometimes deeper. In these later stages of dry rot, infected tissues first become light brown and then turn dark brown to black. External cracks appear in the skin of the tubers and parts can flake off exposing patches of dark brown, dry rot tissues. The most severe symptoms of dry rot are seen in mature tubers especially during storage when it is often associated with general decay of tubers. No foliar symptoms have been observed on yams growing in soil infested with S. bradys (after Jatala and Bridge, 1990 ).
