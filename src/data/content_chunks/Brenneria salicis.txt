 Invasion: B. salicis is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, non-sporing rod, motile with peritrichous flagella. Colonies on nutrient agar are 1-2 mm diameter after 4 days at 20°C, transparent to white, circular, convex and shining.Many isolates, although not those from the Netherlands, produce yellow growth on autoclaved potato tissue.
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: No encontrado
 Reproduccion: B. salicis infects the xylem of willow. However, from the time of the first investigation of the disease in cricket bat willow plantations of eastern England, UK, it has been realized that, although large numbers of bacteria can be liberated from diseased trees to provide inoculum, the pathogen appears not to be readily transmissible to other willow plants. Attempts to inoculate the pathogen artificially into willow stems, whether via wounds, or through leaf and bud scars, have generally resulted in little disease expression.

, although large numbers of bacteria can be liberated from diseased trees to provide inoculum, the pathogen appears not to be readily transmissible to other willow plants. Attempts to inoculate the pathogen artificially into willow stems, whether via wounds, or through leaf and bud scars, have generally resulted in little disease expression. In studies in the Netherlands, many inoculation experiments involving different types of wounds resulted in about 10% success in terms of symptom development. Disease symptoms never appeared following the spraying of bacterial suspension onto leaf scars in autumn or buds and catkins in spring ( Gremmen and De Kam, 1981 ). Results of this kind have led to the conclusion that the pathogen may dwell in a latent existence phase in the xylem, only developing to express disease under precise environmental conditions. Many trees with such latent infections may never show symptoms. This view is supported by data from immunological studies, which indicate that the bacterium is present in asymptomatic trees, including the coppice stools from which stem material is taken for propagation.In Japan, a study entailing wound inoculation of 2-year-old seedlings of Salix sachalinensis and S. kinuyanagi [S. schwerinii] readily resulted in the development of typical symptoms within a few weeks ( Sakomoto et al., 1999 ). However, further inoculation tests conducted in Sapporo in 1999 and 2003 were not successful and it has been suggested that climate may be a key factor in infection (Y. Sakamoto, Hokkaido Research Center, Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Sapporo, Japan, personal communication, 2004). The idea that much disease dissemination occurs by the introduction of propagating material from several sources is supported by evidence that different strains (electrotypes) of the bacterium can be present in adjacent diseased cricket bat willows.

The idea that much disease dissemination occurs by the introduction of propagating material from several sources is supported by evidence that different strains (electrotypes) of the bacterium can be present in adjacent diseased cricket bat willows. This pattern would be unlikely if the spread of infection from tree-to-tree via aerosol- or splash-borne bacteria was occurring from a single source of inoculum.
 Sintomas: During spring and summer, the leaves on some branches suddenly wilt and turn reddish-brown. These branches die and become leafless. The wood of affected branches and trunks shows a water-soaked brown or red-brown stain in the sapwood that is often restricted to the outermost annual rings but may sometimes cover the whole transverse section. Seriously diseased trees may die. Bacteria tend to ooze from the watermark-stained wood after cutting ( Sakomoto et al., 1999 ). Sometimes recovery shoots develop on the affected branches but these often become affected subsequently.
