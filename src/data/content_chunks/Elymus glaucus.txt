This wild-rye is a perennial bunchgrass native throughout the Western States.It grows in small tufts, reaching up to 5 feet. Leaves are broad and flat, upto 12 inches long. It is abundant on moist soils but will tolerate drought. Thecoarse leaves are relished by cattle, particularly while succulent. It is shadetolerant and gives high yields of pasturage or of good hay if cut early. It ispropagated by seeds but has not been widely planted.
