What is bovine babesiosis? 
• Bov
ine babesiosis is caused by Babesia bovis
and Babesia bigemina. These are protozoal
blood cell parasites that mainly infect cattle.
• Other
 wild and domestic animals have shown to
be infected by PCR (testing for DNA) but do not
seem to be sources (reservoirs) for new
infections. These may include bison, water
buffalo, nilgai, and some species of deer.
• Bov
ine babesiosis has many other names
including Texas fever, Redwater, Tick Fever,
and Cattle Fever.
• B. bov
is and B. bigemina are transmitted by
ticks, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and
Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (known as
Cattle Fever Ticks (CFTs)). Transmission may
also happen by re-use of needles or during
transfusions.
• Si
gns of infection can be seen 2-3 weeks after
a tick bite. They normally include fever, blood
cell death (hemolysis), and anemia. Other
symptoms/signs can include decreased
appetite, weakness, neurological and
respiratory distress, and abortion.
• Sy
mptoms such as anemia, may cause 
mucous membranes to turn yellowish or 
pale in color.  
• Uri
ne may turn dark or red (Redwater). A
diagnostic test is required to confirm the
presence of these pathogens.
• Cattl
e of all ages can be infected and

• Uri

presence of these pathogens.
• Cattl
e of all ages can be infected and
become ill, and disease severity usually
increases with age. Many animals become
lifetime carriers after infection.
• B. bov
is and B. bigemina can be treated by
using antiparasitics.
• B. bov
is and B. bigemina do not seem to be
human pathogens. CFTs will bite but do not
normally feed successfully on humans.
D
istribution of Bovine Babesiosis
• Throughout the world, bovine babesiosis
can be found in tropical and subtropical
areas. In these areas, it can be a major
constraint to cattle production.
• Bovine babesiosis was once enzootic
throughout the southern United States.
Efforts to eradicate the ticks have pushed
CFT (and possible babesiosis) to a
permanent quarantine zone on the border of
Mexico in South Texas. Babesiosis and
CFT are endemic in Mexico.
Pasture Management and Tick
Control
You can help control the spread of bovine
babesiosis by:
• Modifying tick habitat - keep grasses cut
short and remove weeds and brush from
grazing areas.

• Restricting cattle from grazing in heavily tick-
infested pastures to reduce tick exposure.   
 
• Routinely using Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) approved insecticide treatments (products 
that kill ticks and flies) on animals, vegetation, and 
equipment. Use Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved drugs for tick management on 
animals. 
 
• Regularly inspecting cattle for ticks. Ticks can be 
found especially in the ears, under the tail area, 
between the hind legs, and in udder skin folds.  
 
• Closely checking the health and tick status of all 
newly introduced animals. 
 
Biosecurity practices 
 
• Protect yourself from ticks or flies by using insect 
repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil 
of lemon or eucalyptus, para-menthane diol, or 2-
undecanone. 
 
• When handling livestock, do not use farm medical 
instruments like needles on multiple animals. 
Thoroughly clean and sanitize tools and devices 
before and after use on each animal.  
 
• Clean, treat, and sanitize equipment before 
moving off CFT infested premises. 
 
• If you suspect Babesia infection, experience 
livestock losses, or observe other conditions such 
as signs of anemia, report these to a local

Report Suspicious Cases 
Suspect cases should be reported to your State 
Animal Health Official.
