 Reproduccion: Rice After sowing, anabiotic A. besseyi rapidly become active and are attracted to meristematic areas. During early growth, it is found in low numbers within the innermost leaf sheath, feeding ectoparasitically around the apical meristem (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b; Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). The main stem is frequently more infected than subsequent tillers ( Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ). A rapid increase in nematode numbers takes place at later tillering ( Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ) and is associated with the reproductive phase of plant growth ( Huang and Huang, 1972 ). Nematodes are able to enter spikelets before anthesis, within the boot, and feed ectoparasitically on the ovary, stamens, lodicules and embryo ( Dastur, 1936 ; Huang and Huang, 1972 ). However, A. besseyi is more abundant on the outer surface of the glumes and enters when these separate at anthesis (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b). As grain filling and maturation proceed, reproduction of the nematode ceases, although the development of J3 to adult continues until the hard dough stage ( Huang and Huang, 1972 ).

ii and Yamamoto, 1950b). As grain filling and maturation proceed, reproduction of the nematode ceases, although the development of J3 to adult continues until the hard dough stage ( Huang and Huang, 1972 ). The population of anabiotic nematodes is predominantly adult females ( Huang et al., 1979 ). These nematodes coil and aggregate in the glume axis. More nematodes occur in filled grain than in sterile spikelets (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b) and infected grain tends to occur more towards the middle of the panicle ( Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ). A. besseyi is amphimictic ( Huang et al., 1979 ) and males are usually abundant, however, reproduction can be parthenogenetic. The optimum temperature for oviposition and hatching is 30°C. At 30°C the life cycle is 10±2 days and lengthens significantly at temperatures <20°C (Huang et al., 1972). No development occurs below 13°C ( Sudakova, 1968 ). A. besseyi aggregate in the glume axis of maturing grain and slowly desiccate as kernel moisture is lost. They become anabiotic and are able to survive for 8 months to 3 years after harvest ( Cralley, 1949 ; Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b; Todd, 1952 ; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). Survival is enhanced by aggregation and a slow rate of drying ( Huang and Huang, 1974 ), but the number (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b; Sivakumar, 1987a ) and infectivity ( Cralley and French, 1952 ) of nematodes is reduced as seed age increases.

A. besseyi is not thought to survive long periods in soil between crops ( Cralley and French, 1952 ; Yamada et al., 1953 ) although anabiotic nematodes may survive on rice husks and plant debris. Sivakumar (1987b) found A. besseyi reproducing on Curvularia and Fusarium in straw after harvest. The principal dispersal method for A. besseyi is seed. It can be transmitted in flood water in lowland rice ( Tamura and Kegasawa, 1958 ) but the survival of nematodes in water decreases as temperature increases from 20 to 30°C ( Tamura and Kegasawa, 1958 ). High seeding rates in infected seed beds facilitates local dispersal ( Kobayashi and Sugiyama, 1977 ). Strawberry A. besseyi is a foliar pest of strawberry and may be found between leaves in buds. The nematode has rapid life cycles (2-3 weeks) and thrive in moist conditions which enable them to move over plant surfaces in water films ( Brown et al., 1993 ).
 Sintomas: RicePlants susceptible to A. besseyi can be symptomless but yield loss only occurs in plants showing some symptoms. During early growth, the most conspicuous symptom is the emergence of the chlorotic tips of new leaves from the leaf sheath. These tips later dry and curl, whilst the rest of the leaf may appear normal. The young leaves of infected tillers can be speckled with a white splash pattern or have distinct chlorotic areas. Leaf margins may be distorted and wrinkled but leaf sheaths are symptomless.The viability of A. besseyi infected seed is lowered and germination is

 leaves from the leaf sheath. These tips later dry and curl, whilst the rest of the leaf may appear normal. The young leaves of infected tillers can be speckled with a white splash pattern or have distinct chlorotic areas. Leaf margins may be distorted and wrinkled but leaf sheaths are symptomless.The viability of A. besseyi infected seed is lowered and germination is delayed (Tamura and Kegasawa, 1959b) and diseased plants have reduced vigour and height ( Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). Infected panicles are shorter, with fewer spikelets and a smaller proportion of filled grain ( Dastur, 1936 ; Yoshii, 1951 ; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ).In severe infections, the shortened flagleaf is twisted and can prevent the complete extrusion of the panicle from the boot (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950a; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). The grain is small and distorted ( Todd and Atkins, 1958 ) and the kernel may be discoloured and cracked ( Uebayashi et al., 1976 ). Infected plants mature late and have sterile panicles borne on tillers produced from high nodes.StrawberryA. besseyi is a foliar pest of strawberry and may be found between leaves and buds. Aphelenchoides spp. cause distortion of the leaves which is more noticeable on newly formed leaves after growth resumes in spring in areas of the USA, south of Virginia and Arkansas, and also in Australia ( Brown et al., 1993 ).

ivakumar, 1987a ) and infectivity ( Cralley and French, 1952 ) of nematodes is reduced as seed age increases. It is ironic that good seed storage conditions probably prolong nematode survival. A. besseyi is not thought to survive long periods in soil between crops ( Cralley and French, 1952 ; Yamada et al., 1953 ) although anabiotic nematodes may survive on rice husks and plant debris. Sivakumar (1987b) found A. besseyi reproducing on Curvularia and Fusarium in straw after harvest. The principal dispersal method for A. besseyi is seed. It can be transmitted in flood water in lowland rice ( Tamura and Kegasawa, 1958 ) but the survival of nematodes in water decreases as temperature increases from 20 to 30°C ( Tamura and Kegasawa, 1958 ). High seeding rates in infected seed beds facilitates local dispersal ( Kobayashi and Sugiyama, 1977 ). Strawberry A. besseyi is a foliar pest of strawberry and may be found between leaves in buds. The nematode has rapid life cycles (2-3 weeks) and thrive in moist conditions which enable them to move over plant surfaces in water films ( Brown et al., 1993 ).
 Sintomas: RicePlants susceptible to A. besseyi can be symptomless but yield loss only occurs in plants showing some symptoms. During early growth, the most conspicuous symptom is the emergence of the chlorotic tips of new leaves from the leaf sheath. These tips later dry and curl, whilst the rest of the leaf may appear normal. The young leaves of infected tillers can be speckled with a white splash pattern or have distinct chlorotic areas. Leaf margins may be distorted and wrinkled but leaf sheaths are symptomless.The viability of A. besseyi infected seed is lowered and germination is

 leaves from the leaf sheath. These tips later dry and curl, whilst the rest of the leaf may appear normal. The young leaves of infected tillers can be speckled with a white splash pattern or have distinct chlorotic areas. Leaf margins may be distorted and wrinkled but leaf sheaths are symptomless.The viability of A. besseyi infected seed is lowered and germination is delayed (Tamura and Kegasawa, 1959b) and diseased plants have reduced vigour and height ( Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). Infected panicles are shorter, with fewer spikelets and a smaller proportion of filled grain ( Dastur, 1936 ; Yoshii, 1951 ; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ).In severe infections, the shortened flagleaf is twisted and can prevent the complete extrusion of the panicle from the boot (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950a; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). The grain is small and distorted ( Todd and Atkins, 1958 ) and the kernel may be discoloured and cracked ( Uebayashi et al., 1976 ). Infected plants mature late and have sterile panicles borne on tillers produced from high nodes.StrawberryA. besseyi is a foliar pest of strawberry and may be found between leaves and buds. Aphelenchoides spp. cause distortion of the leaves which is more noticeable on newly formed leaves after growth resumes in spring in areas of the USA, south of Virginia and Arkansas, and also in Australia ( Brown et al., 1993 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Rice After sowing, anabiotic A. besseyi rapidly become active and are attracted to meristematic areas. During early growth, it is found in low numbers within the innermost leaf sheath, feeding ectoparasitically around the apical meristem (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b; Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). The main stem is frequently more infected than subsequent tillers ( Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ). A rapid increase in nematode numbers takes place at later tillering ( Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ) and is associated with the reproductive phase of plant growth ( Huang and Huang, 1972 ). Nematodes are able to enter spikelets before anthesis, within the boot, and feed ectoparasitically on the ovary, stamens, lodicules and embryo ( Dastur, 1936 ; Huang and Huang, 1972 ). However, A. besseyi is more abundant on the outer surface of the glumes and enters when these separate at anthesis (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b). As grain filling and maturation proceed, reproduction of the nematode ceases, although the development of J3 to adult continues until the hard dough stage ( Huang and Huang, 1972 ). The population of anabiotic nematodes is predominantly adult females ( Huang et al., 1979 ). These nematodes coil and aggregate in the glume axis. More nematodes occur in filled grain than in sterile spikelets (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b) and infected grain tends to occur more towards the middle of the panicle ( Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ). A. besseyi is amphimictic ( Huang et al., 1979

More nematodes occur in filled grain than in sterile spikelets (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b) and infected grain tends to occur more towards the middle of the panicle ( Goto and Fukatsu, 1952 ). A. besseyi is amphimictic ( Huang et al., 1979 ) and males are usually abundant, however, reproduction can be parthenogenetic. The optimum temperature for oviposition and hatching is 30°C. At 30°C the life cycle is 10±2 days and lengthens significantly at temperatures <20°C (Huang et al., 1972). No development occurs below 13°C ( Sudakova, 1968 ). A. besseyi aggregate in the glume axis of maturing grain and slowly desiccate as kernel moisture is lost. They become anabiotic and are able to survive for 8 months to 3 years after harvest ( Cralley, 1949 ; Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b; Todd, 1952 ; Todd and Atkins, 1958 ). Survival is enhanced by aggregation and a slow rate of drying ( Huang and Huang, 1974 ), but the number (Yoshii and Yamamoto, 1950b; Sivakumar, 1987a ) and infectivity ( Cralley and French, 1952 ) of nematodes is reduced as seed age increases. It is ironic that good seed storage conditions probably prolong nematode survival.
