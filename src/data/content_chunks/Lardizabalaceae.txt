Monoecious, rarely dioecious. Stems climbing or twining (erect in Decaisnea); wood with broad medullary rays. Winter buds large; outer scales 2 to numerous; scales subtending leaves persistent, scaly. Stipules usually absent (present and very small in Sinofranchetia). Leaves alternate, palmate or 3-foliolate, rarely pinnate (Decaisnea). Petiole and petiolules swollen at both ends, articulate. Flowers functionally unisexual by reduction or abortion, actinomorphic.
