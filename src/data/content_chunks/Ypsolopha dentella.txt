IMPACT ON ALASKA’S HASKAP BERRIES  
 ISSUE – DEFOLIATION OF HASKAP SHOOTS  
• Haskap (aka “honeyberry”) is an increasingly popular 
cold-hardy ornamental shrub grown for its edible 
berries in Alaska. 
• In May 2022, several growers reported heavy 
defoliation of haskap shoots to the University of Alaska 
Fairbanks Integrated Pest Management Program (AK 
IPM). 
• Little had been known of insect pests on haskaps: 
known management strategies largely focused on birds 
and powdery mildew. 
• Diagnosticians identified the defoliating caterpillar as the 
non-native honeysuckle moth (Ypsolopha dentella).  
 
 RESPONSE  
• AK IPM diagnosticians worked quickly to identify and map 
honeysuckle moth caterpillars across Southcentral Alaska. 
• Diagnosticians evaluated the phenology of the honeysuckle  
moth in Alaska and used that data to inform monitoring 
recommendations. 
 OUTCOMES  
• AK IPM increased outreach focus on awareness of when to 
monitor for and how to identify and manage this non-native  
defoliator of haskaps and ornamental honeysuckles. 
• This work also contributed to a broader understanding of  
the insect pest issues that impact haskap production.
