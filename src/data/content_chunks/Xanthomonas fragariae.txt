 Reproduccion: Residues of infected leaves and crown infections on runners used for planting are sources of inoculum for primary infections. The bacterium survives in the residues of infected leaves, in or on soil, from one crop to the next. In dried infected leaves, kept in the laboratory, the bacterium may survive for at least 2.5 years. Bacterial cells are transferred from residues to young leaves at the beginning of the growing season. From crown infection pockets, the bacterium causes lesions along the veins at the base of the youngest leaves, which develop in the apical crown region. X. fragariae is exuded from primary lesions, and bacterial cells are spread by aerosols, caused by rain and sprinkler irrigation, and transported by wind to healthy leaves. Penetration occurs through the stomata. Infections of the crown occur through local wounds or from affected leaves. During the growing season, several cycles of secondary infections may occur. The bacterium may attack flowers, but not fruits. During epidemics, when environmental conditions favour exudation and spread, X. fragariae may cause systemic infections associated with crown pockets. Systemic infections may arise under damp nursery conditions. X. fragariae is spread locally by splash dispersal. Commercial strawberry runners used for planting may also spread the bacterium. They may still bear old, whole or torn, infected leaves or have crown infection pockets. Moreover, almost invisible fragments of infected leaves may be hidden in the apical crown region or between the roots ( Kennedy and King, 1962a ).

Moreover, almost invisible fragments of infected leaves may be hidden in the apical crown region or between the roots ( Kennedy and King, 1962a ). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of fractured samples showed the bacterial colonization of mesophyll air spaces in the leaf, limited by the vascular bundles and the orientation and packing of bacteria in extracellular polysaccharide ( Allan‐Wojtas et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, flagella-driven motility is critical to the virulence of X. fragariae in strawberry ( Liang et al., 2023 ). Turechek et al. (2023) showed that X. fragariae could survive on corrugated cardboard, cotton balls, cotton cloth, strawberry leaf, sheet metal, plastic, rubber, Tyvek, wood (balsa), glass (microscope slide) and latex (latex glove) but survival rate differed among materials and with storage temperature. All materials were capable of harbouring viable bacteria up to 7 days after inoculation (DAI) when stored at -4°C. The longest survival observed was 270 DAI on cardboard stored at -4°C. At room temperature, cardboard, cotton balls, cotton cloth and strawberry leaf tissue supported small bacterial populations up to 14 DAI. X. fragariae could be found 3 days post-inoculation on plant tissues, i.e. leaf, petiole, rhizome, the heart bud up to the youngest fully expanded leaf and its petiole ( Bestfleisch et al., 2015 ). Kastelein et al. (2014) noted that during the first 3 days after inoculation, bacterial populations of washed off leaves rapidly decreased by at least a factor of 1000, after which populations remained stable until

(2014) noted that during the first 3 days after inoculation, bacterial populations of washed off leaves rapidly decreased by at least a factor of 1000, after which populations remained stable until 14 days post inoculation (dpi), when symptoms first started to appear. Similarly, densities in leaf extracts were low during the first 3 days after inoculation, at a level of 100-1000 CFU/g of leaf tissue. Gradually, populations increased to a level of 10 9 -101 2 CFU/g at 28 dpi. Higher densities of epiphytic populations were found on the abaxial side of the leaf than on the adaxial side during the first 2 weeks after inoculation. Hildebrand et al. (2005) developed a quantitative method for inoculating strawberry leaves with X. fragariae and investigated factors affecting infection and cultivar reactions. Abaxial surfaces of strawberry leaves were quantitatively inoculated with the causal agent using a rigidly mounted spray gun device to examine factors affecting infection. Lesions were uniformly distributed within the inoculation sites, and their numbers increased as the distance between the spray nozzle and leaf surface decreased, and the duration of the inoculation burst increased.

Vandroemme et al. (2013b) published the first draft genome sequence of X. fragariae strain LMG 25863 which confirmed the distinct phylogenetic position of the species within the genus Xanthomonas and revealed a patchwork of both lost and newly acquired genomic features (Vandroemme et al., 2013b). Henry and Leveau (2016) later released the first complete genome sequence of the bacterium. Further genome resources including the type strain LMG 708 T and a X. fragariae strain causing crown infection pockets have recently been published (Gétaz et al., 2017a; Herbert et al., 2021 ; Wei et al., 2022 ). Most of the genomic investigations on strawberry-pathogenic xanthomonads have focused on the virulence-related features differentiating X. fragariae and X. arboricola pv. fragariae strains. The two xanthomonads pathogenic to strawberry showed different integron cassettes ( Barionovi and Scortichini, 2006 ). Structural differences within X. fragariae such as differential plasmid presence and large-scale genomic rearrangements were also observed ( Gétaz et al., 2020 ). As for the genetic diversity of X. fragariae on a global scale, Pooler et al. (1996) indicated that pathogenic strains of the species were very closely related to each other, and noted that the results of RAPD, ERIC and REP PCR were mutually consistent. There was no correlation between DNA amplification product patterns and geographic sites of isolation, suggesting that this bacterium has spread largely through exchange of infected plant germplasm.

There was no correlation between DNA amplification product patterns and geographic sites of isolation, suggesting that this bacterium has spread largely through exchange of infected plant germplasm. Stöger et al. (2008) investigated the genetic variability of 43 X. fragariae strains isolated in Italy compared with 20 representative strains previously isolated in Australia, USA, Brazil, Greece, New Zealand and Italy using repetitive-sequence PCR (rep-PCR) using BOX, ERIC and REP primer sets and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Both rep-PCR and AFLP revealed that X. fragariae strains can be divided into different subgroups. No correlation between DNA amplification product patterns and geographic areas of origin was found. Recently, Smits and Pothier (2018) employed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat regions (CRISPRs) and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) to study genetic diversity of the pathogen. Two major groups and a total of four subgroups were identified within the X. fragariae population. The two main groups were genetically separated before the first X. fragariae isolate was described and are potentially responsible for the worldwide expansion of the disease. Gétaz et al. (2018) , using genome-based population structure analysis, noted that two distinct groups of X. fragariae evolved independently before the species description. Reproductive Biology Xanthomonas fragariae colonizes leaf mesophyll, the top 1 cm portion of the petiole adjacent to the leaf blade, and is occasionally found colonizing xylem vessels down to the middle of the petioles ( Wang et al., 2018 ).

Reproductive Biology Xanthomonas fragariae colonizes leaf mesophyll, the top 1 cm portion of the petiole adjacent to the leaf blade, and is occasionally found colonizing xylem vessels down to the middle of the petioles ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Petiole tissue harbouring bacteria introduced either by direct entry through natural openings or wounds, or by systemic movement from infected foliar tissue, probably serves as a main source of initial inoculum in field plantings. The pathogen overwinters in soil on previously infected plant material and on live plants, including transplants. It can persist for extended periods on dry leaves even when buried into soil. Wolf et al. (2018) assessed the risks for infection of strawberry plants through dispersal of an aerosolized inoculum. Plant infections occurred when plants were up to 5 m distance from the inoculum source, but more frequently in plants wetted prior to inoculation than in plants kept dry. In glasshouse studies, it was shown that under conditions favourable for disease development, spray-inoculation of strawberry plants with estimated densities of X. fragariae as low as 2000 CFU per plant were able to cause symptoms. Pathogen aerosols can be formed during mowing of an infected crop or by water splashing on symptomatic plants during overhead irrigation or rain. Environmental Requirements Environmental conditions that favour X. fragariae infection are moderate to cool daytime temperatures (about 20°C), low night-time temperatures and high humidity ( Maas, 1984 ).
 Sintomas: Typical symptoms of angular leaf spot on strawberry plants are small, water-soaked lesions on the lower surface of leaves. Generally, 1-4 mm, angular, shiny, water-soaked spots appear surrounded by the smallest veins.

 Sintomas: Typical symptoms of angular leaf spot on strawberry plants are small, water-soaked lesions on the lower surface of leaves. Generally, 1-4 mm, angular, shiny, water-soaked spots appear surrounded by the smallest veins. In the early stage, the spots are only visible on the lower surface and appear translucent against the light. They enlarge, coalesce and, after about 2 weeks, are also visible on the upper surface as water-soaked, angular spots, which become reddish brown in colour. They have a shiny appearance and are usually covered by bacterial exudate which, when dry, turns brown and appears as gum-like scales. Spots coalesce more frequently along the primary and secondary veins. The dead tissues tear and break off, and the diseased leaf may assume a ragged appearance. In the most severe cases, crown infection pockets may be seen inside after dissection. They appear as localized, water-soaked zones, frequently confined to one side of the crown. The bacterium has a systemic phase, probably resulting from infected transplants, and is characterized by dying of the crown. Typically, at this stage, there are signs of systemic invasion of adjacent stems and death of stems and leaflets ( Kennedy and King, 1962a ; Kennedy, 1965 ; Maas, 1984 ).

(2008) investigated the genetic variability of 43 X. fragariae strains isolated in Italy compared with 20 representative strains previously isolated in Australia, USA, Brazil, Greece, New Zealand and Italy using repetitive-sequence PCR (rep-PCR) using BOX, ERIC and REP primer sets and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Both rep-PCR and AFLP revealed that X. fragariae strains can be divided into different subgroups. No correlation between DNA amplification product patterns and geographic areas of origin was found. Recently, Smits and Pothier (2018) employed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat regions (CRISPRs) and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) to study genetic diversity of the pathogen. Two major groups and a total of four subgroups were identified within the X. fragariae population. The two main groups were genetically separated before the first X. fragariae isolate was described and are potentially responsible for the worldwide expansion of the disease. Gétaz et al. (2018) , using genome-based population structure analysis, noted that two distinct groups of X. fragariae evolved independently before the species description. Reproductive Biology Xanthomonas fragariae colonizes leaf mesophyll, the top 1 cm portion of the petiole adjacent to the leaf blade, and is occasionally found colonizing xylem vessels down to the middle of the petioles ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Petiole tissue harbouring bacteria introduced either by direct entry through

Reproductive Biology Xanthomonas fragariae colonizes leaf mesophyll, the top 1 cm portion of the petiole adjacent to the leaf blade, and is occasionally found colonizing xylem vessels down to the middle of the petioles ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Petiole tissue harbouring bacteria introduced either by direct entry through natural openings or wounds, or by systemic movement from infected foliar tissue, probably serves as a main source of initial inoculum in field plantings. The pathogen overwinters in soil on previously infected plant material and on live plants, including transplants. It can persist for extended periods on dry leaves even when buried into soil. Wolf et al. (2018) assessed the risks for infection of strawberry plants through dispersal of an aerosolized inoculum. Plant infections occurred when plants were up to 5 m distance from the inoculum source, but more frequently in plants wetted prior to inoculation than in plants kept dry. In glasshouse studies, it was shown that under conditions favourable for disease development, spray-inoculation of strawberry plants with estimated densities of X. fragariae as low as 2000 CFU per plant were able to cause symptoms. Pathogen aerosols can be formed during mowing of an infected crop or by water splashing on symptomatic plants during overhead irrigation or rain. Environmental Requirements Environmental conditions that favour X. fragariae infection are moderate to cool daytime temperatures (about 20°C), low night-time temperatures and high humidity ( Maas, 1984 ).
 Sintomas: Typical symptoms of angular leaf spot on strawberry plants are small, water-soaked lesions on the lower surface of leaves. Generally, 1-4 mm, angular, shiny, water-soaked spots appear surrounded by the smallest veins. In the early stage, the spots are only visible on the lower surface and appear translucent against the light. They enlarge, coalesce

 Sintomas: Typical symptoms of angular leaf spot on strawberry plants are small, water-soaked lesions on the lower surface of leaves. Generally, 1-4 mm, angular, shiny, water-soaked spots appear surrounded by the smallest veins. In the early stage, the spots are only visible on the lower surface and appear translucent against the light. They enlarge, coalesce and, after about 2 weeks, are also visible on the upper surface as water-soaked, angular spots, which become reddish brown in colour. They have a shiny appearance and are usually covered by bacterial exudate which, when dry, turns brown and appears as gum-like scales. Spots coalesce more frequently along the primary and secondary veins. The dead tissues tear and break off, and the diseased leaf may assume a ragged appearance. In the most severe cases, crown infection pockets may be seen inside after dissection. They appear as localized, water-soaked zones, frequently confined to one side of the crown. The bacterium has a systemic phase, probably resulting from infected transplants, and is characterized by dying of the crown. Typically, at this stage, there are signs of systemic invasion of adjacent stems and death of stems and leaflets ( Kennedy and King, 1962a ; Kennedy, 1965 ; Maas, 1984 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Residues of infected leaves and crown infections on runners used for planting are sources of inoculum for primary infections. The bacterium survives in the residues of infected leaves, in or on soil, from one crop to the next. In dried infected leaves, kept in the laboratory, the bacterium may survive for at least 2.5 years. Bacterial cells are transferred from residues to young leaves at the beginning of the growing season. From crown infection pockets, the bacterium causes lesions along

ulum for primary infections. The bacterium survives in the residues of infected leaves, in or on soil, from one crop to the next. In dried infected leaves, kept in the laboratory, the bacterium may survive for at least 2.5 years. Bacterial cells are transferred from residues to young leaves at the beginning of the growing season. From crown infection pockets, the bacterium causes lesions along the veins at the base of the youngest leaves, which develop in the apical crown region. X. fragariae is exuded from primary lesions, and bacterial cells are spread by aerosols, caused by rain and sprinkler irrigation, and transported by wind to healthy leaves. Penetration occurs through the stomata. Infections of the crown occur through local wounds or from affected leaves. During the growing season, several cycles of secondary infections may occur. The bacterium may attack flowers, but not fruits. During epidemics, when environmental conditions favour exudation and spread, X. fragariae may cause systemic infections associated with crown pockets. Systemic infections may arise under damp nursery conditions. X. fragariae is spread locally by splash dispersal. Commercial strawberry runners used for planting may also spread the bacterium. They may still bear old, whole or torn, infected leaves or have crown infection pockets. Moreover, almost invisible fragments of infected leaves may be hidden in the apical crown region or between the roots ( Kennedy and King, 1962a ). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of fractured samples showed the bacterial colonization of mesophyll air spaces in the leaf, limited by the vascular bundles and the orientation and packing of bacteria in extracellular polysaccharide ( Allan‐Wojtas et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, flagella-driven motility is critical to the virulence of X. fragariae in strawberry ( Liang et al., 2023 ). Turechek et al. (2023) showed that X. fragaria

 limited by the vascular bundles and the orientation and packing of bacteria in extracellular polysaccharide ( Allan‐Wojtas et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, flagella-driven motility is critical to the virulence of X. fragariae in strawberry ( Liang et al., 2023 ). Turechek et al. (2023) showed that X. fragariae could survive on corrugated cardboard, cotton balls, cotton cloth, strawberry leaf, sheet metal, plastic, rubber, Tyvek, wood (balsa), glass (microscope slide) and latex (latex glove) but survival rate differed among materials and with storage temperature. All materials were capable of harbouring viable bacteria up to 7 days after inoculation (DAI) when stored at -4°C. The longest survival observed was 270 DAI on cardboard stored at -4°C. At room temperature, cardboard, cotton balls, cotton cloth and strawberry leaf tissue supported small bacterial populations up to 14 DAI. X. fragariae could be found 3 days post-inoculation on plant tissues, i.e. leaf, petiole, rhizome, the heart bud up to the youngest fully expanded leaf and its petiole ( Bestfleisch et al., 2015 ). Kastelein et al. (2014) noted that during the first 3 days after inoculation, bacterial populations of washed off leaves rapidly decreased by at least a factor of 1000, after which populations remained stable until 14 days post inoculation (dpi), when symptoms first started to appear. Similarly, densities in leaf extracts were low during the first 3 days after inoculation, at a level of 100-1000 CFU/g of leaf tissue. Gradually, populations increased to a level of 10 9 -101 2 CFU/g at 28 dpi. Higher densities of epiphytic populations were found on the abaxial side of the leaf than

 to appear. Similarly, densities in leaf extracts were low during the first 3 days after inoculation, at a level of 100-1000 CFU/g of leaf tissue. Gradually, populations increased to a level of 10 9 -101 2 CFU/g at 28 dpi. Higher densities of epiphytic populations were found on the abaxial side of the leaf than on the adaxial side during the first 2 weeks after inoculation. Hildebrand et al. (2005) developed a quantitative method for inoculating strawberry leaves with X. fragariae and investigated factors affecting infection and cultivar reactions. Abaxial surfaces of strawberry leaves were quantitatively inoculated with the causal agent using a rigidly mounted spray gun device to examine factors affecting infection. Lesions were uniformly distributed within the inoculation sites, and their numbers increased as the distance between the spray nozzle and leaf surface decreased, and the duration of the inoculation burst increased. For more information, see Kennedy and King (1962b) , Hildebrand et al. (1967) and Maas (1984) . Genetics There are currently 74 genome assembly and annotation sources available for X. fragariae in the NCBI GenBank database https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/#!/prokaryotes/12281/ . Vandroemme et al. (2013b) published the first draft genome sequence of X. fragariae strain LMG 25863 which confirmed the distinct phylogenetic position of the species within the genus Xanthomonas and revealed a patchwork of both lost and newly acquired genomic features (Vandroemme et al., 2013b). Henry and Leveau (2016) later released the first complete genome sequence of the bacterium. Further genome resources including the type strain LMG 708 T and a X. fragariae strain causing crown infection pockets have recently been published (G

Henry and Leveau (2016) later released the first complete genome sequence of the bacterium. Further genome resources including the type strain LMG 708 T and a X. fragariae strain causing crown infection pockets have recently been published (Gétaz et al., 2017a; Herbert et al., 2021 ; Wei et al., 2022 ). Most of the genomic investigations on strawberry-pathogenic xanthomonads have focused on the virulence-related features differentiating X. fragariae and X. arboricola pv. fragariae strains. The two xanthomonads pathogenic to strawberry showed different integron cassettes ( Barionovi and Scortichini, 2006 ). Structural differences within X. fragariae such as differential plasmid presence and large-scale genomic rearrangements were also observed ( Gétaz et al., 2020 ). As for the genetic diversity of X. fragariae on a global scale, Pooler et al. (1996) indicated that pathogenic strains of the species were very closely related to each other, and noted that the results of RAPD, ERIC and REP PCR were mutually consistent. There was no correlation between DNA amplification product patterns and geographic sites of isolation, suggesting that this bacterium has spread largely through exchange of infected plant germplasm. Stöger et al. (2008) investigated the genetic variability of 43 X. fragariae strains isolated in Italy compared with 20 representative strains previously isolated in Australia, USA, Brazil, Greece, New Zealand and Italy using repetitive-sequence PCR (rep-PCR) using BOX, ERIC and REP primer sets and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis.
