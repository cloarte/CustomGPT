1. Reagent Name: Salmonella typhimurium Challenge Culture 
2. Strain or Source: APHIS, NVSL #102 
3. Lot Number: IRP 596 
4. Fill Date: March 10, 2011 
5. Expiration Date: No expiration date has been assigned to this product because 
S. typhimurium has demonstrated over time to be stable if properly stored. 
Precautions: This reagent is a potential human pathogen that may cause gastrointestinal 
infections. Handle the reagent in a biological safety hood while wearing gloves. 
6. Intended Use: Challenge material for potency testing of S. typhimurium biologicals. 
7. Instructions for Use: For mouse potency tests, use this reagent according to current 
version of Supplemental Assay Method 631 (SAM 631). Rehydrate with 1.0 mL tryptose broth. 
Inoculate 0.5 mL of culture into 10.0 mL of brain heart infusion broth and incubate 16-20 hours 
at 35°- 37°C. Adjust the density of the culture to 57-61%T at 620 nm using a Spectronic 20 D+ 
Spectrophotometer or equivalent. The recommended mouse dose is 0.25 mL of a 10-1 dilution of 
the standardized culture, administered intraperitoneally. 
8. Test of Reagent: Gram stain, biochemical characteristics, and serotyping of the culture

 density of the culture to 57-61%T at 620 nm using a Spectronic 20 D+ 
Spectrophotometer or equivalent. The recommended mouse dose is 0.25 mL of a 10-1 dilution of 
the standardized culture, administered intraperitoneally. 
8. Test of Reagent: Gram stain, biochemical characteristics, and serotyping of the culture 
were consistent with S. typhimurium. Purity testing was satisfactory according to 9 CFR 113.27b. 
Standardized culture diluted to 10-3.8 to 10-4.5 contained 1 mouse LD50 per 0.25-mL dose using 
Harlan Sprague Dawley CF-1 mice as described above. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 1.0 mL of lyophilized culture in 5-mL 
borosilicate vials. 
10. Storage Conditions: 2°- 7°C or lower 
11. CVB Technical Contact: Bacteriology Section, Center for Veterinary Biologics, (515)

12. Origin and Passage History: Origin: APHIS, NVSL, Accession No. 102. No passage 
history is available.
