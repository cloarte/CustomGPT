Clematis vitalbaL. - Traveller's Joy  -Ranunculaceae© Roy Anderson© Alan Hill© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)A perennial woody climbing plant with divided (pinnate) leaves, the leaf stalk twining around supports. Flowers produced in July and August are about 3/4 inch (2cm.) across with greenish-white perianth segments and many one-seeded dry fruits called achenes at the centre. These persist after flowering and are conspicuous because of the long feathery styles.This plant is not native to Northern Ireland but is established and naturalised at many sites (especially in areas where the soil is lime-rich) in woodland, on sand dunes and on quarry waste. On dunes, or in other habitats where there are no shrubs or trees to climb up, it grows flat against the ground.All names:Clematis vitalbaL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
