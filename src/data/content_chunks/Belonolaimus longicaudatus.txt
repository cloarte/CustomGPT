 Reproduccion: B. longicaudatus is a migratory ectoparasite of plant roots. There are three juvenile stages in the soil; the first moult occurs within the egg. The life cycle takes about 28 days and the species is amphimictic. Although an ectoparasite, the exceptionally long spear allows the nematode to feed deep within the root tissue, causing severe damage to the host. The optimum temperature for reproduction is around 30ºC, but the nematode remains active and feeds at up to 39ºC. Light sandy soils are favoured and the nematode is absent in muck or marl soils. The existence of physiological races has been demonstrated and these have differing host ranges ( Smart and Nguyen, 1991 ). The presence of the nematode may overcome

 the host. The optimum temperature for reproduction is around 30ºC, but the nematode remains active and feeds at up to 39ºC. Light sandy soils are favoured and the nematode is absent in muck or marl soils. The existence of physiological races has been demonstrated and these have differing host ranges ( Smart and Nguyen, 1991 ). The presence of the nematode may overcome resistance to Fusarium wilt [Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum] in cotton leading to high crop losses in the field.
 Sintomas: B. longicaudatus feeds ectoparasitically near the root tip and along the root resulting in a reduced root system with stubby side branches and terminal galling. Dark lesions may appear on the outer root surface at the point of penetration. Above-ground symptoms include severe stunting, wilting in dry conditions, leaf chlorosis and, in severe cases, death of the plant.
