 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for E. japonica is 2 n = 34 ( Flora of China, 2016 ). Loquat has gametophytic self incompatibility (GSI) and PCR analysis suggests that the S6 haplotype is responsible for the breakdown of GSI ( Schneider et al., 2011 ). Loquat is a perennial, long-lived tree and orchards over 90 years old remain productive. In China, flower bud differentiation occurs from July (warmer climate) to September (cooler climate). In Zhejiang, China, the main axis of inflorescence panicles differentiate in the beginning of August, secondary axes in the middle to the end of August, sepals and petals in the beginning of September, stamens and pistils in the middle to end of September, and sperm nuclei and egg nuclei in October. The time span from flower bud differentiation to anthesis in November is 3 months. The summer lateral shoot begins to differentiate flower buds in September, 1 month later than the spring main shoot, but anthesis also takes place in November, the differential duration just spanning 2 months. Therefore, flower clusters of summer lateral shoots may be short and small, and should be thinned. Flowering in loquat may extend over 1.5-2.5 months, and fruit normally ripen about 150-200 days from flowering. In Israel, the loquat flowers over a 3-month period, which permits collection of fruit at all stages of development at a single date.

In Israel, the loquat flowers over a 3-month period, which permits collection of fruit at all stages of development at a single date. In New Zealand flowers appear from April to August, followed by fruits from October to December ( Weeds of New Zealand, 2016 ). Trees that are vegetatively propagated will begin to bear fruit in 5 years or less, as compared to 8 to 10 years in seedling trees ( Morton, 1987 ). Eriobotrya japonica has bisexual flowers that are often pollinated by bees. Some cultivars are partially self-compatible. In Punjab, India, Apis dorsata is the main flower visitor. Other species of insects found occasionally included syrphids, houseflies, Myrmeleontidae, Bombinae and Pieris rapae . In India, for some cultivars, it has been observed that cross-pollination results in fruit-set increases of about 10-17% over self-pollination ( Morton, 1987 ). The germination rate of pollen is related to percentage fruit set. There are papillose cells on the wet stigma and conducting tissue in the style, which contains transfer cells and annular tracheids. Transfer cells are also found in locules. Some cells in the inner integument and nucellus have outstanding wall ingrowths. The growth pattern of loquat fruit is exponential, with a rapid growth towards the end of fruit development in spring. The maturation phase is characterized by a decline in acidity, colour development, pulp softening and sugar accumulation and a rapid increase in the fresh weight of the pulp tissue.

The maturation phase is characterized by a decline in acidity, colour development, pulp softening and sugar accumulation and a rapid increase in the fresh weight of the pulp tissue. The fruit produces ethylene at the beginning of the maturation phase. However, the loquat is a non-climacteric fruit and shows no climacteric rise in respiration and no peak of ethylene production either on the tree or after harvest. The fruit does not abscise after ripening but shrinks on the tree. Fruit weight is influenced by the number of days to ripening, heat summation from flowering to ripening, seed number and seed weight, but not number of leaves on bearing shoots. Seed weight is the most influential factor affecting fruit weight. Fruit acidity increases up to 50 days after fruit set and then declines as maturity approaches, resulting in a marked increase in total soluble solids (TSS) and the sugar:acid ratio. In China, loquat fruit growth occurs in three stages and the levels of endogenous growth regulators have been analysed during each stage. In stage I, the stage of slow fruit growth, from December to the middle of February, IAA, abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin are maximal. In stage II, the cell division stage from the end of February to the end of March, ABA declines gradually to a minimum, while ethylene, which appears at the end of stage I, increases gradually to a maximum and then gradually declines. IAA and cytokinin reach a second peak at the end of stage II. In stage III, the stage of rapid enlargement of fruits in the middle of April to fruit maturation, IAA and cytokinin are at a minimum, ABA increases again and a second peak of ethylene occurs.

In stage III, the stage of rapid enlargement of fruits in the middle of April to fruit maturation, IAA and cytokinin are at a minimum, ABA increases again and a second peak of ethylene occurs. Scanning electron microscopy of loquat reveals that the fruit skin is composed of only one layer of cells. The stomatal openings and base of the trichome are surrounded by small, circular, cuticle ridges. Stomatal differentiation is completed before enlargement of young fruit, while trichomes develop up to the initial stages of fruit enlargement. Sucrose accumulates faster than any other sugars at the beginning of fruit maturation and became the predominant sugar in ripe fruit, while sorbitol, predominant during fruit development, is reduced to a minor component in ripe fruit. Glucose and fructose content increases as colour intensity increases. Malic and citric acid levels increase with fruit maturation, and then decrease, with citric acid declining at a faster rate. Traces of tartaric acid that disappear with maturation are found in green fruit ( Janick and Paull, 2008 ). Eriobotrya japonica grows in subtropical and warm temperate climates at elevations ranging from 700 m to 2400 m. In China and India, loquats are grown at elevations up to 2000 m. Loquats are grown on hillsides in Japan to obtain the benefits of good air flow. In more tropical regions, the tree thrives and fruits well at elevations between 900 and 1200 m, but bears little or not at all at lower levels.

This species grows well on a variety of soils of moderate fertility, from light sandy loam to heavy clay and even oolitic limestone ( Morton, 1987 ). It has a tolerated pH range of 5.0-8.0, however, it prefers acid over alkaline soils, with pH 6.0 being optimum. Soil should be deep with good drainage and an adequate content of organic matter ( Janick and Paull, 2008 ; ​ Orwa et al., 2009 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics The chromosome number reported for E. japonica is 2 n = 34 ( Flora of China, 2016 ). Loquat has gametophytic self incompatibility (GSI) and PCR analysis suggests that the S6 haplotype is responsible for the breakdown of GSI ( Schneider et al., 2011 ). Growth stages Loquat is a perennial, long-lived tree and orchards over 90 years old remain productive. In China, flower bud differentiation occurs from July (warmer climate) to September (cooler climate). In Zhejiang, China, the main axis of inflorescence

 that the S6 haplotype is responsible for the breakdown of GSI ( Schneider et al., 2011 ). Growth stages Loquat is a perennial, long-lived tree and orchards over 90 years old remain productive. In China, flower bud differentiation occurs from July (warmer climate) to September (cooler climate). In Zhejiang, China, the main axis of inflorescence panicles differentiate in the beginning of August, secondary axes in the middle to the end of August, sepals and petals in the beginning of September, stamens and pistils in the middle to end of September, and sperm nuclei and egg nuclei in October. The time span from flower bud differentiation to anthesis in November is 3 months. The summer lateral shoot begins to differentiate flower buds in September, 1 month later than the spring main shoot, but anthesis also takes place in November, the differential duration just spanning 2 months. Therefore, flower clusters of summer lateral shoots may be short and small, and should be thinned. Flowering in loquat may extend over 1.5-2.5 months, and fruit normally ripen about 150-200 days from flowering. In Israel, the loquat flowers over a 3-month period, which permits collection of fruit at all stages of development at a single date. In New Zealand flowers appear from April to August, followed by fruits from October to December ( Weeds of New Zealand, 2016 ). Trees that are vegetatively propagated will begin to bear fruit in 5 years or less, as compared to 8 to 10 years in seedling trees ( Morton, 1987 ). Reproduction Eriobotrya japonica has bisexual flowers that are often pollinated by bees. Some cultivars are partially self-compatible. In Punjab, India, Apis dorsata is the main flower visitor. Other species of insects found occasionally included syrphids, houseflies, Myrmeleontidae,

 8 to 10 years in seedling trees ( Morton, 1987 ). Reproduction Eriobotrya japonica has bisexual flowers that are often pollinated by bees. Some cultivars are partially self-compatible. In Punjab, India, Apis dorsata is the main flower visitor. Other species of insects found occasionally included syrphids, houseflies, Myrmeleontidae, Bombinae and Pieris rapae . In India, for some cultivars, it has been observed that cross-pollination results in fruit-set increases of about 10-17% over self-pollination ( Morton, 1987 ). The germination rate of pollen is related to percentage fruit set. There are papillose cells on the wet stigma and conducting tissue in the style, which contains transfer cells and annular tracheids. Transfer cells are also found in locules. Some cells in the inner integument and nucellus have outstanding wall ingrowths. Fruit The growth pattern of loquat fruit is exponential, with a rapid growth towards the end of fruit development in spring. The maturation phase is characterized by a decline in acidity, colour development, pulp softening and sugar accumulation and a rapid increase in the fresh weight of the pulp tissue. The fruit produces ethylene at the beginning of the maturation phase. However, the loquat is a non-climacteric fruit and shows no climacteric rise in respiration and no peak of ethylene production either on the tree or after harvest. The fruit does not abscise after ripening but shrinks on the tree. Fruit weight is influenced by the number of days to ripening, heat summation from flowering to ripening, seed number and seed weight, but not number of leaves on bearing shoots. Seed weight is the most influential factor affecting fruit weight. Fruit acidity increases up to 50 days after fruit set and then declines as maturity approaches, resulting in a marked

 after ripening but shrinks on the tree. Fruit weight is influenced by the number of days to ripening, heat summation from flowering to ripening, seed number and seed weight, but not number of leaves on bearing shoots. Seed weight is the most influential factor affecting fruit weight. Fruit acidity increases up to 50 days after fruit set and then declines as maturity approaches, resulting in a marked increase in total soluble solids (TSS) and the sugar:acid ratio. In China, loquat fruit growth occurs in three stages and the levels of endogenous growth regulators have been analysed during each stage. In stage I, the stage of slow fruit growth, from December to the middle of February, IAA, abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin are maximal. In stage II, the cell division stage from the end of February to the end of March, ABA declines gradually to a minimum, while ethylene, which appears at the end of stage I, increases gradually to a maximum and then gradually declines. IAA and cytokinin reach a second peak at the end of stage II. In stage III, the stage of rapid enlargement of fruits in the middle of April to fruit maturation, IAA and cytokinin are at a minimum, ABA increases again and a second peak of ethylene occurs. Scanning electron microscopy of loquat reveals that the fruit skin is composed of only one layer of cells. The stomatal openings and base of the trichome are surrounded by small, circular, cuticle ridges. Stomatal differentiation is completed before enlargement of young fruit, while trichomes develop up to the initial stages of fruit enlargement. Sucrose accumulates faster than any other sugars at the beginning of fruit maturation and became the predominant sugar in ripe fruit, while sorbitol, predominant during fruit development, is reduced to a minor component in ripe fruit.

. Stomatal differentiation is completed before enlargement of young fruit, while trichomes develop up to the initial stages of fruit enlargement. Sucrose accumulates faster than any other sugars at the beginning of fruit maturation and became the predominant sugar in ripe fruit, while sorbitol, predominant during fruit development, is reduced to a minor component in ripe fruit. Glucose and fructose content increases as colour intensity increases. Malic and citric acid levels increase with fruit maturation, and then decrease, with citric acid declining at a faster rate. Traces of tartaric acid that disappear with maturation are found in green fruit ( Janick and Paull, 2008 ). Environmental requirements Eriobotrya japonica grows in subtropical and warm temperate climates at elevations ranging from 700 m to 2400 m. In China and India, loquats are grown at elevations up to 2000 m. Loquats are grown on hillsides in Japan to obtain the benefits of good air flow. In more tropical regions, the tree thrives and fruits well at elevations between 900 and 1200 m, but bears little or not at all at lower levels. For cultivation, winter temperature should be higher than -3°C and summer temperature not over 35°C. Trees can survive temperatures as low as -10°C but temperatures lower than -12°C can be lethal ( Morton, 1987 ; Hiep and Verheij, 1991 ; Orwa et al., 2009 ). The flowers and fruit of loquat are particularly susceptible to extremes of temperature. Ovules in early fruit are killed by brief exposure to -4°C. The tree requires 1000-1200 mm of rainfall annually and a suitable level of humidity. This species grows well on a variety of soils of moderate fertility, from light sandy loam to heavy clay and even oolitic limestone ( Morton, 1987 ). It has a tolerated pH range of 5.
