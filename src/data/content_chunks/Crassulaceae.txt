CrassulaceaeCandolle景天科 jing tian keAuthors:Kunjun Fu,Hideaki Ohba&Michael G. GilbertRhodiola crenulataCredit: Harvard University HerbariaHerbs, subshrubs, or shrubs. Stems mostly fleshy. Leaves alternate, opposite, or verticillate, usually simple; stipules absent; leaf blade entire or slightly incised, rarely lobed or imparipinnate. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, cymose, corymbiform, spiculate, racemose, paniculate, or sometimes reduced to a solitary flower. Flowers usually bisexual, sometimes unisexual in Rhodiola (when plants dioecious or rarely gynodioecious), actinomorphic, (3 or)4-6(-30)-merous. Sepals almost free or basally connate, persistent. Petals free or connate. Stamens as many as petals in 1 series or 2 × as many in 2 series. Nectar scales at or near base of carpels. Follicles sometimes fewer than sepals, free or basally connate, erect or spreading, membranous or leathery, 1- to many seeded. Seeds small; endosperm scanty or not developed.About 35 genera and over 1500 species: Africa, America, Asia, Europe; 13 genera (two endemic, one introduced) and 233 species (129 endemic, one introduced) in China.Some species of Crassulaceae are cultivated as ornamentals and/or used medicinally.Fu Shu-hsia & Fu Kun-tsun. 1984.
