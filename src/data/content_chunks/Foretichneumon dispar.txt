Flighted Spongy Moth Complex (FSMC) 
    (Lymantria dispar asiatica, L. d. japonica, L. albescens, L. postalba, and L. umbrosa)  
  
February 2025 
Due to population outbreaks in regions where FSMC is endemic, North American ports periodically 
experience a high number of vessels arriv ing with FSMC egg masses. Data from previous years 
indicate that populations could potentially reach outbreak levels in 2025. In addition to obtaining 
FSMC certification, extra vigilance in conducting self -inspection is requested t o prevent a 
high number of vessels with egg masses arriving in 2025.  
 
FSMC is a serious pest that can be carried on ships and cargo. FSMC populations are prevalent in 
some seaport areas in Far East Russia, Japan, Korea, and Northern China . If introduced to North 
America, FSMC would have significant negative impacts on our forestry and agriculture, the natural 
environment, the commerce that relies on those plant resources, and market access.  
 
Vessels must arrive in North American ports free of FSMC and should have obtained pre-
departure certification.   It is vital that the maritime industry and authorities in the United States 
(U.S.) and Canada collaborate on measures to minimize the risk of FSMC  incursion.  FSMC risk 
mitigation and exclusion efforts are a joint effort and a high priority.  
 
Both countries are committed to wor king with industry partners on measures to reduce FSMC 
risk at origin. The shipping industry’s role in promoting and meeting FSMC requirements has

 on measures to minimize the risk of FSMC  incursion.  FSMC risk 
mitigation and exclusion efforts are a joint effort and a high priority.  
 
Both countries are committed to wor king with industry partners on measures to reduce FSMC 
risk at origin. The shipping industry’s role in promoting and meeting FSMC requirements has 
been vital to preventing the introduction of FSMC to North America and maintaining shipping 
schedules. When vessels arriv e without FSMC certification, or when FSMC is detected , 
significant delays in c argo loading or discharging activities as well as  in routine clearance can 
occur, resulting in loss of revenue to the shipping line and associated parties.  
 
Actions 
For vessels that  have called on areas regulated for FSMC  during the specified risk periods, as 
outlined in Table 1, the following measures are required: 
1.  Vessels should be inspected and certificated free of FSMC by a recognized certification 
body.  A copy of the certificate, stating that the vessel is free of FSMC life stages, should 
be forwarded to the vessel’s U.S. or Canadian agents. A certificate is valid until the ship 
calls on another port in a regulated area during the specified risk period. 
2.  Vessels must arrive in  North American ports free from FSMC . To avoid facing re-
routing, being ordered out of port for cleaning and other potential impacts associated with 
mitigating the risk of e ntry of FSMC to North America, crews should perform intensive 
vessel self-inspections to look f or, remove (scrape off) and properly dispose of or destroy 
all egg masses and other life stages of FSMC prior to entering U.S. and Canadian ports.

vessel self-inspections to look f or, remove (scrape off) and properly dispose of or destroy 
all egg masses and other life stages of FSMC prior to entering U.S. and Canadian ports. 
3.   Vessels must provide two -year port of call data, at l east 96 hours prior to arrival in a 
North American port, to the vessel’s Canadian or U.S. ag ent. The agent is to  ensure 
that this information is provided to U.S. or Canadian officials.

*Specified risk period is the time period when there is a risk of FSMC flight and egg mass deposition 
 
We also remind vessel operators to ensure that the vessels are in good repair and decks are clear 
of debris and unnecessary obstacles  in order to allow for thorough inspection both in FSMC  
regulated areas and upon arrival in North America. While in regulated ports during moth flight 
periods and where port operations and safety allow, reducing lighting and keeping exterior doors 
and curtains closed may reduce the number of moths being attracted to the vessel.  
 
Upon arrival in North America there have been FSMC detections on vessels that obtained pre-
departure certification. During the flight period inspection should be  conducted and 
certification issued as close to departure as possible — ideally during daylight hours and on the 
same day as departure. Where vessel departure is delayed post -certification, there is the 
possibility that moths re -infest the vessel and deposit egg masses . Arranging for inspection

possibility that moths re -infest the vessel and deposit egg masses . Arranging for inspection 
and certification services as far in advance as possible and providing two- year port of call 
history at the time of that request allows the inspection and certification body to better 
plan for delivery of the service in a timely manner. 
 
Although we try to align the requirements for FSMC pre-departure certification and vessels 
arriving free from all FSMC  life forms (egg masses, larvae, pupae, adults) between the U.S. and 
Canada, there are differences in port -of-entry processes between the two countries  due to 
sovereign regulations and policies.   
 
It is the responsibility of the shipping lines to meet all requirements for entry to the U.S. and 
Canada, including freedom from FSMC  and other pest s of concern. We strongly urge maritime 
interests to take all possible precautions. For further information on the FSMC  program, please 
visit the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and/or USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service’s websites.
