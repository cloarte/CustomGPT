1. Reagent Name: Escherichia coli Anti-987P Pilus Polyclonal Antibody (987P PAb) 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 534-06 
4. Fill Date: March 23, 2006 
5. Expiration Date: March 31, 2027 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: For use in potency testing of E. coli biological containing the 987P pilus 
antigen, according to Supplemental Assay Method 622 (SAM 622). 
7. Instructions for Use: Dilute the 987P PAb 1:3,000 in cold carbonate-bicarbonate coating 
buffer (0.05M, pH 9.6), and use immediately according to SAM 622. 
8. Test of Reagent: The 987P PAb was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays. The 987P PAb was shown to be specific for 987P pilus antigen, with negligible reactivity 
against other pilus types and non-piliated mutants of E. coli. It exhibits minimal nonspecific 
binding in assays performed according to SAM 622. The optimal use dilution was determined by 
titration using the assay described in SAM 622. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 100-µL aliquots in microfuge vials (lot size 
99.5 mL).

13. Method of Preparation: The 987P PAb was produced in New Zealand White rabbits. 
Each rabbit received six intravenous doses of E. coli 987 at weekly intervals. The first four doses 
contained formalin-killed E. coli 987 (IRP 531-05), the final two doses were live E. coli 987 
(IRP 531-05). Serum was harvested, pooled, adsorbed against three E. coli strains, each 
expressing a different pilus type, including K88, K99, and F41, to remove antibodies not specific 
for 987P pili. The 987P PAb was filter sterilized, aliquoted, and frozen at -70°C or lower.
