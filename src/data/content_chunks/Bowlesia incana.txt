Plant Notes:  Hoary Bowlesia is an introduced herbaceous winter annual in the Carrot family (Apiaceae). It is native to the southwestern United States south into South America. In Alabama it can be found in the central and southern portions of the state. Hoary Bowlesia occurs as a weed in nursery stock, in lawns and flowerbeds, in cemeteries, and in moist to wet woodlands. This species was first collected in Alabama in the 1970’s in Mobile and seems to be spreading. It is an annual with a taproot. It is a low growing plant forming clumps of mats. The stems are decumbent, green in color, stellate pubescent, and up to 2 feet in length. Leaves are petiolate, opposite on the stem, palmately 5-7 lobed and stellate pubescent. The leaves resemble those of some Buttercup (Ranunculus) species. Flowers are produced in unbranched axillary umbels of 2-6 flowers. The peduncles are shorter than the petioles. Sepals and petals are minute and scale-like. The petals are green or reddish in color. The fruit is a stellate pubescent schizocarp splitting into two one-seeded segments. Hoary Bowlesia is resistant to many herbicides and is difficult to control once established.--A
