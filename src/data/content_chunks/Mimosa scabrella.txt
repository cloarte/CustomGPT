Uses
Regarded as a useful living fence post or ornamental avenue tree.  Useful for
reforestation.  It sheds copious leaves forming a good humus.  Makes an
excellent fuel wood.  Though its pulp is inferior to
Eucalyptus saligna
it is promising for printing and writing papers (fibers average 1.1–1.2 mm
long).  Used for coffee shade in Guatemala, where Standley and Steyermark
(1946) say, "The coffee plantations shaded by bracatinga are very handsome, for
the trees are uniform in height, their crowns far above the coffee bushes...
The bracatinga has been much advertised in tropical America in recent years as
a tree suitable for reforestation...until better trees could take its place."
Folk Medicine
No data available.
Chemistry
I find no data on this species.
Mimosa hostilis
reportedly contains the
hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine, and is used in making a beverage which
translates "Wine of Jurema."  Interestingly, this species is called catinga
instead of bracatinga.

instead of bracatinga.
Description
Unarmed tree to 15 m tall, 40 cm in diameter, with sparse broad crown, the
trunk branching shortly above the base; bark whitish, young branchlets
lepidote.  Leaves bipinnate; the pinnae mostly 5–7 pairs; leaflets 25–35 pairs,
oblong-linear, obtuse, stellate, subterminal peduncles ca 1.5 cm long, the
heads about 7.5 mm in diameter.  Sepals glabrous, ca 1.2 mm long.  Corolla
4-lobed, stellate tomentose, ca 3.5 mm long.  Stamens 4.  Pods sessile,
oblong-linear, obtuse, verrucose-tomentose 20–25 x 5–6 mm 2–4-jointed.  Seeds
castaneous, 3–4 mm long.
Germplasm
Reported from the South American Center of Diversity, bracatinga, or cvs
thereof, is reported not to tolerate wet soils which tend to stunt its growth.
Distribution
Native to the cool subtropical Parana plains of Southeastern Brazil although
Standley and Steyermark (1946) have reported its introduction into Guatemala.
Small plots have been established in Argentina, Colombia, Ethiopia, Guatemala,
Jamaica, Mexico, Portugal, El Salvador, Senegal, Spain, Venezuela, and Zaire.

 (1946) have reported its introduction into Guatemala.
Small plots have been established in Argentina, Colombia, Ethiopia, Guatemala,
Jamaica, Mexico, Portugal, El Salvador, Senegal, Spain, Venezuela, and Zaire.
Ecology
Estimated to range from Tropical to Subtropical Moist Forest Life Zones.  Grows
in many types of well-drained soils.  Grows at 2,400 m in Guatemala.
Cultivation
Easily planted by seed, 3–4 seed sown in depressions 3–4 cm deep.  Spaced at
2–3 m.  Readily cultivates in plantations, even at exceptionally close spacings
(NAS, 1979).
Harvesting
Some plantations have been harvested on rotations of only 3 years.
Yields and Economics
May attain 15 m tall in 3 years, 8–9 m in 2 years, and 5 m in 14 months.
Energy
Before the advent of the diesel, bracatinga was grown to fuel Brazilian
railroads.  Although the plant is reported to fix nitrogen, Allen and Allen
(1981) do not cite it as a nodulated species.
