 Invasion: Naranjilla is a spreading herbaceous shrub of up to 2-3 m. The stems are thick, cylindrical and pubescent, and become woody with age. The alternate leaves are oblong–ovate and up to 60 cm long and 35-45 cm wide, woolly and soft. Spines are present in the stems, petioles, midrib and lateral veins, as well as in the upper and lower parts of the leaf blade. In some types, however, the leaves are spineless. Young leaves, stems and petioles have a coat of purple stellate hairs. The primary root (being of sexual origin) is pivotal but the secondary root system is fairly superficial, not going below 50-60 cm.

 Reproduccion: Naranjilla requires light, fertile, well-drained soils ( Martin et al., 1987 ) that are rich in organic matter (ideally >10%). It will grow well in loamy soils or sandy and clay loams. TEMPERATURE In the oriental parts of the Andes this crop does well at elevations of 1600-2400 m with the optimum being 1800 m; the acid type can be grown above 2000 m. At higher latitudes the altitude can be lower. The temperature range for this crop is 16-24°C, with

TEMPERATURE In the oriental parts of the Andes this crop does well at elevations of 1600-2400 m with the optimum being 1800 m; the acid type can be grown above 2000 m. At higher latitudes the altitude can be lower. The temperature range for this crop is 16-24°C, with an optimal temperature of 17-18°C. It therefore does well on the central coast of Peru, which has a subtropical climate with cool winters and not excessively hot summers. This species requires cooler locations than cocona, although both can be grown in areas where the climatic conditions for both species overlap. LIGHT AND PHOTOPERIOD Naranjilla tolerates certain amounts shade. In many cases, especially in the Amazonia, it is planted under partial shade given by trees that are left after clearing the forest. The plant can also grow and adequately produce under full sun. No specific information is available about photoperiodic requirements, but since it flowers almost continuously there doesn't appear to be any. WIND There is not much information on the wind tolerance of naranjilla. Being a rather small plant with a well-anchored root system, it should not be very susceptible to uprooting by winds. However, its large and soft leaves will probably be severely damaged. The chromosome number reported for S. quitoense is 2n = 24 ( Bernardello et al., 1994 ). Hybrids of S. quitoense with S. hirtum , S. tequilense and S. vestissimum have been developed ( Heiser, 1972 ) and currently most ‘granadilla fruit’ grown and commercialized in Ecuador comes from hybridization between S. quitoense × S. sessiliflorum ( Heiser et al., 2005 ).

 S. tequilense and S. vestissimum have been developed ( Heiser, 1972 ) and currently most ‘granadilla fruit’ grown and commercialized in Ecuador comes from hybridization between S. quitoense × S. sessiliflorum ( Heiser et al., 2005 ). Hybrids can be distinguished from the wild form of S. quitoense by the colour of their fruit pulp. S. quitoense has bright green fruit pulp, whereas hybrids most often have yellow or light green fruit pulp ( Heiser et al., 2005 ). All Solanum species have poricidally dehiscent anthers that result in buzz pollination syndrome, where pollen can only be released by particular bee species. This pollination syndrome can be found in about 200 genera of flowering plants ( Buchmann, 1983 ). Naranjilla flowers are hermaphrodite and can be self-fertile ( Martin et al., 1987 ) or show allogamy, depending on insects for pollination. Flowers can have short, medium or long styles, and the last two types can be cross-pollinated. Pollination is performed by insects such as honey-bees and bumblebees ( Paull and Duarte, 2012 ). S. quitoense prefers to grow in humid regions at elevations between 1500 m and 2500 m where the mean annual rainfall ranges from 1500 mm to 2000 mm and the mean annual temperature range is between 17ºC and 25ºC. It is able to tolerate precipitation >2500 mm as well as temperatures up to 30ºC. Across Latin America, this species is planted on virgin soil in tracts where the large trees have been felled and the undergrowth burned off. The remaining trees provide semi-shade and wind protection ( Morton, 1987 ).
