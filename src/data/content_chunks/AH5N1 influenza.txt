U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Research Priorities: 
October 2024 
 
 
Introduction 
The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI A(H5N1) has impacted more than 200 dairy cattle 
herds and led to sporadic human cases in the United States in 2024. So far, human cases in this outbreak 
have been mild, and the virus has thus far not demonstrated the ability to efficiently bind to receptors that 
predominate in the human upper respiratory tract. However, influenza viruses have potential to evolve, and 
A(H5N1) viruses are widely prevalent globally in wild birds. Therefore, continued comprehensive and 
coordinated, multisectoral surveillance across public health and animal health for these viruses in wild birds, 
poultry, mammals, and people worldwide, are critical to determine the public health risk. To control this 
outbreak and minimize its current and potential impacts, we must continue to better understand why and 
how this is happening, and what actions need to be taken to better protect the health and safety of people and 
animals, and keep the food supply safe.  
 
Today, the U.S. Government is laying out its clear set of research priorities to address this outbreak.  
 
Experts from across the U.S. Government have outlined a research plan to continue furthering our 
understanding of the A(H5N1) virus and guide response activities to stop the expansion of the outbreak. 
These priorities will also guide the broader global scientific community.

that have arisen across both animal and human health. For animals, the Agricultural Research Service

 of the A(H5N1) virus and guide response activities to stop the expansion of the outbreak. 
These priorities will also guide the broader global scientific community.   
 
This collaborative, whole-of-government, one-health response is focused on addressing scientific questions 
that have arisen across both animal and human health. For animals, the Agricultural Research Service 
(ARS), as the in-house research agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is the leading 
authority for influenza research in poultry and livestock, partnering with other agencies, academia, and 
research institutions. Additionally, other USDA agencies including Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), the National Institute for Food and Agriculture 
(NIFA), have been working in coordination with sister agencies and in their respective mission areas 
through field investigation and epidemiology, diagnostics, food safety, and applied research coordination 
activities to comprehensively learn as much as possible about A(H5N1) virus transmission and risk factors 
within herds, between herds, and between dairy and poultry premises. 
 
When it comes to human health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is charged with 
protecting public health and the safety of the food supply. HHS stood up a response team of four HHS 
agencies – Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – that is working closely with 
USDA to understand A(H5N1) virus biology, epidemiology, and factors that influence disease pathogenesis 
and transmission, mitigate risk and

Infectious Diseases (NIAID) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – that is working closely with 
USDA to understand A(H5N1) virus biology, epidemiology, and factors that influence disease pathogenesis 
and transmission, mitigate risk and prevent the transmission among both people and animals, ensure that 
America’s food supply remains safe, support preclinical and clinical development, regulatory approval, and 
procure treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics for H5 viruses. 
 
In response to the ongoing A(H5N1) outbreak, the interagency team has prioritized research focusing on the

U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Research Priorities: 
October 2024 
 
 
Introduction 
The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI A(H5N1) has impacted more than 200 dairy cattle 
herds and led to sporadic human cases in the United States in 2024. So far, human cases in this outbreak 
have been mild, and the virus has thus far not demonstrated the ability to efficiently bind to receptors that 
predominate in the human upper respiratory tract. However, influenza viruses have potential to evolve, and 
A(H5N1) viruses are widely prevalent globally in wild birds. Therefore, continued comprehensive and 
coordinated, multisectoral surveillance across public health and animal health for these viruses in wild birds, 
poultry, mammals, and people worldwide, are critical to determine the public health risk. To control this 
outbreak and minimize its current and potential impacts, we must continue to better understand why and 
how this is happening, and what actions need to be taken to better protect the health and safety of people and 
animals, and keep the food supply safe.  
 
Today, the U.S. Government is laying out its clear set of research priorities to address this outbreak.  
 
Experts from across the U.S. Government have outlined a research plan to continue furthering our 
understanding of the A(H5N1) virus and guide response activities to stop the expansion of the outbreak.

These priorities will also guide the broader global scientific community.   
 
This collaborative, whole-of-government, one-health response is focused on addressing scientific questions 
that have arisen across both animal and human health. For animals, the Agricultural Research Service 
(ARS), as the in-house research agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is the leading 
authority for influenza research in poultry and livestock, partnering with other agencies, academia, and 
research institutions. Additionally, other USDA agencies including Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), the National Institute for Food and Agriculture 
(NIFA), have been working in coordination with sister agencies and in their respective mission areas 
through field investigation and epidemiology, diagnostics, food safety, and applied research coordination 
activities to comprehensively learn as much as possible about A(H5N1) virus transmission and risk factors 
within herds, between herds, and between dairy and poultry premises. 
 
When it comes to human health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is charged with 
protecting public health and the safety of the food supply. HHS stood up a response team of four HHS 
agencies – Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Centers for Disease Control
