rochloa, Urochloa panicoides
 Invasion: U. panicoides is a tufted annual grass, with culms 6-60 cm high, sometimes decumbent and rooting from the lower nodes, usually with flowering branches. Leaves are usually loosely to densely hairy with tubercle-based hairs, blades up to 12 mm wide, expanded, light green, margins thickened and crinkled. Ligule a line of hairs 1 mm long. The inflorescence is up to 8 cm long, comprising 2-7 racemes up to 6 cm long; spikelets 4-5 mm long, somewhat flattened, solitary and almost sessile, forming two regular rows; glumes unequal, the lower one-quarter to one-third as long as the spikelet; upper lemma mucronate. Variety panicoides has glabrous spikelets, var. pubescens has pubescent spikelets.

 Habitat: , Cultivated / agricultural land, Managed forests, plantations and orchards, Managed grasslands (grazing systems), Disturbed areas, Natural grasslands
 Reproduccion: GeneticsU. panicoides var. panicoides possesses 24 chromosomes and demonstrates a distinctive karyotype ( Murthy and Basavaiah, 1990 ). Supporting the gametic chromosome number of n=24, meiosis in pollen mother cells was found to be normal and characterized by the regular incidence of 24 bivalents and their regular disjunction resulting in high pollen fertility. Occasionally occurring 2 univalents in var. panicoides and 1 tetravalent in var. velutina were the only abnormalities observed. In all the varieties, the ovules were bitegmic, pseudocrassinucellate and hemianatropous. A single hypodermal archesporial cell differentiates in the nucellus and directly functions as meg

In all the varieties, the ovules were bitegmic, pseudocrassinucellate and hemianatropous. A single hypodermal archesporial cell differentiates in the nucellus and directly functions as megaspore mother cell, undergoing meiosis and forming usually a linear, rarely T-shaped tetrad. The chalazal megaspore forms an 8-nucleate embryosac after 3 nuclear divisions. The mature embryosac is spindle shaped, consisting of an egg apparatus, 2 polars and 3 antipodals. In var. panicoides and var. pubescens the antipodals divide to form 6-12 celled antipodal complex, whereas in var. marathensis and var. velutina they become binucleate and hypertrophied. The mature embryos conform to panicoid type. The results are discussed in relation to the systematics of these sexually reproducing taxa ( Basavaiah and Murthy, 1989 ). Physiology and PhenologyU. panicoides is an annual grass weed possessing a C4 photosynthetic pathway ( Hatch et al., 1988 ). Veenendaal et al. (1996a) studied the phenology of seed production in natural savannah grasslands in Botswana.

Yield traits of regenerated plants and their progenies were superior to those of the mother plants. Seeds of U. panicoides in cotton crops in Kenya germinated in each of the short and long rains and exposure to hot dry conditions tended to break dormancy ( Popay, 1972 ). Seedlings emerging early in the growing season (summer weeds) flowered younger and produced more seeds than winter weeds ( Wilson, 1981 ). In Botswana, it was found that small rainfall events were insufficient to trigger germination of grass species including U. panicoides and that seedling numbers were low on compacted and crusted sandy loamy soils and that these soils were without a seed bank. Seedling survival was positively correlated with seed size with 20% survival of U. panicoides after 100 days ( Veenendaal et al., 1996b ). Lakshmanachary et al. (1988) studied the photosynthetic area (green leaves + leaf sheaths + green stem/plant) of U. panicoides, with variations observed between protected and grazed grasslands for photosynthetic area and density of dominant and other species in the same month and for the same component in different months. The minimum value was in April and maximum in November.Environmental RequirementsU. panicoides is a tropical to sub-tropical species, susceptible to both frost and very wet conditions, with optimum temperatures for growth of 25-40°C.

Seedlings of U. panicoides were generally associated with shaded habitats in Botswana surviving low light conditions, and the relative growth rate of seedlings was negatively related to seed weight ( Veenendaal et al., 1993 ). Nel et al. (1993) classified grass species on the red turfveld of the Springbok Flats Turf thornveld into ecological status groups according to their reaction to degradation, with U. panicoides included in the class 3 stage of degradation, representing the best indicator for severely grazed veld. Surveys by Awasthi et al. (1991) on the vegetation structure and composition of limestone quarries aged between 4 and 8 years situated in Madhya Pradesh, India found that U. panicoides was one of two dominant species at the top of the quarry in spring. Pandit et al. (1991) found that a grazing area in Gujarat, India in a semiarid coastal zone that had been protected from animals for 5 years was dominated by several species including U. panicoides. They also found that seasonal variation in the aboveground biomass corresponded with seasonal rainfall distribution.
