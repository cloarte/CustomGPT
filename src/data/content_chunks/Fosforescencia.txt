 Statement 
Infestations of damaging populations of grasshoppers or Mormon crickets occur periodically in 
arid ecoregions of Oregon, especially basins, plateaus and uplands, in areas of gentle slope with 
minimal shade, that typify many high desert landscapes east of the Cascade Mountains. Damaging 
outbreaks can occur in warm microclimates of western Oregon as well but are less frequent or 
enduring. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) may, upon request by land 
managers or State departments of agriculture, conduct treatments to suppress grasshopper 
infestations as part of the Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program 
(program). The term ‘grasshopper’ used in this environmental assessment (EA) refers to both 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets, unless differentiation is necessary. 
Under the guidance of Section 417 of the Plant Protection Act of 2000, USDA plays a coordinating 
role between Federal agencies, State agricultural departments, and private ranchers to control both 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets. 
Populations of grasshoppers that may trigger the need for an APHIS suppression program are 
considered on a case-by-case basis and are difficult to predict, or to detect and delimit in a timely 
manner during the limited annual treatment window. The Grasshopper Hazard Map, which is 
produced each fall and offered to the public at our program website (www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-
pests-diseases/ghmc), is the best forecasting tool a vailable for predicting locations of outbreaks in 
the coming year. There are limitations to these maps however, such as not catching limited sized

the coming year. There are limitations to these maps however, such as not catching limited sized 
outbreaks (a.k.a. ‘hotspots’), or proximity spillover of projected hazard level from areas prone to 
outbreak, into areas that are unconducive, such as forests or mountains. If the Level IV ecoregions 
of Eastern Oregon in the following table are clipped out of the hazard map, this better indicates 
geographical limits of the forecast grasshopper outbreaks. For hotspots to show up better on the 
other hand, either more survey is required or, such as with Klamath Falls and Lakeview, surveys 
need focus more on problem areas. Currently, survey protocols focus on federal rangeland, due to 
consistency of access and land use, however that can mask a hotspot if survey from such areas do 
not capture what is occurring on nearby private agricultural land.

 Grasshopper Hazard Map of Oregon, based on 2024 survey results, excluding unconducive ecoregions. 
Through adult grasshopper surveys in July and early August, APHIS attempts to forecast areas 
where damaging grasshopper populations may occur during the following year. Land managers and 
property owners may request APHIS assistance to control grasshopper outbreaks because of these 
efforts, a history of damage they have observed and/or as part of a good neighbor policy. The 
estimated potential damage to rangeland resources forecast in the current year is determined by 
spring nymphal assessment and delimitation surveys which are necessarily conducted within the 
limited treatment window when grasshoppers are active in their annual cycle. Typically, there is 
only about one month in a given location to conduct this survey, and any feasible treatment, 
spanning from late spring to early summer, and varying by location, elevation, species and weather. 
The aggregate history of 70 years of grasshopper outbreak surveys can help to inform the public on

areas generally prone to outbreaks, as illustrated in the following map. Even the most prone areas 
do not have outbreaks every year however, and the exact location of outbreaks can migrate from 
year to year, but a general pattern emerges of what to expect over decades. Changes caused over 
time due to survey protocols, land use, water availability or other longterm trends may be slow to 
show up in this aggragate map. One of most impacted areas of recent years, the Klamath and Goose 
Lake Basins, again shows only moderate hazard for example, which is not accurate.

Many areas prone to damaging grasshopper populations are more rural and closely tied to the land 
for economic productivity on average, even for a state that takes pride in these metrics. Harney 
County for example, where most APHIS grasshopper treatments have occurred in Oregon, is the 
largest county by area (10,226 square miles) but has a population which averages less than one 
person per square mile, which is less than 1/40th of the state’s average population density. Such 
areas also typically have a high percentage of public land (e.g., 75% in Harney County), and rely 
heavily on natural resources for economic development and quality of life of its citizens. When 
grasshopper population are at high levels, known as outbreaks, intensive feeding on available 
vegetation can degrade natural resources and negatively impact rural communities, including: 
• Reduction of herbivore capacity, including agricultural livestock and wildlife, 
• Reduction of flowers for pollinators and seed production including for rare plants, 
• Increased soil erosion,

• Reduced water quality,  
• Damage to private crops, orchards/vineyards, and gardens 
• Increased use of pesticides, 
• Public health impacts due to slippery roads, poor windshield visibility, airplane bird-strikes, 
and damage to infrastructure from flooding of clogged gutters

• Reduced water quality,  
• Damage to private crops, orchards/vineyards, and gardens 
• Increased use of pesticides, 
• Public health impacts due to slippery roads, poor windshield visibility, airplane bird-strikes, 
and damage to infrastructure from flooding of clogged gutters,  
• Reduction of tourism, property values and municipal tax income. 
 
Outbreaks also have the potential to continue for many years without diminishment from natural 
causes, such as wildfire, disease and/or unfavorable climatic conditions, which are difficult to 
predict. Benefits of controlling damaging grasshopper outbreaks include the protection of 
rangeland ecosystem resources and nearby cropland from decimating impacts in the current year, 
and reduced potential for continuing damage in subsequent years. The goal of the proposed 
suppression program analyzed in this EA is to reduce grasshopper populations below economic 
injury levels in order to protect the natural resources of rangeland ecosystems, the value of 
livestock and wildlife forage, and cropland adjacent to rangeland. 
This EA analyzes potential effects of the proposed action and its alternatives. This EA applies to a 
proposed suppression program that would take place from May 1st to August 1st within rangeland 
ecosystems of the following ecoregions and counties of Oregon: 
• Columbia Plateau (Jefferson, Wasco, and Umatilla counties) primarily in support of 
potential treatment requests from tribal governments. 
• Blue Mountains (Baker and northern Malheur counties) primarily in support of BLM Vale 
District.

Figure 4. Map of Level III Ecoregions of Oregon and seven counties included in this environmental assessment. 
As discussed in this introduction, many other counties in the state, including significant parts of 
nearly every county in Central and Eastern Oregon, are prone to some level of grasshopper 
outbreaks, demonstrated visually in figures 2 and 3 (as forecast or as shown in aggregate). For that

reason, in previous years more counties were included in the program EA for Oregon. No viable 
treatment request from stakeholders in these excluded counties have been received in past decade 
however, meaning that APHIS has responded to requests for assistance, but ultimately found no 
way to provide program run suppression treatments, due to limitations of authority or program 
guidelines. If a viable request for an APHIS treatment is received from outside the counties listed 
in this EA, a supplemental EA could be produced, or additional coverage area(s) would be added to 
a future Oregon EA for the program. 
This EA is prepared in accordance with the requirements under the National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) regulations

Implementing Procedures (7 CFR Part 372). APHIS make and issue a decision based on the 
analysis presented in this EA, the results of public involvement, and consultation with other 
agencies and individuals. A selection of one of the program alternatives will be made by APHIS in 
2025 and for subsequent years until and unless an updated EA is prepared, for rangeland in Baker, 
Harney, Jefferson, Lake, Malheur, Umatilla and Wasco counties of Oregon. APHIS is aware of the 
November 12, 2024 decision in Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration, No. 
23-1067 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 12, 2024). To the extent that a court may conclude that the CEQ 
regulations implementing NEPA are not judicially enforceable or binding on this agency action, 
APHIS has nonetheless elected to follow those regulations at 40 C.F.R. Parts 1500– 1508, in 
addition to the APHIS’s procedures and regulations implementing NEPA at 7 CFR Part 372, to

B. Background Discussion 
1. Grasshopper Ecology 
Rangelands provide many goods and services, including food, fiber, recreational opportunities, and 
grazing land for cattle (Havstad et al, 2007; Follett and Reed, 2010). Grasshoppers and Mormon 
crickets are part of rangeland ecosystems, serving as food for wildlife and playing an important 
role in nutrient cycling. However, grasshoppers and Mormon crickets have the potential to occur at 
high population levels, referred to as outbreaks (Belovsky et al, 1996), that result in competition 
with livestock and other herbivores for rangeland forage and can result in damage to rangeland 
plant species (Wakeland and Shull, 1936; Wakeland and Parker, 1952; Hewitt, 1977; Hewitt and 
Onsager, 1983; Belovsky et al, 1996; Belovsky, 2000; Pfadt, 2002; Branson et al, 2006; Bradshaw 
et al, 2018). Out of approximately 650 western grasshopper species, only 10 to 15 are recurrent 
economic pests. However, even during “normal” population years, they remove over 20% of 
above-ground rangeland forage annually at an estimated cost of $1.2 billion per year (Hewitt & 
Onsager, 1983; dollar amount adjusted). During severe outbreaks, grasshoppers consume 
substantial forage, which may disrupt the ecological functioning of rangelands (Rashford et al, 
2012). Outbreaks are amplified and exacerbated by drought, as vegetative regrowth is reduced and

 cost of $1.2 billion per year (Hewitt & 
Onsager, 1983; dollar amount adjusted). During severe outbreaks, grasshoppers consume 
substantial forage, which may disrupt the ecological functioning of rangelands (Rashford et al, 
2012). Outbreaks are amplified and exacerbated by drought, as vegetative regrowth is reduced and 
more bare ground provides increased egg laying habitat, especially in areas that might otherwise 
have a layer of thatch or more persistent flooding (Schell, 2023). Clearwing grasshoppers have 
been observed at extremely high levels in Oregon in recent years, likely linked to this dynamic. 
APHIS supports the use of integrated pest management (IPM) principles in the management of 
grasshoppers. IPM is the selection, integration, and implementation of pest control tactics in a 
systems approach on the basis of anticipated economic, environmental, and sociological 
consequences. The economic injury level (EIL) concept is the most widely accepted decision-
making framework for pest management (Pedigo et al, 1986). The basic principle is to determine 
`  
Page | 12 
 
the pest level (e.g., population per unit area) that results in monetary damages greater than the cost 
of treatment – benefit cost ratio greater than one in standard economic terminology.  The 
mathematical formulations can vary depending on the application and data available, but the basic 
formulation for EIL is given by (see Higley and Pedigo, 1996): 
 EIL C
VDK= , 
where, C is treatment cost (e.g., $/acre), V is market value per unit of production (e.g., $/lb), D is 
production loss per pest (e.g., lb/pest) and K is the proportional

 is given by (see Higley and Pedigo, 1996): 
 EIL C
VDK= , 
where, C is treatment cost (e.g., $/acre), V is market value per unit of production (e.g., $/lb), D is 
production loss per pest (e.g., lb/pest) and K is the proportional reduction in loss from applying 
control. The EIL identifies the pest population (e.g., pest/acre) that justifies spending C dollars on 
control. 
The EIL can be used as an actionable criterion; however, given pest population dynamics and 
delays in treatment effect, applying treatment once EIL pest levels are observed may result in 
substantial economic losses. APHIS and our cooperators assess whether grasshopper populations 
are exceeding an action threshold (historically termed the “economic infestation level”), which 
identifies the pest level when treatment should be initiated to avoid an increasing pest population 
from reaching the EIL. The action threshold therefore identifies a temporal criterion to initiate 
management given observations of pest levels, as shown in the following figure. Action thresholds 
can be developed in a variety of ways including subjective determinations based on local 
experience, to objective functions of the EIL.   
 
Figure 5. Diagram of the typical relationship between the economic injury level (EIL) and action threshold (AT) for applying pest 
treatments (Rashford et al., 2012). 
The ‘economic injury level’ is a measurement of the economic losses caused by a particular 
population level of grasshoppers to the infested rangeland. This value is determined on a case-by-

 (Rashford et al., 2012). 
The ‘economic injury level’ is a measurement of the economic losses caused by a particular 
population level of grasshoppers to the infested rangeland. This value is determined on a case-by-
case basis with knowledge of many factors including, but not limited to, the following: economic 
use of available forage or crops; grasshopper species, age, and density present; rangeland 
productivity and composition; accessibility and cost of alternative forage; and weather patterns. In 
decision making, the level of economic injury is balanced against the cost of treating to determine 
an “economic threshold” below which there would not be an overall benefit for the treatment. 
Short-term economic benefits accrue during the years of treatments, but additional long-term 
benefit may accrue and be considered in deciding the total value gained by treatment. Grasshopper

the necessity of treatment.  
While market prices are good proxies for the direct market value of commodities damaged by pests 
(e.g., crops or forage), market prices do not capture all of the potential economic values affected by 
pests. Market prices, for example, can be highly variable over time and space, depending on local 
supply and demand conditions (Rashford et al, 2012).

supply and demand conditions (Rashford et al, 2012).   
2. Grasshopper Population Control 
Grasshopper populations sometimes build to economic injury levels despite ecologically sound 
general land management practices and efforts to prevent outbreaks.  Noxious weeds and erosion 
are linked to grasshopper outbreaks and are actively managed against by agencies that may request 
help from APHIS, such as the BLM, which surveys for and suppresses noxious weeds, especially 
those linked increased wildfire and works to prevent erosion. Many areas they manage are prone to 
cyclical wildfire increased by invasive annual grasses, including medusahead rye, Taeniatherum 
caputmedusae, and cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum. In response major projects have occurred to 
suppress these species and plant cool-season grass species (e.g., crested wheatgrass, Agropyron 
christatum). Grazing is limited seasonally to help protect these revegetation projects which also 
helps to reduce grasshopper outbreaks. Where possible, vegetative thatch and soil biomass is 
encouraged to promote fungal, protozoal and beneficial insect growth conditions to help limit 
grasshopper outbreaks. These efforts can be moisture limited however and compete with other land 
manager responsibilities.    
When forage and land management have failed to prevent grasshopper outbreaks insecticides may 
be needed to reduce the destruction of rangeland vegetation and to limit damage to neighboring 
agricultural operations. APHIS’ enabling legislation provides, in relevant part, that ‘on request of

When forage and land management have failed to prevent grasshopper outbreaks insecticides may 
be needed to reduce the destruction of rangeland vegetation and to limit damage to neighboring 
agricultural operations. APHIS’ enabling legislation provides, in relevant part, that ‘on request of 
the administering agency or the agriculture department of an affected State, the Secretary, to 
protect rangeland, shall immediately treat Federal, State, or private lands that are infested with 
grasshoppers or Mormon crickets’… (7 U.S.C. § 7717(c)(1)).  
Under the guidance of Section 417 of the Plant Protection Act of 2000 (PPA), USDA plays a 
coordinating role between federal agencies, state agricultural departments, and private ranchers to 
control both grasshoppers and Mormon crickets. APHIS accomplishes this by conducting 
cooperative surveys during the early spring and late summer to measure both nymphal and adult 
populations of grasshoppers, respectively. The annual adult surveys can be used to forecast 
grasshopper population levels in the following year. Where outbreaks are common, the program 
selectively employs nymphal surveys to delimit potential treatment boundaries.  
IPM procedures are thoroughly incorporated into the management of grasshoppers by APHIS. IPM 
strategies consider economic, environmental, and pesticide resistance consequences of pest control 
tactics. The primary objective of IPM is to reduce agricultural pest populations below the economic 
injury level. APHIS published a programmatic EIS in 1987 for rangeland grasshopper control that 
included IPM methods as the preferred alternative. At that time APHIS expected the IPM 
alternative would primarily include biological or chemical methods for grasshopper control. 
APHIS would continue to participate in research and testing

injury level. APHIS published a programmatic EIS in 1987 for rangeland grasshopper control that 
included IPM methods as the preferred alternative. At that time APHIS expected the IPM 
alternative would primarily include biological or chemical methods for grasshopper control. 
APHIS would continue to participate in research and testing to identify other feasible cultural and 
mechanical control methods. The program uses IPM principles by selecting a particular control 
method on an individual site after taking into consideration of economic (the cost and the cost-
effectiveness of various methods in both the short and long term), ecological (the impact on 
nontarget organisms and the environment), and sociological (the acceptability of various IPM 
methods to cooperators, or the potential effects on land use) factors.

APHIS uses survey data to inform stakeholders of the potential for economic damage associated 
with grasshoppers. The program also provides technical assistance on insecticides, application 
methodology and cost benefit analysis to equip land managers with information needed to make 
economically and environmentally sound grasshopper treatment decisions. 
APHIS responds to solicitations from land managers to assess, and if necessary, suppresses 
grasshopper infestations. While many stakeholders interact with the program, Federal Land 
Managers represent about 75% of suppression requests. Engaging in grasshopper suppression is 
complicated, and funding, rangeland conditions, environmental regulations, politics and public 
sentiment all impact the process. The need for rapid and effective response when an outbreak 
occurs limits the options available to APHIS. The application of an insecticide within all or part of 
the outbreak area is often the only response available to APHIS to rapidly suppress or reduce

, and funding, rangeland conditions, environmental regulations, politics and public 
sentiment all impact the process. The need for rapid and effective response when an outbreak 
occurs limits the options available to APHIS. The application of an insecticide within all or part of 
the outbreak area is often the only response available to APHIS to rapidly suppress or reduce 
grasshopper populations and effectively protect rangeland (USDA APHIS, 2011). APHIS uses 
several factors to determine if grasshopper suppression is warranted, including, but not limited to, 
the pest species present, maturity of the pest species population, timing of treatment, costs and 
potential benefits of conducting the action, and ecological considerations (USDA APHIS, 2008).  
The site-specific data used to make treatment decisions in real time is gathered in part during the 
limited duration spring nymph survey, specifically pest grasshopper density, species, nymphal 
stage and distribution. Focusing spring survey for cost effectiveness, among the millions of acres 
where harmful grasshopper infestations may occur in the state, is aided by adult surveys which are 
reported out in the fall of the previous year and are ideally analyzed by land managers over the 
winter to provide early notice to APHIS of a concern and request for assistance. As discussed in 
Chapter 1.A. forecasts and tentative plans are limited in accuracy, as may be land managers 
awareness of an emergent outbreak. Section 417 of the PPA requires among other things that 
“Subject to the availability of funds… on request of the administering agency or the agriculture 
department of the affected State… to protect rangeland, [APHIS] shall immediately treat… lands 
that are infested with grasshoppers… at levels of economic infestation, unless [APH

“Subject to the availability of funds… on request of the administering agency or the agriculture 
department of the affected State… to protect rangeland, [APHIS] shall immediately treat… lands 
that are infested with grasshoppers… at levels of economic infestation, unless [APHIS] determines 
that delaying treatment will not cause greater economic damage to adjacent owners of rangeland.” 
Determining if there is an economic infestation and if delaying treatment will not cause greater 
damage to adjacent owners of rangeland requires a complex assessment, often somewhat limited by 
the practicality and cost of gathering a comprehensive dataset. Grasshopper densities, species 
complex, dominant species, dominant life stage, grazing allotment terrain, soil types, range 
conditions, local weather patterns (wind, temp., precipitation), slope and aspect for hatching beds, 
animal unit months (AUMs) present in grazing allotment, forage damage estimates, number of 
potential AUMs consumed by grasshopper population, potential AUMs managed for allotment and 
value of the AUM, estimated cost of replacement feed for livestock, rotational time frame for 
grazing allotments, and number of livestock in grazing allotment are all potential factors which 
could play into such as comprehensive dataset. APHIS is also not a land management or research 
agency, so a reliance on outside partners, such as ARS and the requesting land managers to 
contribute much of this information, is also a legal limitation of mandate. In addition to official 
requests for assistance, APHIS therefore requires whatever justification is available to help 
determine the economic benefits of proposed treatments, if economic justification is in doubt. The

contribute much of this information, is also a legal limitation of mandate. In addition to official 
requests for assistance, APHIS therefore requires whatever justification is available to help 
determine the economic benefits of proposed treatments, if economic justification is in doubt. The 
assessment is aided in Oregon by the fact that 1.) Treatment request typically come from areas with 
a history of demonstrated loses, 2.) Treatment funds are limited, and requests compete for urgency, 
3.) Treatments prioritize areas that have been reseeded or otherwise are considered fragile, such as 
post fire or noxious weed project areas. In Oregon the 2025 surcharge AUM rate is $6.35, which is 
an average cost of AUM between public and private land prices. Such rates go some way in 
justifying treatments on their own, however other factors also contribute to potential upside of 
`

reducing grasshopper outbreaks (as discussed in Chapter 1.A.). The typical treatment in Oregon has 
occurred when grasshoppers are at rates of 30 square yard or above on average, though lower rates 
may still justify treatments. Considerations of suitable phenological timing (i.e. limited treatment 
window) create a hard back stop each year to approval of APHIS treatment programs, also for 
economic reasons, since currently supported program pesticides for APHIS in Oregon are 
ineffective in adult grasshopper control. Adult grasshoppers have already caused most of their 
potential damage for the year, meaning that delay is unlikely to cause greater economic damage.

ineffective in adult grasshopper control. Adult grasshoppers have already caused most of their 
potential damage for the year, meaning that delay is unlikely to cause greater economic damage.  
Although APHIS does extensive surveys and considers the factors described above to determine 
whether treatment is warranted, pestiferous grasshopper species can be found in suitable habitat 
statewide and can increase exponentially over one or two years, making exact location of 
individual requests for treatments difficult to predict. By the time new significant outbreaks are 
first reported in a given year, it is often too late in the annual development cycle of the 
grasshoppers to delimit the outbreak and organize an effective treatment. Response to outbreaks 
may take multiple years of survey and planning, however populations can also crash due to natural 
causes or migrate to new areas, which again makes exact locations of outbreaks prior to the limited 
treatment window difficult to predict each year. For roughly 80% of the year grasshoppers are 
dormant eggs in the soil, with active immature stages lasting roughly one month, and adult phases 
varying by weather and access to sustaining resources. Use of the most ecologically responsible 
pesticides available (i.e., those that don’t kill on contact) has resulted in a shorter effective 
treatment window, typically lasting a month or less, following detection of hatch. In the Affected 
Environment chapter below (III.A.) APHIS does its utmost to predict locations where treatments 
may occur based on survey data, previous and on-going requests for treatments, and historical data 
and trends. However, APHIS cannot predict all the specific locations at which affected resource 
owners would determine that a rangeland damage problem has become intolerable to the point that

be ready to respond to treatment requests on short notice anywhere in Oregon to protect rangeland 
where consistent with applicable federal and state laws, land management agency policies, and 
where funding and resources to conduct treatments are available. 
3. Description of Grasshopper Species in Oregon 
Grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Caelifera, Acridoidea) are important endemic herbivores and 
decomposers of grassland ecosystems worldwide, stimulating plant growth while aggregating 
protein for carnivorous species and providing a significant amount of biodiversity. When 
populations of certain species boom to extreme levels however, devastating impacts on agriculture 
and ecological processes at a landscape scale can result. Rapid loss of vegetation can negatively 
impact rare species of plants and pollinators, decreasing overall biodiversity and abundance, 
increasing run-off and soil erosion, and decreasing water quality (Latchininsky et al, 2011). More 
than 100 species of Acridid grasshoppers have been recorded from localities in Oregon, though 
only nine species during the past five decades have been known to reach outbreak levels that 
threaten crops or valuable range resources. The most frequent economic pest grasshopper species 
of concern in Oregon roughly in order of damage are as follows (with active hyperlinks to ARS

The most widespread and commonly encountered pest species in North America is the migratory 
grasshopper, which is considered a locust species due to its propensity to build to dense 
populations in which they change appearance, improve flight ability to migrate in swarms, and 
march in destructive bands. Migratory grasshopper populations can be exacerbated by agricultural 
practices (e.g., thriving on weeds, soil erosion or over-grazed land, and potentially from lush 
growth in summer from irrigation, or even no till practices). They are capable of forming massive 
swarms flying at high altitude to infest lands miles away at densities of 60-140 per square yard, and 
feed heavily on grains, legumes, vegetables, and ornamentals. The valley, two-striped, red-legged, 
Packard’s, and striped sand grasshoppers can also build up rapidly in areas impacted by agricultural 
land disturbances, but are not considered locusts, having not demonstrated the requisite phase shift. 
Clear-winged grasshopper and big-headed grasshopper have been reported at extremely damaging 
high densities and can be especially devastating to small grains and grasses. These species as well 
as the white-whiskered grasshopper can spread from well-managed, substantially intact native 
ecosystems, such as seasonal wetlands and prairies, into widespread outbreaks devastating to 
agricultural areas. Once in outbreak, populations can continue to build to increasingly damaging 
levels that spread geographically and sustain over several years. (Pfadt 2002)

 prairies, into widespread outbreaks devastating to 
agricultural areas. Once in outbreak, populations can continue to build to increasingly damaging 
levels that spread geographically and sustain over several years. (Pfadt 2002) 
The widespread grasshopper outbreaks of the mid-1980s were comprised primarily of ‘spur-
throated’ grasshoppers in the subfamily Melanoplinae: migratory grasshopper (Melanoplus 
sanguinipes), red-legged grasshopper (M. femurrubrum), two-striped grasshopper (M. bivittatus),

Packard grasshopper (M. packardii), and striped sand grasshopper (M. foedus). Localized outbreaks 
in the 1990s and early 2000s were mainly clear-winged grasshopper (Camnula pellucida). 
Outbreaks beginning in 2019 have included the economically damaging species big-headed 
grasshopper (Aulocara elliotti) and valley grasshopper (Oedaleonotus enigma) in addition to 
species of Melanoplus and Camnula pellucida. (Information provided by State Entomologist, 
2020.)

Mormon cricket, Anabrus simplex (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae, Decticinae), is not a true cricket

attributes with grasshoppers than with members of its own family, the shield-backed katydids, most 
of which are tree and shrub dwelling and uncommon in rangelands. Unlike complexes of

ickets (Ensifera). In many ways this species shares more 
attributes with grasshoppers than with members of its own family, the shield-backed katydids, most 
of which are tree and shrub dwelling and uncommon in rangelands. Unlike complexes of 
pestiferous grasshopper species, other shieldbacked katydids found in Oregon rangeland have not 
been found to cause economic damage, remaining mostly solitary and not reaching outbreak levels. 
Mormon crickets are well adapted to the Great Basin and other arid environments of the Western 
US. Radiocarbon-dating of several hundred Mormon crickets remains excavated from an ancient 
roasting pit shows that they were abundant enough to catch and use for food by Native Americans 
at least 2,000 years prior to European settlement of the American West. Outbreaks of this species 
are like those of grasshoppers in that they are unpredictable and increase over several years, 
however outbreaks typically last longer, up to 20 years or more. Though incapable of flight, during 
outbreaks adults march in dense bands, travelling up to a mile per day. Their behavior and coloring 
is bold, since their abundance overwhelms the appetites of predator populations. In contrast, when 
population densities are low, Mormon crickets are more camouflaged, solitary and do not migrate. 
(Pfadt 2002) 
Feeding damage to crops and garden vegetables can be devastating, and a single individual per acre 
is estimated to consume 38 dry weight pounds of rangeland forage (Pfadt 2002). Mormon crickets 
also present an economic contamination issue for many crops, giving off a rotten fish smell as they 
decompose. Additionally, high roadkill of Mormon crickets can make road surface slick and unsafe

also present an economic contamination issue for many crops, giving off a rotten fish smell as they 
decompose. Additionally, high roadkill of Mormon crickets can make road surface slick and unsafe 
for motorists, which is exacerbated by the fact that, as cannibalistic omnivores, they are attracted to 
the road to feed. Often congregating on buildings in large numbers, they further can become a 
general nuisance to town residents, clogging drains, biting people, and discourage tourism, in 
impacted communities such as Jordan Valley, McDermitt, and Arlington, Oregon. In responses 
from the public, it has been pointed out that each of these remarkably large insects make excellent 
fish bait, or poultry feed, and to some extent entrepreneurs do harvest them for such uses. This, and 
take by wildlife of this resource, however, does not significantly diminish their extreme abundance

and distribution during outbreaks. During a peak outbreak in 1938 for example, it was estimated 
that 19 million acres in 11 states were infested (Pfadt 2002). 
Special programmatic considerations with Mormon crickets include the fact that they migrate much 
more actively than most grasshoppers and also occur in more mountainous canyon lands and 
passes. To date, treatment of this species in Oregon has been far less common than in surrounding 
states, Nevada, Idaho and even Washington. The program is primarily geared towards regular 
grasshoppers, with very few areas where Mormon crickets have been observed being feasible for 
treatment. If Mormon Crickets continue to expand into the SE quadrant of the state or out of the

grasshoppers, with very few areas where Mormon crickets have been observed being feasible for 
treatment. If Mormon Crickets continue to expand into the SE quadrant of the state or out of the 
Arlington area, as has been observed as a possible trend in recent years, a greater focus of program 
strategy and resources will need to be directed towards them. So far, this has been severely limited 
by Sage Grouse protection areas and other special management areas which leave very little 
geographical areas for treatment.  
4. APHIS Environmental Compliance and Cooperators 
In June 2002, APHIS completed an EIS describing the agency’s most effective methods of 
reducing the damage caused by grasshopper populations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, 
Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South 
Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. During November 2019, APHIS published 
human health and ecological risk assessments (HHERAs) for the use of carbaryl, 
chlorantraniliprole, diflubenzuron and malathion by the program. APHIS also published an updated 
EIS to consolidate and incorporate the available data and analyze the environmental risk of new 
program tools. The risk analysis in the 2019 EIS is incorporated by reference (USDA APHIS, 
2019).  
In October 2015, APHIS and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) detailing cooperative efforts between the two groups on suppression of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets on BLM lands (Document #15-8100-0870-

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 is incorporated by reference (USDA APHIS, 
2019).  
In October 2015, APHIS and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) detailing cooperative efforts between the two groups on suppression of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets on BLM lands (Document #15-8100-0870-MU, October 15, 
2015). This MOU clarifies that APHIS will prepare and issue to the public site-specific 
environmental documents that evaluate potential impacts associated with proposed measures to 
suppress economically damaging grasshopper and Mormon cricket populations. The MOU also 
states that these documents will be prepared under the APHIS NEPA implementing procedures 
with cooperation and input from the BLM.  
The MOU further states that the responsible BLM official will request in writing the inclusion of 
appropriate lands in the APHIS suppression project when treatment on BLM land is necessary. The 
BLM must also prepare a Pesticide Use Proposal (Form FS-2100-2) for APHIS to treat infestations. 
According to the provisions of the MOU, APHIS can begin treatments after APHIS issues an 
appropriate decision document and BLM prepares and approves the Pesticide Use Proposal. 
APHIS provides technical assistance to federal, tribal, state and private land managers including 
the use of IPM. However, implementation of on-the-ground IPM activities is limited to land 
managers. APHIS completed the Grasshopper Integrated Pest Management (GIPM) project. One of 
the goals of the GIPM is to develop new methods of suppressing grasshopper and Mormon cricket 
populations to improve non-target effects. Reduced agent area treatment (RAAT) methods were 
developed to decrease pesticide use and provide

managers. APHIS completed the Grasshopper Integrated Pest Management (GIPM) project. One of 
the goals of the GIPM is to develop new methods of suppressing grasshopper and Mormon cricket 
populations to improve non-target effects. Reduced agent area treatment (RAAT) methods were 
developed to decrease pesticide use and provide refuges for non-target organisms within the 
treatment block during suppression activities while reducing target populations below the level 
causing economic harm. APHIS typically employs RAAT methods in which the application rate of 
insecticide is reduced from conventional levels, and treated swaths are alternated with swaths that 
are not directly treated. RAATs rely on selected insecticide to effectively suppress grasshoppers 
`

while conserving grasshopper predators and parasites in swaths not directly treated (USDA APHIS, 
2002). APHIS continues to evaluate new suppression tools and methods for grasshopper 
populations, including biological control. 
C. About This Process 
Activities under the Program are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). APHIS follows the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) regulations 
implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.) along with USDA (7 CFR Part 1b) and APHIS NEPA 
Implementing Procedures (7 CFR Part 372) as part of the decision-making process. NEPA sets 
forth the requirement that all federal actions be evaluated in terms of the following: 
• Their potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment for the purpose 
of avoiding or, where possible, mitigating and minimizing adverse impacts;  
• Making informed decisions;

Implementing Procedures (7 CFR Part 372) as part of the decision-making process. NEPA sets 
forth the requirement that all federal actions be evaluated in terms of the following: 
• Their potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment for the purpose 
of avoiding or, where possible, mitigating and minimizing adverse impacts;  
• Making informed decisions; and  
• Including agencies and the public in their NEPA planning in support of informed decision-
making.  
As previously discussed above (I.B.) the NEPA process for grasshopper management is 
complicated by the fact that there is a limited window of time when treatments are most effective, 
and it is difficult to forecast which specific sites within the area covered by this EA will both have 
requests for treatment and be warranted for treatment to suppress grasshopper outbreaks. As such, 
the geographic scope of the actions and analyses in this EA is Baker, Harney, Jefferson, Lake, 
Malheur, Umatilla, and Wasco counties to account for the wide geographic areas in which 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets occur on rangelands. Then, when grasshopper populations grow 
to nuisance levels, program managers examine the proposed treatment area to ensure that this EA 
applies to the specific areas where control activities will be conducted and can act quickly. At the 
same time, the Program strives to alert the public in a timely manner to its more concrete treatment 
plans and avoid or minimize harm to the environment in implementing those plans. 
Section 1619 of the Farm Bill (7 USC 8791) also prohibits disclosure of certain information from 
agricultural producers who provide information to participate in programs of the department.

plans and avoid or minimize harm to the environment in implementing those plans. 
Section 1619 of the Farm Bill (7 USC 8791) also prohibits disclosure of certain information from 
agricultural producers who provide information to participate in programs of the department.  
Public involvement under the CEQ Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of 
NEPA distinguishes Federal actions with effects of national concern from those with effects 
primarily of local concern (40 CFR 1501.9). The 2019 EIS is a programmatic analysis of the 
environmental impacts of the Program across 17 Western States, including Oregon.  
To assist with understanding applicable issues and reasonable alternatives to manage grasshopper 
outbreaks in rangelands and to ensure that the analysis is complete for informed decision making, 
APHIS has made this Draft EA available for a 30-day public review and comment period. Public 
outreach notification methods for this EA include local newspaper (i.e., The Oregonian); 
Regulations.gov; Stakeholder Registry Notice; direct emailing to those who have expressed interest 
in the program, and public meetings. After reviewing and considering all timely received 
comments, APHIS will issue a decision and will notify the public of the decision using the same 
methods as for the advertising the availability of the Draft EA. 
Scoping as defined by NEPA is an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be 
addressed by the environmental risk analysis and for identifying the significant issues related to a 
proposed action (40 CFR 1501.7). APHIS uses the scoping process to enlist land managers and the 
public to identify alternatives and issues to be considered during the development of a grasshopper 
suppression program. The process can occur formally and informally through meetings,

conversations, or written comments from individuals and groups. Though not technically scoping, 
EAs for grasshopper suppression have been created for 50 years, and this iterative process has 
resulted in extensive feedback from the public. In fact, the suppression of grasshoppers created the 
first federal agricultural department in the US, predating NEPA by approximately a century. 
Broadly, the cumulative process of receiving feedback on proposed actions has been profound. 
APHIS reviews and considers all comments received in preparing EAs for this program in Oregon.

II. Alternatives 
A. Framing 
To engage in comprehensive NEPA risk analysis APHIS must frame potential agency decisions 
into distinct action alternatives. These program alternatives are then evaluated to determine the 
significance of environmental effects. The 2019 programmatic EIS looked at the environmental 
impacts of three different alternatives:  
1. Alternative 1: No action alternative, which would maintain the status quo of allowing 
applications of three pesticides (carbaryl, diflubenzuron, and malathion). Pesticides may be 
applied as a spray or bait using ground or aerial equipment at full coverage rates or, more 
typically, by using RAATs.  
2. Alternative 2: No suppression alternative where APHIS would not fund or participate in any 
program
Text Len: 1733
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of three pesticides (carbaryl, diflubenzuron, and malathion). Pesticides may be 
applied as a spray or bait using ground or aerial equipment at full coverage rates or, more 
typically, by using RAATs.  
2. Alternative 2: No suppression alternative where APHIS would not fund or participate in any 
program to suppress grasshopper infestations. Any suppression program would be 
implemented by another entity; and  
3. Alternative 3: Preferred alternative updates the information allows use of four pesticides 
(carbaryl, diflubenzuron, malathion, and chlorantraniliprole). Upon request, APHIS would 
make a single application per year to a treatment area, and would apply it at conventional 
or, more likely, RAAT rates. The approach to use either conventional treatment or RAATs 
is an adaptive management feature that allows the Program to make site-specific 
applications with a range of rates to ensure adequate suppression. The preferred alternative 
further incorporates adaptive management by allowing treatments that may be approved in 
the future, and by including protocols for assessing the safety and efficacy of any future 
treatment when compared to currently approved treatments. 
APHIS selected Alternative 3 in the Record of Decision (ROD). However, under each alternative 
APHIS would conduct survey activities, provide technical assistance, and may make insecticide 
treatments according to the agency’s authority under the Plant Protection Act. An example of 
APHIS technical guidance is the agency’s work on IPM for the grasshopper program. IPM is 
defined as a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical 
and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health and environmental risks (7 U.S. Code

’s authority under the Plant Protection Act. An example of 
APHIS technical guidance is the agency’s work on IPM for the grasshopper program. IPM is 
defined as a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical 
and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health and environmental risks (7 U.S. Code 
136r-1). IPM for grasshoppers includes biological control, chemical control, rangeland and 
population dynamics, and decision support tools. Under all the alternatives considered in the EIS 
APHIS would continue to conduct grasshopper surveys and provide information on ways to 
manage grasshopper populations in the long-term, such as livestock grazing methods and cultural 
control by land managers. 
APHIS has funded the investigation of various IPM strategies for the grasshopper program. 
Congress established the Grasshopper Integrated Pest Management (GIPM) project to study the 
feasibility of using IPM for managing grasshoppers. The major objectives of the APHIS GIPM 
program were to: 1) manage grasshopper populations in study areas, 2) compare the effectiveness 
of an IPM program for rangeland grasshoppers with the effectiveness of a standard chemical 
control program on a regional scale, 3) determine the effectiveness of early sampling in detecting 
developing grasshopper infestations, 4) quantify short- and long-term responses of grasshopper 
populations to treatments, and 5) develop and evaluate new grasshopper suppression techniques 
that have minimal effects on non-target species (Quinn, 2000). The results for the GIPM program

The 2019 programmatic EIS provides a solid analytical foundation, but no site-specific suppression 
pesticide treatments are implemented relying entirely on the risk analysis of the EIS and ROD. The 
EIS provides the basic background information needed for the tiering of future project-specific 
analyses on rangelands in accordance with the CEQ regulations for implementing NEPA. APHIS 
instead prepares state-or site-specific EAs to address local issues before implementing suppression 
pesticide treatments. Therefore, APHIS decided to prepare an EA for Oregon to analyze more site-
specific impacts. The EA tiers to the 2019 programmatic EIS and incorporates by reference the 
carbaryl, and diflubenzuron HHERAs also published in 2019. Copies of the 2019 programmatic 
EIS and ROD are available for review at 6035 NE 78th Court, Ste 100 Portland, OR 97218. These 
documents are also available at the Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Program web site

B. Alternatives Considered for Comparative Analysis 
1. No Suppression Program Alternative 
Under Alternative A, the No Action alternative, APHIS would not conduct a program to suppress 
grasshopper infestations within Oregon. Under this alternative, APHIS would continue to conduct 
grasshopper surveys and provide information on ways to manage grasshopper populations in the 
long-term, such as different livestock grazing methods and cultural control by farmers. Any 
suppression program would be implemented by a federal land management agency, a state 
agriculture department, a local government, or a private group or individual. 
2. Insecticide Applications utilizing Reduced Agent Area Treatments 
(RAATs) - Preferred Alternative  
Under Alternative B, the Preferred Alternative, APHIS would manage a grasshopper treatment 
program using techniques and tools discussed hereafter to suppress outbreaks. The insecticides 
available for use by APHIS include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) registered 
carbaryl (bait formulation), and diflubenzuron. These two chemicals have different modes of 
action. Carbaryl inhibits acetylcholinesterase (enzymes involved in nerve impulses). Diflubenzuron 
inhibits the formation of chitin by insects which causes weak exoskeletons. APHIS would make a 
single application per year of one of these chemicals to a treatment area using a Reduced 
Agent/Area Treatments (RAATs) methodology—described further at the University of Wyoming 
entomology department website: www.uwyo.edu/entomology/grasshoppers/raat/index.html.

single application per year of one of these chemicals to a treatment area using a Reduced 
Agent/Area Treatments (RAATs) methodology—described further at the University of Wyoming 
entomology department website: www.uwyo.edu/entomology/grasshoppers/raat/index.html.  
APHIS selects which insecticides and coverage rates are appropriate for suppression of a particular 
grasshopper outbreak based on several biological, logistical, environmental, and economical 
criteria. The primary biological factor is the grasshopper species and the most common life stage of 
the dominant species of concern. When grasshoppers populations are mostly comprised of the first 
three instars diflubenzuron is typically selected because it is effective, economical and least 
harmful to non-target species. Diflubenzuron limits the formation of chitin in arthropod 
exoskeletons and can produce 90 to 97% grasshopper mortality in nascent populations with a 
greater percentage of early instars. If the window for the use of diflubenzuron closes, as a result of 
treatment delays, then carbaryl is the remaining control options. Circumstances where the use of 
carbaryl bait would be best are reduced because of the higher cost per acre than liquid insecticide 
formulations and that only certain species consume carbaryl insecticide when it is formulated as a

bait. Bait may be a preferred option when migratory or banding behavior allows targeted treatments 
over smaller areas, such as with clearwinged grasshopper (Camnula pellucida) and Mormon cricket

bait. Bait may be a preferred option when migratory or banding behavior allows targeted treatments 
over smaller areas, such as with clearwinged grasshopper (Camnula pellucida) and Mormon cricket 
(Anabrus simplex) species.  
RAATs strategy is effective for grasshopper suppression because the insecticide controls 
grasshoppers within treated swaths while conserving grasshopper predators and parasites in swaths 
not directly treated. RAATs can decrease the rate of insecticide applied by using lower than label 
insecticide concentrations and decreasing the deposition of insecticide applied by alternating 
treated and untreated swaths, with untreated swaths typically of equal or greater width than the 
treated swaths, as determined by various factors such as application method (air or ground) and 
target species. Combined (i.e., reduced pesticide rate and reduced coverage rate), these methods 
significantly lower the total amount of insecticide applied and application costs, while providing 
refugia for non-target invertebrates within the treatment block. Either carbaryl bait or 
diflubenzuron would be utilized at the following application rates to treated swaths for any given 
area treated (Lockwood et al., 2000, Foster et al., 2000, USDA APHIS, 2019): 
• 4.0 pounds (0.2 lbs. or 9.07 grams a.i.) per acre treated of 5% carbaryl bait; or 
• 1.0 fluid ounce (0.0156 lbs. or 7.07 grams a.i.) per acre sprayed of diflubenzuron. 
The width of the area not directly treated (untreated swaths) under RAATs methodology is not 
standardized, though a solid body of research (see below) paved the way for its
Text Len: 1620
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; or 
• 1.0 fluid ounce (0.0156 lbs. or 7.07 grams a.i.) per acre sprayed of diflubenzuron. 
The width of the area not directly treated (untreated swaths) under RAATs methodology is not 
standardized, though a solid body of research (see below) paved the way for its broad adoption in 
the early 2000s, and good results have been observed in a variety of sites and situations. Rather 
than suppress grasshopper populations to the greatest extent possible, the goal of this method is to 
suppress grasshopper populations to less than the economic injury level. Typically, 50% untreated 
area is the minimum target utilized for APHIS programs, while in some cases (e.g., bait 
applications by ground or applications targeting Momon cricket by air) a 2/3rds untreated (a.k.a., 
double skip-swath) or even greater have produced good results. Most of the cost savings of RAATs 
methodology comes from maximizing untreated areas, so efforts are made to do this to the best 
extent possible, which still can be relied upon to provide adequate results, from either research or 
shared experience. 
The variation in pesticide deposition resulting from following the RAATs procedures is not 
expected to result in uniformly absent chemical residues within the untreated swaths. Instead, 
swaths with maximum application rates alternate with swaths of low deposition rates. Program 
managers decided to increase the number of deposition dye card samples during 2021 to gather 
more data on actual application rates inside treatment blocks. Field personnel stationed 28 dye 
cards in a 150-foot spaced grid with four transects of seven cards. The long axis of the grid was 
oriented approximately parallel with the direction the aircraft were flying during

 low deposition rates. Program 
managers decided to increase the number of deposition dye card samples during 2021 to gather 
more data on actual application rates inside treatment blocks. Field personnel stationed 28 dye 
cards in a 150-foot spaced grid with four transects of seven cards. The long axis of the grid was 
oriented approximately parallel with the direction the aircraft were flying during the treatment. 
Unfortunately, strong winds caused pesticide drift from the flight swaths that were sprayed to the 
unsprayed swaths. Shortly after the portion of the treatment block containing the dye card grid was 
sprayed, the program managers ceased operations for the morning because wind gusts were 
measured over ten miles per hour. Figure 6 is a graph showing the pesticide concentrations on the 
dye cards as they were positioned in the grid. Despite the strong winds, the linear variation in 
deposition during an application using the RAAT method is evident. The program diflubenzuron 
application rate is 1.0 fluid ounce per acre which is equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2, approximately three 
times greater than the highest dye card concentration.

The concept of reducing the treatment area of insecticides while also applying less insecticide per 
treated acre was developed in 1995, with the first field tests of RAATs in Wyoming (Lockwood 
and Schell, 1997). Applications can be made either aerially or with ground-based equipment 
(Deneke and Keyser, 2011). Studies utilizing RAATs have shown good control (up to 85% of that 
achieved with a total area insecticide application) at a significantly lower cost and less insecticide

 tests of RAATs in Wyoming (Lockwood 
and Schell, 1997). Applications can be made either aerially or with ground-based equipment 
(Deneke and Keyser, 2011). Studies utilizing RAATs have shown good control (up to 85% of that 
achieved with a total area insecticide application) at a significantly lower cost and less insecticide, 
and with a markedly higher abundance of non-target organisms following application (Deneke and 
Keyser, 2011; Lockwood et al., 2000). Levels of control may also depend on variables such as 
body size of targeted grasshoppers, growth rate of forage, and the amount of coverage obtained by 
the spray applications (Deneke and Keyser, 2011). Control rates may also be augmented by the 
necrophilic and necrophagic behavior of grasshoppers, in which grasshoppers are attracted to 
volatile fatty acids emanating from cadavers of dead grasshoppers and move into treated swaths to 
cannibalize cadavers (Lockwood et al., 2002; Smith and Lockwood, 2003). Under optimal 
conditions, RAATs decrease control costs, as well as host plant losses and environmental effects 
(Lockwood et al., 2000; Lockwood et al., 2002). 
This methodology has been used very successfully in Oregon since the early 2000s. Focusing in on 
the past 10 years in Oregon, APHIS has protected a quarter million acres of public land through 
applications of 82.7 kg a.i. and four days duration per year, on average.

(roughly 0.09%) of the area of these two counties (20,156 square miles). Extensive survey and 
RAAT methodology, as well as cooperative partnerships with land managers, university extension 
and local community leaders, has allowed IPM to be applied to solving landscape scale problems 
with the best ecologically and economically sound practices available, in areas where treatment 
was requested and feasible, showing a mode target reduction of 80% and sustained reduction in 
following years of survey for those protected areas.  
C. Protective Measures and Program Procedures to Avoid or Reduce 
Adverse Impacts  
The Program applies insecticides as liquid ultra-low volume (ULV) sprays or solid-based carbaryl 
baits through aerial or ground applications. Habitat diversity, topographical features, 
meteorological conditions, economic concerns, and environmental considerations all have 
important roles in choosing the best form of treatment (Foster and Onsager, 1996). Aerial 
applications are typical for treatments over large and less accessible areas. Ground applications are 
most likely to be made when treating localized grasshopper outbreaks, border protection, or spot 
treatments of precise areas.  
Compared to liquid formulations, baits are easier to direct toward the target area, are much more 
specific toward grasshoppers, act primarily through ingestion, and affect fewer non-target 
organisms (Peach et al., 1994; Foster, 1996; Latchininsky and VanDyke, 2006). The baits have a 
carrier, such as bran, that absorbs the carbaryl, making it less bioavailable, particularly in dermal 
exposures (USDA APHIS, 2015). Biodegradation of carbaryl occurs readily in soil, but there is 
moderate

 1994; Foster, 1996; Latchininsky and VanDyke, 2006). The baits have a 
carrier, such as bran, that absorbs the carbaryl, making it less bioavailable, particularly in dermal 
exposures (USDA APHIS, 2015). Biodegradation of carbaryl occurs readily in soil, but there is 
moderate potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms. This is unlikely to occur for APHIS 
application however due to program application buffers from aquatic sites as well as the lack of 
significant drift due to the large bait size used during application. 
ULV applications use lower than the conventional label rates, specifically 0.5 gallon or less per 
acre of insecticide in liquid form. Liquid applications typically produce a quicker, greater, and 
more predictable grasshopper mortality rate than bait applications (Catangui et al, 1996). 
Generally, contract costs are substantially lower for applying ULV sprays compared to 
conventional liquid application rates and bait applications because ULV sprays use less product 
(Foster and Onsager, 1996). The program avoids off target drift to protect environmentally 
sensitive areas and maintain treatment efficacy through standard protocols including program 
buffers and monitoring of wind conditions, as well as adjuvants including crop oil concentrate or 
natural oils (e.g., methylated seed oil or canola oil) which increases specific gravity and droplet 
size to further reduce drift.  
As discussed in the previous section, the RAAT strategy reduces the treatment area, the application 
rate of insecticides, or both. RAATs suppress grasshopper populations below the economic injury 
level, rather than to the greatest extent possible, keeping with the IPM principles that have 
governed the program since the 1980s. Insecticides suppress grasshoppers within treated swaths,

 discussed in the previous section, the RAAT strategy reduces the treatment area, the application 
rate of insecticides, or both. RAATs suppress grasshopper populations below the economic injury 
level, rather than to the greatest extent possible, keeping with the IPM principles that have 
governed the program since the 1980s. Insecticides suppress grasshoppers within treated swaths, 
yet RAATs reduce cost and conserve non-target biological resources (including predators and 
parasites of grasshoppers and other beneficial invertebrates) in untreated areas. 
APHIS grasshopper treatments must follow all applicable federal, state, tribal, and local laws and 
regulations regarding pesticide use, including all USEPA and state approved label instructions. 
APHIS has also implemented several measures that go beyond label instructions to protect workers 
and the environment. All aircrafts must have a positive on/off system that will prevent leaks from 
`  
Page | 28 
 
the nozzles and a positive emergency shutoff valve between the tank and the pump. Whenever 
possible, applicators must avoid aerial ferrying and turnaround routes over water bodies and 
sensitive habitats (USDA APHIS, 2013). This will reduce the risk of accidental release of 
insecticides into aquatic habitats and other sensitive habitats. Environmental monitoring and flight 
line review is conducted daily during treatments to ensure accurate applications and buffering, as 
well as appropriate pesticide specifications and rates. 
The program has procedures to limit potential movement of applied insecticides outside of the 
intended treatment area. Operationally, the accurate placement of the ULV spray insecticide is 
essential if grasshopper populations are to be suppressed efficaciously. Winds may displace the 
insecticide, and high air temperatures combined with low humidity may cause fine droplets to 
evaporate and

 has procedures to limit potential movement of applied insecticides outside of the 
intended treatment area. Operationally, the accurate placement of the ULV spray insecticide is 
essential if grasshopper populations are to be suppressed efficaciously. Winds may displace the 
insecticide, and high air temperatures combined with low humidity may cause fine droplets to 
evaporate and drift without reaching the targeted vegetation. During applications, APHIS personnel 
constantly monitor wind conditions because when steady wind speeds exceed 10 miles per hour 
(mph), or wind direction changes towards sensitive habitat treatments are suspended until 
conditions improve. Field personnel measure ground and air temperatures to check for temperature 
inversions characterized by stable air with little mixing. Temperature inversions can cause ULV 
spray droplets to remain aloft increasing the potential for off-site transport of drift.  
The program has also established treatment restriction buffers around water bodies to protect those 
features from insecticide drift and runoff. The labels for all program insecticides prohibit direct 
application to water (defined as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by seasonal streams, springs, 
wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers). APHIS maintains the following additional buffers for 
water bodies that are not designated critical habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot buffer for 
aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground sprays, and a 50-foot buffer for bait applications (USDA 
APHIS, 2013).  
GPS shapefiles showing exact treatment block boundaries and sensitive site buffers are provided to 
contracted applicators or to APHIS staff conducting treatments prior to start of operations, and 
blocks designated for treatment are inspected for unexpected sensitive sites and waterbodies to

III. Environmental Consequences 
A. Description of Affected Environment 
Chapter III identifies the affected environment where the Program will be implemented, identifies 
the types of impacts or effects that will be evaluated, and the environmental issues that will be 
studied. Each environmental issue section addresses a separate environmental resource, and 
includes background information, an evaluation of the impacts on those resources, and a 
conclusion. The alternatives are compared with the environmental consequences of the proposed 
action at the end of each issue section. Determination of significance of the impacts predicted in 
this chapter does not occur in this EA but is made by the APHIS decisionmaker and documented in 
the appropriate decision document. 
The potential suppression program areas covered in this EA fall within seven central and eastern 
Oregon counties which collectively encompass 38,408 square miles, listed in the following table:

The level III ecoregions of these counties that are conducive to grasshopper outbreaks and APHIS 
treatment may be feasible in are Columbia Plateau (10), Blue Mountains (11), and Northern Basin

Columbia Plateau (10): This is an arid sagebrush steppe and grassland, surrounded by wetter, 
mostly forested, mountainous ecoregions. This region is underlain by a thick layer of lava rock. 
Particularly in the region’s eastern portion, where precipitation is greater, deep wind-deposited 
loess soils have been extensively cultivated for wheat. 
Blue Mountains (11): This ecoregion is a complex of mountain ranges that are lower and more 
open than the neighboring Cascades and northern Rocky Mountains. Like the Cascades but unlike 

`

the Rockies, the Blue Mountains region is mostly volcanic in origin. Only its highest ranges, 
particularly the Wallowa and Elkhorn mountains, consist of intrusive rocks that rise above the 
dissected lava surface of the region. Much of this ecoregion is grazed by cattle, unlike the Cascades 
and northern Rockies. 
Northern Basin and Range (80): This ecoregion consists of dissected lava plains, rolling hills, 
alluvial fans, valleys, and scattered mountains. Mountains are more common in the eastern part. 
Overall, it is higher and cooler than the Snake River Plain and has fewer ranges than the Central 
Basin and Range. Sagebrush steppe is extensive here. Juniper dominated woodland occurs on the 
rugged stony uplands. Much of the region is used for rangeland.  
As described and listed in Chapter 1.A., certain level IV ecoregions do not appear to be conducive 
to grasshopper outbreaks and therefore will not be included in

Basin and Range. Sagebrush steppe is extensive here. Juniper dominated woodland occurs on the 
rugged stony uplands. Much of the region is used for rangeland.  
As described and listed in Chapter 1.A., certain level IV ecoregions do not appear to be conducive 
to grasshopper outbreaks and therefore will not be included in this EA or therefore be considered 
part of program area as regards to potentially impacting non-target species of concern. In the Blue 
Mountains ecoregion, these areas are 11c - Maritime-Influenced Zone, 11d - Melange, 11e - 
Wallowas/Seven Devils Mountains, 11h - Continental Zone Highlands, 11l - Mesic Forest Zone, 
11m - Subalpine-Alpine Zone. In the Norther Basin and Range ecoregion, these areas are 80j - 
Semiarid Uplands, 80k - Partly Forested Mountains, 80m - Barren Playas.  
APHIS in cooperation with state and university collaborators provides general information to the 
public on grasshoppers in all parts of the state, for example in 2022 a report was received from 
Mary’s Peak Botanical Special Interest Area which stated, “The grasshoppers seem to be 
decimating a robust population of Lupinus albicaulis. They, from what I can tell, are damaging the 
flowers and substantially reducing the number of seed pods and seed produced." It was identified 
by the state entomologist as Melanoplus saltator, “… a native species of grasshopper (family 
Acrididae) first described from specimens from Portland OR. M. saltator is endemic to 
Northwestern Oregon, distributed from Washington and Yamhill Counties south to Linn County in

 of seed pods and seed produced." It was identified 
by the state entomologist as Melanoplus saltator, “… a native species of grasshopper (family 
Acrididae) first described from specimens from Portland OR. M. saltator is endemic to 
Northwestern Oregon, distributed from Washington and Yamhill Counties south to Linn County in 
meadows, open woodlands and woods edges. It is one of two Oregon-endemic flightless 
grasshopper species known to occur at the top of Mary's Peak (the other is Melanoplus immunis, 
the Mary's Peak short-winged grasshopper, a smaller species).” Such outreach or response to 
inquiries is a service that the public has come to expect regardless of potential for further action.  
This EA on the other hand is attempting to focus as closely as possible to areas where treatment 
requests received may be feasible to conduct. At this time, this is primarily limited to federal, state 
or tribally managed rangeland, with the possible incorporation of adjacent private rangeland to a 
limited extent. Cropland, including Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) crops are limited by law 
to 20% of overall project area with no cost share being provided, and of course must also meet 
pesticide label requirements.  
B. Special Management Areas 
APHIS is aware there are areas that have greater scenic and environmental value within or adjacent 
to the rangeland areas considered by this EA. These areas might have remote recreational uses, 
special ecological characteristics or species that are of special concern to land management 
agencies, the public, or other groups and individuals. Many of these areas are excluded from 
grasshopper outbreak habitat and therefore from this EA, as described in Chapter 1.A. and in
Text Len: 1739

to the rangeland areas considered by this EA. These areas might have remote recreational uses, 
special ecological characteristics or species that are of special concern to land management 
agencies, the public, or other groups and individuals. Many of these areas are excluded from 
grasshopper outbreak habitat and therefore from this EA, as described in Chapter 1.A. and in the 
above section. For example, the Steens Mountain Wilderness and similar Semiarid Uplands (80j),  
Partly Forested Mountains (80k), as well as the Barren Playas (80m) which typify the Alvord 
Dessert have always been excluded from grasshopper treatments by way of never having 
grasshopper outbreaks ever observed. Similarly, in the Blue Mountains in particular, significant 
`  
Page | 32 
 
portions are forested and or mesic, thus have also always been excluded from grasshopper outbreak 
observations.  
In general, areas designated as wilderness areas and national parks or monuments in Oregon share 
the characteristic of not having outbreaks, or at minimum, not being sources of requests from land 
management submitted to APHIS for help with grasshoppers. Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs) 
have been excluded from treatment requests heretofore as well however this is ultimately a 
decision of the land management agency, specifically the BLM, with APHIS having not authority 
to oversee land management on their behalf. As shown in the following figure, taken from 
www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/oregon-washington, the (salmon colored) 
WSAs cover a significant portion of SE Oregon. Many of these areas correspond with special 
protection areas for Greater Sage Grouse, meaning that treatments are not generally considered in

 their behalf. As shown in the following figure, taken from 
www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/oregon-washington, the (salmon colored) 
WSAs cover a significant portion of SE Oregon. Many of these areas correspond with special 
protection areas for Greater Sage Grouse, meaning that treatments are not generally considered in 
those areas already. If treatment requests do start coming to APHIS for WSAs however, greater 
environmental analysis would be needed prior to proceeding with treatments. 
 
Figure 13. Steens Mountain Wilderness/Special Management Area, Wild Scenic Rivers, and Wilderness Study Areas of SE Oregon. 
As discussed in the Mormon Cricket section of Chapter 1.B., one possible reason why WSAs and 
areas not typically associated with grasshopper outbreaks or requests might need to be reconsidered 
in the future, would be due to expanding ranges of this highly migratory and upland habitat adapted 
species.  
Currently, program activities adjacent to WSAs may occur and be covered by this EA. (This would 
be in areas where grasshopper outbreaks coincide and are otherwise outside of Greater Sage 
Grouse or other sensitive species buffers which extend beyond WSAs.) A representative area for 
this would be along the east slope of Steens Mountain north of Mann Lake, which is an especially 
arid mixed-use rangeland that the BLM has worked to recondition but is prone to frequent 
grasshopper outbreaks due to frequent drought. Nearby survey work conducted by BLM found

expansion of Sullivan’s sulfur butterfly (Colias christina sullivani) out of the WSA and into an 
allotment which APHIS has treated three times in the past decade, indicating that program 
activities are not adversely impacting the adjacent WSA or the rare species of invertebrates in that 
general area. Indeed, since this butterfly is strongly supported by stiff pea (Lathyrus rigidus), 
suppression of herbivory by grasshopper outbreaks may theoretically be helping their population 
expansion. (Based on their detection and delimitation of this rare butterfly population BLM 
buffered the specific area in question out of their potential treatment request for the year.)

A conservation biocontrol agent of grasshoppers, the ground mantis (Litaneutria minor) can also be 
observed in this allotment where frequent treatments have occurred, as with this photo observation 
taken by APHIS personnel in July 2023, providing further evidence of generally sound ecological 
management of this mixed-use rangeland area where APHIS has recently suppressed grasshoppers 
on request from BLM more frequently than anywhere else in the state.

C. Effects Evaluated Including Cumulative Impacts 
Chapter III examines the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each of the alternatives on the 
biological, physical, and sociocultural aspects of the human environment (issues). Direct effects are 
caused by the action and occur at the same time and place (40 CFR § 1508.1(i)(1)). Indirect effects 
are caused by the action but are later in time and farther removed in distance (40 CFR § 
1508.1(i)(2)). Cumulative effects are the effects on the environment that result from the 
incremental effects of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions (40 CFR § 1508.1(i)(3)). 
Cumulative effects can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking 
place over a period of time (40 CFR § 1508.1(i)(3)).  
Cumulative impact, as defined in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA 
implementing regulations (40 CFR § 1508.1) “is the impact on the environment which results from 
the incremental impact of the action when added to the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such 

`

actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions 
taking place over a period of time.” 
Potential cumulative impacts associated with the No Action alternative where APHIS would not 
take part in any grasshopper suppression program include the continued increase in grasshopper 
populations and potential expansion of populations into neighboring range and cropland. In 
addition

 can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions 
taking place over a period of time.” 
Potential cumulative impacts associated with the No Action alternative where APHIS would not 
take part in any grasshopper suppression program include the continued increase in grasshopper 
populations and potential expansion of populations into neighboring range and cropland. In 
addition, State and private land managers could apply insecticides to manage grasshopper 
populations however, land managers may opt not to use RAATs, which would increase insecticides 
applied to the rangeland. Increased insecticide applications from the lack of coordination or 
foregoing RAATs methods could increase the exposure risk to non-target species. In addition, land 
managers may not employ the extra program measures designed to reduce exposure to the public 
and the environment to insecticides.  
Potential cumulative impacts associated with the Preferred Alternative are not expected to be 
significant because the program applies an insecticide application once during a treatment season. 
The program may treat an area with different insecticides but does not overlap the treatments. The 
program does not mix or combine insecticides. Based on historical outbreaks in the United States, 
the probability of an outbreak occurring in the same area where treatment occurred in the previous 
year is unlikely; however, given time, populations eventually may reach economically damaging 
thresholds and require treatment. Since a general outbreak started in Oregon in 2020, areas where 
sufficiently large acreage treatment occurred have seen sustained reductions in grasshoppers based 
on a single treatment. Blocks treated which were smaller or more fragmented however have seen 
some repeated requests for treatments in subsequent years. Treatment by APHIS in 2024 was 
limited due to a shortage of personnel and funding and is not expected to significantly alter 
grasshopper outbreaks on a broad scale

ly large acreage treatment occurred have seen sustained reductions in grasshoppers based 
on a single treatment. Blocks treated which were smaller or more fragmented however have seen 
some repeated requests for treatments in subsequent years. Treatment by APHIS in 2024 was 
limited due to a shortage of personnel and funding and is not expected to significantly alter 
grasshopper outbreaks on a broad scale in coming years on its own.  The Preferred Alternative 
insecticide application reduces the insect population down to levels that cause an acceptable level 
of economic damage. The duration of treatment activity, which is relatively short since it is a one-
time application, and the lack of repeated treatments in the same area in the same year reduce the 
possibility of significant cumulative impacts. 
The insecticides proposed for use in the grasshopper program are not anticipated to persist in the 
environment or bioaccumulate. Therefore, a grasshopper outbreak that occurs in an area previously 
treated for grasshoppers is unlikely to cause an accumulation of insecticides from previous program 
treatments. For a second time in recent years, the Oregon legislature provided enhanced funding to 
private land managers to conduct subsidized treatments in certain counties for the control of 
grasshoppers. No information on how widespread this program was utilized is available, despite 
requests for it made by APHIS, and it is unclear how this alters the continued outbreak observed in 
many parts of the state in previous years or currently. For federal land managers however, these 
funds and potential treatments were not applicable. Having no treatments overlap in location, or 
nearly any being made on federal land by APHIS in 2024, make cumulative impacts from private 
treatments last year also unlikely.

The 2002 EIS Appendix B, Environmental Risk Assessment for Rangeland Grasshopper 
Suppression Program—Insecticides, analyzed effects of various insecticide formulations and 
treatment rates in detail and found minimal negative impacts of any kind for either carbaryl bait or 
diflubenzuron. Cumulative and synergistic effects were also analyzed and found to be minimal or 
non-existent for these. “Diflubenzuron is only reported to be synergistic with defoliant DEF (NLM, 
1988)” (page 134). Def is a defoliant registered for use in cotton crops, which are not grown in 
Oregon, with  the active ingredient Tribuphos (S,S,S-Tributyl phosphorotrithioate). No record of 
this or related chemicals being used in Oregon was found. For carbaryl in general (all

organophosphates combined with carbaryl is additive not synergistic (Keplinger and Deichmann, 
1967; Carpenter et al, 1961)” (page 130). Regarding cumulative effects of these program 
pesticides, pesticide use data as well as land use were analyzed below.

of the conterminous United States from 1992-2017. The most recent 10-year dataset, 2008-2017, 
establishes general trends for pesticide use by crop in Oregon which are comparable to the recent 
10-year dataset summarizing program chemical use. Estimates specific to the two program 
chemicals are also captured here, though formulations and county level spatial data, are not 
specified.  
In total for the decade, an estimated 76,713,875 kg of pesticides were applied, an average of 
767,139 kg per year. 84% of the estimate was applied to Vegetables & Fruit crops (61%) and 
Orchard & Grape crops (23%). All other crop groups (Wheat, Pasture & Hay, Alfalfa, Corn, and 
Other) received the estimated remainder of 16%.

fields planted with the intent to market as a harvested commodity, including hay—though rarely 
done, up to 20% of a project may include crops, with no cost share provided. Private rangeland or 
pasture may be included in APHIS treatments, especially in areas where public and private land is

The 2022 agricultural census (www.nass.usda.gov) estimates that 42% of acreage harvested for hay 
in Oregon occurred in the seven counties considered in this EA, and were the largest crop in terms 
of land use in the state overall, utilizing 5.8% of the 15.3 million acres of operational farmland. 
(This estimate does not include any acreage for pasture or rangeland.) The next largest commodity

by harvested acreage statewide was wheat at 4.7%, followed by corn, hazelnuts, and potatoes (with 
none greater than 0.6%). In sum, Hay & Pasture crops have a larger geographical size than all other 
agricultural operations in the state, require less than a tenth of agricultural pesticides and no routine 
insecticides at all. 
Management of rangeland varies much more than any agricultural lands, even pasture, however as 
with pasture, weeds are generally considered the leading pests of concern. Invasive grasses are the 
leading pest in rangeland in Oregon, according to the Oregon SageCon Dashboard with 4.1 million 
acres impaired, and 1.1 million acres treated to address invasive plants, as of 2021 
(oe.oregonexplorer.info/externalcontent/sagecon/SageCon_Dashboard.pdf). Though not tracked as 
closely as agricultural statistics, the SageCon partnership clearly sees invasive weeds as a primary 
pest to rangeland, worth treating, especially for their mission of supporting functional sagebrush 
rangeland, summarized on their website as follows: “In 2012, the Oregon Sage-grouse 
Conservation Partnership (SageCon) was convened at the request of the Governor’s office to 
formulate an ‘all lands, all threats’ approach to sage-grouse conservation.” Many noxious weed 
species thrive in arid conditions, increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfire and out 
competing native and more ecologically beneficial species, making their management a priority in 
rangelands. With some notable exceptions such as classical biocontrol agents that specialize in

feeding on a handful of exotic noxious weeds, few if any options besides herbicide are typically 
feasible for treatment of these pests on rangeland. It can be expected therefor that projects utilizing 
herbicide will be occurring on both private and public rangeland, including potential program 
treatment. No cumulative or synergistic effects are anticipated to result from herbicide in general, 
including on rangeland. 
Aside from intermittent requests to APHIS to treat grasshopper outbreaks, insecticide applications, 
especially on public rangeland, are not documented or anticipated. They are also expected to be 
very rare on private rangeland, with little upside benefit to treatments to be found outside of 
grasshopper outbreaks, even in the higher production Hay & Pasture crops, as reflected by the lack 
of insecticide applications to be found in Wieben, C.M, 2019. 
Looking specifically at the pesticides considered in this EA, Wieben, C.M., 2019 show 
diflubenzuron to be generally uncommon, with only three years of treatments estimated in whole 
the decade, all in Orchard & Grape crops, for 1,253 kg total, an average of 125 kg per year across 
the entire state. Based on this limited use and lack of geographic overlap, no cumulative effects are 
anticipated from this agricultural use.

Carbaryl is a faster acting and broader spectrum insecticide, especially in the liquid form that is 
primarily used, and is not a restricted-use pesticide like diflubenzuron, so no special applicator 
license is necessarily required. As expected, it was more widely and consistently used, however 
none was estimated to have occurred in Pasture & Hay crops. Orchards & Grapes made up 71% of 
usage and was the most consistent use over the decade. Vegetable & Fruit crops showed the 2nd 
highest and most consistent usage rates, though a trend of decreased use in the 2nd half of the 
decade is evident. Alfalfa crop usage varied the most, averaging almost the same application rate 
per year over the decade as Vegetable & Fruit crops, despite only being recorded in three years, 
with a massive single year spike recorded in 2009. Other crops (e.g., small grains or legumes) 
showed very slight usage estimates, and zero usage in eight years of the 10 years.

Since no estimates on non-agricultural use were available, and carbaryl is a popular option 
available to home gardeners, it can be assumed that residences, gardeners, and possibly municipal 
green spaces, near potential APHIS treatment areas may be treated with this pesticide. Given the 
Restricted Use Pesticide labeling of Diflubenzuron, public use of that pesticide is less likely.  
Cumulative effects from organophosphate pesticides in Oregon is also a potential concern, since 10 
pesticides of this type occurs in the 10-year data, though again, none for Pasture & Hay. 
Table 8. Estimated Kilograms of Organophosphate Pesticide Applied in Oregon per Crop, 2008-2017 
 
Alfalfa shows a consistent use of these insecticides, as do most other crops. Other sources of these 
pesticides in the environment may be from municipal mosquito abatement programs. Given the 
program formulation of bait only1, the lack of geographic overlap with any of the above treatments, 
and the infrequency of APHIS treatments, the additive effects of carbaryl resulting from the

continues to be a popular option for agricultural pest and mosquito suppression. 
Based on the above analysis of Wieben, C.M., 2019, which is the best currently available for this 
purpose, there is no reason in evidence that cumulative impacts from the program would occur, 
given the low use of program insecticides in overall, and the lack of geographic or crop usage

purpose, there is no reason in evidence that cumulative impacts from the program would occur, 
given the low use of program insecticides in overall, and the lack of geographic or crop usage 
overlap that is discernable. 
For many years however, APHIS and ODA have provided the interested public with information 
on program pesticides, timing and preferred application methods (i.e., RAATs), so it is likely that 
increases in use of these methods have occurred in areas impacted by pestiferous grasshopper 
outbreaks, which is not adequately captured by these data. ODA in particular has responded to 
public pressure to provide funding mechanisms through the Oregon legislature to aid private

or other solid media acts only upon ingestion by the organism and is considered to be more selective and 
environmentally benign than other chemical control means (Peach et al., 1994). This suppression method may offer a 
viable alternative when grasshopper treatment is required in close proximity to endangered and threatened species, 
water bodies, or other sensitive sites.”

growers impacted by grasshoppers. APHIS will continue to evaluate this source of application data 
as it becomes available. 
Potential cumulative impacts resulting from the use of pesticides include insecticide resistance, 
synergistic chemical effects, chemical persistence and bioaccumulation in the environment. The 
program use of reduced insecticide application rates (i.e. ULV and RAATs) are expected to 
mitigate the development of insect resistance to the insecticides. Grasshopper outbreaks in the 
United States occur cyclically so applications do not occur to the same population over time further 
eliminating the selection pressure that increases the chances of insecticide resistance. 
The insecticides proposed for use in the program have a variety of agricultural and non-agricultural 
uses. There may be an increased use of these insecticides in an area under suppression when 
private, State, or Federal entities make applications to control other pests. However, the vast 
majority of the land where program treatments occur is uncultivated rangeland and additional 
treatments by landowners or managers are very uncommon making possible cumulative or 
synergistic chemical effects extremely unlikely.  
APHIS has prepared this EA for Oregon because treatments could be requested if grasshopper 
populations reach outbreak levels. Past experience and continuing/cyclical grasshopper outbreaks 
impacting rangeland health and agricultural producers, as well as possibility of exacerbating 
drought conditions lead APHIS to believe treatments will be needed in the near future

APHIS has prepared this EA for Oregon because treatments could be requested if grasshopper 
populations reach outbreak levels. Past experience and continuing/cyclical grasshopper outbreaks 
impacting rangeland health and agricultural producers, as well as possibility of exacerbating 
drought conditions lead APHIS to believe treatments will be needed in the near future. 
Unfortunately, the agency can’t accurately predict exact treatment locations and usually discovers 
building grasshopper populations only a few weeks in advance. Additionally, requested treatments 
may be cancelled or change location if land manager priorities and policies shift, APHIS funding 
and staffing is too limited, or higher priority work emerge. Thunderstorms, heat waves or wildfires 
may also make areas inaccessible or delay treatments past the optimal window. 
As summarized in Chapter II.A., all treatments in the past 10 years have occurred on BLM 
rangeland in Harney and Malheur counties. Tentative requests were received from Lake and Baker 
counties for BLM rangeland also, but to date no viable project areas have emerged, primarily due 
to buffers for Greater Sage Grouse or ESA fish critical habitat occurring in the same areas as high 
grasshopper populations. The BLM continues to look at mixed use rangeland locations they 
manage that do not have such limitations (or other special designations) where grasshoppers 
outbreaks have occurred historically, tentatively requesting ongoing assistance with the 
grasshopper upcycle identified starting in 2020, as well as progressive migration of Mormon 
crickets from Idaho and Nevada. Based on spring survey results, they may finalize treatment

request submissions to be acted upon in the limited phenological treatment window, or if a 
downcycle in grasshopper populations is observed, no treatment will be advisable. There are no 
areas that have been retreated by APHIS in the past decade to date aside from very arid areas on the 
east slope of Steens Mountain, with most seeing sustained reductions from a single treatment.  
D. Site Specific Considerations and Environmental Issues  
Environmental issues are the resources that may be affected by the proposal, or concerns about the 
risks to humans from implementing the Program. The following issues are analyzed in Section E. 
Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives in the order outlined. 
1. Human Health 
Direct exposure to program chemicals because of suppression treatments is unlikely due to the 
infrequency of treatments and the general lack of humans in treatment areas. In addition, program 
`  
Page | 40 
 
buffers and procedures further reduce the chances of human exposure. Finally, pesticide label 
specifications, standard spill prevention and rapid response measures mitigate the risk of accidental 
human exposure resulting from program activities. 
As summarized in Table 4, approximately 196,529 people live in the seven counties covered by 
this EA which have an area of 38,408 square miles, creating an average population density of 5.1 
persons per square mile overall. Program suppression activities are conducted on rangelands that 
are far more sparsely inhabited however, typically with few or no people present or in residence. 
Most habitation in rangeland areas is comprised of singular houses, but some rangeland areas may 
have denser areas of

, creating an average population density of 5.1 
persons per square mile overall. Program suppression activities are conducted on rangelands that 
are far more sparsely inhabited however, typically with few or no people present or in residence. 
Most habitation in rangeland areas is comprised of singular houses, but some rangeland areas may 
have denser areas of habitation nearby. Such areas are treated as sensitive sites, and provided 
programmatic buffers and notification of treatment activities is provided to residents in advance of 
nearby treatments. A buffer of 1.25 miles from the treatment area to the perimeter of any town and 
other communities will be used. Ranch buildings and structures (such as stock tanks) will have a 
buffer of 200 feet. Federal highways and State roads will have a buffer of 25 feet. Local law 
enforcement, fire departments emergency medical services, hospitals and tribal agencies will be 
notified prior to any treatment as an advisory to access any safety risk, the treatment date and 
location and contact personnel.  
Recreationists are sometimes present on rangelands receiving program treatment, though this is 
very uncommon. Recreationists may theoretically use rangelands in question for hiking, camping, 
bird watching, hunting, rock hunting, or other uses, and ranchers may work be at work. Individuals 
with allergic or hypersensitive reactions to insecticides may live near or may utilize rangelands in 
the proposed suppression program area also, in theory. Some rural schools may be in areas near 
treatment blocks but not observed to date and would be buffered. To date, no recreationists have 
been observed in or near treatment blocks in Oregon (aside from driving past on buffered roads 
inside vehicles) outside of a BLM campground at Mann Lake, which was buffered. Notice is 
routinely provided to

 Some rural schools may be in areas near 
treatment blocks but not observed to date and would be buffered. To date, no recreationists have 
been observed in or near treatment blocks in Oregon (aside from driving past on buffered roads 
inside vehicles) outside of a BLM campground at Mann Lake, which was buffered. Notice is 
routinely provided to any recreationist found in areas of treatment, to limit their announce or 
potential exposure to program chemicals, and applicators are advised to avoid direct treatment of 
people, vehicles or buildings unexpected encountered.  
Those most at risk during operations would be persons mixing or applying chemicals. Adherence to 
pesticide label recommendations is therefore mandatory, and APHIS employees receive annual 
health screening to monitor for harmful pesticide exposure. The 2019 EIS contains detailed hazard, 
exposure, and risk analyses for the chemicals available to APHIS. Impacts to workers and the 
general public were analyzed for all possible routes of exposure (dermal, oral, inhalation) under a 
range of conditions designed to overestimate risk. The operational procedures and spraying 
conditions examined in those analyses conform to those expected for operations. Direct exposure to 
program chemicals because of suppression treatments is unlikely due to the infrequency of 
treatments and the general lack of humans in treatment areas. In addition, program buffers and 
procedures further reduce the chances of human exposure. Finally, pesticide label specifications, 
standard spill prevention and rapid response measures mitigate the risk of accidental human 
exposure resulting from program activities. Potential exposures to the public from conventional 
application rates are infrequent and of low magnitude. The RAATs approach reduces this potential 
even further by using reduced rates and less actual directly treated area. The proposed program 
should benefit human and environmental health by reducing the risk of insect annoyance

 prevention and rapid response measures mitigate the risk of accidental human 
exposure resulting from program activities. Potential exposures to the public from conventional 
application rates are infrequent and of low magnitude. The RAATs approach reduces this potential 
even further by using reduced rates and less actual directly treated area. The proposed program 
should benefit human and environmental health by reducing the risk of insect annoyance, blowing 
dust, higher light reflection and higher temperature on the semi-arid land surface.  
Various compounds are released in smoke during wildland fires, including carbon monoxide (CO), 
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, aerosols, polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons contained within fine particulate matter (a byproduct of the combustion of organic 
`

matter such as wood), aldehydes, and most notably formaldehyde produced from the incomplete 
combustion of burning biomass (Reisen and Brown, 2009; Burling et al., 2010; Broyles, 2013). 
Particulate matter, CO, benzene, acrolein, and formaldehyde have been identified as compounds of 
particular concern in wildland fire smoke (Reinhardt and Ottmar, 2004). Many of the naturally 
occurring products associated with combustion from wildfires may also be present because of 
combustion of program insecticides that are applied to rangeland. These combustion byproducts 
will be at lower quantities due to the short half-lives of most of the program insecticides and their 
low use rates. Other minor combustion products specific to each insecticide may also be present 
because of combustion from a rangeland fire but these are typically less toxic based on available 
human health data. The safety data sheet for each insecticide identifies these combustion products

low use rates. Other minor combustion products specific to each insecticide may also be present 
because of combustion from a rangeland fire but these are typically less toxic based on available 
human health data. The safety data sheet for each insecticide identifies these combustion products 
as well as recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) which is equal to what 
typically is used in fighting wildfires. Material applied in the field will be at a much lower 
concentration than what would occur in a fire involving a concentrated formulation. Therefore, the 
PPE worn by rangeland firefighters would also be protective of any additional exposure resulting 
from the burning of residual insecticides. 
2. Nontarget Species 
a) Ecological Summary 
While the program conducts grasshopper control treatments any other species affected by the 
insecticides can be viewed as non-target effects or unintentional take. The program has established 
and follows procedures to prevent take of species federally listed under the Endangered Species 
Act as endangered or threatened. The programmatic protection measures that resulted from 
consultation with the USFWS also prevent take of state listed species (sensitive species or species 
of concern) in the same habitats or having similar ecological (i.e., the relationship between species 
and their environment) niches as federal listed species. These procedures (e.g., no-spray buffers, 
RAATs, insecticide choices) also limit effects on pollinators (e.g., butterflies, moths, bees) and 
other beneficial insects. 
Grasslands, open forest, shrublands and associated seasonal wetlands, typically below 6,000 feet 
elevation, are most likely to host outbreaks of grasshoppers and potentially be targeted for 
suppression

ATs, insecticide choices) also limit effects on pollinators (e.g., butterflies, moths, bees) and 
other beneficial insects. 
Grasslands, open forest, shrublands and associated seasonal wetlands, typically below 6,000 feet 
elevation, are most likely to host outbreaks of grasshoppers and potentially be targeted for 
suppression programs in Oregon. Collectively, these lands host abundant and diverse terrestrial and 
aquatic organisms. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter III.A, to be viable requests to APHIS 
for grasshopper treatments in Oregon, federally managed lands that do not have other restrictions 
as designated by the land managers such as Wilderness Area/Wilderness Study Area or in 
consultation with governmental wildlife services, such as sensitive species restriction need to be 
the foundation of any project. Croplands also host grasshopper outbreaks, however these can have 
only a very limited role in any program treatments, if any. 
APHIS has ongoing consultation with jurisdictional wildlife management agencies on grasshopper 
programs, both nationally and more focused as shown in Table 5 for Oregon, and further described 
in Appendix C. Species consultation, determinations and mitigations, are summarized for all 82 
species considered in 2025 and available on request as described in Appendix C.

remotely gathered information or statistical models. Agencies shall explain any relevant 
assumptions or limitations of the information, or the particular model or methodology selected for 
use.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6(b).  
Estimating nontarget species population sizes over large areas can be extremely difficult, labor 
intensive, and expensive. State and federal wildlife management agencies have limited resources to 
conduct flora and fauna population surveys and monitor trends. States may monitor the status of 
wildlife populations by assessing sex ratios and age distribution. Plant species surveys often 
identify historical or potential habitat locations. In accordance with CEQ regulations and to 
preserve the professional and scientific integrity of the analysis, this EA uses reliable existing data 
and resources provided by jurisdictional agencies and peer-reviewed literature to estimate nontarget 
species population sizes. 
The Oregon Biodiversity Information Center (ORBIC) tracks the distribution and status of flora 
and fauna in the state, with location and populations data managed from all observations and 
occurrence data. Tiered to this are iNaturalist projects as well which empower citizen scientists to 
volunteer in aid of these efforts in a way that is scientifically reviewed. Their efforts are made 
available to the public on their rare species publications page (inr.oregonstate.edu/orbic/rare-

speculation. The lowest estimate is assumed to be the minimum population. Habitat suitability

The program has suppressed grasshopper populations on at most about a tenth of one percent of the 
area of the seven counties considered by this EA in any given year. As shown in Chapter II.A., 
11,676 acres on average per year were treated in the past decade, out of 24,581,120 acres in the 
seven counties, or 0.0475%; while in the largest treatment year, 33,792 acres were treated or 
0.137%. Within blocks protected through treatments, substantial portions are excluded from direct 
insecticide applications because of buffers around sensitive sites and the alternating spray and skip 
swaths inherent in the RAATs method. In sum, the potential impacts from the program activities on 
nontarget species populations occur in a small portion of the area considered by this EA and for a 
limited duration (happening once per 1-3 years at most, usually just once in a decade or longer). 
According to USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), rangelands comprise about 
30% of the entire land cover of the United States, totaling about 770 million acres. These lands are 
described by the NRCS as lands on which the indigenous vegetation is predominately grasses, 
grass-like plants, forbs, and possibly shrubs or dispersed trees, containing plant communities of 
either native or introduced plants. Grasslands, open forest, shrublands and associated wetlands are 
most likely to host outbreaks of grasshoppers and be targeted for suppression programs. These 
lands host abundant and diverse terrestrial and aquatic organisms. 
b) Invertebrates

health in natural environments. In addition to the benefits of general biodiversity, specific groups

lands host abundant and diverse terrestrial and aquatic organisms. 
b) Invertebrates 
Biodiversity of invertebrate organisms is generally recognized as crucial for overall ecosystem 
health in natural environments. In addition to the benefits of general biodiversity, specific groups 
of beneficial invertebrates are identified as providing important ecological services. Biological 
control organisms (species that feed on and help control pests) and pollinators (species that 
pollinate flowering plants) in particular help control pests and provide pollination services which 
are crucial to sustaining diverse ecosystems, while predatory arthropods (carnivores including 
insects, arachnids, and chilopods such as centipedes) help to regulate herbivorous populations and 
maintain balanced food-webs generally. Overuse of broad-spectrum pesticides and other artificial 
disturbances can disrupt the herbivore control and pollination services which populations of 
beneficial invertebrates provide. IPM is largely the practical science of creating the least disruption 
to invertebrate communities, while reducing the population of target pest(s), to prevent larger 
ecological problems from artificial imbalance in these communities. For crop producers this may 
mean preventing a ‘flush’ of very difficult to control pestiferous mites, or the costly replacement of 
honeybees, resulting from overuse of pesticides which broadly impact insects, such as 
organophosphates. For stewards of natural resources, IPM is also crucial for maintaining an overall 
balance of invertebrate biodiversity, not due to cost calculations, but as a primary goal of 
grasshopper outbreak suppression efforts. Currently, the pesticides considered for this program are 
very specific in terms of mode of uptake, requiring ingestion to be effective, which is only likely to

. For stewards of natural resources, IPM is also crucial for maintaining an overall 
balance of invertebrate biodiversity, not due to cost calculations, but as a primary goal of 
grasshopper outbreak suppression efforts. Currently, the pesticides considered for this program are 
very specific in terms of mode of uptake, requiring ingestion to be effective, which is only likely to 
occur from a small subset of invertebrates and most especially, grasshoppers (as discussed further 
in part E. of this chapter, Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives). 
In public comments, concern is often raised about impacts on beneficial invertebrates from blanket, 
broad-spectrum insecticide applications, which have been found to result in significant mortality of 
beneficial invertebrates, including those with the greatest potential to help regulate grasshopper 
populations over the long term (Branson et al 2006). This EA does not consider using such 
methods. An important body of research investigated how methods and materials which were 
`

previously used to control grasshopper outbreaks on rangelands, such as blanket, broad-spectrum 
insecticide applications, were unsustainable and counterproductive. Similar and supporting 
research developed the IPM techniques currently preferred for control of grasshopper outbreaks in 
Oregon, being both ecologically and economically far superior to those known to science 
previously. The USDA Grasshopper IPM User Handbook (https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-

promotes and helps to summarize these IPM resources to land-managers seeking guidance on this 
topic. There are challenges with these resources being taken out of context, oversimplified or 
blatantly misrepresented, however, especially as relates to the topic of biological control of 
grasshoppers.  
Biological pest control is a broad topic that is studied and presented in great detail in these 
resources, and for good reason since it is a cornerstone of any ecological pest control methodology. 
Rarely however is biological control ever a stand-alone alternative to all other control methods. 
Indeed, that would arguably take away from the concept of ‘integrated’ potentially as much as 
relying only on insecticide treatments alone. Specifically as relates to controlling grasshopper 
outbreaks, biological controls typically become saturated and decrease in effectiveness during pest 
outbreaks. This is one of the findings in the USDA Grasshopper IPM User Handbook, including in

outbreaks, biological controls typically become saturated and decrease in effectiveness during pest 
outbreaks. This is one of the findings in the USDA Grasshopper IPM User Handbook, including in 
VII.14 Grasshopper Population Regulation 
(www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/30320505/grasshopper/Extras/PDFs/IPM%20Handbook/VII14.
pdf). This study aims to describe relationships between available food, weather, and abundance of 
natural enemies, as ecological factors contributing to the regulation of grasshopper populations. 
Public comments citing this study as indicating that grasshopper populations have a high potential 
for being limited by natural enemies. While this is generally presented in the study as a sort of 
ecological first principle, equated in the text to how wolves have a strong potential to regulate deer, 
it is not the conclusion of the study generally. It does not draw any overarching conclusion as to the 
effectiveness of biological control on known outbreaks of grasshoppers. Rather it attempts to 
describe specific instances where survey of grasshopper populations may not be necessary due to 
limiting factors including biological control, weather, and food availability.  
Biological control, specifically conservation biological control (which is the encouragement of 
endemic natural enemies to control a pest species) is generally recognized as an important factor in 
the eventual regulation of outbreaks, particularly as caused by disease when combined with 
difficult weather and food scarcity conditions, and is utilized broadly by default, since insecticide

treatments are statistically rare for grasshoppers in Oregon. Even where treatments occur however, 
the methods and materials of the program fully support conservation biocontrol (including limiting 
when treatments occur based on survey results, providing non-treated swaths with RAATs, and 
selecting softer pesticides which do not kill a broad spectrum of invertebrates on contact). 
Conservation biological control agents which help to control grasshopper pests in the Western US 
are listed in the following table, drawn from the GIPM User Handbook made available to the 
public at ARS: www.ars.usda.gov/pa/nparl/pmru/IPMHandbook. The methods and materials 
developed for GIPM that are utilized by APHIS and transferred to landmanagers in direct 
consultation and public meetings, support populations of these ‘beneficials’ to help prevent future 
outbreaks and improve rangeland ecosystem health and productivity.

In closing, two other methods of natural pest control are referred to as kinds of biological control:

In closing, two other methods of natural pest control are referred to as kinds of biological control:  
Classical biological control is the intentional release of natural enemies from an exotic pest’s 
native range. Since pestiferous grasshoppers in the US are generally considered native species, this 
categorically does not apply a viable control strategy. 
Augmentative biological control is the artificial release of a large number of natural enemies to 
overwhelm pest populations, and is not currently a viable control option for APHIS to use 
effectively, though it remains an area of study, see Table 4. For example, organic formulations of 
biopesticide with active ingredients of fungi are registered for grasshopper control by the EPA, and 
are available to the public.

Possibly of even greater than concern for maintaining populations of biocontrols, may be that for 
pollinators, especially bees. Based on current available scientific research, there is a decrease in 
quantity of pollinators across the country and in rangeland ecosystems. However, the extent of 
program insecticide's role in this decrease is not clear. Existing research serves to outline the 
impact of these pesticides on pollinators of the order Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera primarily but 
also delves into pollinators of other orders to a lesser extent.

impact of these pesticides on pollinators of the order Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera primarily but 
also delves into pollinators of other orders to a lesser extent.  
The availability of native floral resources is a primary determinant of the composition and 
abundance of bees and other pollinators in rangeland ecosystems in the United States (Potts et al. 
2003, Gilgert and Vaughan 2011, Tuell et al, 2014). Approximately 4,000 different bee species aid 
in pollination in the United States (Black et al, 2011, Gilgert and Vaughan 2011). Many secondary 
pollinators such as moths and butterflies, wasps, flies, and beetles also contribute to distributing 
pollen despite being less efficient than bees (Larson et al, 2018).  
A
ccording to Goosey et al., rangeland ecosystems are primarily pollinated by bee species. At 27 
pastures in central Montana specimens from 27, 24, and 16 different bee genera were captured 
during 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Lasioglossum (Dialictus), Agapostemon, and Eucera 
were the most common genera captured constituting more than half (58%) of bee specimens. 
Halictus was the fourth most common genera, adding another 7% to the total bee capture. In 2016, 
secondary pollinators were ~8% of total pollinator catch. Lepidopterans were 10-fold more 
abundant than Syrphidae as sec-ond
ary pollinators across all years. Secondary pollinators were 
19% and 13% of the total catch in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

urthermore, the researchers found in 2016 and 2017 bee abundance increased where periodic 
grazing of pastures provided suitable nesting habitat for these rangeland pollinators. They 
suggested forage consumption and hoof action likely created the unvegetated space required for 
reproduction by these mostly solitary, ground-nesting bees.  However, abundances of secondary 
pollinators (i.e., butterflies and hover flies) were unrelated to grazing during two of the three study 
years. According to Gilgert and Vaughan, the diverse plant landscapes that rangelands are 
composed meet the needs of a variety of pollinators, including Hymenopterans and Lepidopterans. 
Idling large swaths of rangelands could be detrimental to bee populations because most ground-
nesting species exhibit breeding-site fidelity, with multiple generations returning to nest in the 
same pasture (Michener 2007). 
The Xerces society promotes a symbiotic relationship between pollinators and rangelands, with 
each benefitting from the others existence (Buxton et al.). Noting rangelands provide large 
contiguous areas of food and shelter habitat for pollinators. Likewise, the pollination of a wide 
array of wildflowers produces valuable forage for cattle and wildlife, supports soil health, and 
makes grasslands more resilient. Information about rangeland pollinators species is generally 
limited, with most of it coming from “uncoordinated, short-term, small-scale sampling focusing on

 and shelter habitat for pollinators. Likewise, the pollination of a wide 
array of wildflowers produces valuable forage for cattle and wildlife, supports soil health, and 
makes grasslands more resilient. Information about rangeland pollinators species is generally 
limited, with most of it coming from “uncoordinated, short-term, small-scale sampling focusing on 
bees and butterflies” (Hanberry et al). Though this information is limited, studies on bees of the 
Great Plains indicate that about two-thirds of the bee species in rangelands are generalists, which 
use many families of plants for nectar and nesting. With this information about generalist nature of 
bees in rangelands, and the increased biodiversity caused by grazing, pollinators of the rangelands 
`

are very likely widespread in both species and location, which can increase their resiliency to 
disturbances.  
Therefore, pesticides applications will also potentially impact a much more abundant and rich 
collection of pollinators due to the unique qualities of rangeland habitats. Additionally, the 
presence of agrochemicals and other pesticides have been found in samples of bee tissue from the 
Great Plains, likely due to the conversion of land from pollinator friendly rangeland to crop fields 
(Hladik et al 2016, Otto et al 2016). In Oregon rangeland, treatments could affect these abundant 
and species rich areas, but nearby untreated areas will allow recolonization if so.  
According to a sampling of native bee communities across broad Canadian ecoregions Kohler et al 
2020, found climate and geographic variables caused differences in species abundance, richness, 
and composition, indicating that assessments on impacts may not be generalizable across the entire 
rangeland ecosystem. The researchers

According to a sampling of native bee communities across broad Canadian ecoregions Kohler et al 
2020, found climate and geographic variables caused differences in species abundance, richness, 
and composition, indicating that assessments on impacts may not be generalizable across the entire 
rangeland ecosystem. The researchers found bee community composition was significantly 
different across regions (i.e., Canadian grassland, parkland and boreal areas) and between land use 
types (i.e., rangeland and canola cropland). Within rangeland communities it may be difficult to 
understand the best conservation measures for bees due to the variance in responses on a larger 
scale. 
Pollinators in Oregon include economically important managed exotic species such as European 
honeybee and alfalfa leafcutting bee, and a vast diversity of native species, including many kinds of 
solitary and eusocial bees. Additional pollinators include wasps and ants, flies, hoverflies and bee-
mimicking flies, many families of beetles, true bugs, moths and butterflies, as well as vertebrate 
pollinators. All pollinators are considered non-target species requiring consideration and protection 
from treatment program impacts, but a large and particularly diverse group of pollinators that 
deserve special attention are native bees. The Oregon Bee Atlas project 
(extension.oregonstate.edu/bee-atlas) funded in part by the USDA, has documented 
approximately 750 species of bees native to Oregon, most of which occur in the more arid parts of 
the state, especially in wilderness areas and areas with diverse floral nectaries. This cooperative 
public science project has significantly clarified relationships between bee species and the host 
plants from which they gather nectar and pollen

las) funded in part by the USDA, has documented 
approximately 750 species of bees native to Oregon, most of which occur in the more arid parts of 
the state, especially in wilderness areas and areas with diverse floral nectaries. This cooperative 
public science project has significantly clarified relationships between bee species and the host 
plants from which they gather nectar and pollen and help to pollinate and reproduce sexually in the 
process. Some species of insects are obligate pollinators of rare plants, meaning the plants cannot 
reproduce without them, and such relationships are helping to be clarified by the project.  
Other ecological services which both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates provide are less obvious 
but equally important, including nutrient cycling, decomposition and stimulating plant regrowth. 
Many species of herbivorous and omnivorous arthropods including a great diversity of 
grasshoppers are in this general category. Finally, as described already, parasitic and predacious 
invertebrates (e.g. arachnids, mantids, and dragonflies) help regulate herbivores while also 
providing food to larger animals. Invertebrates in general are incredibly important to ecosystem 
health and provide quantitatively the greatest animal biodiversity within these ecosystems.  
Two specific non-target invertebrate species of potential concern, which have been previously 
identified in public scoping for the program, are Leona’s little blue butterfly (Philotiella leona) and 
the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The monarch butterfly may potentially be found 
throughout Oregon and is proposed for ESA status. In contrast, the Leona’s little blue butterfly is 
only documented in certain areas of Klamath County, particularly near the Upper Klamath Marsh 
National Wildlife Refuge. A request for program treatment

the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The monarch butterfly may potentially be found 
throughout Oregon and is proposed for ESA status. In contrast, the Leona’s little blue butterfly is 
only documented in certain areas of Klamath County, particularly near the Upper Klamath Marsh 
National Wildlife Refuge. A request for program treatment in Klamath county by federal land 
managers has not been directed to APHIS since 2013. Subsequent Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
listings have resulted in a lack of federally managed rangeland in the county that does not also have 
`  
Page | 49 
 
an abundance of ESA protected species and critical habitat (see figure 5). For these reasons, 
Klamath County is no longer included in this EA. The program will not have any impact on this 
butterfly therefore, except as described in the No Suppression Program Alternative section of this 
EA (IV.A.1.), in that the absence of an APHIS run program may result in neighboring private 
landowners using more and stronger pesticides, which could potentially impact this species 
negatively.

c) Vertebrates 
Though less directly at risk from many modern pesticides targeting insects, including both 
considered in this EA, many other non-target species occur in areas prone to grasshopper outbreaks 
and potential treatments. Vertebrates occurring in rangelands of Oregon include introduced 
livestock and pets (e.g. cows, goats, sheep, horses, poultry, cats, dogs) and native species including 
carnivores (e.g. coyotes, foxes, wolves, cougars), large herbivorous mammals (

and potential treatments. Vertebrates occurring in rangelands of Oregon include introduced 
livestock and pets (e.g. cows, goats, sheep, horses, poultry, cats, dogs) and native species including 
carnivores (e.g. coyotes, foxes, wolves, cougars), large herbivorous mammals (e.g. deer, elk, 
pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep), smaller ones (e.g. rabbits, gophers), omnivores (e.g. badgers, 
mice, bats). Various reptiles, amphibians and fish are also present.  
Birds comprise a large portion of the vertebrate species complex, and they also include exotic and 
native species. Some exotic game birds, like pheasant and partridge, have been deliberately 
introduced into the area, and other species such as starlings and pigeons have expanded into the 
area. Sage obligate bird species, typified by sage-grouse, are potentially present in much of eastern

Oregon rangeland. Herbivorous vertebrate species may compete with some species of grasshoppers 
for forage, while omnivorous and predacious species can utilize grasshoppers and other insects as 
an important food source. There is special concern about the role of grasshoppers as a food source 
for sage-grouse, sharp-tail grouse, and other bird species. Given program methods and materials, 
impacts on vertebrate species are expected to be minimal, as described in greater detail in various 
parts of the Environmental Consequences Chapter.

 sharp-tail grouse, and other bird species. Given program methods and materials, 
impacts on vertebrate species are expected to be minimal, as described in greater detail in various 
parts of the Environmental Consequences Chapter.  
d) Flora 
A diverse community of terrestrial plants also occur in potential program areas. Non-native plants, 
including invasive weeds such as annual grasses (e.g. cheat grass, venenata), annual forbs (e.g. 
diffuse knapweed, Scotch thistle, yellow starthistle), perennial forbs (e.g. Canada thistle, Russian 
thistle, leafy spurge, white top), and woody plants (e.g. Russian olive, tamarisk) are common in 
areas prone to grasshopper outbreaks and may help to support these populations (see Photos 4 & 5, 
and discussion in part II.B. Description of Grasshopper Species). Land managers can help limit 
future outbreaks by controlling invasive weeds on their property, in some cases, but not always, as 
discussed in part III.b. Description of Grasshopper Species. 
A great diversity of native plants (e.g. sagebrush, bitterbrush, numerous grasses and forbs) are 
endemic to eastern Oregon rangeland. Rare flowering plants may also occur in or near areas where 
treatments are requested. As with buffering of other rare species, this is a collaborative 
responsibility of the land manager, APHIS, and wildlife management agencies, to identify and 
buffer out plants species as dictated by applicable policy or preference from treatment requests 
during the planning phase, or proposed treatment blocks during final review. Though not rare, 
milkweed plants (which support monarch butterfly) would be an example of a plant species that

buffer out plants species as dictated by applicable policy or preference from treatment requests 
during the planning phase, or proposed treatment blocks during final review. Though not rare, 
milkweed plants (which support monarch butterfly) would be an example of a plant species that 
would be desirable to buffer, as requested by anyone involved. APHIS has done so for all projects 
in Oregon for the past five years. The Oregon Flora project (oregonflora.org) supported in part by 
the USDA, is one helpful resource for reviewing treatment areas for plants of concern. Due to 
methods and materials, impacts to flowering plants, including pollination services, are not 
anticipated to be significant by proposed actions, except for the no action alternative, which may 
results in fewer such plants due to herbivory by damaging grasshopper population outbreaks. 
e) Miscellaneous 
Biological soil crusts, also known as cryptogamic, microbiotic, cryptobiotic, and microphytic 
crusts, occur within the proposed suppression area. Biological soil crusts are formed by living 
organisms and their by-products, creating a crust of soil particles bound together by organic 
materials. Crusts are predominantly composed of cyanobacteria (formerly blue-green algae), green 
and brown algae, mosses, and lichens. Liverworts, fungi, and bacteria can also be important 
components. Crusts contribute to various functions in the environment. Because they are 
concentrated in the top 1 to 4 mm of soil, they primarily affect processes that occur at the land 
surface or soil-air interface. These include stabilizing soil against erosion, fixing atmospheric 
nitrogen, providing nutrients to plants, and

components. Crusts contribute to various functions in the environment. Because they are 
concentrated in the top 1 to 4 mm of soil, they primarily affect processes that occur at the land 
surface or soil-air interface. These include stabilizing soil against erosion, fixing atmospheric 
nitrogen, providing nutrients to plants, and improving soil-plant-water relations, infiltration, 
seedling germination, and plant growth. Finally, sundry other organisms (e.g. fungi and fungus-like 
organisms, algae and lichens, non-vascular plants, earthworms and other annelids, both terrestrial 
and aquatic microorganisms) though less visible in rangelands of eastern Oregon are nonetheless 
present and contribute to these ecosystems in various ways. Given program methods and materials, 
negative impacts on these non-targets are expected to be minimal, as described in greater detail in 
the Environmental Consequences Section.

3. Consultation and Assessment Determinations  
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its implementing regulations require Federal 
agencies to ensure their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed 
threatened or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical 
habitat. Within the seven counties and three level III ecoregions under consideration by this EA 
there are federally listed species and areas of designated critical habitat, although few if any occur 
within or near potential grasshopper suppression areas.  
APHIS considers whether listed species, species proposed for listing, experimental populations, or 
critical habitat are present in the proposed suppression area. Before treatments are conducted, 
APHIS contacts the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the National
Text Len: 1847
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 areas of designated critical habitat, although few if any occur 
within or near potential grasshopper suppression areas.  
APHIS considers whether listed species, species proposed for listing, experimental populations, or 
critical habitat are present in the proposed suppression area. Before treatments are conducted, 
APHIS contacts the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS) (where applicable) to determine if listed species are present in the suppression 
area, and whether mitigations or protection measures must be implemented to protect listed species 
or critical habitat.  
APHIS submitted a programmatic biological assessment for grasshopper suppression in the 17-
state program area and requested consultation with USFWS on March 9, 2015. In November 2023 
APHIS revised the biological assessment to address USFWS comments and include species that 
had been listed since 2015. USFWS concurred with APHIS’ determination the grasshopper 
program would have no effect or was not likely to adversely affect listed species and the critical 
habitat on March 21, 2024. USFWS stated:  
As a result of the APHIS program conservation measures such as use of the buffer 
distances discussed above for all taxonomic groups and their designated critical habitats, 
as applicable, along with the reduced application rates as compared to label rates for 
each insecticide, and RAAT treatment procedures, any risk of exposure associated with 
the application of the three insecticides used under the APHIS grasshopper and Mormon 
cricket suppression program is expected to be minimal. Thus, any direct or indirect 
effects from the proposed action to listed species and their designated critical habitats 
are expected to be insignificant due to program conservation measures. 
 
APHIS will also continue to consult with USFWS

the application of the three insecticides used under the APHIS grasshopper and Mormon 
cricket suppression program is expected to be minimal. Thus, any direct or indirect 
effects from the proposed action to listed species and their designated critical habitats

APHIS will also continue to consult with USFWS field offices at the local level to ensure listed 
species habitats are properly buffered during grasshopper suppression treatments, as summarized in 
Appendix C.  
Nationally, APHIS completed a programmatic Section 7 consultation with NMFS for use of 
carbaryl, malathion, and diflubenzuron to suppress grasshoppers in the 17-state program area 
because of the listed salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) and critical habitat. To minimize the possibility 
of insecticides from reaching salmonid habitat, APHIS implements the following protection 
measures:  
• RAATs are used in all areas adjacent to salmonid habitat. 
• ULV sprays are used, which are between 50% and 66% of the USEPA recommended 
rate. 
• Insecticides are not aerially applied in a 3,500 foot buffer zones for carbaryl or 
malathion, or applied within a 1,500 foot buffer zones for diflubenzuron along stream 
corridors. 
• Insecticides will not be applied when wind speeds exceed 10 miles per hour. APHIS will 
attempt to avoid insecticide application if the wind is blowing towards salmonid habitat. 
`

• Insecticide applications are avoided when precipitation is likely or during temperature 
inversions. 
APHIS determined that with the implementation of these measures, the grasshopper suppression

• Insecticide applications are avoided when precipitation is likely or during temperature

APHIS determined that with the implementation of these measures, the grasshopper suppression 
program may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect listed salmonids or designated critical 
habitat in the program area. NMFS concurred with this determination in a letter dated April 12, 
2010.  
a) Protective Measures for Vertebrate Species 
(1) Yellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus 
In Oregon, cuckoos, although never common, have become even rarer with the loss of floodplain 
forests along the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The last confirmed breeding records in Oregon 
were in the 1940s. Records of cuckoos continued in eastern Oregon at Malheur National Wildlife 
Refuge in Harney county specifically, and from Malheur and Deschutes counties generally. Over 
the last 20 years however, more recent reports have come from western Oregon. Mature riparian 
stands on the east side such as on the Owyhee, Snake and Umatilla Rivers are expected to continue 
to have cuckoos reported. Two years ago, one was reported from Harney county at Fields. 
Yellow-billed cuckoos are migratory. Historically, cuckoos arrived in Oregon in mid-May and flew 
south to their wintering grounds in September. The bird primarily eats large insects including 
caterpillars, cicadas, grasshoppers, and Mormon crickets. Breeding coincides with the emergence 
of cicadas and tent caterpillars.

-billed cuckoos are migratory. Historically, cuckoos arrived in Oregon in mid-May and flew 
south to their wintering grounds in September. The bird primarily eats large insects including 
caterpillars, cicadas, grasshoppers, and Mormon crickets. Breeding coincides with the emergence 
of cicadas and tent caterpillars. 
The greatest threat to the species has been reported to be loss of riparian habitat. It has been 
estimated that 90 percent of this cuckoo's stream-side habitat has been lost. Habitat loss in the 
Western US is attributed to agriculture, dams, and river flow management, overgrazing and 
invasive plants such as tamarisk. Activities which alter or destroy riparian habitat are of particular 
concern, including unmanaged cattle grazing that contributes to the loss of sub-canopy vegetation 
and cottonwood regeneration. 
APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket program activities may affect the yellow-billed cuckoo. 
While diflubenzuron and carbaryl are highly toxic to insects they are both only slightly toxic to 
birds. These chemicals should have no direct effect to the yellow-billed cuckoo, but they may cause 
a temporary reduction of prey species, though use of RAATs will help to mitigate this. 
Yellow-billed cuckoo distribution has not been systematically surveyed in eastern Oregon in recent 
years, but the existing record of reports do indicate that Harney County has areas where 
observations are more likely to occur, especially in June and July. APHIS will confer with the 
USFWS to consult recent survey records or conduct surveys of high potential for nesting and 
foraging habitat prior to implementing the suppression program to determine locations of 
yellow-billed cuckoo nests or

observations are more likely to occur, especially in June and July. APHIS will confer with the 
USFWS to consult recent survey records or conduct surveys of high potential for nesting and 
foraging habitat prior to implementing the suppression program to determine locations of 
yellow-billed cuckoo nests or occupied habitat prior to treatment. In addition to this, or if this is 
not possible for any reason,  the water buffers of 500’ for liquid insecticide and 200’ for bait when 
applied by air, 200’ for liquid applied by ground, and 50’ for bait when applied by ground, will be 
extended to begin at the edge of any riparian stands greater than 50 acres or larger, not just from 
the waterbodies present therein, and not exclusive to stands proven to have yellow-billed cuckoo 
populations present. Additionally, the RAATS application method will be used exclusively when 
treating near known, or suspected, yellow-billed cuckoo habitat to preserve non-target insect prey. 
Implementation of these protective measures will assure that the APHIS Grasshopper Suppression 
Program will not likely adversely affect yellow-billed cuckoo.

(2) Oregon Spotted Frog, Rana pretiosa 
Oregon spotted frogs are currently only known to occur in Deschutes, Klamath, Jackson, and Lane 
counties. This species is the most aquatic native frog in the Pacific Northwest. It is almost always 
found in or near a perennial body of water that includes zones of shallow water and abundant 
emergent or floating aquatic plants. Oregon spotted frogs seem to prefer large warm marshes

, Klamath, Jackson, and Lane 
counties. This species is the most aquatic native frog in the Pacific Northwest. It is almost always 
found in or near a perennial body of water that includes zones of shallow water and abundant 
emergent or floating aquatic plants. Oregon spotted frogs seem to prefer large warm marshes 
(approximate minimum size of 4 hectares (9 acres)), as well as riverine corridors with suitably slow 
water or pooling habit, that can support a large enough population to persist despite high predation 
rates and sporadic reproductive failures. Oregon Spotted frogs are known to move several hundred 
meters usually along flooded or saturated corridors. The Oregon spotted frog is now absent from at 
least 76 percent of its former range. Most of the remaining Oregon spotted frog populations are 
small and isolated. 
In central Oregon, spotted frogs breed in mid- to late April. Metamorphosis occurs in mid to late 
summer. Adult spotted frogs are opportunistic feeders, consuming many types of insects, mollusks, 
and other amphibians. Tadpoles are grazers which consume algae and detritus. Spotted frogs are 
highly aquatic and live in or near permanent bodies of water, including lakes, ponds, slow streams 
and marshes; movements of spotted frogs are limited to wet riparian corridors. Standing water, 
flooded meadows, and willows provide breeding, foraging, and overwintering habitat. 
The largest threat to spotted frogs is the destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of wetland 
habitat. Changes in hydrology (from construction of ditches and dams) and water quality, 
development, and livestock overgrazing continue to result in habitat loss, alteration, and/or 
fragmentation. Non-native plant invasions by aggressive species like re

The largest threat to spotted frogs is the destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of wetland 
habitat. Changes in hydrology (from construction of ditches and dams) and water quality, 
development, and livestock overgrazing continue to result in habitat loss, alteration, and/or 
fragmentation. Non-native plant invasions by aggressive species like reed canary grass (Phalaris 
arundinacea), succession of plant communities from marsh to meadow, and invasive predators 
such as bullfrogs, bass and other predatory fish species are believed to contribute to their decline. 
Direct toxic effects could occur to Spotted frogs should they be exposed to program insecticides, 
but this will be mitigated sufficiently by program buffers to prevent any significant impacts. 
Indirect effects through loss of prey items could also occur if program chemicals were to reach 
occupied habitat. The APHIS Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program maintains a 
standard, programmatic 500 foot buffer from water for aerial Dimilin treatments, a 200 foot buffer 
from water for all aerial bait treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground 
treatments, and a 50 foot buffer from water for all ground bait treatments. These standard buffers 
are in place to reduce the chance that a pesticide used for grasshopper suppression will enter water. 
Monitoring of APHIS grasshopper treatments by Beyers and McEwen (1996) concluded that the 
standard buffer resulted in trace amounts of pesticide in aquatic habitats, and that grasshopper 
control operations had no biologically significant effect on aquatic resources. 
APHIS will confer with USFWS to determine locations of spotted frog habitat prior to treatment.

APHIS will confer with USFWS to determine locations of spotted frog habitat prior to treatment. 
Implementation of these protective measures will assure that the APHIS Grasshopper Suppression 
Program will not likely adversely affect spotted frog. 
b) Protective Measures for Fish Species 
(1) General Protective Measures 
The APHIS Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program does not apply insecticides 
directly to water bodies (defined herein as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by seasonal streams, 
springs, wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers). Furthermore, APHIS provides the following 
`  
Page | 54 
 
buffers for water bodies: 500-foot buffer with aerial liquid insecticide; 200 foot buffer with ground 
liquid insecticide; 200-foot buffer with aerial bait; and 50-foot buffer with ground bait. 
These standard buffers are in place to reduce the chance that a pesticide used for grasshopper 
suppression will enter water. Monitoring of APHIS grasshopper treatments by Beyers and McEwen 
(1996) concluded that the standard buffer resulted in trace amounts of pesticide in aquatic habitats, 
and that grasshopper control operations had no biologically significant effect on aquatic resources.  
However, APHIS recognizes that even trace amounts of pesticides entering locations inhabited by 
listed fish species may be of concern. Therefore, the standard buffers for carbaryl and 
diflubenzuron liquid applications have been increased in distance in order to protect listed fish 
species and their prey, that is no aerial application of liquid pesticides within 0.25 mile of occupied 
habitats. 
Chronic effects to listed fish species are unlikely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 by 
listed fish species may be of concern. Therefore, the standard buffers for carbaryl and 
diflubenzuron liquid applications have been increased in distance in order to protect listed fish 
species and their prey, that is no aerial application of liquid pesticides within 0.25 mile of occupied 
habitats. 
Chronic effects to listed fish species are unlikely even assuming the worst case scenario because: 1) 
the insecticides APHIS uses are non-persistent in water; 2) APHIS applies only a single application 
of a single insecticide to a grasshopper treatment area only one time a year – there are no multiple 
treatments; 3) in the unusual case that APHIS would return to an area treated the previous year, any 
insecticides applied by APHIS would have degraded; and 4) the insecticide APHIS could use and 
at the application rate APHIS would apply, there are few, if any, chronic properties that could 
affect listed fish species. 
There is also some potential for a very effective grasshopper treatment to affect listed fish species 
indirectly and adversely by reduction of prey base. RAATs will be required for use in areas with 
ESA fish or habitat species, to ensure that the suppression treatment does not suppress 
grasshoppers or non-target insects too severely. Additionally, normal treatment buffers for riparian 
areas will help to ensure a continued food source in the area to limit such indirect adverse effects.  
Therefore, when the above protection measures are implemented listed fish species are not likely to 
be adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, by APHIS grasshopper program activities.

 the area to limit such indirect adverse effects.  
Therefore, when the above protection measures are implemented listed fish species are not likely to 
be adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, by APHIS grasshopper program activities. 
(2) Bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus 
Bull trout occur in rivers and tributaries throughout the Columbia Basin in Montana, Idaho, 
Washington, Oregon, and Nevada, as well as the Klamath Basin in Oregon, and several 
cross-boundary drainages in extreme southeast Alaska. They are mostly found in high 
elevation forested areas, not likely to be targeted for grasshopper control or suppression. 
This lack of geographic overlap of program treatment areas with bull trout habitat, as well as 
the above-described general protection measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for 
known ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, 
either directly or indirectly. 
(3) Hutton tui chub, Gila bicolor spp. 
The Hutton tui chub is found in spring systems and outflow channels. The size of the Hutton 
Spring holes range from 20-40 feet in width, and about 15 ft in depth at its center. The smaller 
spring hole is about 10 feet across and 2 feet deep. The spring holes are surrounded by water 
parsley, sedge, saltgrass, and squirreltail, which the chub use for cover. No details of 
reproduction are known, except that fish of 17 millimeters (mm) have been seen in late July, 
which infers that spawning probably takes place in May or June.

reproduction are known, except that fish of 17 millimeters (mm) have been seen in late July, 
which infers that spawning probably takes place in May or June. 
`  
Page | 55 
 
The fish feed on zooplankton, insects, gastropods, and plants. Juvenile Hutton tui chubs feed 
on zooplankton of appropriate size, and apparently feed on small insects as well. At 50 to 60 
mm in length, the fish’s diet shifts toward plant material and they remain omnivorous, 
feeding on vegetation, insect, and gastropods. 
It is found only in Hutton Spring, a small spring system with surface flow in two areas located 
in the now dry alkali lake in Lake County, South Central Oregon and in another small 
unnamed spring 3/8 mile southeast of Hutton Spring (3/8 Mile Spring)(USDOI, USFWS, 1998). 
Threats to the populations of Hutton tui chubs includes pumping of water for agricultural 
irrigation from the springs which occurred in the past but has since decreased. Other threats 
include trampling of habitats by livestock and contamination of ground water by dispersal of 
chemicals from a nearby herbicide-manufacturing residue disposal site south of Hutton 
Spring. 
Hutton Spring and 3/8 Mile Spring are located on private lands in Lake County. It is unlikely 
that the private landowner(s) would make a request to APHIS to apply pesticides on their 
lands around Hutton Spring or 3/8 Mile Spring, however if a treatment in the area did occur, 
standard program buffers would of course apply, whether the habitat was included in the 
treatment area directly or simply adjacent to it.

measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for known ESA species populations, 
should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, 
Hutton tui chub populations. 
(4) Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii 
henshawi 
The Lahontan cutthroat trout is a lacustrine subspecies, which was isolated as a consequence of 
geologic change. Within southeastern Oregon, Lahontan cutthroat trout occur in Willow Creek and 
Whitehorse Creek and their tributaries, which are within the Coyote Lake watershed which is 
within the larger Alvord Lake basin. In addition, Lahontan cutthroat trout were transferred to 
previously fishless streams flowing off the east side of the Steens and Pueblo Mountains. Willow 
Creek and one unnamed tributary stream to Willow Creek is the entire occupied Lahontan cutthroat 
trout habitat in the Willow Creek watershed.  Whitehorse Creek, Little Whitehorse Creek, 
Sheepline Canyon Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Antelope Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Doolittle 
Creek are tributaries to Whitehorse Creek which are either occupied or historic Lahontan cutthroat 
trout habitat. The streams into which Lahontan cutthroat trout were transferred on the east side of 
the Steens Mountains are Big Alvord

epline Canyon Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Antelope Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Doolittle 
Creek are tributaries to Whitehorse Creek which are either occupied or historic Lahontan cutthroat 
trout habitat. The streams into which Lahontan cutthroat trout were transferred on the east side of 
the Steens Mountains are Big Alvord Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Little Alvord Creek, McCoy 
Creek, Mosquito Creek, Pike Creek, and Willow Creek.  In the Pueblo Mountains, Denio Creek 
and Van Horn Creek were planted with Lahontan cutthroat trout. Within the northern portion of the 
Quinn River watershed, Lahontan cutthroat trout are located in McDermitt Creek and its tributaries. 
Tributaries which are or historically were occupied by Lahontan cutthroat trout include McDermitt 
Creek, North Fork McDermitt Creek, Sage Creek, Line Canyon Creek, Corral Canyon Creek and 
Riser Creek. Lahontan cutthroat trout may have historically occupied Indian Creek; however, the 
current status of the population in Indian Creek is unknown.   
During periods of high precipitation, Lahontan cutthroat trout are believed to ascend river or stream 
waterways to spawn in the gravel riffles, depositing fertilized eggs in the gravel sediment. Upon 
`

hatching, the young remain in that habitat for a time, feeding on aquatic invertebrates or insect 
larvae before migrating downstream. 
The above-described general protection measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for known 
ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly 
or indirectly, Lahontan cutthroat trout populations.

ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly 
or indirectly, Lahontan cutthroat trout populations. 
Both the Lost River and shortnose suckers are lake dwelling species, but spawn in tributary streams 
or springs. Larval Lost River and shortnose suckers usually spend little time in tributary streams 
and migrate back to the lake shortly after their swim up. Larval sucker migration from the 
spawning sites can begin in May or June. After emigrating from the parental spawning sites in late 
spring, larval and juvenile Lost River and shortnose suckers inhabited near shore waters, primarily 
under 50 cm in depth. 
The primary refuge for both species is Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath County, Oregon. Hybridized 
populations of both species are also known from the Lost River system and other nearby areas of 
Klamath County, Oregon. Both species also have been collected from J. C. Boyle Reservoir, 
Klamath County, Oregon. Shortnose suckers have also been collected in Winema National Forest 
of Klamath County from Lake of the Woods, although these were reportedly lost in 1952 during a 
fish eradication project aimed at other species. 
The shortnose sucker (Chasmistes brevirostris) and the Lost River sucker (Deltistes luxatus) are 
restricted to the Klamath Basin of south central Oregon and north central California. The Upper 
Klamath Lake and its tributaries are the primary refuge for the species although both have been

The shortnose sucker (Chasmistes brevirostris) and the Lost River sucker (Deltistes luxatus) are 
restricted to the Klamath Basin of south central Oregon and north central California. The Upper 
Klamath Lake and its tributaries are the primary refuge for the species although both have been 
found in Copco Reservoir and Clear Lake Reservoir, California, and Boyle Reservoir, Oregon. 
Shortnose suckers have also been taken from Lake of the Woods, Oregon. Lost suckers have been 
found from Sheepy Lake, Lower Klamath Lake, and Tule Lake in California. 
Forms of water manipulation, such as damming, instream flow diversion, draining of marshes, and 
dredging of the Upper Klamath Lake, have contributed to the widespread decline of both species. 
In addition, hybridization, competition and predation by exotic species, insularization of habitat, 
and water quality problems associated with timber harvest, removal of riparian vegetation, 
livestock grazing, and agricultural practices are also suggested as reasons for their decline. 
The above-described general protection measures for waterways, and the added buffers for known 
ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly 
or indirectly, shortnose sucker populations. 
(5) Warner sucker, Catostomus warnerensis 
The species is endemic to the Warner Basin of south-central Oregon, with known populations that 
include: the Warner Lake Basin of south-central Oregon, Lake County, near the California/Nevada 
line, and Nevada portion of Twelvemile Creek, Nevada. It reported in portions of Crump and Hart 
Lakes; a spillway canal north of Hart Lake; Snyder Creek; Deep (=Warner) Creek; Honey

 south-central Oregon, with known populations that 
include: the Warner Lake Basin of south-central Oregon, Lake County, near the California/Nevada 
line, and Nevada portion of Twelvemile Creek, Nevada. It reported in portions of Crump and Hart 
Lakes; a spillway canal north of Hart Lake; Snyder Creek; Deep (=Warner) Creek; Honey Creek 
(above the dam at Plush, and at its mouth at Hart Lake); Twentymile Creek (between the south end 
of Warner Valley floor and the confluence with Twelvemile Creek); and Twelvemile Creek 
(immediately above and below the O'Keefe Diversion Dam) (Williams et al., 1990). 
The Warner sucker spawns over silt-free gravel substrate in low gradient streams. At least some 
young may move immediately into lakes, but this remains an outstanding question (Lee et al., 
1980). It has been threatened by water diversion structures, siltation of gravel beds used for 
spawning, and the introduction of exotic species which prey upon juveniles. A spreading labyrinth 
`  
Page | 57 
 
of irrigation ditches, dams, and canals now block the major creeks that feed the Warner Valley 
lakes thus disrupting spawning runs. 
Understanding of this species complex, obligatory life-cycle and seasonal distribution within its 
limited range, continue to improve, as well as resulting proactive measures to support them: 
“Relatively recent anthropomorphic alterations to the aquatic environment in the valley presents 
challenges to the species’ ability to express the full suite of its life history characteristics. Recently, 
there has been a concerted effort among management agencies and landowners to provide fish 
passage through the numerous diversion dams and to screen irrigation canals in the valley. These

there has been a concerted effort among management agencies and landowners to provide fish 
passage through the numerous diversion dams and to screen irrigation canals in the valley. These 
changes, along with other habitat improvements, should help Warner Suckers better carry out all 
aspects of their life history” (ODFW, 2019). 
Since this is a relatively dynamic species and science, any requests for APHIS treatments in the 
Warner Basin will require additional consultation from APHIS with land managers and wildlife 
experts to ensure that the latest population modelling is used for the enhanced ESA protection 
buffers around potential Warner sucker populations. 
The above-described general protection measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for known 
ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly 
or indirectly, Warner sucker populations.  
c) Protective Measures for Plant Species 
(1) General Protective Measures 
APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket program activities may adversely affect Applegate’s 
milk-vetch, Howell’s spectacular thelypody, and Spalding’s catchfly (listed plant species). The 
insecticide used for a grasshopper treatment could reduce pollinators of these species and the 
equipment used for a ground application could damage individual plants or modify the habitat. In 
order to protect listed plant species, APHIS will implement the following measures from the edge 
of known listed plant species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used from 
known locations of listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 ft. 
from the edge of known locations of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 damage individual plants or modify the habitat. In 
order to protect listed plant species, APHIS will implement the following measures from the edge 
of known listed plant species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used from 
known locations of listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 ft. 
from the edge of known locations of this plant. When these measures are implemented grasshopper 
program activities are not likely to adversely affect listed plant species. 
The highest potential for a grasshopper treatment to directly affect listed plant species involves the 
use of ground equipment which could physically damage a plant or modify the habitat. Toxicity is 
unlikely because the insecticides that could be used by the APHIS Grasshopper and Mormon 
Cricket Suppression Program are not phytotoxic. However, the successful reproduction of plants is 
often highly dependent upon adequate populations of pollinators, and the insect populations that 
may pollinate listed plant species could be reduced by the insecticide used in a grasshopper 
treatment. 
An important part of the APHIS GIPM project in the 1990’s were studies to better understand the 
reproductive biology of rare rangeland plants and the effects of insecticides on rangeland plant 
pollinators (see Alston and Tepedino 1996, and Tepedino 1996). Among the findings of those 
studies were that carbaryl bait may be a relatively safe option to protect pollinators.  
APHIS recognizes that the pollination and reproductive processes of rare plants are extremely 
complex and not well understood in many cases. While the Grasshopper IPM Program made some 
progress into understanding these issues, sufficient information still does not exist to precisely 
`

 option to protect pollinators.  
APHIS recognizes that the pollination and reproductive processes of rare plants are extremely 
complex and not well understood in many cases. While the Grasshopper IPM Program made some 
progress into understanding these issues, sufficient information still does not exist to precisely 
`  
Page | 58 
 
determine adequate protective measures for rare plant pollinators. In the 1987 BO for the 
Grasshopper Program, the USFWS stipulated a 3-mile buffer zone restricting the use of aerial Ultra 
Low Volume (ULV) applications around occupied habitats with no restrictions on the use of 
carbaryl bait. Although these measures were based more on best guesses rather than accurate 
estimates (Tepedino, 1996), APHIS does not have the resources to conduct the level of research 
that would be needed to refine those measures. Thus, the measures APHIS is proposing to protect 
listed plant species are mostly the same measures derived in 1987. 
The current measures proposed by APHIS include a 3 mile buffer for any liquid pesticide 
application for grasshopper suppression. This is essentially the same as the 1987 buffer, except that 
ground applications were not addressed in 1987, but have now been grouped with aerial 
applications. 
Because the RAATs strategy uses a pesticide at a rate that is less than the rate conventionally used, 
and typically 50% or more of the treatment area is not directly treated (skip swathing), the overall 
pesticide deposition is dramatically reduced and many pollinators within a treatment area would be 
protected from direct exposure to the insecticide. Also, studies have indicated that diflubenzuron 
treatments against rangeland grasshoppers have no effect on pollinators, even one year post-
treatment (Catangui et al

skip swathing), the overall 
pesticide deposition is dramatically reduced and many pollinators within a treatment area would be 
protected from direct exposure to the insecticide. Also, studies have indicated that diflubenzuron 
treatments against rangeland grasshoppers have no effect on pollinators, even one year post-
treatment (Catangui et al., 1996). This reduces impacts to pollinators outside of the 3 mile buffer 
area. 
The 50 foot buffer for carbaryl bait proposed by APHIS is more restrictive than in 1987 when there 
was no restriction on bait. Although carbaryl bait poses little, if any, risk to bees (Alston and 
Tepedino 1996) the 50 foot buffer will prevent equipment used to apply carbaryl bait from 
physically damaging plants or their habitat. 
Therefore, when the above protection measures are implemented listed plant species populations 
are not likely to be adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, by APHIS grasshopper program 
activities. 
(2) Howell’s spectacular thelypody, Thelypodium howellii 
ssp. spectabilis 
Howell’s spectacular thelypody is a biennial herb of the mustard family endemic to a small range 
in eastern Oregon. The plant is currently known from 11 sites (5 populations) ranging in size from 
0.03 acres to 41.4 acres in the Baker-Powder River Valley in Baker and Union counties. The total 
occupied habitat for this species is approximately 100 acres, all of which is privately-owned. The 
entire extant range of this taxon lies within a 13 mile radius of Haines, Oregon.

 Baker and Union counties. The total 
occupied habitat for this species is approximately 100 acres, all of which is privately-owned. The 
entire extant range of this taxon lies within a 13 mile radius of Haines, Oregon. 
Howell’s spectacular thelypody occurs in moist, alkaline meadow habitats at approximately 3,000 
feet to 3,500 feet elevation, usually in and around woody shrubs such as greasewood or 
rabbitbrush. Soils are pluvial-deposited alkaline clays mixed with recent alluvial silts and are 
moderately well-drained. 
This taxon is threatened by a variety of factors including habitat destruction and fragmentation 
from agricultural and urban development; spring and early summer grazing by domestic livestock; 
competition from non-native vegetation; and alterations of wetland hydrology. The use of certain 
pesticides could indirectly affect this taxon since the pesticides could harm the insect pollinators 
that Howell’s spectacular thelypody relies upon to reproduce (USDOI, USFWS, 2002).

(1) Miscellaneous 
APHIS implements best management practices (BMPs) in treatment strategies that are designed to 
protect nontarget invertebrates, including pollinators. APHIS minimizes insecticide use by using 
lower than labeled rates for all Program insecticides, alternating swaths during treatment, making 
only one application per season and minimizing use of liquid broad-spectrum insecticides. APHIS 
also continues to evaluate new monitoring and control methods designed to respond to 
economically damaging populations of grasshoppers and Mormon crickets while protecting 
rangeland resources such as pollinators. APHIS considers the role of pollinators in any 
consultations conducted with the USFWS to protect federally listed plants. Mitigation measures, 
such as no treatment buffers are applied with consideration of the protection of pollinators that are 
important to a listed plant species.  
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 U.S.C. 703–712) established a Federal prohibition,

by any means whatever, receive for shipment, transportation or carriage, or export, at any time, or 
in any manner, any migratory bird or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird. 
APHIS will support the conservation intent of the migratory bird conventions by integrating bird 
conservation principles, measures, and practices into agency activities and by avoiding or reducing, 
to the extent practicable, adverse impacts on migratory bird resources when conducting agency 
actions. Impacts are minimized as a result of buffers to water, habitat, nesting areas, riparian areas, 
and the use of RAATs. For any given treatment, only a portion of the environment will be treated, 
therefore minimizing potential impacts to migratory bird populations. 
The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668–668c) prohibits anyone, without a 
permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, from “taking” bald eagles, including their parts, 
nests, or eggs. During the breeding season, bald eagles are sensitive to a variety of human 
activities. Grasshopper management activities could cause disturbance of nesting eagles, depending 
on the duration, noise levels, extent of the area affected by the activity,

 the Secretary of the Interior, from “taking” bald eagles, including their parts, 
nests, or eggs. During the breeding season, bald eagles are sensitive to a variety of human 
activities. Grasshopper management activities could cause disturbance of nesting eagles, depending 
on the duration, noise levels, extent of the area affected by the activity, prior experiences that 
eagles have with humans, and tolerance of the individual nesting pair. However, rangeland 
grasshopper suppression treatments occur during the late spring or early summer, after the nesting 
season when eagle young typically will have already fledged. The program also recognizes 
disruptive activities in or near eagle foraging areas can interfere with bald eagle feeding, reducing 
chances of survival. Program operational procedures that prevent applications near water bodies 
will reduce the possibility of disturbing eagle foraging activities. USFWS has provided 
recommendations for avoiding disturbance at foraging areas and communal roost sites that are 
applicable to grasshopper management programs (USFWS, 2007).  
No toxic effects are anticipated on eagles as a direct consequence of insecticide treatments. Toxic 
effects on the principal food source, fish, are not expected because insecticide treatments will not 
be conducted over rivers or lakes. Buffers protective of aquatic biota are applied to their habitats to 
ensure that there are no indirect effects from loss of prey. 
There may be species that are of special concern to land management agencies, the public, or other 
groups and individuals in proposed treatment areas. For example, the sage grouse populations have 
declined throughout most of their entire range, with habitat loss being a major factor in their 
decline.

groups and individuals in proposed treatment areas. For example, the sage grouse populations have 
declined throughout most of their entire range, with habitat loss being a major factor in their 
decline. 
(2) Protection of Greater Sage-Grouse 
There is special concern about the role of grasshoppers as a food source for sage grouse and other 
insectivorous vertebrate species found in Oregon rangeland. Grasshopper suppression programs 
reduce grasshoppers and potentially non-target insects in the treatment area that are food items for 
such species, including sage grouse chicks. There is low potential that the program insecticides 
would be toxic to these populations, either by direct exposure to the insecticides or indirectly 
through eating moribund grasshoppers. Further, because grasshopper numbers are so high in 
outbreak years, and usually composed of just a few species, treatments would not likely reduce the 
number of grasshoppers below levels present in a normal year and may increase the diversity of 
herbivorous insects overall. What constitutes ‘normal’ grasshopper population levels will vary by 
location, but in general a diversity of grasshopper species at densities of 5 per square yard might be 
considered normal in many areas. Should grasshoppers be unavailable in small, localized areas, 
sage grouse chicks may catch what grasshoppers are available as well as other insects, which  
would be normal in naturally down-cycle years for grasshopper populations. By suppressing 
grasshoppers, rangeland vegetation is available for use by other species, and rangeland areas are

of concern which utilize tall sage habitat extensively. 
The Oregon Greater Sage-grouse Approved Resource Management Plan (GRSG ARMPA) of 2015 
was developed in leu of listing this species under endangered species act protection and is overseen 
by the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife (ODFW) pursuant to state law 
(www.dfw.state.or.us/wildlife/sagegrouse/docs/OAR_140_Greater_Sage-Grouse_Cons_Strat.pdf). 
A summary of mitigation plans, policies and GIS tools is maintained at 
www.dfw.state.or.us/wildlife/sagegrouse/mitigation.asp, including the following map of habitat 
designations.

(3) Protection of Columbia Spotted Frog 

`  
Page | 63 
 
The Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) Great Basin Distinct Population Segment is known 
to occur in potential program counties of Lake, Harney, and Malheur, Oregon. USFWS has 
determined that protection under the Endangered Species Act is no longer warranted and has 
withdrawn the species from the candidate species list. However, USFWS is recommending 
protection measures of this species, similar to Oregon spotted frog. The program will work with 
USFWS to avoid areas occupied by Columbia spotted frog and to implement conservation 
objectives and protection measures recommended by USFWS and BLM prior to commencing with 
any treatment projects. 
Program activities may affect spotted frogs, since direct toxic effects could occur to Spotted frogs 
should they be exposed to program insecticides. Further, indirect effects through loss of prey items 
could occur if program chemicals were to reach occupied habitat. The program maintains a 
standard 500 foot buffer from water for all aerial ULV treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for 
all aerial bait treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground treatments, and a 50 
foot buffer from water for all ground bait treatments (also referred to as ‘programmatic buffers’). 
Text Len: 1793
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 chemicals were to reach occupied habitat. The program maintains a 
standard 500 foot buffer from water for all aerial ULV treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for 
all aerial bait treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground treatments, and a 50 
foot buffer from water for all ground bait treatments (also referred to as ‘programmatic buffers’). 
These buffers are in place to reduce the chance that a pesticide used for grasshopper suppression 
will enter water. Monitoring of APHIS grasshopper treatments by Beyers and McEwen (1996) 
concluded that the standard buffer resulted in trace amounts of pesticide in aquatic habitats, and 
that grasshopper control operations had no biologically significant effect on aquatic resources. 
APHIS will confer with USFWS to determine locations of spotted frog habitat prior to treatment 
and apply programmatic buffers to these and other water bodies. Implementation of these 
protective measures will assure that the program will not likely adversely affect spotted frog. 
(4) Protection of Borax Lake Chubb 
The Borax Lake chub (Gila boraxobius) was emergency-listed as endangered in 1980, and a final 
listing rule with critical habitat was published in 1982. A recovery plan was published in 1987. On 
February 26, 2019, USFWS published a proposal to remove the Borax Lake chub, and its critical 
habitat, from the list of Endangered and Threatened Species in the federal register. In 2020, 
USFWS removed the Borax Lake chub from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife on the basis of recovery.

 the federal register. In 2020, 
USFWS removed the Borax Lake chub from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife on the basis of recovery. 
Borax Lake chubs are opportunistic omnivores whose feeding habits vary a great deal with 
maturity level and seasonal occurrence of prey. Diatoms, chironomid larvae, 
microcrustaceans, and adult dipterans are primary food during the spring. In the summer, 
terrestrial insects play a more important role in the diet. Chironomid larvae are important in 
the winter when terrestrial insects are not abundant. Adults tend to consume more 
gastropods and diatoms than juveniles which tend to consume more copepods and 
terrestrial insects. Fish feed by picking food from soft bottom sediments or from rocks. 
Feeding takes place throughout the water column generally all day with a peak just after 
sunset. Relatively little is known about the biology of this species, including how it manages 
to survive in waters with such a high borate concentration. 
  
Borax Lake chubs spawn through the year, but most spawning takes place in early spring. The 
species mature at a small size, standard length of little more than an inch and seldom lives 
more than 1 year.

This species is found in Borax Lake, a shallow 10-acre, thermal spring fed lake in Harney 
County, Oregon. The lake is named for its concentration of borax, and its ecosystem is 
considered highly susceptible to modification due to irrigation and geothermal projects. The 
Borax Lake chub, resides on private land owned by The Nature Conservancy, within an Area

County, Oregon. The lake is named for its concentration of borax, and its ecosystem is 
considered highly susceptible to modification due to irrigation and geothermal projects. The 
Borax Lake chub, resides on private land owned by The Nature Conservancy, within an Area 
of Critical Environmental Concern designated by the BLM. The Nature Conservancy is not 
likely to make a request to APHIS to apply pesticides on their lands. Therefore, this area 
could be eliminated from the proposed action. Implementation of APHIS’ protective 
measures will assure that the APHIS Grasshopper Suppression Program will not likely 
adversely affect Borax lake chub. 
 
(5) Protection of Foskett Speckled Dace 
The Foskett speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) was listed as threatened in 1985. The listing rule 
found that the designation of critical habitat was not prudent, as identification of the habitat may 
have led to vandalism of the small, isolated springs that support the species.  A recovery plan was 
published in 1998. Due to the successful implementation of the recovery plan, the species' status 
improved, and on October 15, 2019, USFWS announced the removal of the Foskett speckled dace 
from the list of Endangered and Threatened Species. 
The Foskett speckled dace occurs naturally in Foskett Spring, a small spring system found in the 
Coleman Basin on the west side of the Warner Valley, Lake County, Oregon. Its main natural 
habitat is the small, shallow pool at the spring source. The outflow of the spring at one time 
apparently formed a small rivulet, which is

ckled dace occurs naturally in Foskett Spring, a small spring system found in the 
Coleman Basin on the west side of the Warner Valley, Lake County, Oregon. Its main natural 
habitat is the small, shallow pool at the spring source. The outflow of the spring at one time 
apparently formed a small rivulet, which is now obliterated by cattle. The main population is in the 
spring hole, which is about 6 feet in diameter, and mostly 6 to 12 inches wide and deep. Individuals 
live in tiny outflow rivulets that are at times only a few inches wide and deep. Some are found in 
cattle tracks into which water seeps continuously. It requires clean and fresh water with a fairly 
constant temperature. 
 Little is known about the habits of the Foskett speckled dace. Extensive migration is not known, 
but larval and early juvenile dace have been observed only in the marsh at the edge of the lake bed, 
so there is either a migration of adults downstream to spawn or rivulets to the marsh. There has 
been no complete study of food habits for the Foskett speckled dace, but preliminary observations 
indicate the use of small insects and crustaceans and zooplankton by fry. 
 Trampling by cattle is perceived as the main reason for diminution of the habitat. Other threats 
would include encroachment of vegetation, such as cattails, pumping of ground water or 
channelization which would affect water level, flow and increased silt. 
Based on the status of this species, program treatments will not be conducted near Foskett Spring. 
This prohibition in addition to programmatic buffers should result in no adverse impacts to Foskett

channelization which would affect water level, flow and increased silt. 
Based on the status of this species, program treatments will not be conducted near Foskett Spring. 
This prohibition in addition to programmatic buffers should result in no adverse impacts to Foskett 
speckled dace from the program. 
(6) Protection of Monarch butterfly 
Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is proposed for endangered species status. In the Pacific 
Northwest, monarch butterfly adults migrate from overwintering sites in California to utilize 
seasonal habitat, including Oregon. Adult monarch butterflies feed on flower nectar from a wide 
range of plants. Any impacts from grasshopper treatments to adult monarchs therefore are likely to 
be a positive since grasshopper outbreaks can reduce flowering, with some species such as 
migratory and two-striped grasshoppers preferring forbs when available (Pfadt, 2002). Further, 
`  
Page | 65 
 
neither diflubenzuron nor carbaryl bait are expected to impact adult butterflies due to mode of 
action requiring ingestion. For larval development, monarch caterpillars are obligate to milky-
sapped perennial plant in the dogbane family, primarily showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) in 
the counties considered in this EA. The planting and protection of this host species, coupled with 
and preventing spraying lepidoptera impacting pesticides, has been identified as an important tool 
for supporting monarch butterfly populations. Milkweed is common in much of the state, though 
not necessarily common in areas treated for grasshoppers. Although it is a drought-resistant plant in 
general, it is not thrifty enough to thrive

 protection of this host species, coupled with 
and preventing spraying lepidoptera impacting pesticides, has been identified as an important tool 
for supporting monarch butterfly populations. Milkweed is common in much of the state, though 
not necessarily common in areas treated for grasshoppers. Although it is a drought-resistant plant in 
general, it is not thrifty enough to thrive in arid rangeland areas of the state where grasshopper 
outbreaks are most problematic. Since it is toxic to vertebrates, in many cases it has been managed 
against for decades in agricultural areas. As a result, incidences of milkweed in areas of Malheur 
and Harney County that have been treated for grasshoppers in are extremely limited, mostly 
occurring in small patches in roadside ditches, which is not ideal caterpillar habitat due to patch 
size limitations and disturbances caused by traffic, and would be buffered already if a state hi-way 
or interstate. Impacts caused by the program will further be limited by the infrequency and limited 
scale of treatments, coupled by the relative lack of obligate species habitat, however APHIS in 
Oregon will also work with land-managers to exclude any milkweed sites and buffer them as 
sensitive sites with standard program buffers.

Figure 18. Generalized Geologic Map of Oregon 
In terms of soils, The Soils of Oregon by Thorson et al (2022) ranks the dominant soil orders in the 
counties listed in this EA as Mollisols followed by Aridisols. Of the Mollisols, which are loamy, 
fertile soils, Xerolls are the most abundant suborder in Oregon which the NRCS characterizes as, 
“the more or less freely drained Mollisols of regions that have Mediterranean climates. Xerolls are 
dry for extended periods in summer, but moisture moves through most of the soils in winter and is 
stored above the deep layers or above bedrock in normal years” (www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-
basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils/mollisols).

In the SE corner of the state as well as the Pendleton area, Aridisols become dominant, which are

These soils require irrigation as a prerequisite for most agriculture but may naturally host prairie 
ecosystems where adequate seasonal moisture occurs. 
Soil is the basic component of rangeland ecosystems and is associated with nearly all processes that 
occur within the ecosystem. It provides a medium to support plant growth. It is also the home for 
many insects and microorganisms. It is a product of parent material, climate, biological factors, 
topography, and time. The soil formation process is slow, especially in arid and semiarid climates. 
It is believed to take several hundred years to replace an inch of top soil lost by erosion.  Rangeland 
soils, as those found in the Great Plains and Palouse Prairie, have been extensively converted to 
agricultural crop production. Remaining rangeland soils may be rocky, steep, salt affected, or 
otherwise not very productive compared to prime agricultural lands. The chemical and physical 

`

characteristics of a soil determine: its ability to furnish plant nutrients, the rate and depth of water 
penetration, and the amount of water the soil can hold and its availability to plants. 
b) Hydrology and Water Resources 
Most watersheds in Oregon feed into to the Columbia River. For Baker and Malheur counties, this 
occurs via the Snake River by way of the Powder or Burnt River watersheds, or the Malheur or 
Owyhee River watersheds respectively. Most of Umatilla county drains into the Columbia via the 
Umatilla River, while Jefferson and Wasco counties do so via the Deschutes River. Rivers in

Harney and Lake counties drain into pluvial lake basins, especially Malheur, Harney, Summer, 
Abert, Wamer and Goose lakes. National Rivers and Streams Assessments (www.epa.gov/national-
aquatic-resource-surveys/nrsa) do appear to have utilized s ome sampling sites from Harney and 
Malheur counties and the Deschutes River watershed in their Xeric ecoregion report, as shown in 
their sampling sites map.  
 
Figure 20. Map of NRSA 2018-19 Sampling Sites in Each Ecoregion 
In the most recent assessments, only 24% of the 66,540 miles of waterways assessed in the Xeric 
region were in good biological condition, with widespread stressors cited as disturbance and excess 
nutrient runoff leading to toxic microcystins, with 71% of 9,370 lakes assessed having the same 
issue.

According to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the whole state meets national 
health standards for air pollution, however smoke from wildfire can lead to unhealthy regional 
conditions. Attempts to manage smoke from proscribed burning is an ongoing area of focus and

 Environmental Quality, the whole state meets national 
health standards for air pollution, however smoke from wildfire can lead to unhealthy regional 
conditions. Attempts to manage smoke from proscribed burning is an ongoing area of focus and 
community coordinating. The climate of much of the state lends itself to wildfire, with a 
combination of moist winters and dry summers and strong winds that build in part between the cool 
Pacific Ocean coast and the semi-arid interior of the state. As the introduction of Soils of Oregon 
states, “The origin of the word ‘Oregon’ is disputed. However, three suggestions suggest that it 
originates from (1) the French Canadian word, ouragan, which means ‘windstorm’ after the 
chinook winds on the lower Columbia River; (2) orejón, meaning ‘big ear,’ after Indigenous 
Peoples living in the area; and (3) the spice, orégano, which grew in the territory.” Precipitation in 
Oregon rangeland varies from 5 inches per year in the Alvord Desert, typically from local 
thunderstorms, as the tertiary rain shadow of Steens Mountain pulls away nearly all remaining 
moisture traveling from the Pacific, to a more typical 25 inches per year maximum, which falls 
primarily either in cool season or as summer thunderstorms.  
5. Socioeconomic Issues 
Rangelands are essential to western livestock producers providing forage for a variety of domestic 
animals. Economic values of rangelands also include energy production sites, both fossil and 
renewable, and recreation sites. Two important distinctions are between market and non-market 
values, and between use and non-use values. Market values are associated with goods and services 
sold directly in a marketplace (e.g

 providing forage for a variety of domestic 
animals. Economic values of rangelands also include energy production sites, both fossil and 
renewable, and recreation sites. Two important distinctions are between market and non-market 
values, and between use and non-use values. Market values are associated with goods and services 
sold directly in a marketplace (e.g., livestock); market prices are therefore a good estimate value. 
Non-market values arise from goods and services that are not directly sold in a marketplace (e.g., 
ecosystem services). Similarly, use values arise from goods that are physically used (now or in the 
future), such as forage for livestock (market value) or outdoor recreation (usually a non-market 
value). Non-use values arise from goods that are never physically used. Non-use values, for 
example, include the concept of “existence value” (i.e., the value people place on simply knowing 
something, such as an unspoiled wilderness area, exists). Non-use values are often unrelated to any 
market good, but are real economic values nonetheless. Non-market and non-use values are 
difficult to estimate; therefore, most economic injury level estimates only consider market values 
and, in most cases, only the single market value for the commodity (e.g., forage) being damaged. In 
the case of rangeland, there are a large suite of values, both market and non-market, and use and 
non-use, that can be affected by pests, such as grasshoppers (Rashford et al, 2012).  
Agriculture is an important part of Eastern Oregon’s economy and landscape. More than half the 
area is used for cropland or rangeland (Meacham et.

 both market and non-market, and use and 
non-use, that can be affected by pests, such as grasshoppers (Rashford et al, 2012).  
Agriculture is an important part of Eastern Oregon’s economy and landscape. More than half the 
area is used for cropland or rangeland (Meacham et. al. 2001). Croplands are concentrated on the 
Columbia Plateau with other small, scattered pockets of mainly irrigated cropland in arable valleys. 
Crop growers in areas adjacent to possible suppression areas grow feed for dairies and feedlots as 
well as high value crop such as potatoes, sugar beets, wheat, barley, oats, hay, grass seed, and a 
variety of other crops. Grain production is concentrated on the Columbia Plateau. Umatilla county 
also produces alfalfa, corn, and potatoes. Central Oregon counties produce a variety of vegetable 
seeds, mint, grain, and hay. Malheur County is a major producer of seed crops, potatoes, onions 
and sugar beets. Tree fruit production is important in Wasco and Umatilla Counties (Bradbury 
2001). Processing plants add value in several of the rural communities. 
Livestock grazing is one of the primary uses of rangeland in the area, and is the dominate 
agricultural activity in many areas, including Harney and Lake Counties. Livestock enterprises 
include rangeland grazing by cattle, sheep, and horses; feedlots for beef; and concentrated dairy

and hog farms. Rangeland may be utilized for grazing during the summer or reserved for fall and

and hog farms. Rangeland may be utilized for grazing during the summer or reserved for fall and 
winter grazing. 
There is a significant amount of acreage in organic production in the area. In 2019, there was 
196,000 acres in production yielding $454,000 in sales statewide (USDA ERS). 
Beekeepers maintain hives to produce honey and other bee products in central and eastern Oregon, 
especially near crop production areas. Alfalfa, seed crops, and tree fruits rely on pollination 
services from bees, including native bees, which may nest or forage on or near proposed 
suppression areas. Alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata, are intensively managed solitary 
bees used in the production of alfalfa seed. 
Much of the land in the seven counties considered in this EA are publicly owned. They contain 
parts of Malheur, Umatilla, Wallowa-Whitman, Fremont-Winema National Forests which are 
administered by USDA Forest Service (USFS). (Grasshopper outbreaks have not been associated 
with these areas. USFS entomologists are aware of the APHIS grasshopper program, no requests 
for assistance have come from this federal land manager in Oregon.) USFWS administers the Hart 
Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), McKay Creek 
NWR, Cold Springs NWR, and Umatilla NWR. Currently, coordination with APHIS is limited to 
grasshopper survey and outreach only for any NWRs in Oregon. The BLM administers much of the

Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), McKay Creek 
NWR, Cold Springs NWR, and Umatilla NWR. Currently, coordination with APHIS is limited to 
grasshopper survey and outreach only for any NWRs in Oregon. The BLM administers much of the 
public rangeland in the southeast and south-central part of Oregon.  
Though typically not recreation destinations of note, the public may use some rangelands in the 
seven counties of Oregon included in this EA for a variety of recreational purposes including: 
hiking, horseback riding, camping, fishing, swimming, hot-springs soaking, astronomy, 
photography, general wildlife viewing and bird watching, insect, plant, rock or fossil collecting, 
archeology, hunting, shooting, archery, falconry, road or mountain biking, off-roading, and even 
rocketry. Members of the public may traverse rangelands in or near the proposed suppression area 
by various means including on foot, horseback, all-terrain vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, four-
wheel drive vehicles, snowmobiles, and aircraft, though trails and roads are relatively sparse.  
6. Cultural Resources and Events 
Executive Order 13175 "Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments," calls for 
agency communication and collaboration with tribal officials when proposed Federal actions have 
potential tribal implications. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. §§ 
470aa-mm), secures the protection of archaeological resources and sites on public and tribal lands. 
Prior to the treatment season, program personnel notify Tribal land managers of the potential for 
grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks on their lands. Consultation with local Tribal

 tribal implications. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. §§ 
470aa-mm), secures the protection of archaeological resources and sites on public and tribal lands. 
Prior to the treatment season, program personnel notify Tribal land managers of the potential for 
grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks on their lands. Consultation with local Tribal 
representatives takes place prior to treatment programs to inform fully the Tribes of possible 
actions APHIS may take on Tribal lands. Treatments typically do not occur at cultural sites, and 
drift from a program treatment at such locations is not expected to adversely affect natural surfaces, 
such as rock formations and carvings. APHIS would also confer with the appropriate Tribal 
authority to ensure that the timing and location of a planned program treatment does not coincide 
or conflict with cultural events or observances on Tribal lands. 
Federal actions must seek to avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential negative impacts to cultural 
and historic resources as part of compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 
the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, and NEPA. Section 106 of the NHPA 
requires Federal agencies to provide the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation with an 
opportunity to comment on their findings.

Cultural and historical sites include locations and artifacts associated with Native Americans, 
explorers, pioneers, religious groups and developers. Native American petroglyphs have been 
discovered in several areas within the proposed suppression area, as have artifacts from knapping 
(stone tool making). Elements of the Oregon Trail transect portions of the proposed suppression 
area, and monuments have been erected in several places. Museums, displays, and structures

(stone tool making). Elements of the Oregon Trail transect portions of the proposed suppression 
area, and monuments have been erected in several places. Museums, displays, and structures 
associated with mining, logging, Japanese internment camps, and irrigation development exist in 
Central and Eastern Oregon. 
As described by the Oregon Secretary of State (sos.oregon.gov/), central and eastern Oregon 
includes sovereign tribal governments with land holdings and protected cultural rights, including:  
The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs has a reported tribal member population of 5,363 and a 
1019 square mile reservation, primarily in Wasco and Jefferson counties. 
The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation has 3,152 enrolled members and a 
172,000 acre reservation in Umatilla county.  
The Burns Paiute Tribe has 420 members, a 13,736 acre reservation in Harney county. 
The Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Tribe’s reservation straddles the Oregon-Nevada border, 
18,829 acres are in Oregon in Malheur county.  
The Klamath Tribes, 5,200 members, exercise court affirmed treaty rights within the 1954 former 
Klamath Reservation Boundary, approximately 1.8 million acres in the northern half of the county. 
This area includes the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge and large portions of the 
Freemont-Winema Forests. In addition to treaty resources in this area, cultural resources and tribal 
traditional use areas extend beyond the 1954 Reservation Boundary to the aboriginal homelands of 
the Klamath Tribes.

the Klamath Tribes.  
The 1855 Treaty that created the Warm Springs and Umatilla Reservations reserved specific rights 
including the right to hunt and gather traditional foods and medicines on open and unclaimed lands. 
These rights are generally referred to as ‘Treaty reserved rights’ and extend to approximately 16.4 
million acres of ceded land in Washington and Oregon.  
Other Native Americans may practice traditional food and medicine gathering in or near proposed 
suppression areas.  
7. Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
Executive Order No. 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety 
Risks: 
The increased scientific knowledge about the environmental health risks and safety risks associated 
with hazardous substance exposures to children and recognition of these issues in Congress and 
Federal agencies brought about legislation and other requirements to protect the health and safety 
of children. On April 21, 1997, President Clinton signed E.O. 13045, Protection of Children From 
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks (62 FR 19885). This E.O. requires each Federal 
agency, consistent with its mission, to identify and assess environmental health risks and safety 
risks that may disproportionately affect children and to ensure that its policies, programs, activities, 
and standards address those risks. APHIS has developed agency guidance for its programs to 
follow to ensure the protection of children (USDA, APHIS, 1999).

risks that may disproportionately affect children and to ensure that its policies, programs, activities, 
and standards address those risks. APHIS has developed agency guidance for its programs to 
follow to ensure the protection of children (USDA, APHIS, 1999).   
Children, along with the general populus, in or near rangeland areas likely to have grasshopper 
outbreaks and potential suppression treatments are quite low; and further would have all the

protective measures that area standardized to protect humans from any program hazards, such as 
buffering of any houses, schools, churches or other areas of potential human congregation.  
E. Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives 
Each alternative described in this EA potentially has adverse environmental effects. The general 
environmental impacts of each alternative are discussed in detail in the 2019 programmatic EIS 
published by APHIS. The specific impacts of the alternatives are highly dependent upon the 
particular action and location of the grasshopper infestation. The principal concerns associated with 
the alternatives are: (1) the potential effects of insecticides on human health (including 
subpopulations that might be at increased risk); and (2) impacts of insecticides on nontarget 
organisms (including threatened and endangered species).   
APHIS has written human health and ecological risk assessments (HHERAs) to assess the 
insecticides and use patterns that are specific to the program. The risk assessments provide an in-
depth technical analysis of the potential impacts of each insecticide to human health, non-target 
wildlife, and its environmental fate in soil, air, and water. The assessments rely on data required by 
USEPA for pesticide product registrations, as well as peer-reviewed and other published literature.

 and use patterns that are specific to the program. The risk assessments provide an in-
depth technical analysis of the potential impacts of each insecticide to human health, non-target 
wildlife, and its environmental fate in soil, air, and water. The assessments rely on data required by 
USEPA for pesticide product registrations, as well as peer-reviewed and other published literature. 
The HHERAs are heavily referenced in the 2019 EIS and this Draft EA is likewise tiered to that 
analysis (USDA APHIS, 2019a, 2019bC). These Environmental Documents can be found at our 
program website: www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-health/grasshopper.  
The program suppresses grasshopper populations on a small portion of the area considered by this 
EA in any given year. In those control treatment areas substantial portions are excluded from direct 
insecticide applications because of buffers around sensitive sites and the alternating spray and skip 
swaths inherent in the RAATs method. The potential harmful effects from the program activities on 
environmental components and nontarget species populations occur in a small portion of the area 
considered by this EA and for a limited duration. Site-specific environmental consequences of the 
alternatives are discussed below. 
1. Alternative 1 - No Suppression Program Alternative 
a) Grasshopper Population Control 
Under this alternative, APHIS would not conduct a program to suppress grasshoppers other than 
provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the implementation of IPM strategies by land 
managers. When cultural or mechanical methods have failed to prevent harmful grasshopper 
populations Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, 
private groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort.

provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the implementation of IPM strategies by land 
managers. When cultural or mechanical methods have failed to prevent harmful grasshopper 
populations Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, 
private groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort. 
Without the coordination that APHIS provides during grasshopper outbreaks, the land managers 
and owners could use insecticides that APHIS considers too environmentally harsh. Multiple 
treatments and excessive amount of insecticide could be applied in efforts to suppress or even 
locally eradicate grasshopper populations. There are approximately 100 pesticide products 
registered by USEPA for use on rangelands and against grasshoppers (Purdue University, 2018). 
Without APHIS’ coordination and funding of grasshopper suppression programs in Oregon the 
responsibility would rest with the BLM, Oregon Department of Agriculture, tribal or municipal 
governments and industry groups to coordinate and perform grasshopper control treatments. The 
conventions of IPM APHIS has incorporated into our standard program procedures could be too 
burdensome for other agencies to observe. While the economic benefits of suppressing 
grasshoppers by using a RAATs method have been widely publicized, less frequent treatments by 
`  
Page | 73 
 
other agencies might encourage widespread complete coverage treatments to ‘eradicate’ 
grasshopper populations or prophylactically treat areas with minimal survey efforts. Adverse 
environmental effect particularly on nontarget species, could be much greater than under the 
APHIS led suppression program alternative due to lack of operational knowledge or coordination 
among the groups.

 treat areas with minimal survey efforts. Adverse 
environmental effect particularly on nontarget species, could be much greater than under the 
APHIS led suppression program alternative due to lack of operational knowledge or coordination 
among the groups.  
(1) Human Health 
Human exposure and health risks could increase because of the inexperience of other agencies in 
planning, contracting and monitoring treatments. APHIS hygiene and safety protocols establish 
procedures for use of personal protection equipment and handling of hazardous chemicals. Other 
less experienced agencies might underestimate potential worker or bystander exposures, increasing 
health risks.  
(2) Nontarget Species 
Grasshopper treatment programs could occur with more random frequency as various agencies 
allocate funding when it is available. These programs would almost certainly not have the same 
procedures and safeguards incorporated into the APHIS program. The possibility of multiple 
agencies with overlapping jurisdictions could result in multiple treatments per year with the same 
or incompatible insecticides. This overlapping of treatments could cause synergistic chemical 
interactions and more severe effects to nontarget species. It is also unlikely the other agencies will 
be equally equipped as APHIS to incorporate guidance and species location information from 
USFWS. Therefore, adverse effects on protected species and their critical habitat could increase. 
(3) Physical Environment Components 
The potential grasshopper control conducted by third parties could result in increases and a greater 
variety of pesticide residues in the environment. As noted previously, APHIS can only speculate 
which agencies and land owners will decide to control grasshoppers and what chemicals will be 
used. The program has also established treatment restriction buffers around water bodies to protect 
those features from insecticide drift and runoff. The labels for all program insecticides prohibit 
direct application to water (defined as reservoirs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 residues in the environment. As noted previously, APHIS can only speculate 
which agencies and land owners will decide to control grasshoppers and what chemicals will be 
used. The program has also established treatment restriction buffers around water bodies to protect 
those features from insecticide drift and runoff. The labels for all program insecticides prohibit 
direct application to water (defined as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by seasonal streams, 
springs, wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers). APHIS maintains the following additional 
buffers for water bodies that are not designated critical habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot 
buffer for aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground sprays, and a 50-foot buffer for bait applications 
(USDA APHIS, 2013). Almost certainly land management agencies and property owners would 
not observe the same buffers to prevent accidental spray drift to sensitive environments.  
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
In the absence of an APHIS administered grasshopper suppression program the cost of treatments 
would be paid entirely by land management agencies and land owners. Ranchers that lease land for 
grazing livestock might also have to pay third parties to protect rangeland forage from grasshopper 
outbreaks. These additional expenses would increase the cost of rangeland leases and production of 
livestock in general. Rural economies that depend on ranching and farming would experience 
increased economic hardship. The economic effects of infrequent and haphazard grasshopper 
treatments on rangeland forage could be similar to those described below for a scenario where no 
treatments occur.  
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
`

requent and haphazard grasshopper 
treatments on rangeland forage could be similar to those described below for a scenario where no 
treatments occur.  
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
`  
Page | 74 
 
The potential grasshopper control conducted by third parties might or might not be coordinated 
with Tribes and other cultural or historical observance events. It is reasonable to assume Tribal 
interests would ensure grasshopper treatments would not interfere with events or occur in areas of 
cultural significance.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
Grasshopper suppression programs are likely to occur in the same rural rangeland areas that are 
largely uninhabited. No matter who conducts the treatments, disproportionately high and adverse 
human health or environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a 
program area are unlikely.  
Likewise, potential grasshopper control programs would be conducted in rural rangeland areas, 
where agriculture is a primary industry. These areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural 
dwellings in ranching communities with low population density. The other agencies and land 
owners might notify residents within treatment areas to reduce the potential for incidental exposure 
to residents including children. None the less, treatments would occur on open rangelands where 
children would not be expected to be present during treatment or to enter should there be any 
restricted entry period after treatment. The APHIS grasshopper program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA AP

 period after treatment. The APHIS grasshopper program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA APHIS, 2016). There is a reasonable expectation that treatments 
conducted by third parties would also avoid spraying chemicals where children are present or 
congregate.  
b) No Grasshopper Population Control 
Conversely, in the absence of an APHIS funded grasshopper suppression program the most likely 
environmental effects would result from other agencies and land managers not controlling 
outbreaks. As noted, grasshoppers consuming vast amounts of vegetation in rangelands and 
surrounding areas. Grasshoppers are generalist feeders, eating grasses and forbs first and often 
moving to cultivated crops. High grasshopper density of one or several species and the resulting 
defoliation may reach an economic threshold where the damage caused by grasshoppers exceeds 
the cost of controlling the grasshoppers. Researchers determined that during typical grasshopper 
infestation years, approximately 20% of forage on western rangeland is removed, valued at a 
estimated cost of $1.2 billion per year (Hewitt & Onsager, 1983; dollar amount adjusted). This 
value represents 32 to 63% of the total value of rangeland across the western states (Rashford et al, 
2012). Other market and non-market values such as carbon sequestration, general ecosystem 
services, and recreational use may also be impacted by grasshopper outbreaks in rangeland.

value represents 32 to 63% of the total value of rangeland across the western states (Rashford et al, 
2012). Other market and non-market values such as carbon sequestration, general ecosystem 
services, and recreational use may also be impacted by grasshopper outbreaks in rangeland. 
(1) Human Health 
The risk of accidental exposure to insecticides would be reduced if no grasshopper control 
programs are implemented by APHIS or third parties. Grasshopper outbreaks could cause other 
health hazards including increased runoff, dust storms and road hazards.  
(2) Nontarget Species 
Vegetation damage during serious grasshopper outbreaks may be so severe that all grasses and 
forbs are destroyed causing impaired plant growth for several years. Rare plants may be consumed 
`  
Page | 75 
 
during critical times of their development such as during seed production, and loss of important 
plant species, or seed production may lead to reduced biological diversity of the rangeland habitats, 
potentially creating opportunities for the expansion of invasive and exotic weeds (Lockwood and 
Latchininsky, 2000). Rangeland herbivorous wildlife would have to migrate or suffer food 
shortages caused by the loss of forage. 
(3) Physical Environment Components 
When grasshoppers consume plant cover, soil is more susceptible to the drying effects of the sun, 
making plant roots less capable of holding soil in place. Soil damage results in erosion and 
disruption of nutrient cycling, water infiltration, seed germination, and other ecological processes 
which are important components of rangeland ecosystems (Latchininsky et al, 2011). A reduction 
vegetation will make steep rangeland topography more susceptible to erosion which would cause 
additional sediment loading in streams,

 place. Soil damage results in erosion and 
disruption of nutrient cycling, water infiltration, seed germination, and other ecological processes 
which are important components of rangeland ecosystems (Latchininsky et al, 2011). A reduction 
vegetation will make steep rangeland topography more susceptible to erosion which would cause 
additional sediment loading in streams, rivers, and other water bodies. This would result in a 
decrease in water quality. Likewise the denuded rangeland caused by poor grasshopper control 
would have less evapotranspiration, lower humidity, and higher daily temperature ranges. During 
windstorms the dry soil would be more likely to allow soil particles to become airborne and result 
in poor air quality and possibly health and other physical hazards to humans.  
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
When the density of grasshoppers reaches economic injury levels, grasshoppers begin to compete 
with livestock for food by reducing available forage (Wakeland and Shull, 1936; Belovsky, 2000; 
Pfadt, 2002; Branson et al, 2006; Bradshaw et al, 2018). Ranchers could offset some of the costs by 
leasing rangeland in another area and relocating their livestock, finding other means to feed their 
animals by purchasing hay or grain, or selling their livestock. Local communities and families with 
ranching based incomes could see adverse economic impacts. Grasshoppers that infest rangeland 
could move to surrounding croplands. Crop agriculture farmers could incur economic losses from 
attempts to chemically control grasshopper populations or due to the loss of their crops. The 
general public could see an increase in the cost of meat, crops, and other agricultural products.

could move to surrounding croplands. Crop agriculture farmers could incur economic losses from 
attempts to chemically control grasshopper populations or due to the loss of their crops. The 
general public could see an increase in the cost of meat, crops, and other agricultural products. 
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
The lack of grasshopper treatments would reduce the possibility of accidental spraying by third 
parties of cultural resources and during activities observing cultural or historically significant 
events. Grasshopper outbreak populations could reduce recreational and cultural uses of rangeland. 
Uncontrolled grasshopper populations would make these effects more severe.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
The risk of accidental human exposure to insecticides would be reduced if no grasshopper control 
programs are implemented by APHIS or third parties.  
As previously noted, the general public could see an increase in the cost of meat, crops, and other 
agricultural products. Low-income populations would suffer greater relative economic hardship 
from this increase in food prices, especially where grocery shopping choices are limited by longer 
travel between small rural villages. Likewise, the cost of food staples for families with children 
could increase.

2. Alternative 2 -Insecticide Applications at Reduced Agent Area 
Treatments with Adaptive Management Strategy 
Under Alternative 2, APHIS would participate in grasshopper programs with the option of using 
one of the insecticides (carbaryl bait or ULV diflubenzuron) depending upon the various factors 
related to the grasshopper outbreak and the site-specific characteristics. The use of an insecticide 
would typically occur at reduced pesticide rate and treatment area following the RAATs strategy.

 in grasshopper programs with the option of using 
one of the insecticides (carbaryl bait or ULV diflubenzuron) depending upon the various factors 
related to the grasshopper outbreak and the site-specific characteristics. The use of an insecticide 
would typically occur at reduced pesticide rate and treatment area following the RAATs strategy. 
APHIS would apply a single treatment to affected rangeland areas to suppress grasshopper 
outbreak populations by a range of 35 to 98 percent, depending upon the insecticide used.   
a) Carbaryl 
Carbaryl is a member of the N-methyl carbamate class of insecticides, which affect the nervous 
system via cholinesterase inhibition. Inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) causes 
nervous system signals to persist longer than normal. While these effects are desired in controlling 
insects, they can have undesirable impacts to non-target organisms that are exposed.  
(1) Human Health 
Carbaryl can cause cholinesterase inhibition (i.e., overstimulate the nervous system) in humans 
resulting in nausea, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and mental confusion, as well as convulsions, 
coma, and respiratory depression at high levels of exposure (NIH, 2009; Beauvais, 2014). USEPA 
classifies carbaryl as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans” based on vascular tumors in mice 
(USEPA, 2007, 2015a, 2017).  
USEPA regulates the amount of pesticide residues that can remain in or on food or feed 
commodities as the result of a pesticide application. The agency does this by setting a tolerance, 
which is the maximum residue level of a pesticide, usually measured in

 to humans” based on vascular tumors in mice 
(USEPA, 2007, 2015a, 2017).  
USEPA regulates the amount of pesticide residues that can remain in or on food or feed 
commodities as the result of a pesticide application. The agency does this by setting a tolerance, 
which is the maximum residue level of a pesticide, usually measured in parts per million (ppm), 
that can legally be present in food or feed. USEPA-registered carbaryl products used by the 
grasshopper program are labeled with rates and treatment intervals that are meant to protect 
livestock and keep chemical residues in cattle at acceptable levels (thereby protecting human 
health). While livestock and horses may graze on rangeland the same day that the land is sprayed, 
in order to keep tolerances to acceptable levels, carbaryl spray applications on rangeland are 
limited to half a pound active ingredient per acre per year (USEPA, 2012a). The grasshopper 
program would treat at or below use rates that appear on the label, as well as follow all appropriate 
label mitigations, which would ensure residues are below the tolerance levels. 
Adverse human health effects from the proposed program bait applications of the carbaryl 5% 
formulations to control grasshoppers are not expected based on low potential for human exposure 
to carbaryl and the favorable environmental fate and effects data. Technical grade (approximately 
100% of the insecticide product is composed of the active ingredient) carbaryl exhibits moderate 
acute oral toxicity in rats, low acute dermal toxicity in rabbits, and very low acute inhalation 
toxicity in rats. Technical carbaryl is not a primary eye or skin irritant in rabbits and is not a dermal 
sensitization in guinea pig (USEPA, 2007). This data can be

 composed of the active ingredient) carbaryl exhibits moderate 
acute oral toxicity in rats, low acute dermal toxicity in rabbits, and very low acute inhalation 
toxicity in rats. Technical carbaryl is not a primary eye or skin irritant in rabbits and is not a dermal 
sensitization in guinea pig (USEPA, 2007). This data can be extrapolated and applied to humans 
revealing low health risks associated with carbaryl. 
The proposed use of carbaryl bait, use of RAATs, and adherence to label requirements, 
substantially reduces the potential for exposure to humans. Program workers are the most likely 
human population to be exposed. APHIS does not expect adverse health risks to workers based on 
low potential for exposure to liquid carbaryl when applied according to label directions and use of 
personal protective equipment (e.g., long-sleeved shirt and long pants, shoes plus socks, chemical-
`  
Page | 77 
 
resistant gloves, and chemical-resistant apron) (USEPA, 2012a) during loading and applications. 
APHIS quantified the potential health risks associated with accidental worker exposure to carbaryl 
during mixing, loading, and applications. The quantitative risk evaluation results indicate no 
concerns for adverse health risk for program workers (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-
health/grasshopper). 
Adherence to label requirements and additional program measures designed to reduce exposure to 
workers and the public (e.g., mitigations to protect water sources, mitigations to limit spray drift, 
and restricted-entry intervals) result in low health risk to all human population segments.

 to reduce exposure to 
workers and the public (e.g., mitigations to protect water sources, mitigations to limit spray drift, 
and restricted-entry intervals) result in low health risk to all human population segments. 
(2) Nontarget Species 
The APHIS HHERA assessed available laboratory studies regarding the toxicity of carbaryl on fish 
and wildlife. In summary, the document indicates the chemical is highly toxic to insects, including 
native bees, honeybees, and aquatic insects; slightly to highly toxic to fish; highly to very highly 
toxic to most aquatic crustaceans, moderately toxic to mammals, minimally toxic to birds; 
moderately to highly toxic to several terrestrial arthropod predators; and slightly to highly toxic to 
larval amphibians (USDA APHIS, 2019a). However, adherence to label requirements and 
additional program measures designed to prevent carbaryl from reaching sensitive habitats or 
mitigate exposure of non-target organisms will reduce environmental effects of treatments.  
Acute and chronic risks to mammals are expected to be low to moderate based on the available 
toxicity data and conservative assumptions that were used to evaluate risk. There is the potential 
for impacts to small mammal populations that rely on terrestrial invertebrates for food. However, 
based on the toxicity data for terrestrial plants, minimal risks of indirect effects are expected to 
mammals that rely on plant material for food. Carbaryl has a reported half-life on vegetation of 
three to ten days, suggesting mammal exposure would be short-term. Direct risks to mammals from 
carbaryl bait applications is expected to be minimal based on oral, dermal, and inhalation studies 
(USDA APHIS, 2019a). 
A number of studies have reported no effects on bird populations in areas treated with carbaryl

 half-life on vegetation of 
three to ten days, suggesting mammal exposure would be short-term. Direct risks to mammals from 
carbaryl bait applications is expected to be minimal based on oral, dermal, and inhalation studies 
(USDA APHIS, 2019a). 
A number of studies have reported no effects on bird populations in areas treated with carbaryl 
(Buckner et al, 1973; Richmond et al, 1979; McEwen et al, 1996). Some applications of formulated 
carbaryl were found to cause depressed AChE levels (Zinkl et al, 1977); however, the doses were 
twice those proposed for the full coverage application in the grasshopper program. 
Several field studies that assist in determining impacts of carbaryl on aquatic invertebrates and fish 
have been published (Relyea and Diecks, 2008; USDA FS, 2008a; NMFS, 2009) and are 
summarized in the 2019 EIS. The value of these studies is limited because they all had dosing 
levels or frequencies that are much higher than would occur in the grasshopper program. 
While sublethal effects have been noted in fish with depressed AChE, as well as some impacts to 
amphibians (i.e. days to metamorphosis) and aquatic invertebrates in the field due to carbaryl, the 
application rates and measured aquatic residues observed in these studies are well above values that 
would be expected from current program operations. Indirect risks to amphibian and fish species 
can occur through the loss of habitat or reduction in prey, yet data suggests that carbaryl risk to 
aquatic plants that may serve as habitat, or food, for fish and aquatic invertebrates is very low.

 from current program operations. Indirect risks to amphibian and fish species 
can occur through the loss of habitat or reduction in prey, yet data suggests that carbaryl risk to 
aquatic plants that may serve as habitat, or food, for fish and aquatic invertebrates is very low. 
The majority of rangeland plants require insect-mediated pollination. Native, solitary bee species 
are important pollinators on western rangeland (Tepedino, 1979). Potential negative effects of 
insecticides on pollinators are of concern because a decrease in their numbers has been associated 
with a decline in fruit and seed production of plants.

Research from Gao et al (2022) found that chronic exposure to Carbaryl led to several negative 
effects on adult bees including impacts on nesting performance, foraging ability and gut microbial 
community. The researchers posited the no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of the 
chronic toxicity test of carbaryl (5 mg/L) to A. mellifera larvae were much higher than the field-
realistic levels as well as the residual levels detected in bee products. They designed this study to 
expand the risk assessment to the chronic effects of carbaryl on the transcriptional and metabolic 
level of A. mellifera larvae at the concentration where no adverse reactions were observed. 
Stock solution of carbaryl was prepared by dissolving the powder in acetone and then diluted with 
normal components of bee diet (50% royal jelly, 2% yeast extract, 9% d-glucose, 9% d-fructose). 
The final concentration of 2 mg/L carbaryl was applied to the third instar larvae for four days and 
correspond to the NOAEC determined in a previous study from the researchers (Yang et.al

normal components of bee diet (50% royal jelly, 2% yeast extract, 9% d-glucose, 9% d-fructose). 
The final concentration of 2 mg/L carbaryl was applied to the third instar larvae for four days and 
correspond to the NOAEC determined in a previous study from the researchers (Yang et.al. 2019). 
However, they noted the carbaryl concentration on developing larvae was 48 times the maximum 
residual value in nectar or honey.    
Carbaryl exposure at the NOAEC disrupted the transcriptional and metabolic regulatory networks 
of bees, even though no adverse physiological effects were observed in exposed larvae. 
Metabolome analysis showed that carbaryl treatment led to reduction of amino acids, accumulation 
of nucleic acid components, and disturbed flavonoids and fatty acids in exposed larvae which 
would suggest that chronic exposure to carbaryl might change internal metabolism in bee larvae 
(Gao et al, 2022). 
Research from Novotny et al in a preprint manuscript found that pesticides that are traditionally 
considered contact-based and applied when flowers are unopened can reach pollen and nectar and 
produce measurable risk to bees. The persistence of some agrochemicals in leaves, pollen, and 
nectar up to a week following application merits consideration when managing pollinator-
dependent crops. They analyzed residues of three insecticides (carbaryl, lambda-cyhalothrin, 
permethrin) and three fungicides (chlorothalonil, quinoxyfen, triflumizole) in pumpkin leaves, 
pollen, and nectar collected from five farms in the north-central United States, one day before a 
spray event, and one, three, and seven days after. Bees foraging on pumpkin flowers were

pollen, and nectar collected from five farms in the north-central United States, one day before a 
spray event, and one, three, and seven days after. Bees foraging on pumpkin flowers were collected 
one day before and one day after spraying and screened for the same pesticides. Chemical 
concentrations and application rates were decided by the farmer based on what a typical schedule 
would look like. The pumpkin seeds had a systemic treatment containing three fungicides and the 
neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam.  
The octanol-water partition coefficient (logKow) is the relative concentration of a chemical in n-
octanol versus water at pH 7, 20°C. Higher values of logKow indicate greater lipophilicity (and a 
lower affinity for water). Since carbaryl has a logKow value of 2.36 the chemical is less likely to 
adsorb and accumulate in lipid-rich plant tissues such as cuticular waxes or pollen. A chemical’s 
ionizability is given as pKa, the pH at which a chemical is 50% ionized, or in equilibrium between 
its undissociated and ionized state (calculated as the negative base-10 logarithm of the acid 
dissociation constant at 25°C). Chemicals with pKa < 7 are most likely to reach vascular tissue and 
mobilize systemically throughout the plant. A ‘neutral’ pKa indicates the chemical does not ionize 
under relevant plant conditions. Carbaryl does not offer systemic insecticidal protection because 
the chemical has a pKa of 10.4. However, carbaryl has a molecular weight of

 Chemicals with pKa < 7 are most likely to reach vascular tissue and 
mobilize systemically throughout the plant. A ‘neutral’ pKa indicates the chemical does not ionize 
under relevant plant conditions. Carbaryl does not offer systemic insecticidal protection because 
the chemical has a pKa of 10.4. However, carbaryl has a molecular weight of 201.2 g/mol well 
below 800 g/mol, the molecular weight typical of chemicals that are able to penetrate plant cuticles 
(University of Hertfordshire Agriculture and Environment Research Unit. Pesticide properties 
database (PPDB). 2024. [Cited 1 March 2024]. Available from: http://sitem.herts.ac.uk). 
The researchers found foliar insecticide and fungicide spray residues were detected more 
frequently and in greater concentrations in pumpkin leaves than in pollen, nectar, or foraging bees 
`  
Page | 79 
 
and insecticide concentrations in leaves often exceeded levels of concern. However, the risk indices 
used to examine pollinator exposure against the levels of concern assume that a foraging bee would 
actually come into contact with all the chemical present on or in the leaf sample.   
Carbaryl applied to foliage was present in some plant pollen and nectar samples, and in two or the 
69 bee samples (male X. pruinosa) collected one day after a spraying event. The researchers noted 
the bees that tested positive (male squash bees) have life history traits that bring them into 
prolonged contact with sprayed crop plants. Typically, either the proportion of contaminated 
samples or the maximum concentration of insecticides in pumpkin tissues decreased over the week 
following foliar application. For example, one day after application of carbaryl spray 43% of nectar

 bees that tested positive (male squash bees) have life history traits that bring them into 
prolonged contact with sprayed crop plants. Typically, either the proportion of contaminated 
samples or the maximum concentration of insecticides in pumpkin tissues decreased over the week 
following foliar application. For example, one day after application of carbaryl spray 43% of nectar 
samples tested positive for the insecticide, but carbaryl was not present in nectar samples collected 
one week later. However, the pretreatment data suggested carbaryl residues can persist longer than 
a week in leaves and pollen.   
Carbaryl has only moderate lipophilicity (logKOW = 2.4), giving it more potential to mobilize 
vascularly and be incorporated into developing floral tissue. Consistent with this reasoning, the 
researchers recorded a five-fold increase in carbaryl concentrations in pollen from the first to the 
third day after treatment. Carbaryl has a low molecular weight and is a very weak acid. Therefore, 
the chemical can cross membranes and bind with compounds in plant cells with similar pH before 
it reaches phloem. These properties contribute to its persistence in leaves, instead of translocation 
to pollen and nectar that bees eat. However, this persistence prolongs pollinator risk of exposure. 
The high concentrations of carbaryl in leaves during the week after foliar spray led to the highest 
bee risk quotient values. As previously noted, the assessments may overestimate bee toxicity from 
leaf contact because they assume a bee receives the entire dose of chemical present in the leaf 
sample (Novotny et al, 2024). 
Researchers analyzed persistence of pesticides in agroecosystems in the Emilia-Romagna region of

leaf contact because they assume a bee receives the entire dose of chemical present in the leaf 
sample (Novotny et al, 2024). 
Researchers analyzed persistence of pesticides in agroecosystems in the Emilia-Romagna region of 
northern Italy (Bogo et al, 2024). They investigated pesticide residue in beebread by analyzing 100 
samples collected in 25 BeeNet national monitoring project stations in March and June of 2021 and 
2022. They looked at the diversity and concentration of the chemicals, their correlation with land 
use, and the risk they posed to the bees. They calculated a toxicity-weighted concentration (TWC) 
of chemicals by computing the ratio between the measured concentration in beebread and the oral 
acute toxicity (LD50) of that chemical for bees. For risk evaluation a risk threshold was assigned by 
dividing the TWC by an order of magnitude to account for chemical degradation, harmful 
synergistic interaction with other chemicals and chronic exposure causing sublethal effects. The 
risk threshold was exceeded in four beebread samples out of 100; one for carbaryl, fipronil, 
imidacloprid and thiamethoxam (Bogo et al, 2024). 
Research from Nogrado et al (2019) investigated the effect of carbaryl pesticides on gut microbiota 
of honeybees, which had come in contact with rapeseed plants (Brassica napus) sprayed with 
carbaryl wettable powder. Honeybee colonies were placed in tunnels covering an area of 70 meters 
squared and containing Brassica napus. Negative controls were sprayed with tap water (400 L/ha), 
while the experiments were sprayed with carbaryl (250 g a.i./ha in 400 L tap water/ha) during

us) sprayed with 
carbaryl wettable powder. Honeybee colonies were placed in tunnels covering an area of 70 meters 
squared and containing Brassica napus. Negative controls were sprayed with tap water (400 L/ha), 
while the experiments were sprayed with carbaryl (250 g a.i./ha in 400 L tap water/ha) during 
active flight of bees. Bees were collected from the negative control and the carbaryl-treated groups, 
after 2 hours of exposure. The unexposed bees harbored Alphaproteobacteria, which were absent 
in the exposed bees. Microorganisms found in honeybee guts such as Snodgrassella alvi and L. 
kullabergensis, however, were observed only in the exposed bees, but not in the unexposed bees. 
The difference between the two groups was distinctly recognized when copy numbers of 16S 
rRNA genes were compared by quantitative PCR. The researchers noted they could not conclude 
decisively that the differences in the composition of the gut microbial communities from the two 
`  
Page | 80 
 
groups can be attributed directly to the pesticide exposure. However other researchers (Raymann et 
al, 2017) have suggested that one difference between a healthy colony and a colony suffering from 
colony collapse disorder can be a decrease in Alphaproteobacteria in gut bacterial communities. 
Lastly, there were other bacteria that are not commonly found in the gut microbiota of honeybees 
could have been acquired from the environment and could be considered as opportunistic 
pathogens. These uncategorized bacteria were observed in more abundance in the exposed group as 
compared to the unexposed group. Klebsiella was only observed in the unexposed group, while

could have been acquired from the environment and could be considered as opportunistic 
pathogens. These uncategorized bacteria were observed in more abundance in the exposed group as 
compared to the unexposed group. Klebsiella was only observed in the unexposed group, while 
Cronobacter, Edwardsiella, Providencia, Serratia, Erwinia, and Pantoea were observed in the 
exposed group. The researchers suggested the uncategorized bacteria could probably be indicative 
of disruption of balance of gut microbiome or disease as mentioned in previous studies in relation 
to dysbiosis in the presence of a potential cause like chemicals. 
The researchers noted the analysis could measure endpoints of sublethal effects, but there is 
considerable uncertainty in how to relate to adverse effects. Furthermore, there is insufficient data 
to establish plausible adverse outcome pathways with consistent and reproducible linkages between 
molecular initiating events and key events across multiple levels of biological organization to an 
adverse effect at the whole organism or colony or population level (Nogrado.et.al.2019). 
Laboratory studies have indicated that bees can be harmed by acute exposures to carbaryl, but the 
studies were at rates above those proposed in the program. The chronic exposures and effects 
modelled in the studies described above are unlikely to result from one-time applications conducted 
by the program. Potential negative effects of grasshopper program insecticides on bee populations 
may also be mitigated by the more common use of carbaryl baits than the ULV spray formulation. 
Studies with carbaryl bran bait have found no sublethal effects on adults or larvae bees (Peach et al, 
1994, 1995). The reduced rates of carbaryl used in the program and the implementation of 
application buffers should significantly reduce exposure of pollinators to

may also be mitigated by the more common use of carbaryl baits than the ULV spray formulation. 
Studies with carbaryl bran bait have found no sublethal effects on adults or larvae bees (Peach et al, 
1994, 1995). The reduced rates of carbaryl used in the program and the implementation of 
application buffers should significantly reduce exposure of pollinators to carbaryl treatments for 
grasshopper suppression. In areas of direct application where impacts may occur, alternating 
swaths and reduced rates (i.e., RAATs) would reduce risk. The effects on pollinators resulting from 
control of rangeland grasshopper populations with carbaryl based insecticides are not expected to 
cause significant impacts to the human environment.  
(3) Physical Environment Components 
Temperature, pH, light, oxygen, and the presence of microorganisms and organic material are 
factors that contribute to how quickly carbaryl will degrade in water. Hydrolysis, the breaking of a 
chemical bond with water, is the primary degradation pathway for carbaryl at pH 7 and above. In 
natural water, carbaryl is expected to degrade faster than in laboratory settings due to the presence 
of microorganisms. The half-lives of carbaryl in natural waters varied between 0.3 to 4.7 days 
(Stanley and Trial, 1980; Bonderenko et al, 2004). Degradation in the latter study was temperature 
dependent with shorter half-lives at higher temperatures. Aerobic aquatic metabolism of carbaryl 
reported half-life ranged of 4.9 to 8.3 days compared to anaerobic (without oxygen) aquatic 
metabolism range of 15.3 to 72 days (Thomson and Strachan, 1981; USEPA, 2003). Carbaryl’s 
degradation in aerobic soil varies from rapid to slow

. Aerobic aquatic metabolism of carbaryl 
reported half-life ranged of 4.9 to 8.3 days compared to anaerobic (without oxygen) aquatic 
metabolism range of 15.3 to 72 days (Thomson and Strachan, 1981; USEPA, 2003). Carbaryl’s 
degradation in aerobic soil varies from rapid to slow with half-lives ranging from 4 to 253 days 
(USEPA, 2017). Half-lives decrease with increasing pH from acidic to alkaline conditions. Under 
anaerobic soil conditions, carbaryl has a half-life of 72 days. Little transport of carbaryl through 
runoff or leaching to groundwater is expected due to the low water solubility, moderate sorption, 
and rapid degradation in soils. There are no reports of carbaryl detection in groundwater, and less 
than 1% of granule carbaryl applied to a sloping plot was detected in runoff (Caro et al, 1974). 
`

Product use restrictions appear on the USEPA-approved label and attempt to keep carbaryl out of 
waterways. Carbaryl must not be applied directly to water, or to areas where surface water is 
present (USEPA, 2012a). The USEPA-approved use rates and patterns and the additional 
mitigations imposed by the grasshopper program, such as using RAATs and application buffers, 
where applicable, further minimize aquatic exposure and risk. 
It is unlikely that carbaryl will significantly vaporize from the soil, water, or treated surfaces 
(Dobroski et al, 1985). Carbaryl may be found in the atmosphere within air-borne particulates or as 
spray drift and can react with hydroxyl radicals in the ambient atmosphere (Kao, 1994). Once in

 exposure and risk. 
It is unlikely that carbaryl will significantly vaporize from the soil, water, or treated surfaces 
(Dobroski et al, 1985). Carbaryl may be found in the atmosphere within air-borne particulates or as 
spray drift and can react with hydroxyl radicals in the ambient atmosphere (Kao, 1994). Once in 
the air, carbaryl has a half-life of 1 to 4 months, however these minute amounts of carbaryl are not 
expected to reduce air quality. Carbaryl hydrolysis occurs quickly in natural waters with pH values 
of 7 or above, and the presence of microorganisms and organic material also contribute to the rapid 
degradation of the chemical. Adverse effects resulting from carbaryl contamination of water 
resources would harm aquatic organisms (described above) and would be temporary or de minimis.  
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
In addition to the environmental baseline conditions, APHIS also considers other factors such as 
pest population, pest life stage, pest and plant species affected, cost share with State and private 
landowners, and the cost benefit analysis of making a treatment. Because of the cost sharing private 
landowners and land managers typically would only use carbaryl to suppress rangeland 
grasshoppers and preserve forage for livestock. Insecticides applied using the RAATs strategy is 
expected to provide further economic advantages due to effective treatment at reduced costs. The 
economics of the RAATs strategy has been studied by both Foster et al (2000), and Lockwood and 
Schell (1997). In summarizing both studies (which used various rates of insecticide below the 
conventional rates for suppression of rangeland grasshoppers and treated less area), the results 
concluded that treatment costs, under this alternative, when compared to the costs

 the RAATs strategy has been studied by both Foster et al (2000), and Lockwood and 
Schell (1997). In summarizing both studies (which used various rates of insecticide below the 
conventional rates for suppression of rangeland grasshoppers and treated less area), the results 
concluded that treatment costs, under this alternative, when compared to the costs for conventional 
treatments for rangeland grasshopper infestations, were reduced 57 to 66% with carbaryl.  
Another potential economic benefit of chemical treatment of grasshoppers is to crop growers near 
rangelands. Carbaryl bait treatments are sometimes used to reduce the potential for rangeland 
grasshoppers to move to surrounding croplands. This would result in socioeconomic benefits 
because losses, and therefore costs, of meat, crops, and their byproducts should be reduced. 
Additionally, the suppressed grasshopper populations in rangeland surrounding croplands could 
mean less of a need for costly chemical treatments by crop farmers at these sites.  
There is the potential for organic farms adjacent to carbaryl applications in rangeland to control 
grasshopper outbreak populations. However, mitigations such as buffers are meant to protect 
adjacent environments from runoff and insecticide drift. These protective measures are expected to 
protect nearby organic farms, as well as other areas of concern, from the risk of inadvertent 
exposure to rangeland insecticide treatments. It is also likely the organic farms would also benefit 
economically from reductions in crop damage caused by grasshopper populations migrating from 
nearby rangeland. 
The suppression of grasshopper populations with carbaryl should benefit public uses rangelands for 
recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may temporarily 
lose the use

economically from reductions in crop damage caused by grasshopper populations migrating from 
nearby rangeland. 
The suppression of grasshopper populations with carbaryl should benefit public uses rangelands for 
recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may temporarily 
lose the use of rangeland during and directly after carbaryl insecticide applications. However, the 
preservation of vegetation is expected to benefit recreational activities in the long-term by 
preserving their aesthetic value. This in turn will also increase the economic value of the rangeland 
by preserving and improving recreational opportunities.  
`

(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
There is the potential for impacts to cultural and historical resources if the proposed carbaryl 
treatments occur on or near historic trails or properties. If any proposed actions are at, or adjacent 
to, the site of a historic trail or property, APHIS will consult with the appropriate landowner or land 
management agency, the State Historic Preservation Office, any affected National Trail’s 
administrative office, or other appropriate agencies. Likewise, APHIS would coordinate the timing 
of treatments with Tribes or other cooperators to ensure carbaryl treatments would not occur during 
scheduled cultural events or ceremonies.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
APHIS uses carbaryl insecticide treatments to suppress grasshopper populations in rural rangeland 
areas that are largely uninhabited. Disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aryl insecticide treatments to suppress grasshopper populations in rural rangeland 
areas that are largely uninhabited. Disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas, where 
agriculture is a primary industry. The areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural dwellings in 
ranching communities with low population density. The program notifies residents within 
treatment areas, or their designated representatives, prior to proposed operations to reduce the 
potential for incidental exposure to residents including children. Treatments are conducted 
primarily on open rangelands where children would not be expected to be present during treatment 
or to enter should there be any restricted entry period after treatment. The program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA APHIS, 2016).  
APHIS’ HHERA for carbaryl evaluated the potential exposure to each insecticide used in the 
program and risks associated with these insecticides to residents, including children. The HHERA 
suggest that no disproportionate risks to children, as part of the general public, are anticipated 
(USDA APHIS, 2019a).

(USDA APHIS, 2019a). 
b) Diflubenzuron 
Diflubenzuron is a restricted use pesticide (only certified applicators or persons under their direct 
supervision may make applications) registered with USEPA as an insect growth regulator. It 
specifically interferes with chitin synthesis, the formation of the insect’s exoskeleton. Larvae of 
affected insects are unable to molt properly. While this effect is desirable in controlling certain 
insects, it can have undesirable impacts to non-target organisms that are exposed. 
(1) Human Health 
Adverse human health effects from ground or aerial ULV applications of diflubenzuron to control 
grasshoppers are not expected based on the chemical’s low acute toxicity and low potential for 
human exposure. Diflubenzuron has low acute dermal toxicity in rabbits and very low acute oral 
and inhalation toxicities in rats (USEPA, 2015b). The adverse health effects of diflubenzuron to 
mammals and humans involves damage to hemoglobin in blood and the transport of oxygen. 
Diflubenzuron causes the formation of methemoglobin. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin 
that is not able to transport oxygen (USDA FS, 2004). USEPA classifies diflubenzuron as non-
carcinogenic to humans (USEPA, 2015b).

The proposed use of diflubenzuron and adherence to label requirements substantially reduces the 
potential for exposure to humans and the environment. Program workers are the most likely to be 
exposed by program applications of diflubenzuron. APHIS does not expect

The proposed use of diflubenzuron and adherence to label requirements substantially reduces the 
potential for exposure to humans and the environment. Program workers are the most likely to be 
exposed by program applications of diflubenzuron. APHIS does not expect adverse health risks to 
workers based on low potential for exposure to diflubenzuron when applied according to label 
directions and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during applications (e.g., long sleeve 
shirt and pants, chemical-resistant gloves). APHIS quantified the potential risks associated with 
accidental exposure of diflubenzuron for workers during mixing, loading, and application based on 
proposed program uses. The quantitative risk evaluation results indicate no concerns for adverse 
health risk for program workers (USDA APHIS, 2019b). 
Dimilin® 2L is labeled with rates and treatment intervals that are meant to protect livestock and 
keep residues in cattle at acceptable levels (thereby, protecting human health). Tolerances are set 
for the amount of diflubenzuron that is allowed in cattle fat (0.05 ppm) and meat (0.05 ppm) (40 
CFR Parts 180.377). The grasshopper program would treat at application rates indicated on product 
labels or lower, which should ensure approved residues levels. 
Adverse health risk to the general public in treatment areas is not expected due to the low potential 
for exposure resulting from low population density in the treatment areas, adherence to label 
requirements, program measures designed to reduce exposure to the public, and low toxicity to 
mammals. APHIS treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas consisting of widely scattered,

Adverse health risk to the general public in treatment areas is not expected due to the low potential 
for exposure resulting from low population density in the treatment areas, adherence to label 
requirements, program measures designed to reduce exposure to the public, and low toxicity to 
mammals. APHIS treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas consisting of widely scattered, 
single, rural dwellings in ranching communities, where agriculture is a primary industry. 
Applications are not made to farm buildings or homes. Program measures beyond those on the 
label require application buffers from structures as well as aquatic areas reducing the potential for 
exposure to the public from direct exposure due to drift and from drinking water sources. The 
quantitative risk evaluation results indicate no concerns for adverse health risk for humans (USDA 
APHIS, 2019b). 
(2) Nontarget Species 
APHIS’ literature review found that on an acute basis, diflubenzuron is considered toxic to some 
aquatic invertebrates and practically non-toxic to adult honeybees. However, diflubenzuron is toxic 
to larval honeybees (USEPA, 2018). It is slightly nontoxic to practically nontoxic to fish and birds 
and has very slight acute oral toxicity to mammals, with the most sensitive endpoint from exposure 
being methemoglobinemia. Minimal direct risk to amphibians and reptiles is expected, although 
there is some uncertainty due to lack of information (USDA APHIS, 2019b; USEPA, 2018). 
In a review of mammalian field studies, Dimilin® applications at a rate of 60 to 280 g a.i./ha had no 
effects on the abundance and reproduction in voles, field mice, and shrews (USDA FS, 2004). 
These rates are approximately three to

 of information (USDA APHIS, 2019b; USEPA, 2018). 
In a review of mammalian field studies, Dimilin® applications at a rate of 60 to 280 g a.i./ha had no 
effects on the abundance and reproduction in voles, field mice, and shrews (USDA FS, 2004). 
These rates are approximately three to 16 times greater than the highest application rate proposed 
in the program. Potential indirect impacts from application of diflubenzuron on small mammals 
includes loss of habitat or food items. Mice on treated plots consumed fewer lepidopteran (order of 
insects that includes butterflies and moths) larvae compared to controls; however, the total amount 
of food consumed did not differ between treated and untreated plots. Body measurements, weight, 
and fat content in mice collected from treated and non-treated areas did not differ.  
Poisoning of insectivorous birds by diflubenzuron after spraying in orchards at labeled rates is 
unlikely due to low toxicity (Muzzarelli, 1986). The primary concern for bird species is related to 
an indirect effect on insectivorous species from a decrease in insect prey. At the proposed 
application rates, grasshoppers have the highest risk of being impacted while other taxa have a 
greatly reduced risk because the lack of effects seen in multiple field studies on other taxa of 
invertebrates at use rates much higher than those proposed for the program. Shifting diets in

insectivorous birds in response to prey densities is not uncommon in undisturbed areas (Rosenberg 
et al, 1982; Cooper et al, 1990; Sample et al, 1993).

insectivorous birds in response to prey densities is not uncommon in undisturbed areas (Rosenberg 
et al, 1982; Cooper et al, 1990; Sample et al, 1993). 
Indirect risk to fish species can be defined as a loss of habitat or prey base that provides food and 
shelter for fish populations, however these impacts are not expected based on the available fish and 
invertebrate toxicity data (USDA APHIS, 2019b). A review of several aquatic field studies 
demonstrated that when effects were observed it was at diflubenzuron levels not expected from 
program activities (Fischer and Hall, 1992; USEPA, 1997; Eisler, 2000; USDA FS, 2004).  
Diflubenzuron applications have the potential to affect chitin production in various other beneficial 
terrestrial invertebrates. Multiple field studies in a variety of application settings, including 
grasshopper control, have been conducted regarding the impacts of diflubenzuron to terrestrial 
invertebrates. Based on the available data, sensitivity of terrestrial invertebrates to diflubenzuron is 
highly variable depending on which group of insects and which life stages are being exposed. 
Immature grasshoppers, beetle larvae, lepidopteran larvae, and chewing herbivorous insects appear 
to be more susceptible to diflubenzuron than other invertebrates. Within this group, however, 
grasshoppers appear to be more sensitive to the proposed use rates for the program. Honeybees, 
parasitic wasps, predatory insects, and sucking insects show greater tolerance to diflubenzuron 
exposure (Murphy et al,

to be more susceptible to diflubenzuron than other invertebrates. Within this group, however, 
grasshoppers appear to be more sensitive to the proposed use rates for the program. Honeybees, 
parasitic wasps, predatory insects, and sucking insects show greater tolerance to diflubenzuron 
exposure (Murphy et al, 1994; Eisler, 2000; USDA FS, 2004).  
Diflubenzuron is moderately toxic to spiders and mites (USDA APHIS, 2019c). Deakle and 
Bradley (1982) measured the effects of four diflubenzuron applications on predators of Heliothis 
spp. at a rate of 0.06 lb a.i./ac and found no effects on several predator groups. This supported 
earlier studies by Keever et al (1977) that demonstrated no effects on the arthropod predator 
community after multiple applications of diflubenzuron in cotton fields. Grasshopper IPM field 
studies have shown diflubenzuron to have a minimal impact on ants, spiders, predatory beetles, and 
scavenger beetles. There was no significant reduction in populations of these species from seven to 
76 days after treatment. Although ant populations exhibited declines of up to 50 percent, these 
reductions were temporary, and population recovery was described as immediate (Catangui et al, 
1996). 
Due to its mode of action, diflubenzuron has greater activity on immature stages of terrestrial 
invertebrates. Based on standardized laboratory testing diflubenzuron is considered practically non-
toxic to adult honeybees. The contact LD50 value for the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is reported at 
greater than 114.8 μg a.i./

 of action, diflubenzuron has greater activity on immature stages of terrestrial 
invertebrates. Based on standardized laboratory testing diflubenzuron is considered practically non-
toxic to adult honeybees. The contact LD50 value for the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is reported at 
greater than 114.8 μg a.i./bee while the oral LD50 value was reported at greater than 30 μg a.i./bee. 
USEPA (2018) reports diflubenzuron toxicity values to adult honeybees are typically greater than 
the highest test concentration using the end-use product or technical active ingredient. The lack of 
toxicity to honeybees, as well as other bees, in laboratory studies has been confirmed in additional 
studies (Nation et al, 1986; Chandel and Gupta, 1992; Mommaerts et al, 2006). Mommaerts et al 
and Thompson et al documented sublethal effects on reproduction-related endpoints for the bumble 
bee, Bombus terrestris and A. mellifera, respectively, testing a formulation of diflubenzuron. 
However, these effects were observed at much higher use rates relative to those used in the 
program. 
For example, in the Mommaerts et al study researchers exposed bees via a contact application of 
288 mg/L aqueous concentration which was topically applied to the dorsal thorax of each worker 
with a micropipette. Bumblebees also ingested orally sugar/water treated with the same 
concentration of diflubenzuron solution over a period of 11 weeks. Pollen was sprayed with the 
same concentration of diflubenzuron until saturation and then supplied to the nests. The bumble 
bees were not restricted in how much of

with a micropipette. Bumblebees also ingested orally sugar/water treated with the same 
concentration of diflubenzuron solution over a period of 11 weeks. Pollen was sprayed with the 
same concentration of diflubenzuron until saturation and then supplied to the nests. The bumble 
bees were not restricted in how much of these contaminated solutions they could consume. The 
researchers estimated mean LC50 concentrations based on the chronic exposure routes described 
`

above. These were 25 mg a.i/L dermal contact, 0.32 mg a.i/L ingested sugar-water, and 0.95 mg 
a.i/L pollen. The researchers noted, “In practice, bumblebees will rarely be exposed to such high 
concentrations,” and elaborated, “it is necessary that the laboratory-based results are validated with 
risk assessments for these insecticides in field related conditions.”    
APHIS believes conversion and comparison of program applied foliar spray rates to the 
concentrations of the solutions applied in this study would rely on unrealistic exposure scenarios. 
An exposure scenario where pollinators are exposed continuously for 11-weeks is not expected to 
occur in the APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression program. In field applications 
diflubenzuron levels would decline over the 11-week exposure period due to degradation, 
flowering plants that have diflubenzuron residues would no longer be available for foraging by 
pollinators as flowers naturally die and do not provide pollen and nectar, and other plants would 
bloom after application without residues of diflubenzuron.

 to degradation, 
flowering plants that have diflubenzuron residues would no longer be available for foraging by 
pollinators as flowers naturally die and do not provide pollen and nectar, and other plants would 
bloom after application without residues of diflubenzuron. 
Diflubenzuron has been associated with several potentially harmful effects on bees, even when 
mortality was not recorded. Research from Camp et al used Eastern bumble bee (Bombus 
impatiens) as surrogates to measure the effect that diflubenzuron has on bee behavior. 
Diflubenzuron (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1,000 µg/liter) was formulated as an emulsion of the sugar syrup 
with 0.5% (v/v) Honey-B-Healthy and 1% (v/v) acetone and was delivered in syrup feeders. Drone 
production was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner and the 42-d IC50 (half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration) was calculated to be 28.61 µg/liter diflubenzuron. They found that 
diflubenzuron delivered via dietary exposure of sucrose was associated with decreased pollen 
consumption and decreased drone production in bumble bee without there being a significant 
increase in adult mortalities. (Camp et al, 2020) 
However, the tested solutions of diflubenzuron in the supplied syrup and pollen are greater than the 
range of the pesticide applied during grasshopper suppression treatments. Diflubenzuron is applied 
once per year to foliar vegetation and only a miniscule proportion would be to flowers with nectar 
and pollen. In this experiment the bumble bees were fed syrup and pollen with fresh doses of

enzuron in the supplied syrup and pollen are greater than the 
range of the pesticide applied during grasshopper suppression treatments. Diflubenzuron is applied 
once per year to foliar vegetation and only a miniscule proportion would be to flowers with nectar 
and pollen. In this experiment the bumble bees were fed syrup and pollen with fresh doses of 
diflubenzuron three times per week. The same difficulty of applying this study’s findings to real 
field exposures, as is also the case with Mommaerts et.al., 2006, is described above. 
Research from Krueger et al showed that while diflubenzuron exposure didn’t impact bumble bee 
worker survival, the exposure did result in a significant decrease in drone emergence that is 
indicative of a greater sensitivity to diflubenzuron in the immature life stage. Microcolonies 
exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen (i.e. the pollen was contaminated with 10 parts per 
million of diflubenzuron) produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. 
(Krueger et al, 2021) 
A researcher found that exposure to diflubenzuron in a 10 ppm sucrose solution resulted in 
significant effect on the number of larvae successfully eclosing from eggs three days after 
collection. The researcher posited that bee embryos with poorly formed cuticle could initiate egg 
eclosion and perhaps complete it, though the survivorship of the resultant larvae would likely be 
compromised. The results she reported for diflubenzuron suggest that the larval cuticle was not 
developed, resulting in mortality before or during the hatching process, and that many of the larvae 
observed to have hatched may not have survived

eclosion and perhaps complete it, though the survivorship of the resultant larvae would likely be 
compromised. The results she reported for diflubenzuron suggest that the larval cuticle was not 
developed, resulting in mortality before or during the hatching process, and that many of the larvae 
observed to have hatched may not have survived to the later instar stages. Although the doses 
examined in this work may be high relative to what has been found inside of honeybee colonies, 
the exposure did not have an observable effect on egg production. However, successful hatching 
rates were significantly decreased in response to diflubenzuron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor (Fine 
2020).  
`

Further investigations examined two-generational effects to diflubenzuron administered at 1 ppm 
through the workers’ diet, thus exposing queens indirectly in a manner similar to what might occur 
in the field (Fine et al., 2023). The researchers tracked queen performance and worker responses to 
queens, then the performance of the exposed queens’ offspring was assessed to identify patterns 
that may contribute to the long-term health and stability of a social insect colony. 
None of the treatments had a significant effect on the total number of eggs laid. Treated worker 
diets had no effect on retinue response. No differences were detected between treatment groups in 
the consumption of pollen supplement. Treatment had no effect on worker survival and over the 
two-week monitoring period, mortality rates remained below 3.2% on average across all groups. 
No difference was detected between treatment groups in queen weight change. Major royal jelly 
protein-1, MRJP-3, vitellogenin, and vitellogenin precursor proteins were

two-week monitoring period, mortality rates remained below 3.2% on average across all groups. 
No difference was detected between treatment groups in queen weight change. Major royal jelly 
protein-1, MRJP-3, vitellogenin, and vitellogenin precursor proteins were among those quantified, 
but their abundances were not different with respect to the control queens. The researchers 
investigated global patterns of differential protein abundance between exposure groups and found 
no proteins in the diflubenzuron group were significantly altered. 
Receiving care from maternally-exposed workers did not have an effect on the laying rates of new 
queens or their total eggs produced. Receiving care from maternally-exposed workers did not affect 
the egg hatching rate of eggs laid by new queens or rate of adult eclosions relative to controls. 
Treatment also had no effect on worker pollen consumption, queen weight change, or weight at 
adult eclosion. However, treatment had a significant effect on the timing of adult eclosion. 
Maternal exposure to diflubenzuron and methoxyfenozide resulted in significantly longer average 
time to adult eclosion relative to maternal exposure to pyriproxyfen or the control group. Maternal 
pesticide treatment had no effect on worker survival and over the two week monitoring period, 
mortality rates remained below 1.7% on average across all groups, and no queen death was 
observed.

mortality rates remained below 1.7% on average across all groups, and no queen death was 
observed. 
Researchers examined synergistic toxicity of common insecticides and fungicides in California 
almond orchards. Synergistic toxicity is the toxicity of a chemical combination that is greater than 
that predicted from studies of isolated chemical constituents. Young worker larvae were fed diets 
contaminated with 2.28 µg diflubenzuron per larva and a fungicidal dose to achieve comparable 
concentration ratios simulating a tank-mix at the maximum label rate. Diflubenzuron cause 
significantly reduced adult emergence as measured by larval mortality, but no synergistic effect 
was observed when combined with fungicides (Wade et al., 2019). 
During June 2024 the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) collected 58 plant tissue 
samples from flowers within a grasshopper treatment area in Prairie County, Montana. The samples 
were sent to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service – National Science Laboratory for analysis 
to determine the concentration of diflubenzuron residue both 24 hours and 14 days after the 
application. Nine pretreatment flower tissue samples were accidentally collected before the 
insecticide application because of miscommunication between the PPQ program manager, the ARS 
field technician and the pilot. The program uses the RAATs method where spray and no-spray 
swaths are alternated. However, deposition of insecticide within the spray and no-spray swaths is 
variable because of changes in wind direction and speed, as well as the application height which is 
dictated by topography and other hazards. Of the 25 flower samples collected 24 hours after the 
treatment, 14 did not have detectable amounts of diflubenzuron, as was also the case with the nine

treatment, 14 did not have detectable amounts of diflubenzuron, as was also the case with the nine 
pretreatment samples. The sample location coordinates, and applicator flight path software 
indicated only ten of these samples were collected in between spray swaths (i.e. within skip 
swaths). Laboratory analysis showed six samples collected within skip swaths, 24 hours after the 
aerial spray treatment had diflubenzuron residues. Of the 24 samples collected 14 days after the 
`

treatment, 16 did not have detectable amounts of diflubenzuron. Five of the eight samples that had 
diflubenzuron residues 14 days after treatment were collected in skip swaths.  
Ten of the flower samples collected 24 hours after the treatment had measurable amounts of 
diflubenzuron that diminished in samples collected at the same location 14 days later. Laboratory 
analysis showed flower samples collected at five sample locations did not have detectable 
concentrations one day after the treatment, but did have diflubenzuron residues when samples were 
collected at the same or nearby locations 14 days later. Diflubenzuron residues on five flower 
samples collected immediately after treatment either did not attenuate significantly or had greater 
amounts of the chemical when more samples were collected at the same or adjacent locations 14 
days later.

and nectar after foliar diflubenzuron treatments we calculated the

samples collected immediately after treatment either did not attenuate significantly or had greater 
amounts of the chemical when more samples were collected at the same or adjacent locations 14 
days later.  
To assess risk to bees from contact with the rangeland flowers and leaves while collecting pollen 
and nectar after foliar diflubenzuron treatments we calculated the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ 
was calculated as the average concentration of diflubenzuron residues detected on plant tissue for 
both the samples collected 24 hours and 14 days after the treatment divided by acute contact LD50 
(Stoner and Eitzer 2013). Non-detection results were assigned a value of 0.099 parts per million 
(ppm), just below the limit of detection value of 0.100 ppm. Honeybee LD50 was used as LD50 was 
not consistently available for bumble and solitary bees.  
HQ (24 hours) = 245 ppb (0.245 ppm) ÷ 114.8 μg diflubenzuron per bee = 2.134 
HQ (14 days) = 159 ppb (0.159 ppm) ÷ 114.8 μg diflubenzuron per bee = 1.385 
This analysis can be interpreted there is not a significant risk to bees using a common level of 
concern of HQ > 50 (Thompson and Thorbahn 2009; Thompson 2021). Extrapolation to other 
pollinators by multiplying the HQ by an order of magnitude also did not indicate significant acute 
health risk from contact with the flowers with diflubenzuron residues.  
In addition to HQ, we calculated contact Risk Quotient (RQcontact) using the BeeREX tool 
provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is intended for foliar sprays 
Text Len: 1561

 HQ by an order of magnitude also did not indicate significant acute 
health risk from contact with the flowers with diflubenzuron residues.  
In addition to HQ, we calculated contact Risk Quotient (RQcontact) using the BeeREX tool 
provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is intended for foliar sprays 
applied to crops in bloom. Risk quotient has the advantage over HQ of taking into account the 
amount of the contaminated substance consumed or encountered by a typical honeybee forager. 
The BeeREX RQcontact is calculated by comparing the chemical application rate, multiplied by a 
constant that represents the typical amount of chemical encountered by a honeybee forager if it 
flies through a cloud of spray, to the contact acute LD50. The BeeREX RQcontact index value for 
1.0 fl.oz. Dimilin/acre (0.0078125 gal. X 2.0 lb. = 0.015625 lbs./acre) = 0.000367.   
To interpret risk to bees from contact with the diflubenzuron residues on flowers and plant tissues 
collected by USDA, the acute RQcontact value is compared to a pre-determined level of concern 
set to 0.4, which and is based on the historic average dose response relationship for acute toxicity 
studies with bees and a 10% mortality level in foragers and worker larvae. Based on calculations in 
the BeeREX risk model the index value of 0.000367 does not represent a significant risk to 
honeybees or a likely risk to other bee pollinators (USEPA 2014). Extrapolation to other pollinators 
by multiplying the RQ by an order of magnitude also did not indicate significant acute health risk

by multiplying the RQ by an order of magnitude also did not indicate significant acute health risk 
from contact with the diflubenzuron flowers. 
Insecticide applications to rangelands have the potential to impact pollinators, and in turn, 
vegetation and various rangeland species that depend on pollinated vegetation. Based on the review 
of laboratory and field toxicity data for terrestrial invertebrates, applications of diflubenzuron are 
expected to have minimal risk to pollinators of terrestrial plants. The use of RAATs provide 
`  
Page | 88 
 
additional benefits by using reduced rates and creating untreated swaths within the spray block that 
will further reduce the potential risk to pollinators.  
APHIS reduces the risk to native bees and pollinators through monitoring grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket populations and making pesticide applications in a manner that reduces the risk to 
this group of nontarget invertebrates. Monitoring grasshopper and Mormon cricket populations 
allows APHIS to determine if populations require treatment and to make treatments in a timely 
manner reducing pesticide use and emphasizing the use of program insecticides that are not broad 
spectrum. The treatment history of program since the introduction of diflubenzuron demonstrates it 
is the preferred insecticide. Over 90% of the acreage treated by the program has been with 
diflubenzuron. The effects on pollinators resulting from control of rangeland grasshopper 
populations with diflubenzuron are not expected to cause significant impacts to the

 of program since the introduction of diflubenzuron demonstrates it 
is the preferred insecticide. Over 90% of the acreage treated by the program has been with 
diflubenzuron. The effects on pollinators resulting from control of rangeland grasshopper 
populations with diflubenzuron are not expected to cause significant impacts to the human 
environment. 
(3) Physical Environment Components 
USEPA considers diflubenzuron relatively non-persistent and immobile under normal use 
conditions and stable to hydrolysis and photolysis. The chemical is considered unlikely to 
contaminate ground water or surface water (USEPA, 1997). The vapor pressure of diflubenzuron is 
relatively low, as is the Henry’s Law Constant value, suggesting the chemical will not volatilize 
readily into the atmosphere from soil, plants or water. Therefore, exposure from volatilization is 
expected to be minimal. Due to its low solubility (0.2 mg/L) and preferential binding to organic 
matter, diflubenzuron seldom persists more than a few days in water (Schaefer and Dupras, 1977). 
Mobility and leachability of diflubenzuron in soils is low, and residues are usually not detectable 
after seven days (Eisler, 2000). Aerobic aquatic half-life data in water and sediment was reported 
as 26.0 days (USEPA, 1997). Diflubenzuron applied to foliage remains adsorbed to leaf surfaces 
for several weeks with little or no absorption or translocation from plant surfaces (Eisler, 1992, 
2000). Field dissipation studies in California citrus and Oregon apple orchards reported half-live 
values of 68.2 to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as 26.0 days (USEPA, 1997). Diflubenzuron applied to foliage remains adsorbed to leaf surfaces 
for several weeks with little or no absorption or translocation from plant surfaces (Eisler, 1992, 
2000). Field dissipation studies in California citrus and Oregon apple orchards reported half-live 
values of 68.2 to 78 days (USEPA, 2018). Diflubenzuron persistence varies depending on site 
conditions and rangeland persistence is unfortunately not available. Diflubenzuron degradation is 
microbially mediated with soil aerobic half-lives much less than dissipation half-lives. 
Diflubenzuron treatments are expected to have minimal effects on terrestrial plants. Both 
laboratory and field studies demonstrate no effects using diflubenzuron over a range of application 
rates, and the direct risk to terrestrial plants is expected to be minimal (USDA APHIS, 2019c). 
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
In addition to the environmental baseline conditions, APHIS also considers other factors such as 
pest population, pest life stage, pest and plant species affected, cost share with State and private 
landowners, and the cost benefit estimate of making a treatment. Because of the cost sharing 
private landowners and land managers typically would only use diflubenzuron to suppress 
rangeland grasshoppers and preserve forage for livestock. Insecticides applied using the RAATs 
strategy is expected to provide further economic advantages due to effective treatment at reduced 
costs. The RAATs strategy reduces treatment costs to half of the costs for conventional treatments 
for rangeland grasshopper infestations (Foster et al., 2000, Lockwood and Schell, 1997). 
Another potential economic benefit of chemical treatment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 using the RAATs 
strategy is expected to provide further economic advantages due to effective treatment at reduced 
costs. The RAATs strategy reduces treatment costs to half of the costs for conventional treatments 
for rangeland grasshopper infestations (Foster et al., 2000, Lockwood and Schell, 1997). 
Another potential economic benefit of chemical treatment of grasshoppers is to crop growers near 
rangelands. This would result in socioeconomic benefits because losses, and therefore costs, of 
meat, crops, and their byproducts should be reduced. Additionally, the suppressed grasshopper 
`  
Page | 89 
 
populations in rangeland surrounding croplands could mean less of a need for costly chemical 
treatments by crop farmers at these sites.  
There is the potential for organic farms adjacent to diflubenzuron treatments in rangeland to control 
grasshopper outbreak populations. However, mitigations such as buffers are meant to protect 
adjacent environments from runoff and insecticide drift. These protective measures are expected to 
protect nearby organic farms, as well as other areas of concern, from the risk of inadvertent 
exposure to rangeland insecticide treatments. It is also likely the organic farms would also benefit 
economically from reductions in crop damage caused by grasshopper populations migrating from 
nearby rangeland. 
The suppression of grasshopper populations with diflubenzuron should benefit public uses 
rangelands for recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may 
temporarily lose the use of rangeland during and directly after diflubenzuron insecticide 
applications. However, the preservation of vegetation is expected to benefit recreational activities 
in the long-term by preserving their aesthetic

uron should benefit public uses 
rangelands for recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may 
temporarily lose the use of rangeland during and directly after diflubenzuron insecticide 
applications. However, the preservation of vegetation is expected to benefit recreational activities 
in the long-term by preserving their aesthetic value. This in turn will also increase the economic 
value of the rangeland by preserving and improving recreational opportunities.  
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
There is the potential for impacts to cultural and historical resources if the proposed diflubenzuron 
treatments occur on or near historic trails or properties. If any proposed actions are at, or adjacent 
to, the site of a historic trail or property, APHIS will consult with the appropriate landowner or land 
management agency, the State Historic Preservation Office, any affected National Trail’s 
administrative office, or other appropriate agencies. Likewise, APHIS would coordinate the timing 
of treatments with Tribes or other cooperators to ensure insecticide applications would not occur 
during scheduled cultural events or ceremonies.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
APHIS uses diflubenzuron insecticide treatments to suppress grasshopper populations in rural 
rangeland areas that are largely uninhabited. Disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas, where 
agriculture is a primary industry. The areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural dwellings in 
ranching communities with low population density. The program notifies residents within 
treatment areas, or their designated

 and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas, where 
agriculture is a primary industry. The areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural dwellings in 
ranching communities with low population density. The program notifies residents within 
treatment areas, or their designated representatives, prior to proposed operations to reduce the 
potential for incidental exposure to residents including children. Treatments are conducted 
primarily on open rangelands where children would not be expected to be present during treatment 
or to enter should there be any restricted entry period after treatment. The program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA APHIS, 2016).  
APHIS’ HHERA for diflubenzuron evaluated the potential exposure to each insecticide used in the 
program and risks associated with these insecticides to residents, including children. The HHERA 
suggest that no disproportionate risks to children, as part of the general public, are anticipated 
(USDA APHIS, 2019c).

c) Reduced Area Agent Treatments (RAATs)  
The use of RAATS is the standard methodology used by APHIS in Oregon. The RAATs method is 
an effective IPM strategy because the goal is to suppress grasshopper populations to a desired 
level, rather than to reduce those populations to the greatest possible extent. All APHIS 
grasshopper treatments are conducted in adherence with U.S.

The use of RAATS is the standard methodology used by APHIS in Oregon. The RAATs method is 
an effective IPM strategy because the goal is to suppress grasshopper populations to a desired 
level, rather than to reduce those populations to the greatest possible extent. All APHIS 
grasshopper treatments are conducted in adherence with U.S. EPA approved label directions. 
Labeled application rates for grasshopper control tend to be lower than rates used against other 
pests. The RAATs rates used for grasshopper control by APHIS are lower than rates typically used 
by private landowners. APHIS would apply a single application of insecticide per year, typically 
using a RAATs strategy that decreases the rate of insecticide applied by either using lower 
insecticide spray concentrations, or by alternating one or more treatment swaths. Usually, RAATs 
applications use both lower concentrations and skip treatment swaths. The RAATs strategy 
suppresses grasshoppers within treated swaths, while conserving grasshopper predators and 
parasites in swaths that are not treated.  
The efficacy of a RAATs strategy in reducing grasshoppers is, therefore, less than conventional 
treatments and more variable. Foster et al. (2000) reported that grasshopper mortality using RAATs 
was reduced 2 to 15% from conventional treatments, depending on the insecticide, while 
Lockwood et al. (2000) reported 0 to 26% difference in mortality between conventional and 
RAATs methods. APHIS will consider the effects of not suppressing grasshoppers to the greatest 
extent possible as part of the treatment planning process.

RAATs methods. APHIS will consider the effects of not suppressing grasshoppers to the greatest 
extent possible as part of the treatment planning process.  
(1) Human Health 
The potential effects on human health during the application of pesticides using the RAATs 
method depends on the choice of insecticide. The possible exposure scenarios are described in 
detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. The minimal risk to program workers would 
not decrease because the mixing and formulation of the pesticide procedures would remain the 
same and are expected to prevent exposure. Any potential exposure of bystanders within treatment 
blocks would be reduced because of the lower application rates and skip swaths where insecticides 
are not applied.  
(2) Nontarget Species 
The potential effects on nontarget species during the application of pesticides using the RAATs 
method depends on the choice of insecticide. The possible environmental impacts are described in 
detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. Any exposure of nontarget species within 
treatment blocks would be reduced because of the lower application rates and skip swaths where 
insecticides are not applied. Therefore, the risk of significant impacts to populations of nontarget 
species would be less than if the program used conventional application rates and complete 
coverage of the treatment area.

depends on the choice of insecticide. The expected fate of program applied chemicals, and possible 
environmental impacts are described in detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. The 
concentration of pesticide residues within treatment blocks would be reduced because of the lower 
application rates and skip swaths where insecticides are not applied. Therefore

 pesticides using the RAATs method 
depends on the choice of insecticide. The expected fate of program applied chemicals, and possible 
environmental impacts are described in detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. The 
concentration of pesticide residues within treatment blocks would be reduced because of the lower 
application rates and skip swaths where insecticides are not applied. Therefore, the risk of 
significant impacts to air, soil and water resources would be less than if the program used 
conventional application rates and complete coverage of the treatment area.

(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
RAATs reduces treatment costs and conserves non-target biological resources in untreated areas. 
The potential economic advantages of RAATs were proposed by Larsen and Foster (1996), and 
empirically demonstrated by Lockwood and Schell (1997). Widespread efforts to communicate the 
advantages of RAATs across the Western States were undertaken in 1998 and have continued on 
an annual basis. The viability of RAATs at an operational scale was initially demonstrated by 
Lockwood et al. (2000), and subsequently confirmed by Foster et al. (2000). The first government 
agencies to adopt RAATs in their grasshopper suppression programs were the Platte and Goshen 
County Weed and Pest Districts in Wyoming; they also funded research at the University of 
Wyoming to support the initial studies in 1995. This method is now commonly used by 
government agencies and private landowners in States where grasshopper control is required. 
(5) Cultural Resources and Events

during grasshopper suppression operations because of our close cooperation with Tribes and other 
stakeholders. This would be the

(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
APHIS expects there is a negligible possibility of harm to cultural resources or disruption of events 
during grasshopper suppression operations because of our close cooperation with Tribes and other 
stakeholders. This would be the case regardless of whether the program used the RAATs method or 
conventional rates at complete coverage.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
APHIS uses the RAATs method to suppress grasshopper populations in rural rangeland areas that 
are largely uninhabited. Disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental 
impacts on Tribes in a program area are unlikely. The potential effects on human health during the 
application of pesticides using the RAATs method depends on the choice of insecticide. The 
possible exposure scenarios are described in detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. 
Any potential exposure of children near or within treatment blocks would be reduced because of 
the lower application rates and skip swaths where insecticides are not applied.

IV. Conclusions 
This EA examines alternatives available to APHIS when requested to suppress economically 
damaging outbreaks of grasshoppers. The preferred alternative includes insecticide treatments 
which are considered based on the site conditions. APHIS decides whether a suppression of the 
outbreak is warranted based on the IPM principles including an assessment of the economic injury 
level represented by the grasshopper populations. This EA discusses and examines the tools and 
strategies employed by APHIS and their potential effects on the human environment. This EA does 
not decide which alternative will be selected, however, all reasonable options available to

 a suppression of the 
outbreak is warranted based on the IPM principles including an assessment of the economic injury 
level represented by the grasshopper populations. This EA discusses and examines the tools and 
strategies employed by APHIS and their potential effects on the human environment. This EA does 
not decide which alternative will be selected, however, all reasonable options available to the 
agency for dealing with grasshopper infestations have been adequately considered, including 
consideration of direct, indirect and cumulative environmental effects. Decisions about whether, 
how, and when to employ the tools and strategies discussed in the EA will be made as the need to 
suppress grasshopper populations at specific sites arises.  
In June 2002, APHIS completed an EIS describing the agency’s most effective methods of 
reducing the damage caused by grasshopper populations to rangeland in the western United States. 
During November 2019, APHIS published HHERA for the use of carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, 
diflubenzuron and malathion by the program. APHIS also published an updated EIS to consolidate 
and incorporate the available data and analyze the environmental risk of new program tools. The 
risk analysis in the 2019 EIS is incorporated by reference (USDA APHIS, 2019). 
This EA examined a No Action alternative, where APHIS would not conduct a program to 
suppress grasshoppers other than provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the 
implementation of IPM strategies by land managers. Without an APHIS administered program 
Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, private 
groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort. Without the 
coordination that APHIS provides during grasshopper outbreaks, the land managers

 other than provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the 
implementation of IPM strategies by land managers. Without an APHIS administered program 
Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, private 
groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort. Without the 
coordination that APHIS provides during grasshopper outbreaks, the land managers and owners 
could use insecticides that APHIS considers too environmentally harsh. Multiple treatments and 
excessive amount of insecticide could be applied in efforts to suppress or even locally eradicate 
grasshopper populations. Conversely, in the absence of an APHIS funded grasshopper suppression 
program the most likely environmental effects would result from other agencies and land managers 
not controlling outbreaks. As noted, grasshoppers consuming vast amounts of vegetation in 
rangelands and surrounding areas. Grasshoppers are generalist feeders, eating grasses and forbs 
first and often moving to cultivated crops. 
Under the Preferred Alternative APHIS would participate in grasshopper programs with the option 
of using one of the insecticides [abridge this list and the following risk analysis sections as 
appropriate for this EA] carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, diflubenzuron, or malathion, depending upon 
the various factors related to the grasshopper outbreak and the site-specific characteristics. The use 
of an insecticide would typically occur at half the conventional application rates following the 
RAATs strategy. APHIS would apply a single treatment per year to affected rangeland areas to 
suppress grasshopper outbreak populations.  
Each alternative described in this EA potentially has adverse environmental effects. The general 
environmental impacts of each alternative are discussed in detail in the 2019 programmatic EIS 
published by APHIS. The specific impacts of

RAATs strategy. APHIS would apply a single treatment per year to affected rangeland areas to 
suppress grasshopper outbreak populations.  
Each alternative described in this EA potentially has adverse environmental effects. The general 
environmental impacts of each alternative are discussed in detail in the 2019 programmatic EIS 
published by APHIS. The specific impacts of the alternatives are highly dependent upon the 
particular action and location of the grasshopper infestation. The principal concerns associated with 
the alternatives are: (1) the potential effects of insecticides on human health (including 
subpopulations that might be at increased risk); and (2) impacts of insecticides on nontarget 
organisms (including threatened and endangered species).

Appendix A: APHIS Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression 
Program Treatment Guidelines 
FY-2025 Treatment Guidelines 
Version   1/9/2023 
The objectives of the APHIS Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program are to 1) 
conduct surveys in the Western States; 2) provide technical assistance to land managers and private 
landowners; and 3) when funds permit, suppress economically damaging grasshopper and Mormon cricket 
outbreaks on Federal, Tribal, State, and/or private rangeland.  The Plant Protection Act of 2000 provides 
APHIS the authority to take these actions. 
 
General Guidelines for Grasshopper / Mormon Cricket Treatments 
 
1. All treatments must be in accordance with: 
a. the Plant Protection Act of 2000; 
b. applicable environmental laws and policies such as: the National Environmental Policy Act, the 
Endangered Species Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and the Clean Water 
Act (including National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements – if  applicable);  
c. applicable state laws;  
d. APHIS Directives pertaining to the proposed action; 
e. Memoranda of Understanding with other Federal agencies. 

Text Len: 1503

, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and the Clean Water 
Act (including National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements – if  applicable);  
c. applicable state laws;  
d. APHIS Directives pertaining to the proposed action; 
e. Memoranda of Understanding with other Federal agencies. 
 
2. Subject to the availability of funds, upon request of the administering agency, the agriculture department of an 
affected State, or private landowners, APHIS, to protect rangeland, shall immediately treat Federal, Tribal, 
State, or private lands that are infested with grasshoppers or Mormon crickets at levels of economic 
infestation, unless APHIS determines that delaying treatment will not cause greater economic damage to 
adjacent owners of rangeland.  In carrying out this section, APHIS shall work in conjunction with other 
Federal, State, Tribal, and private prevention, control, or suppression efforts to protect rangeland. 
 
3. Prior to the treatment season, conduct meetings or provide guidance that allows for public participation in the 
decision-making process.  In addition, notify Federal, State and Tribal land managers and private landowners 
of the potential for grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks on their lands.  Request that the land manager / 
landowner advise APHIS of any sensitive sites that may exist in the proposed treatment areas. 
 
4. Consultation with local Tribal representatives will take place prior to treatment programs to fully inform the 
Tribes of possible actions APHIS may take on Tribal lands. 
 
5. On APHIS run suppression programs and subject to funding availablity, the Federal government will bear the 
cost of treatment up to 100 percent on Federal and Tribal Trust land, 50 percent of the cost
Text Len: 1781
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ation with local Tribal representatives will take place prior to treatment programs to fully inform the 
Tribes of possible actions APHIS may take on Tribal lands. 
 
5. On APHIS run suppression programs and subject to funding availablity, the Federal government will bear the 
cost of treatment up to 100 percent on Federal and Tribal Trust land, 50 percent of the cost on State land, and 
33 percent of cost on private land.  There is an additional 16.15% charge, however, on any funds received by 
APHIS for federal involvement with suppression treatments.  
6. Land managers are responsible for the overall management of rangeland under their control to prevent or 
reduce the severity of grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks.  Land managers are encouraged to have 
implemented Integrated Pest Management Systems prior to requesting a treatment.  In the absence of 
available funding or in the place of APHIS funding, the Federal land management agency, Tribal authority or 
other party/ies may opt to reimburse APHIS for suppression treatments. Interagency agreements or 
reimbursement agreements must be completed prior to the start of treatments which will be charged thereto. 
 
 
Page | 104 
 
7. There are situations where APHIS may be requested to treat rangeland that also includes small areas where 
crops are being grown (typically less than 10 percent of the treatment area).  In those situations, the crop 
owner pays the entire treatment costs on the croplands.   
 
NOTE: The insecticide being considered must be labeled for the included crop as well as rangeland and current 
Worker Protection Standards must be followed by the applicator and private landowner. 
 
8. In some cases, rangeland treatments may be conducted by other federal agencies (e

 pays the entire treatment costs on the croplands.   
 
NOTE: The insecticide being considered must be labeled for the included crop as well as rangeland and current 
Worker Protection Standards must be followed by the applicator and private landowner. 
 
8. In some cases, rangeland treatments may be conducted by other federal agencies (e.g., Forest Service, Bureau 
of Land Management, or Bureau of Indian Affairs) or by non-federal entities (e.g., Grazing Association or 
County Pest District).  APHIS may choose to assist these groups in a variety of ways, such as: 
a. loaning equipment (an agreement may be required): 
b. contributing in-kind services such as surveys to determine insect species, instars, and infestation levels; 
c. monitoring for effectiveness of the treatment; 
d. providing technical guidance. 
 
9. In areas considered for treatment, State-registered beekeepers and organic producers shall be notified in 
advance of proposed treatments.  If necessary, non-treated buffer zones can be established.  
 
Operational Procedures     
 
GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR ALL AERIAL AND GROUND APPLICATIONS 
 
1. Follow all applicable Federal, Tribal, State, and local laws and regulations in conducting grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket suppression treatments. 
 
2. Notify residents within treatment areas, or their designated representatives, prior to proposed operations.  
Advise them of the control method to be used, proposed method of application, and precautions to be taken. 
 
3. One of the following insecticides that are labeled for rangeland use can be used for a suppression treatment of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets:

 within treatment areas, or their designated representatives, prior to proposed operations.  
Advise them of the control method to be used, proposed method of application, and precautions to be taken. 
 
3. One of the following insecticides that are labeled for rangeland use can be used for a suppression treatment of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets:  
a. Carbaryl 
1. solid bait 
2. ultra-low volume (ULV) spray 
b. Diflubenzuron ULV spray 
c. Malathion ULV spray      
d. Chlorantraniliprole spray                                                                                                
 
4. Do not apply insecticides directly to water bodies (defined herein as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by 
seasonal streams, springs, wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers).  
 
Furthermore, provide the following buffers for water bodies:  
• 500-foot buffer with aerial liquid insecticide. 
• 200-foot buffer with ground liquid insecticide. 
• 200-foot buffer with aerial bait. 
• 50-foot buffer with ground bait. 
   
5. Instruct program personnel in the safe use of equipment, materials, and procedures; supervise to ensure safety 
procedures are properly followed. 
 
6. Conduct mixing, loading, and unloading in an approved

 liquid insecticide. 
• 200-foot buffer with aerial bait. 
• 50-foot buffer with ground bait. 
   
5. Instruct program personnel in the safe use of equipment, materials, and procedures; supervise to ensure safety 
procedures are properly followed. 
 
6. Conduct mixing, loading, and unloading in an approved area where an accidental spill would not contaminate 
a water body. 
 
Page | 105 
 
 
7. Each aerial suppression program will have a Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) OR a Treatment 
Manager on site.  Each State will have at least one COR available to assist the Contracting Officer (CO) in 
GH/MC aerial suppression programs.  
 
NOTE: A Treatment Manager is an individual that the COR has delegated authority to oversee the actual 
suppression treatment; someone who is on the treatment site and overseeing / coordinating the treatment and 
communicating with the COR. No specific training is required, but knowledge of the Aerial Application 
Manual and treatment experience is critical; attendance to the Aerial Applicators Workshop is very beneficial.  
 
8. Each suppression program will conduct environmental monitoring as outlined in the current year’s 
Environmental Monitoring Plan. 
 
APHIS will assess and monitor rangeland treatments for the efficacy of the treatment, to verify that a suppression 
treatment program has properly been implemented, and to assure that any environmentally sensitive sites are 
protected.  
 
9. APHIS reporting requirements associated with grasshopper / Mormon cricket suppression treatments include:  
a. Completion of a post-treatment report (Part C of the Project Planning and Reporting Worksheet 
(PPQ Form 62) 
b. Providing an entry for each treatment in the PPQ Grasshopper
Text Len: 1741
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 sites are 
protected.  
 
9. APHIS reporting requirements associated with grasshopper / Mormon cricket suppression treatments include:  
a. Completion of a post-treatment report (Part C of the Project Planning and Reporting Worksheet 
(PPQ Form 62) 
b. Providing an entry for each treatment in the PPQ Grasshopper/Mormon Cricket treatment database 
c. For aerial treatments, providing copies of forms and treatment/plane data for input into the Federal 
Aviation Interactive Reporting System (FAIRS) by PPQ’s designee 
SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR AERIAL APPLICATIONS  
 
1. APHIS Aerial treatment contracts will adhere to the current year’s Statement of Work (SOW). 
 
2. Minimize the potential for drift and volatilization by not using ULV sprays when the following conditions 
exist in the spray area: 
a) Wind velocity exceeds 10 miles per hour (unless state law requires lower wind speed); 
b) Rain is falling or is imminent; 
c) Dew is present over large areas within the treatment block; 
d) There is air turbulence that could affect the spray deposition; 
e) Temperature inversions (ground temperature higher than air temperature) develop and deposition 
onto the ground is affected. 
 
3. Weather conditions will be monitored and documented during application and treatment will be suspended 
when conditions could jeopardize the correct spray placement or pilot safety. 
 
4. Application aircraft will fly at a median altitude of 1 to 1.5 times the wingspan of the aircraft whenever 
possible or as specified by the COR or the Treatment Manager. 
 
5. Whenever possible, plan aerial ferrying and turnaround routes to avoid flights over congested areas, water 
bodies

Dear Ms. Willard: 
This letter is in response to the United States Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Services (APHIS) December 13, 2023, request for concurrence on 
determinations of “may affect, not likely to adversely affect,” (NLAA) federally listed, proposed 
and candidate species and designated and proposed critical habitats related to APHIS’ proposal 
to conduct chemical treatments to suppress grasshopper infestations as part of the Rangeland 
Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program (Program) in 17 Western States. In their 
accompanying Biological Assessment for the APHIS Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon 
Cricket Suppression Program, December 2023, revised on January 23, 2024, APHIS uses a risk 
assessment approach to evaluate response data to characterize the potential hazard/risk of the use 
of three of four chemicals in the program to aquatic and terrestrial listed species and their habitat. 
APHIS is adopting the risk assessment and conservation measures from the 2022 U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service Biological Opinion for the reregistration of malathion, and thus, malathion is 
not considered further in their BA. The Service provides this response pursuant to section 7(a)(2) 
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), as amended.

Wildlife Service Biological Opinion for the reregistration of malathion, and thus, malathion is 
not considered further in their BA. The Service provides this response pursuant to section 7(a)(2) 
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), as amended. 
APHIS has made a NLAA determination for their Proposed Action for 201 threatened and 
endangered species, 11 proposed species, 93 designated and 8 proposed critical habitats These 
species include 10 amphibians, 15 birds, 57 fishes, 31 invertebrates, 15 mammals, 78 plants, and 
8 reptiles. A complete list of these species and critical habitats can be found in Enclosure A. 
 
Description of the Proposed Action 
The intent of APHIS’ Program is to reduce populations of various species of grasshoppers and 
Mormon crickets on rangeland in Arizona, California (partial), Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, 
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada (partial), New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma (partial), Oregon 
(partial), South Dakota, Texas (partial), Utah, Washington (partial), and Wyoming. Chemical 
treatments include a seasonal one-time treatment of diflubenzuron, carbaryl, malathion, or

chlorantraniliprole which can be applied from the ground or air. All four chemicals are applied 
at substantially reduced rates, compared to their recommended label uses, and are applied over 
an entire treatment area/spray block, or in alternating swaths within a treatment area/spray 
block. 
Decisions to conduct grasshopper treatments are based on many factors including the number of 
grasshoppers present in the area, grasshopper and plant species composition, life-cycle stage of

 label uses, and are applied over 
an entire treatment area/spray block, or in alternating swaths within a treatment area/spray 
block. 
Decisions to conduct grasshopper treatments are based on many factors including the number of 
grasshoppers present in the area, grasshopper and plant species composition, life-cycle stage of 
the grasshoppers, range condition, the economic significance of the infestation, and whether it is 
economically and logistically feasible to conduct an effective program. 
Toxicity data related to potential direct and indirect effects to listed species were compared to 
exposure estimates for diflubenzuron, carbaryl, and chlorantraniliprole to characterize risk to 
listed species and any designated critical habitat. APHIS reviewed the ecology of the listed 
species, including their distribution throughout the program action area, to determine whether a 
listed entity is found within the program treatment areas and, thus, would likely be exposed to 
any of the program chemicals. 
Based on this review, APHIS identified listed species that could potentially occur in the program 
area, and then used results from the risk characterization for the three chemicals to develop 
program application buffers and other mitigation measures to avoid and/or minimize the 
potential for adverse impacts to listed species and their critical habitat (See Appendix A-9 of the 
BA or Enclosure B). 
 
Best Management Practices (BMPs) 
Surveys 
Prior to any insecticide applications, APHIS conducts immature grasshopper surveys (i.e., 
nymphal surveys) in the spring and early summer (USDA, 2024). The number of grasshopper 
nymphs present within a given area are counted (USDA, 2024). Data gathered includes the stage 
of grasshopper development

Prior to any insecticide applications, APHIS conducts immature grasshopper surveys (i.e., 
nymphal surveys) in the spring and early summer (USDA, 2024). The number of grasshopper 
nymphs present within a given area are counted (USDA, 2024). Data gathered includes the stage 
of grasshopper development; location of sensitive areas such as bee yards and aquatic resources; 
the condition of the rangeland in relation to grasshopper numbers; and the extent of the 
infestation (USDA, 2024). This data is used for planning large-scale treatment programs and 
fiscal tracking, and for local decisions on treatments within a State (USDA, 2024). 
Adult surveys occur in late summer and early fall (USDA, 2024). This survey is timed to 
coincide with the peak populations (USDA, 2024). Adult survey data are useful in predicting if 
and where potential grasshopper problems are likely to occur in the spring and early summer of 
the next growing season (USDA, 2024). 
The survey data collected by the program is used by the agency and land managers/owners to 
assess whether treatments are warranted. Treatments must be requested from a Federal land 
management agency or a State agriculture department (on behalf of a State or local government, 
or private group or individual) that has jurisdiction over the land before APHIS can begin a 
treatment (USDA, 2024). Upon request, APHIS personnel conduct a site visit to determine 
whether APHIS action is warranted (USDA, 2024). Relevant factors influencing this decision 
may include, but are not limited to, the pest species, timing of treatment relative to the biological 
stage of the pest species, costs and benefits of conducting the action, and ecological impacts

may include, but are not limited to, the pest species, timing of treatment relative to the biological 
stage of the pest species, costs and benefits of conducting the action, and ecological impacts 
(USDA, 2024). Based on survey results conducted during the growing season, APHIS is better 
able to predict the potential for large grasshopper populations and to respond quickly before 
extensive loss occurs to rangeland (USDA, 2024). Thus, State and Federal officials may initiate 
early coordination of local programs and request APHIS’ assistance in a timely and effective 
cooperative effort (USDA, 2024).

Insecticide Application 
When land managers request direct intervention, APHIS’ role in the suppression of grasshoppers 
is through a single application of an insecticide—carbaryl, diflubenzuron, malathion, or 
chlorantraniliprole (USDA, 2024). All four insecticides are labeled by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs (EPA–OPP) for rangeland use in the control of 
grasshoppers, including Mormon crickets (USDA, 2024). APHIS may conduct insecticide 
treatments in the above mentioned 17 states. With the exception of chlorantraniliprole, the 
remaining three insecticides are registered for use in all states considered in this program (USDA 
2015). 
Program insecticide applications can be applied in two different forms: liquid ultra-low-volume 
(ULV) sprays, or solid-based baits

ments in the above mentioned 17 states. With the exception of chlorantraniliprole, the 
remaining three insecticides are registered for use in all states considered in this program (USDA 
2015). 
Program insecticide applications can be applied in two different forms: liquid ultra-low-volume 
(ULV) sprays, or solid-based baits (USDA, 2024). Both ULV sprays and baits can be distributed 
by aerial or ground applications (USDA, 2024). Aerial applications are typical for treatments 
over large areas (USDA, 2024). Some grasshopper outbreak locations are economically or 
logistically accessible only by aircraft, while other locations may be best treated by ground 
applications (USDA, 2024). Ground applications are most likely to be made when treating 
localized grasshopper outbreaks or for treatments where the most precise placement of 
insecticide is desired (USDA, 2024). 
Buffers and Conservation Measures 
A reduced agent area treatment (RAATs) rate can be used for all four insecticides (USDA, 
2024). This strategy uses insecticides at low rates combined with a reduction in the area treated 
for grasshopper suppression (USDA, 2024). The RAATs strategy relies on the effects of an 
insecticide to suppress grasshoppers within treated swaths, and the conservation of grasshopper 
predators and parasites in swaths not directly treated (untreated). 
The Program has also established treatment restriction buffers around waterbodies to protect 
those features from insecticide drift and runoff (USDA, 2024). APHIS maintains the following 
buffers for water bodies that are not designated critical habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot 
buffer for aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground sprays, and a 50-

Application buffers as well as additional mitigation measures to protect listed species and their 
critical habitat have also been established for all four pesticides. Parameters specific to the given 
pesticide are used for inputs into the modeling program, AgDrift, to establish additional 
mitigation measure buffer distances for those areas where Program activities and listed species 
and their designated critical habitat are present (USDA, 2024). Specific buffer distances were 
established based on the integration of available effects and exposure data to characterize direct 
and indirect risk to listed species and their critical habitat (USDA, 2024). In addition to the 
standard spray buffers, conservation measures include additional measures for critical habitat 
PCEs, larger buffers for lekking sites (e.g., Greater sage-grouse), larger buffers for species (e.g., 
birds) that rely primarily on insects as food, and additional upstream buffers for fish. These 
additional conservation measures are described in Enclosure B 
In addition to the chemical-specific application buffers, additional label and other requirements 
have been incorporated into the Program to reduce the potential exposure of threatened and 
endangered species and designated critical habitat to Program insecticide treatments: 
• Avoid applications when sustained winds speeds exceed 10 miles per hour (mph). 
• Use RAATs adjacent to locations of listed species and designated critical habitats. 
• Avoid applications under conditions where a temperature inversion is possible or

have been incorporated into the Program to reduce the potential exposure of threatened and 
endangered species and designated critical habitat to Program insecticide treatments: 
• Avoid applications when sustained winds speeds exceed 10 miles per hour (mph). 
• Use RAATs adjacent to locations of listed species and designated critical habitats. 
• Avoid applications under conditions where a temperature inversion is possible or when a 
storm event is imminent.

The use of RAATs will be required for 500 feet from a ground application or 1,000 feet from an 
aerial application (USDA, 2024). This distance will be used from the location of a listed species, 
or its critical habitat when no application buffer is required, or from the distance beyond the no 
application buffer (USDA, 2024). Beyond these distances the program can choose to continue 
RAATs applications or use full applications depending on site-specific conditions and the need 
for greater efficacy (USDA, 2024). 
The avoidance of applications during storm events is required to reduce the probability of off-site 
transport of program insecticides via runoff (USDA, 2024). Variability in weather patterns, even 
within small geographic areas, requires a site-specific evaluation of conditions by program 
personnel prior to application to determine if a rainfall or storm event would result in conditions 
where runoff to sensitive habitats could occur given site conditions and the proposed application 
buffers (USDA, 2024).

Monitoring data from drift cards collected from 2003 to 2022 was reviewed and compared to

Exposure 
Observed Residue Values from Program Applications 
Monitoring data from drift cards collected from 2003 to 2022 was reviewed and compared to 
modeled data to determine if the drift assumptions were representative of the drift expected from 
the Program applications. Drift card data provides a standardized unit of measurement (mg/m2) 
to compare with the outputs of terrestrial deposition estimates in AgDrift. The drift card 
comparisons are made primarily with diflubenzuron as this is the preferred active ingredient to 
be used for the Program activities, and thus, there are data to address the drift assumptions. 
Aquatic residues from the monitoring data are also summarized but are not able to be compared 
to AgDrift outputs due to difficulties with quantifying the waterbody types, sizes, and flow 
regimes. 
Modeling Estimates for all three pesticides using AgDrift 
The aquatic residue values calculated using AgDrift were generated based on conservative 
assumptions and then compared to toxicity values. The parameters used in AgDrift are discussed 
in detail in the Drift Simulations section of the BA (p. 30). While drift card data residue values 
varied, generally the closer to the treatment site, the more residue was detected, but values 
ranged from < LOD (limit of detection) to 1.07 mg/m2 overall. The average drift value estimated 
at 500 feet was 0.246 mg/m2 which is greater than what is observed from most drift card data at 
500 feet (drift card data from 2003 to 2022 at 500 feet ranged from < 0.015 – 0.29 mg/m2 from 
both carbaryl and diflubenzuron applications; BA pp 26-30).

 than what is observed from most drift card data at 
500 feet (drift card data from 2003 to 2022 at 500 feet ranged from < 0.015 – 0.29 mg/m2 from 
both carbaryl and diflubenzuron applications; BA pp 26-30). 
Run-off residues in waterbodies are considered minimal due to the reduced application rates and 
the large buffers in place as standard for all aquatic environments and are discussed in more 
detail in the Runoff Simulations section of the BA (p.32). 
Residue Estimates for Terrestrial Non-Target Organisms 
Estimated exposure levels on vegetation and other forage items for terrestrial species were 
calculated using the Terrestrial Residue Exposure Model (T-REX) developed by EPA (US EPA, 
2012). More details on how this model was used and the parameters for the inputs are provided 
in the BA (p.34). Exposure concentrations for birds and mammals are based on mg/kg diet or 
mg/kg body weight. The resulting concentrations from the model estimates (for each insecticide) 
represent what would be expected from a direct application to the listed dietary item and are then 
used to determine residues for different mammals and birds based on their body size and food 
consumption. These values are then compared to the effects data toxicity endpoints. 
 
Page | 112 
 
AgDrift was then used to estimate the amount of drift reduction needed to arrive below the 
toxicity endpoint. The input parameters used for estimating the aquatic residues provided in 
Tables 2-1 and 2-2 of the BA were the same as those used for estimating drift reduction in 
terrestrial environments. APHIS developed the proposed buffers using these input parameters to 
determine removal of 99% of the off-site drift from the

Tables 2-1 and 2-2 of the BA were the same as those used for estimating drift reduction in 
terrestrial environments. APHIS developed the proposed buffers using these input parameters to 
determine removal of 99% of the off-site drift from the program applications that will be 
protective of listed species and their critical habitat as applicable. 
 
Effects of the Action 
Throughout this section we summarize or describe toxicity effects of the three chemicals used in 
the APHIS grasshopper/cricket suppression program. Toxicity is described for both aquatic and 
terrestrial species using U.S. EPA criteria based on concentrations of a particular chemical 
(practically non-toxic, slightly toxic, moderately toxic, highly toxic, very highly toxic; Aquatic 
and Terrestrial Organism Criteria for Toxicity). Where data were unavailable for certain 
taxonomic groups, surrogate species data are described with assumptions for use of those data 
where indicated. 
For aquatic species, a range of toxicity values is provided for each taxa group to describe the 
potential effects observed from exposure to the three chemicals, carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and 
diflubenzuron. These values are then compared, in the risk section discussion, to the estimated 
concentrations from field monitoring data collected, as well as AgDrift modeled estimates. 
For terrestrial species, toxicity is also described based on route of exposure (i.e., oral, contact, 
dermal) and either acute or chronic (i.e., reproductive or developmental). These values are then 
scaled based on the body weight of the test organism of focus and compared in the risk section 
discussion. APHIS uses

 modeled estimates. 
For terrestrial species, toxicity is also described based on route of exposure (i.e., oral, contact, 
dermal) and either acute or chronic (i.e., reproductive or developmental). These values are then 
scaled based on the body weight of the test organism of focus and compared in the risk section 
discussion. APHIS uses a methodology used by the U.S. EPA (U.S. EPA Ecological Risk 
Assessment Methodology) to describe risk of exposure to different taxonomic groups of 
organisms from each of the three program chemicals. A Risk Quotient (RQ) is calculated by 
dividing a point estimate of exposure (residues on dietary items or thresholds for a given effect) 
by a point estimate of effect and compared to a level of concern (LOC). RQs <1 are not 
expected to result in adverse effects, while RQs >1 are expected to result in adverse effects. 
For critical habitat, APHIS reviewed the primary constituent elements (PCEs) or physical and 
biological features (PBFs) to determine if the Program activities would cause destruction or 
adverse modification of these features. 
In addition, the BA goes into detail to discuss the relevant toxicity of the metabolites that may be 
found in environmental matrices such as soil and water, for all three chemicals as well (see pages 
20, 38, 49, 59 in the BA).  
Carbaryl 
The mode of action of carbamates occurs primarily through acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibition (Klaassen, Andur, & Doull, 1986), (Smith J. G., 1987). The AChE enzyme breaks 
down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that allows for the transfer of

Carbaryl 
The mode of action of carbamates occurs primarily through acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibition (Klaassen, Andur, & Doull, 1986), (Smith J. G., 1987). The AChE enzyme breaks 
down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that allows for the transfer of nerve impulses across nerve 
synapses. Carbamates have a reversible enzyme binding reaction in that the binding will decrease 
as the concentration decreases over time due to metabolism and excretion. 
Aquatic Species 
The 96-hour acute median lethal concentration for carbaryl for fish ranges from 0.14 mg/L for 
channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus; (Brown, Anderson, Jones, Deuel, & Price, 1979) to 1,188 
mg/L for the walking catfish (Clarias batrachus; (Chakrawarti & Chaurasia, 1981). 
 
Page | 113 
 
For chronic effects to fish, chronic NOEC concentrations for studies ranging from 32-35 day 
exposures, are 210, 650, and 445 µg/L for the fathead minnow, bonytail (a listed species 
considered for this consultation) and the Colorado pikeminnow (also a listed species considered 
in the consultation; (Beyers, Keefe, & Carlson, 1994), (Carlson, 1972), respectively. 
For aquatic invertebrates, carbaryl is very highly toxic to all aquatic insects, and highly to very 
highly toxic to most aquatic crustaceans. The toxicity from 96-hour acute static tests ranged from 
1.5 μg/L in the shrimp, Paneaus aztecus, to 22.7 mg/L in the mussel, Mytilus edul

For aquatic invertebrates, carbaryl is very highly toxic to all aquatic insects, and highly to very 
highly toxic to most aquatic crustaceans. The toxicity from 96-hour acute static tests ranged from 
1.5 μg/L in the shrimp, Paneaus aztecus, to 22.7 mg/L in the mussel, Mytilus edulis (Mayer F. 
L., 1987), (US EPA, 2003). EC50/LC50 values for crustaceans range from 5 to 9 μg/L (cladoceran, 
mysid), 8 to 25 μg/L (scud), and 500 to 2,500 μg/L (crayfish) (Peterson, et al., 1994). Aquatic 
insects have a similar range of sensitivity. 
Chronic toxicity of carbaryl to aquatic invertebrates varies by taxa group. Reproductive and 
growth endpoints have been reported for cladocerans that range from 1.0 to 15 µg/L. A NOEC of 
500 µg/L was reported for the chironomid midge (Hanazato, 1991), (USDA Forest Service, 
2008), (US EPA, 2003). 
For aquatic plants, a study testing the effects to the freshwater green algae, Pseudokirchneriella 
subcapitata, reported a EC50 and NOEC of 1.27 and 0.29 mg/L, respectively (USDA Forest 
Service, 2008). (Peterson, et al., 1994) found statistically significant effects at 3.7 mg/L on four 
algal species and the aquatic macrophyte, Lemna minor (duckweed). (Boonyawanich, et al.,

Service, 2008). (Peterson, et al., 1994) found statistically significant effects at 3.7 mg/L on four 
algal species and the aquatic macrophyte, Lemna minor (duckweed). (Boonyawanich, et al., 
2001) reported 96-hour EC50 values of 0.996, 0.785, and 0.334 g/L for three aquatic plants: 
Ipomoea aquatica, Pistia stratiotes, and Hydrocharis dubia (water spinach, water lettuce, and 
frogbit), respectively. 
Terrestrial Species 
Carbaryl is moderate in toxicity when ingested by male and female rats. The oral LD50 in male 
and female rats is 302.6 mg/kg and 311.5 mg/kg, respectively (US EPA, 2003). Low doses can 
cause skin and eye irritation. The acute inhalation LD50 is 721 mg/kg. The acute dermal toxicity 
is low with an LD50 more than 4,000 mg/kg for rats and more than 5,000 mg/kg for rabbits (US 
EPA, 2003). For chronic data, USDA-APHIS provides a discussion on the 4-week dermal study, 
the two-generation reproduction study, and a prenatal developmental study in rats (and one in 
rabbits) on p. 49 in the BA, and also includes discussion on sub-lethal endpoints such as 
neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity thereafter, which are standard toxicity testing 
endpoints for mammalian studies. 
The acute oral LD50 of carbaryl to avian species ranges from 16 mg/kg to > 2,000 mg/kg for 
starlings (Sturnis vulgaris) and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoen

oxicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity thereafter, which are standard toxicity testing 
endpoints for mammalian studies. 
The acute oral LD50 of carbaryl to avian species ranges from 16 mg/kg to > 2,000 mg/kg for 
starlings (Sturnis vulgaris) and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) (Hudson, Tucker, 
& Haegele, 1984) and (Shafer, Bowles, & Hurlbut, 1983). Several toxicity studies evaluating 
sublethal effects have also been conducted. For a more in-depth discussion on these in the BA, 
see pages 52-53. Here we discuss the results from a standardized reproduction study in the 
Japanese quail (Coturnis japonica) and mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). A NOEC of > 3,000 
ppm was determined for C. japonica and a NOEC of 300 ppm was determined for mallard (A 
Platyrhynchos) based on a decrease in the number of eggs produced. 
There are no available studies for reptiles for carbaryl; thus, where reptile data is not available, 
the avian data is used as a surrogate to estimate sensitivity to reptiles. 
For amphibians, the acute oral LD50 for carbaryl exposure in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 
was > 4,000 mg/kg (Hudson, Tucker, & Haegele, 1984). Acute toxicity studies in other species 
have demonstrated lower LC50 values for the tadpole developmental stage and the BA provides 
more detail on these on pages 53-55. (Kirby & Sih, 2015) found carbaryl to be more lethal to the

have demonstrated lower LC50 values for the tadpole developmental stage and the BA provides 
more detail on these on pages 53-55. (Kirby & Sih, 2015) found carbaryl to be more lethal to the 
threatened Foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii) than to the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris 
regilla). The estimated 72-hour LC50 value for R. boylii was 585 µg/L ± 229 and for P. regilla 
 
Page | 114 
 
was 3,006 µg/L ± 955. In addition to mortality endpoints for this study, the authors also 
examined the effect of carbaryl on their competitive interactions with a non-native crayfish 
predator (Pacifastacus leniusculus). R. boylii was found to be more susceptible to pesticide 
exposure than P. regilla and exposure reduced their ability to compete with a 50% increase in 
mortality observed for R. boylii and no change to mortality observed (at 50 µg/L) for P. regilla. 
Several sublethal effect studies have also assessed a variety of endpoints related to direct and 
indirect effects on carbaryl to amphibians. The BA provides a discussion on these reductions in 
swimming behavior in more detail on page 55. 
Carbaryl is very highly toxic to many terrestrial insects. It is very highly toxic to honey bees (A. 
mellifera) with an acute contact LD50 of 0.0011 mg/bee (US EPA, 2003), A. erythronii females 
(0.543 µg/bee), and M

Carbaryl is very highly toxic to many terrestrial insects. It is very highly toxic to honey bees (A. 
mellifera) with an acute contact LD50 of 0.0011 mg/bee (US EPA, 2003), A. erythronii females 
(0.543 µg/bee), and M. rotundata females (0.592 µg/bee) as well as bumble bees (B. terrestris) 
where 24- and 72-hour oral LD50 values ranged from 3.92 to 3.84 µg/bee, respectively and B. 
terricola workers 41.16 µg/bee (Helson, Barber, & Kingsbury, 1994). It has also been measured 
in colonies at 111 µg/kg (Mullin, et al., 2010), so there is a potential for population level effects. 
Toxicity to terrestrial plants has been evaluated for agronomic crops based on registrant 
submitted studies for US EPA FIFRA regulation requirements. These studies showed no effects 
to cabbage, cucumber, onion, ryegrass, soybean, and tomato (US EPA, 2003) at 0.803 lb a.i./ 
acre based on an application rate of 0.5 lb a.i. / acre, which is higher than that projected for 
carbaryl used for the grasshopper and Mormon cricket program (0.37 lb a.i. / acre). Plant 
incident reports have also been reported but at doses well above those proposed for the APHIS 
program activities (USDA-APHIS BA p. 56).

Chlorantraniliprole 
[Section removed to save paper.]  
Diflubenzuron 
Diflubenzuron is classified as an insect growth regulator. The mode of action for this insecticide 
is inhibition of chitin synthesis (or interference with the formation of the insect’s exoskeleton 
that is comprised of a protein known as chitin). The likely mechanism is through blockage of 
chitin synthetase, the ultimate enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway to form chitin (Cohen, 1993), 
(US EPA, 1997). Diflubenzuron exposure can result in both larvicidal and ovicidal effects either 
from dermal or dietary exposure. Ovicidal effects can occur via direct contact of eggs or through 
exposure to a gravid (i.e., pregnant) female by ingestion or dermal routes. Inhibition of chitin 
synthesis can primarily affect immature insects but can also impact other arthropods and some 
fungi. 
Aquatic species 
Diflubenzuron toxicity in fish is considered low based on available data. The LC50 values range 
from 10 mg/L for smallmouth bass to 660 mg/L in bluegill sunfish (Julin & Sanders, 1978), 
(USDA Forest Service, 2004), (US EPA, 1997), (Willcox & Coffey, 1978). Chronic studies from 
30-days to 10 months indicate NOEC values range from 29 – 300 µg/L when tested on various 
species such as fathead minnow, steelhead trout, guppy (

 sunfish (Julin & Sanders, 1978), 
(USDA Forest Service, 2004), (US EPA, 1997), (Willcox & Coffey, 1978). Chronic studies from 
30-days to 10 months indicate NOEC values range from 29 – 300 µg/L when tested on various 
species such as fathead minnow, steelhead trout, guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and mummichog 
(Fundulus heteroclitus; (Hansen & Garton, 1982), (Julin & Sanders, 1978). 
Aquatic invertebrate sensitivity to diflubenzuron varies among different taxonomic groups. For 
crustaceans the median lethal concentration varies from 0.75 µg/L in D. magna (USDA Forest 
Service, 2004) to 2.95 µg/L in grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio, (Wilson & Costlow, 1986). 
For aquatic insects, values range from 0.5 µg/L in the mosquito (A. nigromaculatum; (Miura & 
Takahashi, 1974) to 57 mg/L in the perloid stonefly Skwala sp.; (Mayer & Ellersieck, 1986). For 
aquatic snails, the median lethal concentration in Physa sp. is > 125 mg/L (Willcox & Coffey, 
1978).

The NOEC and EC50 values for aquatic plants exposed to diflubenzuron are 190 µg/L for

algae, S. capricornutum, respectively. 
Terrestrial species 
Diflubenzuron is not very toxic to mammals via the oral route. The BA discusses the threshold 
values in more detail (see BA p. 41), but the lowest value was the oral LD50 in rats of >4,640 
mg/kg (Eisler, 2000). The BA also goes into more detail to discuss diflubenzuron effects on the 
hematopoietic system as well as neurotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity effects, all 
indicating diflubenzuron has no impact on these physiological systems in mammals (see BA p 
41-42). 
Several reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits provided in the BA 
also indicate diflubenzuron has effects on maternal blood pathologies at a LOAEL of 25 
mg/kg/day (US EPA, 2015) but does not affect other endpoints in these studies (e.g., decreased 
body weight in offspring, fetal abnormalities). 
For birds, acute toxicity data show that diflubenzuron is practically non-toxic to birds, with acute 
oral LD50 values ranging from 2,000 mg/kg to 5,000 mg/kg (Eisler, 2000), (Willcox & Coffey, 
1978), (US EPA, 1997) using a variety of species such as the red-winged blackbird, mallard 
duck, and bobwhite quail. 
Several reproductive studies are also available
Text Len: 1410
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

oral LD50 values ranging from 2,000 mg/kg to 5,000 mg/kg (Eisler, 2000), (Willcox & Coffey, 
1978), (US EPA, 1997) using a variety of species such as the red-winged blackbird, mallard 
duck, and bobwhite quail. 
Several reproductive studies are also available that evaluated chronic effects to a variety of avian 
species such as mallard duck, bobwhite quail, and chickens (US EPA, 1997), (Kubena, 1982), 
(USDA Forest Service, 2004), (Smalley, 1976), and (Cecil, Miller, & Corely, 1981). The lowest, 
most sensitive endpoint value used is the LOEC of 1,000 ppm value for effects on eggshell 
thickness and egg production in both mallard and bobwhite quail (US EPA, 1997). 
Little information is available for toxicity of diflubenzuron to reptiles but likely it is low, thus 
where reptile data is not available, the avian data is used as a surrogate to estimate sensitivity to 
reptiles. Diflubenzuron would be expected to be practically nontoxic to reptiles based on the 
available avian toxicity data. 
For amphibians one acute toxicity data indicates low sensitivity to diflubenzuron with a 48-hour 
LC50 of 100 mg/L in Rana brevipoda porosa tadpoles (Fryday & Thompson, 2012). Where data 
are scarce for amphibians, a surrogate approach is to use data for fish for diflubenzuron thus the 
chronic endpoint for amphibians from a 30-d NOEC value of > 45 µg/L for rainbow trout 
(Hansen & Garton, 1982) is used to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 tadpoles (Fryday & Thompson, 2012). Where data 
are scarce for amphibians, a surrogate approach is to use data for fish for diflubenzuron thus the 
chronic endpoint for amphibians from a 30-d NOEC value of > 45 µg/L for rainbow trout 
(Hansen & Garton, 1982) is used to assess chronic effects of diflubenzuron to amphibians. 
For terrestrial invertebrates, there are a large amount of data available for diflubenzuron, but 
toxicity can vary by taxonomic group depending on the Order of insect and the life stage being 
exposed. Available toxicity data for diflubenzuron exposed to adult honeybees indicates that it is 
practically non-toxic (Chandel & Gupta, 1992), (Mommaerts, Sterk, & Smagghe, 2006), (Nation, 
Robinson, Yu, & Bolten, 1986). However, diflubenzuron is moderately to highly toxic to 
developing bees based on residues reported in pollen but not on nectar or honey (Mullin, et al., 
2010). Again, this makes sense considering the mode of action of diflubenzuron. The BA 
discusses other studies confirming similar results (see BA p.44). Other insect Orders such as 
grasshoppers, beetles, and Lepidoptera at the immature stages are more susceptible than other 
terrestrial invertebrates, including the bee species discussed above (Eisler, 2000), (Murphy, 
Jepson, & Croft, 1994), (USDA Forest Service, 2004). Within this group, grasshoppers appear to

 other 
terrestrial invertebrates, including the bee species discussed above (Eisler, 2000), (Murphy, 
Jepson, & Croft, 1994), (USDA Forest Service, 2004). Within this group, grasshoppers appear to 
 
Page | 116 
 
be the most sensitive; however, the rates used in the above studies based on label 
recommendations for Dimilin 2L® are still more than 48-50% more than the rates used in the 
APHIS program (0.75-1.0 fluid oz/acre; see Table 3-6 in the BA). Diflubenzuron is also 
moderately toxic to spiders and mites, but there are no listed arachnids in the program action 
area. 
Diflubenzuron treated grasshoppers fed to darkling beetles showed significant mortality but at 
doses 2,000 times the rate of diflubenzuron applied in the grasshopper/cricket APHIS program 
(Smith & Lockwood, 2003). 
For terrestrial plants, toxicity is low due to low absorption and translocation of diflubenzuron 
residues on plant surfaces (Eisler, R., 1992). (Hatzios & Penner, 1978) determined exposure to 
diflubenzuron had no effect on photosynthesis, respiration, and leaf structure of soybeans at 
doses of up to 0.269 kg a.i./ha. 
 
Toxicity of metabolites of carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron

Toxicity of metabolites of carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron 
For carbaryl and chlorantraniliprole, toxicity data indicate the parent compounds are more toxic 
or have comparable toxicity to the metabolites discussed (see BA page 49 and Table 3-2 and 
page 59 and Table 3-7). Diflubenzuron has several metabolites that are discussed in detail in the 
BA (see pages 20 and 39). Environmental degradation of diflubenzuron can result in four 
primary metabolites, including CO2. The other three are 4-chlorophenyl urea, 2-6, 
diflurobenzoic acid, and 4-chloroaniline. 4-chloroaniline is slightly more toxic than 
diflubenzuron to fish and aquatic invertebrates (see p. 39 and Table 3-4). Both 2-6, 
diflurobenzoic acid and 4-chlorophenyl urea are considered less toxic or comparable in toxicity 
to diflubenzuron based on available data for fish and aquatic invertebrates (see p. 39 in the BA). 
4-chloroaniline has also been shown to be slightly carcinogenic in long-term mammalian studies 
(a NOEL for 4-chloroaniline was slightly higher than the NOEL for diflubenzuron) (USDA 
Forest Service, 2004).

Risk Assessment and Effects Determinations 
Aquatic Species 
The distribution of acute and sub-lethal chronic effects data for fish for carbaryl, 
chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron are compared to the estimated concentrations in aquatic 
systems under different applications for the APHIS Program. These values are below the range 
of response data provided. In addition, where data are not available for any program insecticide 
for aquatic phase amphibians, fish toxicity data is used as discussed above and below in the 
“Terrestrial Species” section of this document. The residues estimated using AgDrift also 
suggests that direct acute and sublethal risk of exposure to fish in small, static waterbodies is not 
expected. Estimated expected residues would range from 0.09 – 1.14 µg/L for carbaryl, 0.009 – 
0.4 µg/L for chlorantraniliprole, and 0.007 – 0.21 µg/L diflubenzuron, (see Figures 4-1, 4-2, and 
4-3 and Table 2-3 of the BA) when different buffer sizes are applied for the different application 
types. Field data collected from monitoring of program applications also support these findings 
(see discussions in BA p. 66 and 75 for carbaryl and diflubenzuron, respectively). The BA also 
discusses actual run-off related residues from program applications for carbaryl and 
diflubenzuron from different years and different states (2003 – 2022; see p. 27-30 in the BA).

diflubenzuron from different years and different states (2003 – 2022; see p. 27-30 in the BA).

These values also indicate the measured environmental concentrations in waterbodies within the 
standard 500-foot buffer or several miles downstream from the application site are still well 
below the effect data thresholds for aquatic organisms. 
For indirect effects, consumption of contaminated prey or loss or reduction in prey items is also 
not expected to adversely impact fish based on low residues and a low bioconcentration factor 
(BCF) value for carbaryl (15; values greater than 1,000 are considered to bioconcentrate whereas 
values lower than 20 are considered compounds with very little ability to bioconcentrate) (USDA 
Forest Service, 2008). Based on the distribution of available fish and aquatic invertebrate toxicity 
data for carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron, and the estimated residues discussed 
above, the adverse risks of exposure to prey items for listed fish species such as other fish or 
aquatic invertebrates are not expected based on the different application scenarios modeled in the 
BA. For aquatic plants, risk is discussed with respect to providing habitat and food for other 
aquatic species. For carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron, no adverse impacts to 
aquatic plants are anticipated, and residues in water are anticipated to be 400-1600 times below 
the NOEC value for carbaryl (see BA p. 65), four orders of magnitude below the lowest effect 
concentration (see BA p. 82) for chlorantraniliprole, and 2,000

 diflubenzuron, no adverse impacts to 
aquatic plants are anticipated, and residues in water are anticipated to be 400-1600 times below 
the NOEC value for carbaryl (see BA p. 65), four orders of magnitude below the lowest effect 
concentration (see BA p. 82) for chlorantraniliprole, and 2,000 times below the NOEC 
concentrations for diflubenzuron (see BA p. 74).Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to 
adversely affect listed aquatic species because the proposed conservation measures are expected to 
lower the estimated environmental concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an 
insignificant effect on aquatic species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, 
detected, or evaluated. 
Terrestrial Species 
For the terrestrial vertebrate risk characterization, insecticide exposure was considered based on the 
most significant route: ingestion through the diet. Exposure can also occur through dermal contact, 
ingestion from preening, and water consumption, but the extent of exposure through these means is 
expected to be minor in comparison to that of ingestion of pesticides through diet. Exposure levels 
on different types of vegetation or other terrestrial non-target invertebrates as dietary items were 
calculated using the Terrestrial Residue Exposure Model (T-REX) (US EPA, 2012). To assess the 
acute and chronic risk to mammals, the most sensitive acute and chronic endpoints were used and 
compared to the T-REX estimated residues on dietary items with consideration for the size of the 
bird or mammal. Indirect risk to mammals was evaluated by reviewing impacts on habitat or prey 
base. For carbaryl, direct effects to mammals of all class sizes that feed on grasses, RQ values 
exceeded 1 (

 chronic endpoints were used and 
compared to the T-REX estimated residues on dietary items with consideration for the size of the 
bird or mammal. Indirect risk to mammals was evaluated by reviewing impacts on habitat or prey 
base. For carbaryl, direct effects to mammals of all class sizes that feed on grasses, RQ values 
exceeded 1 (i.e., likely to cause adverse effects). For chlorantraniliprole, RQs were below 1 (i.e., not 
likely to cause adverse effects) for all mammalian class sizes and for diflubenzuron, there is a slight 
risk to small mammals consuming short grass (see Table 4-8 in the BA). For indirect effects for all 
three pesticides, there is some concern for those mammals that rely on terrestrial invertebrate as prey 
items than for those consuming terrestrial or aquatic plants or other small mammals (see p. 69, 83, 
and 77 in the BA). However, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed mammals 
because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on mammals, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
To assess the acute and chronic risk to birds the most sensitive acute and chronic endpoints were 
used and compared to residue values on respective dietary items (based on the size of the bird), 
estimated using T-REX calculations discussed on pages 69, 78, and 84 to generate RQ values. 
RQs greater than 1 were reduced by implementing the proposed buffers to address impacts from 
program insecticides. For carbaryl, which shows a slight acute risk to birds that consume

contaminated prey (see Table 4-5 p. 70 in the BA), additional buffers for carbaryl applications 
were applied for known locations of adults (see Appendix A–9). 
Indirect risk to birds was evaluated by reviewing impacts on habitat or prey base. For carbaryl, 
direct effects to birds in the 20 and 100 g class sizes that feed on grasses, had RQ values 
exceeding 1 as mentioned above (see Table 4-5). For chlorantraniliprole and diflubenzuron, RQs 
were below 1 for all avian class sizes (see p. 69, 84, and 78 in the BA). For indirect effects for all 
three pesticides, RQ values discussed for small mammals which could be prey items for larger 
birds, are discussed above. For small birds as prey items for other avian species, RQ values are 
discussed above as well. For bird species that feed on insects, RQ values were >1 for 20 g and 
100 g birds for carbaryl, but were well below 1 for chlorantraniliprole and diflubenzuron (see p. 
69,70, 76, and 84). Indirect effects to bird species based on impacts to dietary items (insects) for 
insectivorous birds from exposure to diflubenzuron is also discussed. However, the rates used in 
the APHIS Program are such that they would not reach levels or concentrations that would

see p. 
69,70, 76, and 84). Indirect effects to bird species based on impacts to dietary items (insects) for 
insectivorous birds from exposure to diflubenzuron is also discussed. However, the rates used in 
the APHIS Program are such that they would not reach levels or concentrations that would 
significantly reduce the availability of prey items for these avian species. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed birds because the proposed 
conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of these 
pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on birds, such that the effects cannot 
be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. There are no data for all three pesticides used 
in the APHIS program to assess risks of exposure to reptiles. Although there is uncertainty in 
making the assumption that the range of sensitivities for birds is representative for reptiles, we 
make this assumption in the absence of data. Based on the risk characterization and conclusions 
described above for birds, for both direct and indirect effects, we expect that all three pesticides 
will have insignificant effects on listed reptile species. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed reptiles because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on reptiles, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
For amphibians, direct risk of exposure was determined by using the highest aquatic 
concentration in water and comparing that to the acute and chronic values for each pesticide used 
in the APHIS program. For carbaryl, the highest value in water used was the value discussed 
above for bait considerations and compared to the toxicity threshold values discussed below for

, or evaluated. 
For amphibians, direct risk of exposure was determined by using the highest aquatic 
concentration in water and comparing that to the acute and chronic values for each pesticide used 
in the APHIS program. For carbaryl, the highest value in water used was the value discussed 
above for bait considerations and compared to the toxicity threshold values discussed below for 
the carbaryl bait application exposures. For chlorantraniliprole, there are no data for amphibians. 
Instead, we rely on the fish toxicity data. This assumption is similar to using the toxicity data for 
birds to represent effects for reptiles. While this approach has uncertainty associated with 
whether the data capture the range of sensitivities to amphibians from chlorantraniliprole, we 
make this assumption based on the risk characterization described above for fish exposed to 
chlorantraniliprole. Chlorantraniliprole toxicity in fish is considered low based on available 
toxicity data reporting mortality above the solubility limit (1 mg/L). Two early life-stage tests in 
the rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) and sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) 
showed chlorantraniliprole may have effects at 0.11 and 1.28 mg/L, respectively. 
For diflubenzuron, using the fish data, the 30-d NOEC value of > 45 µg/L for rainbow trout 
(Hansen & Garton, 1982) is compared to the highest residue calculated (0.04 µg/L; described in 
Section II in the BA). Indirect effects to amphibians can include loss of habitat and dietary items.

chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron at all program rates poses minimal risk to aquatic and 
terrestrial plants. This is discussed more in the BA on pages 65, 73, 74, 81, 82, and 85 for the 
program chemicals. For amphibians that feed on aquatic invertebrates or other aquatic 
vertebrates, risk of exposure from all three program insecticides is discussed above in the 
“Aquatic Species” section of this Risk Characterization. We anticipate that the effects to these 
species will be insignificant because pesticide residues for aquatic plants, aquatic invertebrates, 
or fish do not exceed any toxicity endpoint for these taxonomic groups. For the potential indirect 
terrestrial route of exposure to amphibians, terrestrial invertebrates could serve as a food source 
for amphibians (see below discussion). However, the selectivity of diflubenzuron to developing 
insects would not cause significant decreases in food availability for amphibians, nor does it 
bioconcentrate if an amphibian were to consume a contaminated insect. Similarly, for carbaryl or 
chlorantraniliprole, these insecticides do not bioconcentrate. Carbaryl is very highly toxic to 
insects at label rates (see discussion in BA), and chlorantraniliprole is most toxic to those 
developing insects such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae via ingestion and not as toxic

 Similarly, for carbaryl or 
chlorantraniliprole, these insecticides do not bioconcentrate. Carbaryl is very highly toxic to 
insects at label rates (see discussion in BA), and chlorantraniliprole is most toxic to those 
developing insects such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae via ingestion and not as toxic via 
contact exposure (see BA p. 63). Thus, the reduced program application rates would not 
eliminate the insect prey base entirely and would not reduce the availability of prey items to 
amphibians in other insect Orders from exposure to carbaryl or chlorantraniliprole. In addition, 
chlorantraniliprole is not toxic to soil dwelling invertebrates such as isopods, or earthworms (see 
BA p. 63), which could also be considered for terrestrial based dietary items for amphibians. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed amphibians because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on amphibians, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
For terrestrial invertebrates, risk of exposure from all three program insecticides differs among 
various insect Orders. This is discussed in more detail on pages 72, 73, 79, and 85 in the BA. A 
variety of field studies under a variety of application setting, including monitoring from the 
APHIS program applications have been conducted and demonstrate minimal residues of 
diflubenzuron. Minimal to no impacts to non-target arthropods such as honey bees, moths, and 
other insect Orders such as Coleoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera, Heteroptera, Homoptera,

 of application setting, including monitoring from the 
APHIS program applications have been conducted and demonstrate minimal residues of 
diflubenzuron. Minimal to no impacts to non-target arthropods such as honey bees, moths, and 
other insect Orders such as Coleoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera, Heteroptera, Homoptera, 
Neuroptera, and Plecoptera were demonstrated from diflubenzuron exposure (Emmett & Archer, 
1980), (Atkins, Anderson, Kellum, & Heuman, 1976), (Johansen, Mayer, Eves, & Kious, 1983), 
(Schroeder, Sutton, & Beavers, 1980), (Robinson A. F., 1979) (Deakle & Bradley, 1982), 
(Sample, Cooper, & Whitmore, 1993), (Catangui, Fuller, & Walz, 1993), (Weiland, Judge, Pels, 
& Grosscourt, 2002), (Tingle, 1996) (Graham, Brasher, & Close, 2008). In addition, the 
extensive buffers determined via AgDrift modeling and confirmed with field assessments 
indicates the proposed buffers from 250 ft for ground applications and up to 1 mile for some 
aerial applications (buffers of 1,320 ft reduce drift by approximately 89-98%; see BA p. 73) 
address the impacts to listed terrestrial invertebrates within the program action area. In addition, 
the program applications rates (0.75 fl. oz/ acre and 1.0 fl. oz/acre for ground and aerial 
applications, respectively) are well reduced from label rates recommended for Orthoptera, 
Coleoptera, Homoptera, and Lepidoptera (see Table 3-6 in the BA) and combined with the

aforementioned extensive buffers indicates very minimal risk of adverse effects to listed

on terrestrial invertebrate species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured,

Risk of adverse effects to terrestrial plants from all three APHIS program insecticides is 
considered minimal. Based on the available toxicity data discussed above for carbaryl, 
chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron, phytotoxic effects are not anticipated from program 
insecticide applications. However, potential indirect effects of carbaryl on pollinators is 
considered. As discussed above in the Effects of the Action section for carbaryl and terrestrial 
invertebrates, laboratory studies have indicated several species of honeybees and bumblebees are 
sensitive to carbaryl, but these are at rates above those used in the program, and effects have not 
been measured extensively in field studies. One study based on a carbaryl application rate of 
0.80 lb a.i./acre in a fruit orchard indicated no effects on honeybee mortality or behavior 7 days 
post application. Any potential impacts to honey bees or

sensitive to carbaryl, but these are at rates above those used in the program, and effects have not 
been measured extensively in field studies. One study based on a carbaryl application rate of 
0.80 lb a.i./acre in a fruit orchard indicated no effects on honeybee mortality or behavior 7 days 
post application. Any potential impacts to honey bees or bumble bees may also be mitigated by 
the reduced application rates for the program, the RAATs (alternating swaths where the 
insecticide is applied), as well as use of carbaryl bait as opposed to ground or aerial spray 
applications (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1994), (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1995). 
Indirect risk to terrestrial plants from impacts to pollinators from chlorantraniliprole is not 
expected to be significant. Grasshopper nymphs appear to be the most impacted compared to 
other insect groups. Various laboratory and field data indicate low toxicity to other insect groups 
such as honeybees and bumblebees (i.e., those groups more likely to be pollinators to terrestrial 
plants), where no mortality or sublethal effects were observed (see Effects of the Action section 
for terrestrial invertebrates discussed above), and application rates 4 to 10 times higher than 
program rates are shown to have better efficacy in controlling Lepidoptera and other insect pests. 
Indirect risk to terrestrial plants is also not expected from impacts to pollinators from 
diflubenzuron. As discussed above in the Effects of the Action section for terrestrial 
invertebrates, a variety of field studies under a variety of application settings, including 
monitoring from the APHIS program applications, have been conducted and demonstrate

 to terrestrial plants is also not expected from impacts to pollinators from 
diflubenzuron. As discussed above in the Effects of the Action section for terrestrial 
invertebrates, a variety of field studies under a variety of application settings, including 
monitoring from the APHIS program applications, have been conducted and demonstrate 
minimal residues of diflubenzuron have minimal to no impacts to non-target arthropods such as 
honeybees, moths, and other insect Orders. Negative effects have been observed in honeybees in 
some studies, but this was observed at application levels and periods of time that exceed those 
expected to be used in the program. (Robinson & Johansen, 1978) found that diflubenzuron 
application rates as high as 0.125 to .25 lbs. a.i./acre (10 and 20 times the program rate for 
diflubenzuron) resulted in no effect on adult mortality and brood production in honeybees. As 
discussed above, the use of RAATS provide additional protection by limiting the area of 
treatment within the spray block to further reduce the potential risk of exposure to pollinators. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed terrestrial plant species 
because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on terrestrial 
plant species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
 
Bait Applications of Carbaryl

through ingestion, affect fewer non target organisms, and generate very little drift (Foster, 1996), 
(Latchininsky & Van Dyke, 2006), (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1994) 
For bait applications of carbaryl, direct risk of exposure to mammals was calculated using the 
LD50’s per square foot method described in the BA (Section IV A. Insecticide Risk Assessment 
Methodology). When the LD50 per square foot is greater than 1, there is an assumed risk as a 
conservative estimate that the mammal (or bird as the same approach is used for birds) will 
consume the entire bait. RQs were above 1 for all mammals except the 1,000 g group, when no 
application buffer is applied. With an adjusted buffer of 500 feet, the RQs are below 1.0 for all 
mammalian size classes (see Table 4-3 and p. 68 in the BA), and all estimated residues from bait 
applications are anticipated to be below the acute NOEL value (10mg/kg). 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed mammals because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on mammals, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated

 to be below the acute NOEL value (10mg/kg). 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed mammals because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on mammals, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
For carbaryl bait applications, direct risk of exposure to birds was also assessed. The lowest 
acute avian LD50 value of 16 mg/kg (European starling; see Carbaryl toxicity section discussed 
above) was used. RQ values were greater than 1 for all size classes without an application buffer; 
however, drift reductions are observed when a 500-ft buffer is applied, and RQ values fall below 
1 (see Table 4-6 in the BA). As previously discussed, we assume similar impacts from carbaryl 
bait applications to reptiles as to that of birds. Indirect effects from carbaryl bait to both 
mammals and birds are also not expected. We do not expect indirect effects to plants used as 
habitat or dietary items for birds and mammals; we also do not expect indirect effects to small 
mammals, small birds, or terrestrial invertebrates exposed to carbaryl bait used as dietary items 
for birds and mammals. This discussion is covered in more detail in the BA p 68-73. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed birds because the proposed 
conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of 
carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on birds, such that the effects 
cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated.

 affect listed birds because the proposed 
conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of 
carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on birds, such that the effects 
cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
Direct risk of exposure to amphibians from carbaryl bait applications was assessed by taking the 
highest estimated concentration of carbaryl in an aquatic system (1.10 µg/L) and comparing that 
to the acute and chronic values for amphibians. Impacts of carbaryl bait applications on 
amphibians are minimal based on the LC50 values reported for tadpoles (1.73–22.02 mg/L) at 
approximately 1,572 to 20,018 times below the highest calculated carbaryl residue, suggesting 
minimal acute risk of bait applications (and ULV applications based on the same toxicity 
endpoint used for both application methods). Sublethal effects to amphibians are also not 
anticipated based on chronic studies with a NOEC for swimming behavior of 1.25 mg/L and a 
tadpole NOEC for mean age at metamorphosis (0.16 mg/L). 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed amphibians because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on amphibians, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
Direct risk of exposure to terrestrial invertebrates from carbaryl bait applications is considered 
but is less likely to impact most Orders of terrestrial insects. Studies with carbaryl bran bait have

Alston, & Tepedino, 1994), (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1995) and see also p. 73 in the BA). 
Carbaryl bait also poses a low risk to most insect Orders as it is preferentially consumed by 
grasshoppers. There also is less exposure to Hymenoptera or Lepidoptera because the active 
ingredient is contained in the bait and not available for dietary or contact exposure (it is not 
sprayed) and would not be found on floral resources that would be visited by Lepidoptera or 
Hymenoptera during normal activities. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed terrestrial invertebrate 
species because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated 
environmental concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on 
terrestrial invertebrate species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, 
or evaluated. 
 
Critical Habitat 
For critical habitat, APHIS reviewed the primary constituent elements (PCEs) or physical and 
biological features (PBFs) to determine if the program activities would cause destruction or 
adverse modification of these features. For many species, designated critical habitat PCEs or 
PBFs are aspects of the physical landscape such as geomorphological features, soil types, 
hydrologic regimes, as well as the necessary vegetative features. None of

 physical and 
biological features (PBFs) to determine if the program activities would cause destruction or 
adverse modification of these features. For many species, designated critical habitat PCEs or 
PBFs are aspects of the physical landscape such as geomorphological features, soil types, 
hydrologic regimes, as well as the necessary vegetative features. None of the program 
insecticides are expected to impact geomorphological formations or hydrologic regimes. Other 
PCEs or PBFs for certain species involve an adequate source of invertebrate prey items (many 
listed bird species and fish), specified water quality parameters for certain aquatic species to 
support a healthy system (pH, adequate dissolved oxygen, low salinity, lack of pollutants, low 
turbidity, low ammonia, etc.), and the absence of predators or invasives. 
As discussed earlier, there is minimal risk to designated critical habitat PCEs or PBFs involving 
any vegetative structures for habitat or other plants these species may rely on for feeding, 
breeding, or sheltering, because the program’s proposed use of the insecticides is not expected to 
result in phytotoxic effects. 
There is some risk that the program activities could affect designated critical habitats with PCEs 
or PBFs described as an adequate prey base of terrestrial invertebrates or aquatic invertebrates. 
However, the standard program mitigation involving 500 ft buffers for aerial applications, 200 ft 
buffers for ground applications, and 50 ft for bait applications to all water bodies will minimize 
the impacts to aquatic invertebrate prey items from drift. Table 5-2 in the BA provides a list of 
all proposed buffers to protect fish and designated critical habitats. Program designated buffers 
and reduced application rates along with RAAT applications will also minimize impacts to the

buffers for ground applications, and 50 ft for bait applications to all water bodies will minimize 
the impacts to aquatic invertebrate prey items from drift. Table 5-2 in the BA provides a list of

success and brood survival are directly linked to adequate invertebrate prey available to 
developing lesser prairie chicken chicks, and ultimately lesser prairie chicken success, adequate 
buffers protecting lesser prairie chicken are warranted. Adults rely on a variety of food items 
throughout the year but predominantly vegetation during the fall, winter, and early spring (US 
FWS, 2012). Additional buffer distances to protect leks and allow for adequate prey items for 
adults and developing chicks were applied for carbaryl, as it demonstrated some toxicity to 
terrestrial invertebrates as discussed above (see also p. 52-53 and 93 in the BA). Similar 
mitigations are also applied for other prairie birds, such as the Gunnison and greater sage grouse.

Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect designated critical habitat PCEs or 
PBFs because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated 
environmental concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect 
on designated critical habitat PCEs or PBFs, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully 
measured, detected, or evaluated.

Summary and Conclusion 
APHIS evaluated their grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression program application of 
three insecticides, carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron to listed species and their 
designated critical habitat as applicable. They provide an overview of the exposure and response 
analyses for terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate groups, as well as plants, and 
considered all the relevant pathways of exposure for each. As such they established several 
avoidance and minimization measures to ensure that the use of these insecticides for their 
program activities is not likely to adversely impact listed species and their designated critical 
habitat as applicable. APHIS ensures that buffers established based on modeled estimates and 
program application data will be applied during all program activities. In addition to substantial 
buffers used within species’ ranges and designated critical habitats, reduced program application 
rates and RAAT treatment methods will minimize direct and indirect risk of adverse effects from 
exposure of pesticides to listed mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, terrestrial insects, 
aquatic invertebrates, and plants. Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect 
listed species and designated critical habitat because the proposed conservation measures are 
expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of these pesticides to levels that 
would have an insignificant effect on these species and their designated critical habitats. 
 
Aquatic Species 
For all listed aquatic species within the program action area, the following buffers are applied for 
each pesticide (Table 1, adapted from Table 5-2 see also Appendix A-9 in the BA or Enclosure 
B):

would have an insignificant effect on these species and their designated critical habitats.

For all listed aquatic species within the program action area, the following buffers are applied for 
each pesticide (Table 1, adapted from Table 5-2 see also Appendix A-9 in the BA or Enclosure

The estimated residues from the application methods and application concentrations in Table 1 
are the expected range of concentrations where adverse effects to fish or amphibians are 
expected to occur. These buffers are applied as such because they are protective of all aquatic 
species as well as their designated critical habitats, as applicable, and any indirect effects to 
listed fish species’ prey items such as aquatic invertebrates, or terrestrial invertebrates (which are 
more sensitive; see Figures 2-2, 2-3, and Table 2-3 in the BA for how these buffer distances were 
determined) are also minimized. 
 
Terrestrial Species

Terrestrial Species 
For all listed terrestrial species within the program action area, the following buffers are applied 
for each pesticide (Table 2, see also Appendix A-9 in the BA or Enclosure B). We provide a 
range of buffers to demonstrate the differences that exist among the taxonomic groups described 
in the BA in terms of direct sensitivities to the insecticides as well as the indirect effects to 
dietary items upon which a species may rely and that may be integral to their survival and overall 
population level success (see p. 88-89 and p. 93 in the BA).

Bait Applications for Carbaryl 
Run-off or drift from bait applications to water bodies is expected to be minimal as the active 
ingredient is contained within the bait/bran or grain mix and not susceptible to off-site transport 
via rain events or volatilization. Labels for carbaryl also do not allow the product to enter water 
bodies, and thus, to preclude the possibility of the bait moving into aquatic systems, there are

 expected to be minimal as the active 
ingredient is contained within the bait/bran or grain mix and not susceptible to off-site transport 
via rain events or volatilization. Labels for carbaryl also do not allow the product to enter water 
bodies, and thus, to preclude the possibility of the bait moving into aquatic systems, there are 
standard buffers for water bodies used for all program activities, regardless of the presence of 
listed species or critical habitat. An example of such a scenario is described on p. 28 in the BA, 
where carbaryl was detected downstream from where bait applications were made when an area 
 
Page | 125 
 
 
that was treated was irrigated. Residues were measured upstream and downstream of the 
discharge. Residue values upstream were 1.2 μg/L while residue values at 5.5 and 8.0 miles 
below the discharge were 2.0 and 1.6 μg/L, respectively. However, there is uncertainty regarding 
whether these values represent any contribution from APHIS applications. 
 
APHIS also implements additional buffers for water bodies that are not designated as critical 
habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot buffer for aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground 
sprays, and a 50-foot buffer for bait applications. Thus, the buffers for bait applications of 
carbaryl for aquatic species are uniformly applied for all species (see Appendix A-9 in the BA, 
Enclosure B, and Table 1 above) and are sufficiently protective to avoid the likelihood of any 
adverse effects. 
Buffers for bait application of carbaryl vary by terrestrial species taxonomic group and habitat 
(see Appendix A-9 in the BA, Enclosure B, and Table 2 above). These buffers are generally less

Enclosure B, and Table 1 above) and are sufficiently protective to avoid the likelihood of any 
adverse effects. 
Buffers for bait application of carbaryl vary by terrestrial species taxonomic group and habitat 
(see Appendix A-9 in the BA, Enclosure B, and Table 2 above). These buffers are generally less 
distance than for aerial or other ground application methods, except for what is applied for 
prairie birds or riparian mammals (see discussion below and on p. 93 in the BA, Appendix A-9 
in the BA, or Enclosure B), as this application method results in less drift and therefore 
subsequently less exposure (see p. 6-7 in the BA). In addition, the nature of the bait is also such 
that because it is a solid and absorbed by the bran or other carrier (see p. 6 in the BA for bait 
preparation methods), it is less bioavailable, especially for potential dermal contact exposure for 
all terrestrial species. Drift reductions expected for all size classes of mammals and birds from 
the application of a 500-ft buffer are estimated at greater than 99% (see Tables 4-3 and 4-6 in the 
BA). For terrestrial invertebrates, program buffers for bait applications are similar to that of 
mammals and birds. Any indirect effects to listed species’ prey items are discussed above for the 
different taxonomic groups, and effects to designated critical habitat for listed species from 
carbaryl bait applications is also expected to be insignificant. 
As a result of the APHIS program conservation measures such as use of the buffer distances 
discussed above for all taxonomic groups and their designated critical habitats, as applicable,

 critical habitat for listed species from 
carbaryl bait applications is also expected to be insignificant. 
As a result of the APHIS program conservation measures such as use of the buffer distances 
discussed above for all taxonomic groups and their designated critical habitats, as applicable, 
along with the reduced application rates as compared to label rates for each insecticide, and 
RAAT treatment procedures, any risk of exposure associated with the application of the three 
insecticides used under the APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression program is 
expected to be minimal. Thus, any direct or indirect effects from the proposed action to listed 
species and their designated critical habitats are expected to be insignificant due to program 
conservation measures. 
This concludes consultation. As stated in 50 CFR § 402.16, reinitiation of consultation is 
required and shall be requested by APHIS or the Service, where discretionary Federal 
involvement or control over the action has been retained or is authorized by law and: (1) If new 
information reveals effects of the action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a 
manner to an extent not previously considered; (2) If the identified action is subsequently 
modified in a manner that causes an effect to the listed species or critical habitat that was not 
considered in this concurrence letter; or (3) If a new species is listed or critical habitat designated 
that may be affected by the identified action.

Subject: Concurrence on the effects to listed species and critical habitat from Oregon 
Grasshopper Mitigation by USDA APHIS PPQ 
 
Dear Mr. Park: 
 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has reviewed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine 
(PPQ) program’s request for concurrence that the Grasshopper Mitigation Program (Program) 
may affect but is not likely to adversely affect species or habitats listed under the

) has reviewed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine 
(PPQ) program’s request for concurrence that the Grasshopper Mitigation Program (Program) 
may affect but is not likely to adversely affect species or habitats listed under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; Act). Your March 7, 2022 request for 
informal consultation and accompanying biological assessment (Assessment; APHIS 2022) was 
received by the Service on the same day. The species and their critical habitats subject to 
informal consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Act are presented in Table 1 below. 
APHIS also determined that implementation of the Program will have no effect on the following 
species: Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), Gray wolf (Canis lupus), Northern spotted owl (Strix 
occidentalis caurin), Gentner's fritillary (Fritillaria gentneri), MacFarlane’s four-o’clock 
(Mirabilis macfarlanii), Malheur wire-lettuce (Stephanomeria malheurensis), Whitebark pine 
(Pinus albicaulis), Slender Orcutt grass (Orcuttia tenuis), and Green’s Tuctoria (Tuctoria 
greenei). The regulations implementing section 7 of the Act do not require the Service to review 
or concur with no effect determinations. However, the Service acknowledges that the basis for 
these no effect determinations is clear and reasonable. 
APHIS also included protective measures for formerly designated candidate species (greater

s Tuctoria (Tuctoria 
greenei). The regulations implementing section 7 of the Act do not require the Service to review 
or concur with no effect determinations. However, the Service acknowledges that the basis for 
these no effect determinations is clear and reasonable. 
APHIS also included protective measures for formerly designated candidate species (greater 
sage-grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus and the Columbia spotted frog, Rana luteiventris); and 
recently delisted species (Borax Lake chub, Gila boraxobius and Foskett speckled dace, 
Rhinichthys osculus). Legally, APHIS does not have to implement conservation 
recommendations for candidate and non-listed species; however, addressing these species at this 
stage of consultation may minimize or avoid adverse effects to the species and may avert 
potential future conflicts.

In November 2019, APHIS published an updated Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
document, from the original 2002 EIS, concerning suppression of grasshopper (Camnula 
pellucida) and Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) populations in 17 western states, and 
incorporated the available data and analysis of the environmental risk of new program tools. The 
EIS described the actions available to APHIS to reduce the damage caused by grasshopper 
populations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho

pper (Camnula 
pellucida) and Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) populations in 17 western states, and 
incorporated the available data and analysis of the environmental risk of new program tools. The 
EIS described the actions available to APHIS to reduce the damage caused by grasshopper 
populations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and 
Wyoming. APHIS includes discussion of information cited in the 2019 EIS and refers to it as 
“incorporated by reference” in the Assessment. The Service would like to clarify that the 
Service is not concurring on the 2019 EIS proposed action. The reference to the 2019 EIS is for 
informational purposes only and not as a request for consultation on that proposed action. 
The proposed action which is being consulted on, is the “Site-Specific Environmental 
Assessment Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program - Oregon” (OR- 
22-01) prepared by APHIS (EA) which describes site specific issues related to potential 
grasshopper suppression programs. The described action is located in Baker, Crook, Deschutes, 
Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Jefferson, Klamath, Lake, Malheur, Morrow, Sherman, Umatilla, Union, 
Wallowa, Wasco, and Wheeler counties of Oregon. Cropland of any kind (including lands

enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program) is not eligible for treatment under this 
Assessment. Implementation of the Program will only be conducted when potential 
economically damaging populations of grasshoppers occur, funding exists, there is a written 
request from the land manager(s), and APHIS determines that treatment is necessary. 
After several coordination meetings between APHIS and the Service prior to the informal 
consultation conducted in 2003, APHIS developed a proposed action with protective buffers 
designed to prevent application of pesticides within a prescribed distance of federally-listed 
species to prevent effects from spray application. In order to implement the avoidance buffers, 
APHIS will need to survey for certain species whose distributions are unknown or poorly 
understood. Such surveys are not likely needed for fish species or frogs for whose distributions 
are limited to specific habitats such as waterways, or plants that are sessile and whose 
distributions are well known. Since yellow-billed cuckoo distribution is not well understood or 
unknown in the project area, APHIS will confer with the Service to consult recent survey records 
or conduct surveys of high potential for nesting and foraging habitat prior to implementing the 
suppression program. 
 
PROPOSED ACTION 
 
The proposed action is a statewide program for grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression 
activities described in the site-specific EA (OR-22-01) tiered to the 2002 EIS. APHIS treatment 
programs also follow the Treatment Guidelines (included in the EA) and the Grasshopper 
Program Statement of Work (or Prospectus) developed by APHIS. Suppression treatments are

 grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression 
activities described in the site-specific EA (OR-22-01) tiered to the 2002 EIS. APHIS treatment 
programs also follow the Treatment Guidelines (included in the EA) and the Grasshopper 
Program Statement of Work (or Prospectus) developed by APHIS. Suppression treatments are 
typically implemented from May through early June. Treatments later in the growing season are 
strongly discouraged due to lack of effect for the available pesticides in the Program, as well as a 
greatly reduced likelihood of preventing damage in the current year. However, treatments may 
still be advisable with sites or grasshopper populations exhibiting unusual phenology and will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis through July and into August. 
 
The chemical control methods used by APHIS include the use of liquid sprays of diflubenzuron 
and a bait formulation of carbaryl, applied at conventional rates and as reduced agent area 
treatments (RAATs). The preferred chemical control methods for treatment of grasshoppers in 
Oregon by APHIS PPQ include the use of liquid spray diflubenzuron and carbaryl in a bait 
formulation applied as RAATs. 
 
Under this Program, APHIS would make a single application per year to a treatment area and 
could apply insecticide at rate conventionally used for grasshopper suppression treatments, or 
more typically as RAATs. APHIS will select which insecticides and rates are most appropriate 
for suppression of a grasshopper outbreak based on several biological, logistical, environmental, 
and economical criteria. The identification of grasshopper species and their life stage largely 
determines the choice of insecticides used among those available to the program. RAAT

 or 
more typically as RAATs. APHIS will select which insecticides and rates are most appropriate 
for suppression of a grasshopper outbreak based on several biological, logistical, environmental, 
and economical criteria. The identification of grasshopper species and their life stage largely 
determines the choice of insecticides used among those available to the program. RAATs are the 
most common application method for all program insecticides, and only rarely do rangeland pest 
conditions warrant full coverage and higher rates. Under this Program, carbaryl or diflubenzuron 
would cover all treatable sites within the designated treatment block per label directions, 
typically at the following application rates: 
• 10.0 pounds (0.20 lb a.i.) of 2 percent carbaryl bait per acre; 
• 0.75 or 1.0 fluid ounce (0.012 lb a.i.) of diflubenzuron per acre.

Insecticide applications at conventional rates and complete area coverage, is an approach that 
APHIS has used in the past but is currently uncommon. Under this Program, carbaryl bait or 
diflubenzuron would cover all treatable sites within the designated treatment block per label 
directions. The application rates under this Program are typically at the following application 
rates: 
• 10.0 pounds (0.50 lbs. a.i.) of 5 percent carbaryl bait per acre; 
• 2.0 fluid ounce (0.032 lbs. a.i.) of diflubenzuron per acre. 
 
Starting in 2017, APHIS removed the use of malathion from the proposed action based on review 
of recent information and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) January 2016

 of 5 percent carbaryl bait per acre; 
• 2.0 fluid ounce (0.032 lbs. a.i.) of diflubenzuron per acre. 
 
Starting in 2017, APHIS removed the use of malathion from the proposed action based on review 
of recent information and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) January 2016 
Assessment regarding the environmental effects of malathion (Lentz 2017, in litt). Additionally, 
APHIS is suspending their investigation of the use of chlorantraniliprole, which was included on 
a provisional basis in the 2020 Assessment (Park 2021, in litt). Thus, chlorantraniliprole will not 
be considered for use in the program in 2022 and is not included in this consultation. Service 
concurrence is limited to the use of liquid diflubenzuron and carbaryl bait as described in the 
proposed action in APHIS’ 2022 Assessment. 
The proposed action maintains a standard, programmatic 500 foot buffer from water for all aerial 
ultra low volume (ULV) treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all aerial bait treatments, a 
200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground treatments, and a 50 foot buffer from water for 
all ground bait treatments. These standard buffers are in place to reduce the chance that a 
pesticide used for grasshopper suppression will enter water. In order to protect listed plant 
species, APHIS will implement the following measures from the edge of known listed plant 
species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used for from known locations of 
listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 feet from the edge of 
known locations of listed plant species.

species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used for from known locations of 
listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 feet from the edge of 
known locations of listed plant species. 
 
EFFECTS TO FEDERALLY LISTED WILDLIFE AND THEIR CRITICAL HABITAT 
 
The buffers are mandatory as part of the proposed action and are designed to avoid 
contamination of federally-listed species habitats. APHIS’s assessment concludes the buffers 
reduce or eliminate the potential for direct exposure to the federally-listed species and reduces 
the chance of indirect effects being substantial enough to adversely affect the federally-listed 
species. The buffers were not derived by specific impact and distance data, but are based on 
field tests demonstrating the absence of detectable levels of chemical. APHIS’s determination is 
the Project’s protective measures reduce the potential effects of the action to the point that the 
effects are insignificant or the probability of adverse effect is discountable and therefore the 
project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the federally-listed species listed in Table 
1. 
CONCURRENCE 
The Service reviewed the Project described in the Assessment in accordance with section 7(a)(2) 
of the Act. Based on the Service’s review of the Assessment and other information, we concur 
with APHIS’s determination that the Program actions proposed for 2022, in 17 counties of 
Oregon (described previously) may affect, but are not likely to adversely affect the 11 
endangered and threatened species listed in Table 1, nor their designated critical habitats, where 
applicable.

endangered and threatened species listed in Table 1, nor their designated critical habitats, where 
applicable.

Our concurrence with your “not likely to adversely affect” determination for threatened and 
endangered species is based on the conservation measures that will be incorporated into the 
action. Risk of adverse effects to the federally-listed species listed in Table 1 is minimal due the 
following factors as described in the proposed action: 
1. All applicable Federal, State, Tribal, and local environmental laws and regulations will be 
followed in conducting suppression activities. 
2. Information displayed in the Assessment on effects from application of diflubenzuron 
and carbaryl support the conclusion that adverse effects to federally-listed species are 
avoided under the proposed action. APHIS will restrict or avoid insecticide applications 
such that indirect effects to federally-listed species and their habitats will be insignificant 
and discountable. 
 
3. APHIS will avoid applying pesticides in areas of known or potentially occupied 
threatened and endangered species habitat to reduce direct and indirect effects consistent 
with Table 2 of the Assessment. Potential indirect effects described in the Assessment 
include reductions in insect prey for local populations of birds, impacts to aquatic 
environments, and effects on plant productivity from reductions in non-target pollinator 
insect populations. 
 
4. Pesticides will not be applied in areas known to have a high water table, or where sub 
surface leaching is likely. Carbaryl bait will not be applied within 500 feet
Text Len: 1851
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 in insect prey for local populations of birds, impacts to aquatic 
environments, and effects on plant productivity from reductions in non-target pollinator 
insect populations. 
 
4. Pesticides will not be applied in areas known to have a high water table, or where sub 
surface leaching is likely. Carbaryl bait will not be applied within 500 feet of any water 
which contains threatened and endangered species at any time. Designated critical habitat 
that is currently unoccupied would be treated as occupied habitat unless otherwise 
directed by the Service prior to treatment. 
 
5. Aerial spray applications of diflubenzuron or carbaryl will not be conducted within 0.5 
mile of any flowing or standing water which contains threatened and endangered fish 
species at any time. Aerial spray applications will not occur within 500 feet of occupied 
Oregon spotted frog habitat at any time. Ground application of diflubenzuron or 
carbaryl, will not be conducted within 500 feet of any flowing or standing water which 
contains threatened and endangered fish species at any time. Ground application will not 
be conducted within 200 feet of occupied Oregon spotted frog habitat at any time. 
Designated critical habitat that is currently unoccupied would be treated as occupied 
habitat unless otherwise directed by the Service prior to treatment. Aerial application of 
pesticides will not be conducted when winds exceed ten miles per hour. To avoid drift 
and volatilization, aerial application of pesticides will not be conducted when it is raining 
or rain is imminent, when foliage is wet, when it is foggy, when temperature exceeds 80 
degrees Fahrenheit, when there is air turbulence, or when a temperature inversion exists 
in the project area. Boundaries and buffers will be clearly marked. Aircraft used in aerial 
application will be equipped with systems

 application of pesticides will not be conducted when it is raining 
or rain is imminent, when foliage is wet, when it is foggy, when temperature exceeds 80 
degrees Fahrenheit, when there is air turbulence, or when a temperature inversion exists 
in the project area. Boundaries and buffers will be clearly marked. Aircraft used in aerial 
application will be equipped with systems to prevent nozzle dribble when the spray 
mechanism is disabled and emergency shut off valves to minimize pesticide loss in the 
event of broken lines, or system malfunctions. 
 
6. All mixing and loading will be done in approved areas where spills cannot enter any body 
of water. All pesticide tanks will be leak proof and constructed of corrosion resistant 
135

materials. Aircraft used in aerial application will be equipped with APHIS-approved 
differentially corrected global positioning systems that guide pilots along desired flight 
paths with an accuracy of plus or minus three feet. Free flying will not be allowed. 
 
7. APHIS will monitor insecticide applications and will document compliance with the 
protective measures in the Assessment. Emphasis should be on determining the 
effectiveness of avoidance buffers for federally-listed species including indirect affects to 
prey animals and pollinators and indirect transportation of insecticide products to non- 
target areas, including all water bodies. 
 
8. APHIS will notify the Service before any application of pesticide and determine the 
location of any federally-listed or proposed threatened or endangered listed species. 
APHIS will provide the Service with maps and GIS shape files of proposed treatment 
areas for the Service to use to determine accurate locations of the action in relation to 
known species locations. 
 
This concurrence is based on APHIS’s implementation

 pesticide and determine the 
location of any federally-listed or proposed threatened or endangered listed species. 
APHIS will provide the Service with maps and GIS shape files of proposed treatment 
areas for the Service to use to determine accurate locations of the action in relation to 
known species locations. 
 
This concurrence is based on APHIS’s implementation of the avoidance and mitigation measures 
outlined above. To assist in future consultations we request APHIS provide the Service a 
summary of environmental monitoring activities conducted each year in which suppression 
activities are conducted. The report shall be submitted on or before January 1 (or an APHIS and 
Service mutually agreed upon date) every year prior to initiation of the next grasshopper and 
cricket suppression activity. 
This concludes informal consultation on the subject action. This informal consultation does not 
exempt APHIS from prohibition of take under section 7(a)(2) of the ESA for any of the 11 
species listed above. This informal consultation may be superseded by a future programmatic 
consultation and covers only those activities carried out in 2021 as described in the Assessment. 
As provided in 50 CFR § 402.16, reinitiation of consultation may be necessary if: (1) new 
information reveals effects of the agency action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in 
a manner or to an extent not considered herein; (2) the action is subsequently modified in a 
manner that causes an effect to listed species or critical habitat that was not considered herein; or 
(3) a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the action. 
 
ADDITIONAL (CANDIDATE AND NON-LISTED) SPECIES PROTECTION 
 
In addition to the above species listed under the Act, the Service maintains
Text Len: 1821
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ner that causes an effect to listed species or critical habitat that was not considered herein; or 
(3) a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the action. 
 
ADDITIONAL (CANDIDATE AND NON-LISTED) SPECIES PROTECTION 
 
In addition to the above species listed under the Act, the Service maintains a list of species that 
are candidates for listing. Candidate species are plants and animals for which the Service has 
sufficient information on their biological status and threats to propose them as endangered or 
threatened under the Act, but for which development of a proposed listing regulation is 
precluded by other higher priority listing activities. Candidate species are separate from species 
that are listed as threatened or endangered, in that they do not receive the regulatory protections 
of the Act. In previous consultations, APHIS considered protective measures for the greater 
sage-grouse and Columbia spotted frog; however, these species have subsequently been removed 
(USFWS 2015, 2016) from the candidate list. In addition, APHIS will continue to provide 
protective measures and consult the Service annually on Borax Lake chub and Foskett speckled 
dace which were delisted on July 13, 2020 and October 15, 2019, respectively, due to recovery. 
The Service is also recommending protection of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), a 
candidate under the Act. The Service values ongoing conservation and protection of these 
136

species to prevent the need to list in the future, thus we are including the following conservation 
recommendations.

species to prevent the need to list in the future, thus we are including the following conservation 
recommendations. 
 
Greater Sage-Grouse 
In March 2010, the Service determined that protection of the greater sage-grouse (hereafter, 
sage-grouse) under the Act was warranted. However, listing sage-grouse was precluded by the 
need to address other species’ listings facing greater risk of extinction (USFWS 2010). On 
October 2, 2015, the Service announced a 12-month finding on petitions to list sage-grouse both 
rangewide and the Columbia Basin population, as an endangered or threatened species under the 
Act (USFWS 2016). After review of the best available scientific and commercial information, 
the Service found that the Columbia Basin population does not qualify as a distinct population 
segment (DPS). In addition, the Service found listing sage- grouse was not warranted for 
protection under the Act at the time. 
 
Sage-grouse in Oregon are found in Union, Baker, Deschutes, Crook, Lake, Harney and Malheur 
counties. Sage-grouse have not been observed in Klamath County since 1993 (USFWS 2010). 
In 2015, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) finalized the “The Oregon Sage- 
Grouse Action Plan” to help manage sage-grouse populations in Oregon. This plan was an 
update to previous versions from 2005 and 2011 (Hagen 2005, ODFW 2011, Sage-Grouse 
Conservation Partnership 2015). The strategy relies upon Core Areas of habitat that are essential 
to sage-grouse conservation. The maps and data provide a tool

Grouse Action Plan” to help manage sage-grouse populations in Oregon. This plan was an 
update to previous versions from 2005 and 2011 (Hagen 2005, ODFW 2011, Sage-Grouse 
Conservation Partnership 2015). The strategy relies upon Core Areas of habitat that are essential 
to sage-grouse conservation. The maps and data provide a tool for planning and identifying 
appropriate avoidance areas and mitigation in the event of human development in sage-grouse 
habitats. The Core Area maps, available on ODFW’s website, define areas that should be 
targeted for conservation actions or avoided when large scale disturbances are proposed. Core 
Area maps also provide a broad-scale filter to assist planners, County, State and Federal agencies 
in identifying areas of likely high and low resource conflicts associated with development 
proposals. APHIS should ensure that all suppression activities conducted in Oregon are 
consistent with the measures identified within the 2015 plan, specifically those found in Section 
IV and Appendix 4 (Sage-Grouse Conservation Partnership 2015). 
 
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) developed protective measures for sage-grouse to be 
implemented on BLM-administered lands. The Service recommends APHIS follow 
recommendations in the “Oregon Greater Sage-Grouse Approved Resource Management Plan 
Amendment” (BLM 2015), such as, Required Design Features, including seasonal restrictions. 
The Service also recommends following information found in the BLM Instructional 
Memorandum (IM) Number 2016-115, dated June 24, 2016, for all spray activity on BLM- 
administered lands (BLM 2016), which the APHIS references in the proposed action. Within,

grouse nesting/early brood-rearing habitat or summer/late brood-rearing habitat areas are not 
treated (spray or bait) during the respective seasonal use periods, unless: 
 
1) An emergency case exists as determined locally by both BLM and APHIS, or 
 
2) Habitat conditions are unsuitable for sage-grouse and the area is not likely to be 
occupied by sage-grouse at the time of treatments.

3) If treatments in PHMAs and occupied habitat cannot be avoided, treat the minimum 
amount of area needed to ensure grasshopper and Mormon cricket control objectives. 
 
Within General Habitat Management Areas (GHMA), the IM requires treatment of the minimum 
amount of area needed to ensure grasshopper or Mormon cricket control objectives, as agreed to 
by BLM and APHIS locally, while avoiding occupied or likely occupied nesting or late brood- 
rearing habitat to the extent possible. 
Insect reduction as a result of rangeland grasshopper control has been found to reduce brood 
sizes in a wild sage-grouse population (Johnson 1987). The Service recommends APHIS works 
with the BLM to plan around areas occupied by sage-grouse during periods of sage-grouse chick 
foraging and development in May and June (or as appropriate to local circumstances) to provide 
insect availability for

pper control has been found to reduce brood 
sizes in a wild sage-grouse population (Johnson 1987). The Service recommends APHIS works 
with the BLM to plan around areas occupied by sage-grouse during periods of sage-grouse chick 
foraging and development in May and June (or as appropriate to local circumstances) to provide 
insect availability for early development of sage-grouse chicks. In addition, sage-grouse brood 
areas should be located if not already known, and protected from insecticide spraying (Johnson 
1987). Grasshopper control should also be delayed in brood- rearing areas to allow for maximal 
chick development before spraying reduces their insect forage (Johnson 1987). Treatment areas 
near active or pending leks will be evaluated by wildlife specialists prior to being considered for 
treatment. In general, a 4-mile buffer around active and pending leks will be avoided to protect 
nesting and early brood-rearing of sage-grouse chicks and food sources unless close to heavily 
infested private lands or areas within the buffer are determined by a wildlife biologist to not be 
suitable habitat for nesting or early brood-rearing. The Service recommends APHIS use these 
guidelines to avoid pesticide spraying of nesting and brood-rearing areas for sage-grouse in order 
to prevent further declines from current sage-grouse population levels. Exceptions to buffer 
restrictions for aerial spray and ground application of diflubenzuron or carbaryl should be made 
in consultation with the Service, appropriate ODFW area biologists, and BLM District resource 
specialists, on a case-by-case basis. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS study the potential effect of the rangeland grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket control program on sage-grouse, particularly

The Service recommends APHIS study the potential effect of the rangeland grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket control program on sage-grouse, particularly related to reduction in insects as 
forage, within nesting and brood-rearing habitat. We request that APHIS provide us with 
information regarding how they will avoid areas occupied by sage-grouse during time periods of 
sage-grouse chick foraging and development. The Service is available to assist APHIS to 
minimize and avoid impacts to sage-grouse. 
 
Columbia spotted frog Great Basin DPS 
 
The Columbia spotted frog Great Basin DPS (Great Basin DPS) is known to occur in Lake, 
Harney, Malheur, and Grant counties, Oregon. In addition to the counties in Oregon, the Great 
Basin DPS is also known to occur in portions of Idaho and Nevada. The Great Basin DPS is 
widely distributed throughout southeastern Oregon, and local populations are isolated from each 
other by natural or human-induced habitat barriers. Threats to the Great Basin DPS include poor 
management of habitat including water development, improper grazing, mining activities, and 
nonnative species. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS avoid pesticide spraying of habitat for the Great Basin DPS and 
buffer the area surrounding Columbia spotted frog habitat similar to measures taken for Oregon 
spotted frog covered under this consultation in order to reduce risk of exposure of the Great 
Basin DPS to pesticide chemicals. We recommend that APHIS provide information to the

Borax Lake Chub 
Borax Lake chub was delisted from the Act on July 13, 2020, due to recovery. This species is 
found in Borax Lake, a shallow 10-acre, thermal spring fed lake in Harney County, Oregon. The 
lake is named for its concentration of borax, and its ecosystem is considered highly susceptible to 
modification due to irrigation and geothermal projects. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS avoid pesticide spraying of habitat for Borax Lake chub and 
buffer the area surrounding Borax Lake chub habitat similar to measures taken for other 
federally-listed fish species covered under this consultation in order to reduce the risk of 
exposure of Borax Lake chub to pesticide chemicals. We recommend that APHIS provide 
information to the Service regarding how they will avoid areas occupied by Borax Lake chub

Foskett Speckled Dace 
 
The Foskett speckled dace was delisted from the Act on October 15, 2019, due to recovery. This 
species occurs naturally in Foskett Spring, a small spring system found in the Coleman Basin on 
the west side of the Warner Valley, Lake County, and an introduced subpopulation at nearby 
Dace Springs. Trampling by cattle is perceived as the main reason for diminution of the habitat. 
Other threats include encroachment of vegetation, such as cattails, pumping of ground water or 
channelization which would affect water level, flow and increased silt. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS avoid pesticide spraying of habitat for Foskett speckled dace 
and buffer the area surrounding Foskett speckled dace habitat similar to measures taken for other 
federally-listed fish species covered under this consultation in order to reduce the risk of 
exposure of Foskett speckled dace to pesticide chemicals. We recommend that APHIS provide 
information to the Service regarding how they will avoid areas occupied by Foskett speckled 
dace prior to commencing with spray projects. The Service is available to assist APHIS to

 Statement 
Infestations of damaging populations of grasshoppers or Mormon crickets occur periodically in 
arid ecoregions of Oregon, especially basins, plateaus and uplands, in areas of gentle slope with 
minimal shade, that typify many high desert landscapes east of the Cascade Mountains. Damaging 
outbreaks can occur in warm microclimates of western Oregon as well but are less frequent or 
enduring. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) may, upon request by land 
managers or State departments of agriculture, conduct treatments to suppress grasshopper 
infestations as part of the Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program 
(program). The term ‘grasshopper’ used in this environmental assessment (EA) refers to both 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets, unless differentiation is necessary. 
Under the guidance of Section 417 of the Plant Protection Act of 2000, USDA plays a coordinating 
role between Federal agencies, State agricultural departments, and private ranchers to control both 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets. 
Populations of grasshoppers that may trigger the need for an APHIS suppression program are 
considered on a case-by-case basis and are difficult to predict, or to detect and delimit in a timely 
manner during the limited annual treatment window. The Grasshopper Hazard Map, which is 
produced each fall and offered to the public at our program website (www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-
pests-diseases/ghmc), is the best forecasting tool a vailable for predicting locations of outbreaks in 
the coming year. There are limitations to these maps however, such as not catching limited sized

pests-diseases/ghmc), is the best forecasting tool a vailable for predicting locations of outbreaks in 
the coming year. There are limitations to these maps however, such as not catching limited sized 
outbreaks (a.k.a. ‘hotspots’), or proximity spillover of projected hazard level from areas prone to 
outbreak, into areas that are unconducive, such as forests or mountains. If the Level IV ecoregions 
of Eastern Oregon in the following table are clipped out of the hazard map, this better indicates 
geographical limits of the forecast grasshopper outbreaks. For hotspots to show up better on the 
other hand, either more survey is required or, such as with Klamath Falls and Lakeview, surveys 
need focus more on problem areas. Currently, survey protocols focus on federal rangeland, due to 
consistency of access and land use, however that can mask a hotspot if survey from such areas do 
not capture what is occurring on nearby private agricultural land.

 Grasshopper Hazard Map of Oregon, based on 2024 survey results, excluding unconducive ecoregions. 
Through adult grasshopper surveys in July and early August, APHIS attempts to forecast areas 
where damaging grasshopper populations may occur during the following year. Land managers and 
property owners may request APHIS assistance to control grasshopper outbreaks because of these 
efforts, a history of damage they have observed and/or as part of a good neighbor policy. The 
estimated potential damage to rangeland resources forecast in the current year is determined by 
spring nymphal assessment and delimitation surveys which are necessarily conducted within the 
limited treatment window when grasshoppers are active in their annual cycle. Typically, there is 
only about one month in a given location to conduct this survey, and any feasible treatment, 
spanning from late spring to early summer, and varying by location, elevation, species and weather. 
The aggregate history of 70 years of grasshopper outbreak surveys can help to inform the public on

areas generally prone to outbreaks, as illustrated in the following map. Even the most prone areas 
do not have outbreaks every year however, and the exact location of outbreaks can migrate from 
year to year, but a general pattern emerges of what to expect over decades. Changes caused over 
time due to survey protocols, land use, water availability or other longterm trends may be slow to 
show up in this aggragate map. One of most impacted areas of recent years, the Klamath and Goose 
Lake Basins, again shows only moderate hazard for example, which is not accurate.

Many areas prone to damaging grasshopper populations are more rural and closely tied to the land 
for economic productivity on average, even for a state that takes pride in these metrics. Harney 
County for example, where most APHIS grasshopper treatments have occurred in Oregon, is the 
largest county by area (10,226 square miles) but has a population which averages less than one 
person per square mile, which is less than 1/40th of the state’s average population density. Such 
areas also typically have a high percentage of public land (e.g., 75% in Harney County), and rely 
heavily on natural resources for economic development and quality of life of its citizens. When 
grasshopper population are at high levels, known as outbreaks, intensive feeding on available 
vegetation can degrade natural resources and negatively impact rural communities, including: 
• Reduction of herbivore capacity, including agricultural livestock and wildlife, 
• Reduction of flowers for pollinators and seed production including for rare plants, 
• Increased soil erosion,

• Reduced water quality,  
• Damage to private crops, orchards/vineyards, and gardens

• Public health impacts due to slippery roads, poor windshield visibility, airplane bird-strikes, 
and damage to infrastructure from flooding of clogged gutters

• Damage to private crops, orchards/vineyards, and gardens 
• Increased use of pesticides, 
• Public health impacts due to slippery roads, poor windshield visibility, airplane bird-strikes, 
and damage to infrastructure from flooding of clogged gutters,  
• Reduction of tourism, property values and municipal tax income. 
 
Outbreaks also have the potential to continue for many years without diminishment from natural 
causes, such as wildfire, disease and/or unfavorable climatic conditions, which are difficult to 
predict. Benefits of controlling damaging grasshopper outbreaks include the protection of 
rangeland ecosystem resources and nearby cropland from decimating impacts in the current year, 
and reduced potential for continuing damage in subsequent years. The goal of the proposed 
suppression program analyzed in this EA is to reduce grasshopper populations below economic 
injury levels in order to protect the natural resources of rangeland ecosystems, the value of 
livestock and wildlife forage, and cropland adjacent to rangeland. 
This EA analyzes potential effects of the proposed action and its alternatives. This EA applies to a 
proposed suppression program that would take place from May 1st to August 1st within rangeland 
ecosystems of the following ecoregions and counties of Oregon: 
• Columbia Plateau (Jefferson, Wasco, and Umatilla counties) primarily in support of 
potential treatment requests from tribal governments. 
• Blue Mountains (Baker and northern Malheur counties) primarily in support of BLM Vale

As discussed in this introduction, many other counties in the state, including significant parts of 
nearly every county in Central and Eastern Oregon, are prone to some level of grasshopper 
outbreaks, demonstrated visually in figures 2 and 3 (as forecast or as shown in aggregate). For that

reason, in previous years more counties were included in the program EA for Oregon. No viable 
treatment request from stakeholders in these excluded counties have been received in past decade 
however, meaning that APHIS has responded to requests for assistance, but ultimately found no 
way to provide program run suppression treatments, due to limitations of authority or program 
guidelines. If a viable request for an APHIS treatment is received from outside the counties listed 
in this EA, a supplemental EA could be produced, or additional coverage area(s) would be added to 
a future Oregon EA for the program. 
This EA is prepared in accordance with the requirements under the National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) regulations

Implementing Procedures (7 CFR Part 372). APHIS make and issue a decision based on the 
analysis presented in this EA, the results of public involvement, and consultation with other 
agencies and individuals. A selection of one of the program alternatives will be made by APHIS in 
2025 and for subsequent years until and unless an updated EA is prepared, for rangeland in Baker, 
Harney, Jefferson, Lake, Malheur, Umatilla and Wasco counties of Oregon. APHIS is aware of the

regulations implementing NEPA are not judicially enforceable or binding on this agency action, 
APHIS has nonetheless elected to follow those regulations at 40 C.F.R. Parts 1500– 1508, in

B. Background Discussion 
1. Grasshopper Ecology 
Rangelands provide many goods and services, including food, fiber, recreational opportunities, and 
grazing land for cattle (Havstad et al, 2007; Follett and Reed, 2010). Grasshoppers and Mormon 
crickets are part of rangeland ecosystems, serving as food for wildlife and playing an important 
role in nutrient cycling. However, grasshoppers and Mormon crickets have the potential to occur at 
high population levels, referred to as outbreaks (Belovsky et al, 1996), that result in competition 
with livestock and other herbivores for rangeland forage and can result in damage to rangeland 
plant species (Wakeland and Shull, 1936; Wakeland and Parker, 1952; Hewitt, 1977; Hewitt and 
Onsager, 1983; Belovsky et al, 1996; Belovsky, 2000; Pfadt, 2002; Branson et al, 2006; Bradshaw 
et al, 2018). Out of approximately 650 western grasshopper species, only 10 to 15 are recurrent 
economic pests. However, even during “normal” population years, they remove over 20% of 
above-ground rangeland forage annually at an estimated cost of $1.2 billion per year (Hewitt & 
Onsager, 1983; dollar amount adjusted). During severe outbreaks, grasshoppers consume 
substantial forage, which may disrupt the ecological functioning of rangelands (Rashford et al, 
2012). Outbreaks are amplified and exacerbated by drought, as vegetative regrowth is reduced and

 cost of $1.2 billion per year (Hewitt & 
Onsager, 1983; dollar amount adjusted). During severe outbreaks, grasshoppers consume 
substantial forage, which may disrupt the ecological functioning of rangelands (Rashford et al, 
2012). Outbreaks are amplified and exacerbated by drought, as vegetative regrowth is reduced and 
more bare ground provides increased egg laying habitat, especially in areas that might otherwise 
have a layer of thatch or more persistent flooding (Schell, 2023). Clearwing grasshoppers have 
been observed at extremely high levels in Oregon in recent years, likely linked to this dynamic. 
APHIS supports the use of integrated pest management (IPM) principles in the management of 
grasshoppers. IPM is the selection, integration, and implementation of pest control tactics in a 
systems approach on the basis of anticipated economic, environmental, and sociological 
consequences. The economic injury level (EIL) concept is the most widely accepted decision-
making framework for pest management (Pedigo et al, 1986). The basic principle is to determine 
`  
Page | 12 
 
the pest level (e.g., population per unit area) that results in monetary damages greater than the cost 
of treatment – benefit cost ratio greater than one in standard economic terminology.  The 
mathematical formulations can vary depending on the application and data available, but the basic 
formulation for EIL is given by (see Higley and Pedigo, 1996): 
 EIL C
VDK= , 
where, C is treatment cost (e.g., $/acre), V is market value per unit of production (e.g., $/lb), D is 
production loss per pest (e.g., lb/pest) and K is the proportional

 is given by (see Higley and Pedigo, 1996): 
 EIL C
VDK= , 
where, C is treatment cost (e.g., $/acre), V is market value per unit of production (e.g., $/lb), D is 
production loss per pest (e.g., lb/pest) and K is the proportional reduction in loss from applying 
control. The EIL identifies the pest population (e.g., pest/acre) that justifies spending C dollars on 
control. 
The EIL can be used as an actionable criterion; however, given pest population dynamics and 
delays in treatment effect, applying treatment once EIL pest levels are observed may result in 
substantial economic losses. APHIS and our cooperators assess whether grasshopper populations 
are exceeding an action threshold (historically termed the “economic infestation level”), which 
identifies the pest level when treatment should be initiated to avoid an increasing pest population 
from reaching the EIL. The action threshold therefore identifies a temporal criterion to initiate 
management given observations of pest levels, as shown in the following figure. Action thresholds 
can be developed in a variety of ways including subjective determinations based on local 
experience, to objective functions of the EIL.   
 
Figure 5. Diagram of the typical relationship between the economic injury level (EIL) and action threshold (AT) for applying pest 
treatments (Rashford et al., 2012). 
The ‘economic injury level’ is a measurement of the economic losses caused by a particular 
population level of grasshoppers to the infested rangeland. This value is determined on a case-by-

 (Rashford et al., 2012). 
The ‘economic injury level’ is a measurement of the economic losses caused by a particular 
population level of grasshoppers to the infested rangeland. This value is determined on a case-by-
case basis with knowledge of many factors including, but not limited to, the following: economic 
use of available forage or crops; grasshopper species, age, and density present; rangeland 
productivity and composition; accessibility and cost of alternative forage; and weather patterns. In 
decision making, the level of economic injury is balanced against the cost of treating to determine 
an “economic threshold” below which there would not be an overall benefit for the treatment. 
Short-term economic benefits accrue during the years of treatments, but additional long-term 
benefit may accrue and be considered in deciding the total value gained by treatment. Grasshopper 
caused losses to rangeland habitat and cultural and personal values (e.g., aesthetics and cultural

resources), although a part of decision making, are not part of the economic values in determining 
the necessity of treatment.  
While market prices are good proxies for the direct market value of commodities damaged by pests 
(e.g., crops or forage), market prices do not capture all of the potential economic values affected by 
pests. Market prices, for example, can be highly variable over time and space, depending on local 
supply and demand conditions (Rashford et al, 2012).

pests. Market prices, for example, can be highly variable over time and space, depending on local 
supply and demand conditions (Rashford et al, 2012).   
2. Grasshopper Population Control 
Grasshopper populations sometimes build to economic injury levels despite ecologically sound 
general land management practices and efforts to prevent outbreaks.  Noxious weeds and erosion 
are linked to grasshopper outbreaks and are actively managed against by agencies that may request 
help from APHIS, such as the BLM, which surveys for and suppresses noxious weeds, especially 
those linked increased wildfire and works to prevent erosion. Many areas they manage are prone to 
cyclical wildfire increased by invasive annual grasses, including medusahead rye, Taeniatherum 
caputmedusae, and cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum. In response major projects have occurred to 
suppress these species and plant cool-season grass species (e.g., crested wheatgrass, Agropyron 
christatum). Grazing is limited seasonally to help protect these revegetation projects which also 
helps to reduce grasshopper outbreaks. Where possible, vegetative thatch and soil biomass is 
encouraged to promote fungal, protozoal and beneficial insect growth conditions to help limit 
grasshopper outbreaks. These efforts can be moisture limited however and compete with other land 
manager responsibilities.    
When forage and land management have failed to prevent grasshopper outbreaks insecticides may 
be needed to reduce the destruction of rangeland vegetation and to limit damage to neighboring 
agricultural operations. APHIS’ enabling legislation provides, in relevant part, that ‘on request of

When forage and land management have failed to prevent grasshopper outbreaks insecticides may 
be needed to reduce the destruction of rangeland vegetation and to limit damage to neighboring 
agricultural operations. APHIS’ enabling legislation provides, in relevant part, that ‘on request of 
the administering agency or the agriculture department of an affected State, the Secretary, to 
protect rangeland, shall immediately treat Federal, State, or private lands that are infested with 
grasshoppers or Mormon crickets’… (7 U.S.C. § 7717(c)(1)).  
Under the guidance of Section 417 of the Plant Protection Act of 2000 (PPA), USDA plays a 
coordinating role between federal agencies, state agricultural departments, and private ranchers to 
control both grasshoppers and Mormon crickets. APHIS accomplishes this by conducting 
cooperative surveys during the early spring and late summer to measure both nymphal and adult 
populations of grasshoppers, respectively. The annual adult surveys can be used to forecast 
grasshopper population levels in the following year. Where outbreaks are common, the program 
selectively employs nymphal surveys to delimit potential treatment boundaries.  
IPM procedures are thoroughly incorporated into the management of grasshoppers by APHIS. IPM 
strategies consider economic, environmental, and pesticide resistance consequences of pest control 
tactics. The primary objective of IPM is to reduce agricultural pest populations below the economic 
injury level. APHIS published a programmatic EIS in 1987 for rangeland grasshopper control that 
included IPM methods as the preferred alternative. At that time APHIS expected the IPM 
alternative would primarily include biological or chemical methods for grasshopper control. 
APHIS would continue to participate in research and testing

injury level. APHIS published a programmatic EIS in 1987 for rangeland grasshopper control that 
included IPM methods as the preferred alternative. At that time APHIS expected the IPM 
alternative would primarily include biological or chemical methods for grasshopper control. 
APHIS would continue to participate in research and testing to identify other feasible cultural and 
mechanical control methods. The program uses IPM principles by selecting a particular control 
method on an individual site after taking into consideration of economic (the cost and the cost-
effectiveness of various methods in both the short and long term), ecological (the impact on 
nontarget organisms and the environment), and sociological (the acceptability of various IPM 
methods to cooperators, or the potential effects on land use) factors.

APHIS uses survey data to inform stakeholders of the potential for economic damage associated 
with grasshoppers. The program also provides technical assistance on insecticides, application 
methodology and cost benefit analysis to equip land managers with information needed to make 
economically and environmentally sound grasshopper treatment decisions. 
APHIS responds to solicitations from land managers to assess, and if necessary, suppresses 
grasshopper infestations. While many stakeholders interact with the program, Federal Land 
Managers represent about 75% of suppression requests. Engaging in grasshopper suppression is 
complicated, and funding, rangeland conditions, environmental regulations, politics and public 
sentiment all impact the process. The need for rapid and effective response when an outbreak 
occurs limits the options available to APHIS. The application of an insecticide within all or part of 
the outbreak area is often the only response available to APHIS to rapidly suppress or reduce

, and funding, rangeland conditions, environmental regulations, politics and public 
sentiment all impact the process. The need for rapid and effective response when an outbreak 
occurs limits the options available to APHIS. The application of an insecticide within all or part of 
the outbreak area is often the only response available to APHIS to rapidly suppress or reduce 
grasshopper populations and effectively protect rangeland (USDA APHIS, 2011). APHIS uses 
several factors to determine if grasshopper suppression is warranted, including, but not limited to, 
the pest species present, maturity of the pest species population, timing of treatment, costs and 
potential benefits of conducting the action, and ecological considerations (USDA APHIS, 2008).  
The site-specific data used to make treatment decisions in real time is gathered in part during the 
limited duration spring nymph survey, specifically pest grasshopper density, species, nymphal 
stage and distribution. Focusing spring survey for cost effectiveness, among the millions of acres 
where harmful grasshopper infestations may occur in the state, is aided by adult surveys which are 
reported out in the fall of the previous year and are ideally analyzed by land managers over the 
winter to provide early notice to APHIS of a concern and request for assistance. As discussed in 
Chapter 1.A. forecasts and tentative plans are limited in accuracy, as may be land managers 
awareness of an emergent outbreak. Section 417 of the PPA requires among other things that 
“Subject to the availability of funds… on request of the administering agency or the agriculture 
department of the affected State… to protect rangeland, [APHIS] shall immediately treat… lands 
that are infested with grasshoppers… at levels of economic infestation, unless [APH

“Subject to the availability of funds… on request of the administering agency or the agriculture 
department of the affected State… to protect rangeland, [APHIS] shall immediately treat… lands 
that are infested with grasshoppers… at levels of economic infestation, unless [APHIS] determines 
that delaying treatment will not cause greater economic damage to adjacent owners of rangeland.” 
Determining if there is an economic infestation and if delaying treatment will not cause greater 
damage to adjacent owners of rangeland requires a complex assessment, often somewhat limited by 
the practicality and cost of gathering a comprehensive dataset. Grasshopper densities, species 
complex, dominant species, dominant life stage, grazing allotment terrain, soil types, range 
conditions, local weather patterns (wind, temp., precipitation), slope and aspect for hatching beds, 
animal unit months (AUMs) present in grazing allotment, forage damage estimates, number of 
potential AUMs consumed by grasshopper population, potential AUMs managed for allotment and 
value of the AUM, estimated cost of replacement feed for livestock, rotational time frame for 
grazing allotments, and number of livestock in grazing allotment are all potential factors which 
could play into such as comprehensive dataset. APHIS is also not a land management or research 
agency, so a reliance on outside partners, such as ARS and the requesting land managers to 
contribute much of this information, is also a legal limitation of mandate. In addition to official 
requests for assistance, APHIS therefore requires whatever justification is available to help 
determine the economic benefits of proposed treatments, if economic justification is in doubt. The

contribute much of this information, is also a legal limitation of mandate. In addition to official 
requests for assistance, APHIS therefore requires whatever justification is available to help 
determine the economic benefits of proposed treatments, if economic justification is in doubt. The 
assessment is aided in Oregon by the fact that 1.) Treatment request typically come from areas with 
a history of demonstrated loses, 2.) Treatment funds are limited, and requests compete for urgency, 
3.) Treatments prioritize areas that have been reseeded or otherwise are considered fragile, such as 
post fire or noxious weed project areas. In Oregon the 2025 surcharge AUM rate is $6.35, which is 
an average cost of AUM between public and private land prices. Such rates go some way in 
justifying treatments on their own, however other factors also contribute to potential upside of 
`

reducing grasshopper outbreaks (as discussed in Chapter 1.A.). The typical treatment in Oregon has 
occurred when grasshoppers are at rates of 30 square yard or above on average, though lower rates 
may still justify treatments. Considerations of suitable phenological timing (i.e. limited treatment 
window) create a hard back stop each year to approval of APHIS treatment programs, also for 
economic reasons, since currently supported program pesticides for APHIS in Oregon are 
ineffective in adult grasshopper control. Adult grasshoppers have already caused most of their 
potential damage for the year, meaning that delay is unlikely to cause greater economic damage.

ineffective in adult grasshopper control. Adult grasshoppers have already caused most of their 
potential damage for the year, meaning that delay is unlikely to cause greater economic damage.  
Although APHIS does extensive surveys and considers the factors described above to determine 
whether treatment is warranted, pestiferous grasshopper species can be found in suitable habitat 
statewide and can increase exponentially over one or two years, making exact location of 
individual requests for treatments difficult to predict. By the time new significant outbreaks are 
first reported in a given year, it is often too late in the annual development cycle of the 
grasshoppers to delimit the outbreak and organize an effective treatment. Response to outbreaks 
may take multiple years of survey and planning, however populations can also crash due to natural 
causes or migrate to new areas, which again makes exact locations of outbreaks prior to the limited 
treatment window difficult to predict each year. For roughly 80% of the year grasshoppers are 
dormant eggs in the soil, with active immature stages lasting roughly one month, and adult phases 
varying by weather and access to sustaining resources. Use of the most ecologically responsible 
pesticides available (i.e., those that don’t kill on contact) has resulted in a shorter effective 
treatment window, typically lasting a month or less, following detection of hatch. In the Affected 
Environment chapter below (III.A.) APHIS does its utmost to predict locations where treatments 
may occur based on survey data, previous and on-going requests for treatments, and historical data 
and trends. However, APHIS cannot predict all the specific locations at which affected resource 
owners would determine that a rangeland damage problem has become intolerable to the point that

3. Description of Grasshopper Species in Oregon 
Grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Caelifera, Acridoidea) are important endemic herbivores and 
decomposers of grassland ecosystems worldwide, stimulating plant growth while aggregating 
protein for carnivorous species and providing a significant amount of biodiversity. When 
populations of certain species boom to extreme levels however, devastating impacts on agriculture 
and ecological processes at a landscape scale can result. Rapid loss of vegetation can negatively 
impact rare species of plants and pollinators, decreasing overall biodiversity and abundance, 
increasing run-off and soil erosion, and decreasing water quality (Latchininsky et al, 2011). More 
than 100 species of Acridid grasshoppers have been recorded from localities in Oregon, though 
only nine species during the past five decades have been known to reach outbreak levels that 
threaten crops or valuable range resources. The most frequent economic pest grasshopper species 
of concern in Oregon roughly in order of damage are as follows (with active hyperlinks to ARS

The most widespread and commonly encountered pest species in North America is the migratory 
grasshopper, which is considered a locust species due to its propensity to build to dense 
populations in which they change appearance, improve flight ability to migrate in swarms, and 
march in destructive bands. Migratory grasshopper populations can be exacerbated by agricultural 
practices (e.g., thriving on weeds, soil erosion or over-grazed land, and potentially from lush 
growth in summer from irrigation, or even no till practices). They are capable of forming massive 
swarms flying at high altitude to infest lands miles away at densities of 60-140 per square yard, and 
feed heavily on grains, legumes, vegetables, and ornamentals. The valley, two-striped, red-legged, 
Packard’s, and striped sand grasshoppers can also build up rapidly in areas impacted by agricultural 
land disturbances, but are not considered locusts, having not demonstrated the requisite phase shift. 
Clear-winged grasshopper and big-headed grasshopper have been reported at extremely damaging 
high densities and can be especially devastating to small grains and grasses. These species as well 
as the white-whiskered grasshopper can spread from well-managed, substantially intact native 
ecosystems, such as seasonal wetlands and prairies, into widespread outbreaks devastating to 
agricultural areas. Once in outbreak, populations can continue to build to increasingly damaging

 prairies, into widespread outbreaks devastating to 
agricultural areas. Once in outbreak, populations can continue to build to increasingly damaging 
levels that spread geographically and sustain over several years. (Pfadt 2002) 
The widespread grasshopper outbreaks of the mid-1980s were comprised primarily of ‘spur-
throated’ grasshoppers in the subfamily Melanoplinae: migratory grasshopper (Melanoplus 
sanguinipes), red-legged grasshopper (M. femurrubrum), two-striped grasshopper (M. bivittatus),

Packard grasshopper (M. packardii), and striped sand grasshopper (M. foedus). Localized outbreaks 
in the 1990s and early 2000s were mainly clear-winged grasshopper (Camnula pellucida). 
Outbreaks beginning in 2019 have included the economically damaging species big-headed 
grasshopper (Aulocara elliotti) and valley grasshopper (Oedaleonotus enigma) in addition to 
species of Melanoplus and Camnula pellucida. (Information provided by State Entomologist, 
2020.)

Mormon cricket, Anabrus simplex (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae, Decticinae), is not a true cricket 
though it is in the same suborder as crickets (Ensifera). In many ways this species shares more 
attributes with grasshoppers than with members of its own family, the shield-backed katydids, most 
of which are tree and shrub dwelling and uncommon in rangelands. Unlike complexes of 
pestiferous grasshopper species, other shieldbacked katydids found in

ickets (Ensifera). In many ways this species shares more 
attributes with grasshoppers than with members of its own family, the shield-backed katydids, most 
of which are tree and shrub dwelling and uncommon in rangelands. Unlike complexes of 
pestiferous grasshopper species, other shieldbacked katydids found in Oregon rangeland have not 
been found to cause economic damage, remaining mostly solitary and not reaching outbreak levels. 
Mormon crickets are well adapted to the Great Basin and other arid environments of the Western 
US. Radiocarbon-dating of several hundred Mormon crickets remains excavated from an ancient 
roasting pit shows that they were abundant enough to catch and use for food by Native Americans 
at least 2,000 years prior to European settlement of the American West. Outbreaks of this species 
are like those of grasshoppers in that they are unpredictable and increase over several years, 
however outbreaks typically last longer, up to 20 years or more. Though incapable of flight, during 
outbreaks adults march in dense bands, travelling up to a mile per day. Their behavior and coloring 
is bold, since their abundance overwhelms the appetites of predator populations. In contrast, when 
population densities are low, Mormon crickets are more camouflaged, solitary and do not migrate. 
(Pfadt 2002) 
Feeding damage to crops and garden vegetables can be devastating, and a single individual per acre 
is estimated to consume 38 dry weight pounds of rangeland forage (Pfadt 2002). Mormon crickets 
also present an economic contamination issue for many crops, giving off a rotten fish smell as they 
decompose. Additionally, high roadkill of Mormon crickets can make road surface slick and unsafe

also present an economic contamination issue for many crops, giving off a rotten fish smell as they 
decompose. Additionally, high roadkill of Mormon crickets can make road surface slick and unsafe 
for motorists, which is exacerbated by the fact that, as cannibalistic omnivores, they are attracted to 
the road to feed. Often congregating on buildings in large numbers, they further can become a 
general nuisance to town residents, clogging drains, biting people, and discourage tourism, in 
impacted communities such as Jordan Valley, McDermitt, and Arlington, Oregon. In responses 
from the public, it has been pointed out that each of these remarkably large insects make excellent 
fish bait, or poultry feed, and to some extent entrepreneurs do harvest them for such uses. This, and 
take by wildlife of this resource, however, does not significantly diminish their extreme abundance

and distribution during outbreaks. During a peak outbreak in 1938 for example, it was estimated 
that 19 million acres in 11 states were infested (Pfadt 2002). 
Special programmatic considerations with Mormon crickets include the fact that they migrate much 
more actively than most grasshoppers and also occur in more mountainous canyon lands and 
passes. To date, treatment of this species in Oregon has been far less common than in surrounding 
states, Nevada, Idaho and even Washington. The program is primarily geared towards regular 
grasshoppers, with very few areas where Mormon crickets have been observed being feasible for 
treatment. If Mormon Crickets continue to expand into the SE quadrant of the state or out of the 
Arlington area, as has been observed as a

grasshoppers, with very few areas where Mormon crickets have been observed being feasible for 
treatment. If Mormon Crickets continue to expand into the SE quadrant of the state or out of the 
Arlington area, as has been observed as a possible trend in recent years, a greater focus of program 
strategy and resources will need to be directed towards them. So far, this has been severely limited 
by Sage Grouse protection areas and other special management areas which leave very little 
geographical areas for treatment.  
4. APHIS Environmental Compliance and Cooperators 
In June 2002, APHIS completed an EIS describing the agency’s most effective methods of 
reducing the damage caused by grasshopper populations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, 
Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South 
Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. During November 2019, APHIS published 
human health and ecological risk assessments (HHERAs) for the use of carbaryl, 
chlorantraniliprole, diflubenzuron and malathion by the program. APHIS also published an updated 
EIS to consolidate and incorporate the available data and analyze the environmental risk of new 
program tools. The risk analysis in the 2019 EIS is incorporated by reference (USDA APHIS, 
2019).  
In October 2015, APHIS and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) detailing cooperative efforts between the two groups on suppression of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets on BLM lands (Document #15-8100-0870-

 is incorporated by reference (USDA APHIS, 
2019).  
In October 2015, APHIS and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) detailing cooperative efforts between the two groups on suppression of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets on BLM lands (Document #15-8100-0870-MU, October 15, 
2015). This MOU clarifies that APHIS will prepare and issue to the public site-specific 
environmental documents that evaluate potential impacts associated with proposed measures to 
suppress economically damaging grasshopper and Mormon cricket populations. The MOU also 
states that these documents will be prepared under the APHIS NEPA implementing procedures 
with cooperation and input from the BLM.  
The MOU further states that the responsible BLM official will request in writing the inclusion of 
appropriate lands in the APHIS suppression project when treatment on BLM land is necessary. The 
BLM must also prepare a Pesticide Use Proposal (Form FS-2100-2) for APHIS to treat infestations. 
According to the provisions of the MOU, APHIS can begin treatments after APHIS issues an 
appropriate decision document and BLM prepares and approves the Pesticide Use Proposal. 
APHIS provides technical assistance to federal, tribal, state and private land managers including 
the use of IPM. However, implementation of on-the-ground IPM activities is limited to land 
managers. APHIS completed the Grasshopper Integrated Pest Management (GIPM) project. One of 
the goals of the GIPM is to develop new methods of suppressing grasshopper and Mormon cricket 
populations to improve non-target effects. Reduced agent area treatment (RAAT) methods were 
developed to decrease pesticide use and provide

managers. APHIS completed the Grasshopper Integrated Pest Management (GIPM) project. One of 
the goals of the GIPM is to develop new methods of suppressing grasshopper and Mormon cricket 
populations to improve non-target effects. Reduced agent area treatment (RAAT) methods were 
developed to decrease pesticide use and provide refuges for non-target organisms within the 
treatment block during suppression activities while reducing target populations below the level 
causing economic harm. APHIS typically employs RAAT methods in which the application rate of 
insecticide is reduced from conventional levels, and treated swaths are alternated with swaths that 
are not directly treated. RAATs rely on selected insecticide to effectively suppress grasshoppers 
`  
Page | 20 
 
while conserving grasshopper predators and parasites in swaths not directly treated (USDA APHIS, 
2002). APHIS continues to evaluate new suppression tools and methods for grasshopper 
populations, including biological control. 
C. About This Process 
Activities under the Program are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). APHIS follows the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) regulations 
implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.) along with USDA (7 CFR Part 1b) and APHIS NEPA 
Implementing Procedures (7 CFR Part 372) as part of the decision-making process. NEPA sets 
forth the requirement that all federal actions be evaluated in terms of the following: 
• Their potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment for the purpose 
of avoiding or, where possible, mitigating and minimizing adverse impacts;  
• Making informed decisions;

Implementing Procedures (7 CFR Part 372) as part of the decision-making process. NEPA sets 
forth the requirement that all federal actions be evaluated in terms of the following: 
• Their potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment for the purpose 
of avoiding or, where possible, mitigating and minimizing adverse impacts;  
• Making informed decisions; and  
• Including agencies and the public in their NEPA planning in support of informed decision-
making.  
As previously discussed above (I.B.) the NEPA process for grasshopper management is 
complicated by the fact that there is a limited window of time when treatments are most effective, 
and it is difficult to forecast which specific sites within the area covered by this EA will both have 
requests for treatment and be warranted for treatment to suppress grasshopper outbreaks. As such, 
the geographic scope of the actions and analyses in this EA is Baker, Harney, Jefferson, Lake, 
Malheur, Umatilla, and Wasco counties to account for the wide geographic areas in which 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets occur on rangelands. Then, when grasshopper populations grow 
to nuisance levels, program managers examine the proposed treatment area to ensure that this EA 
applies to the specific areas where control activities will be conducted and can act quickly. At the 
same time, the Program strives to alert the public in a timely manner to its more concrete treatment 
plans and avoid or minimize harm to the environment in implementing those plans. 
Section 1619 of the Farm Bill (7 USC 8791) also prohibits disclosure of certain information from 
agricultural producers who provide information to participate in programs of the department.

plans and avoid or minimize harm to the environment in implementing those plans. 
Section 1619 of the Farm Bill (7 USC 8791) also prohibits disclosure of certain information from 
agricultural producers who provide information to participate in programs of the department.  
Public involvement under the CEQ Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of 
NEPA distinguishes Federal actions with effects of national concern from those with effects 
primarily of local concern (40 CFR 1501.9). The 2019 EIS is a programmatic analysis of the 
environmental impacts of the Program across 17 Western States, including Oregon.  
To assist with understanding applicable issues and reasonable alternatives to manage grasshopper 
outbreaks in rangelands and to ensure that the analysis is complete for informed decision making, 
APHIS has made this Draft EA available for a 30-day public review and comment period. Public 
outreach notification methods for this EA include local newspaper (i.e., The Oregonian); 
Regulations.gov; Stakeholder Registry Notice; direct emailing to those who have expressed interest 
in the program, and public meetings. After reviewing and considering all timely received 
comments, APHIS will issue a decision and will notify the public of the decision using the same 
methods as for the advertising the availability of the Draft EA. 
Scoping as defined by NEPA is an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be 
addressed by the environmental risk analysis and for identifying the significant issues related to a 
proposed action (40 CFR 1501.7). APHIS uses the scoping process to enlist land managers and the 
public to identify alternatives and issues to be considered during the development of a grasshopper 
suppression program. The process can occur formally and informally through meetings,

public to identify alternatives and issues to be considered during the development of a grasshopper 
suppression program. The process can occur formally and informally through meetings, 
`

conversations, or written comments from individuals and groups. Though not technically scoping, 
EAs for grasshopper suppression have been created for 50 years, and this iterative process has 
resulted in extensive feedback from the public. In fact, the suppression of grasshoppers created the 
first federal agricultural department in the US, predating NEPA by approximately a century. 
Broadly, the cumulative process of receiving feedback on proposed actions has been profound. 
APHIS reviews and considers all comments received in preparing EAs for this program in Oregon.

II. Alternatives 
A. Framing 
To engage in comprehensive NEPA risk analysis APHIS must frame potential agency decisions 
into distinct action alternatives. These program alternatives are then evaluated to determine the 
significance of environmental effects. The 2019 programmatic EIS looked at the environmental 
impacts of three different alternatives:  
1. Alternative 1: No action alternative, which would maintain the status quo of allowing 
applications of three pesticides (carbaryl, diflubenzuron, and malathion). Pesticides may be 
applied as a spray or bait using ground or aerial equipment at full coverage rates or, more 
typically, by using RAATs.  
2. Alternative 2: No suppression alternative where APHIS would not fund or participate in any 
program
Text Len: 1733
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of three pesticides (carbaryl, diflubenzuron, and malathion). Pesticides may be 
applied as a spray or bait using ground or aerial equipment at full coverage rates or, more 
typically, by using RAATs.  
2. Alternative 2: No suppression alternative where APHIS would not fund or participate in any 
program to suppress grasshopper infestations. Any suppression program would be 
implemented by another entity; and  
3. Alternative 3: Preferred alternative updates the information allows use of four pesticides 
(carbaryl, diflubenzuron, malathion, and chlorantraniliprole). Upon request, APHIS would 
make a single application per year to a treatment area, and would apply it at conventional 
or, more likely, RAAT rates. The approach to use either conventional treatment or RAATs 
is an adaptive management feature that allows the Program to make site-specific 
applications with a range of rates to ensure adequate suppression. The preferred alternative 
further incorporates adaptive management by allowing treatments that may be approved in 
the future, and by including protocols for assessing the safety and efficacy of any future 
treatment when compared to currently approved treatments. 
APHIS selected Alternative 3 in the Record of Decision (ROD). However, under each alternative 
APHIS would conduct survey activities, provide technical assistance, and may make insecticide 
treatments according to the agency’s authority under the Plant Protection Act. An example of 
APHIS technical guidance is the agency’s work on IPM for the grasshopper program. IPM is 
defined as a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical 
and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health and environmental risks (7 U.S. Code

’s authority under the Plant Protection Act. An example of 
APHIS technical guidance is the agency’s work on IPM for the grasshopper program. IPM is 
defined as a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical 
and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health and environmental risks (7 U.S. Code 
136r-1). IPM for grasshoppers includes biological control, chemical control, rangeland and 
population dynamics, and decision support tools. Under all the alternatives considered in the EIS 
APHIS would continue to conduct grasshopper surveys and provide information on ways to 
manage grasshopper populations in the long-term, such as livestock grazing methods and cultural 
control by land managers. 
APHIS has funded the investigation of various IPM strategies for the grasshopper program. 
Congress established the Grasshopper Integrated Pest Management (GIPM) project to study the 
feasibility of using IPM for managing grasshoppers. The major objectives of the APHIS GIPM 
program were to: 1) manage grasshopper populations in study areas, 2) compare the effectiveness 
of an IPM program for rangeland grasshoppers with the effectiveness of a standard chemical 
control program on a regional scale, 3) determine the effectiveness of early sampling in detecting 
developing grasshopper infestations, 4) quantify short- and long-term responses of grasshopper 
populations to treatments, and 5) develop and evaluate new grasshopper suppression techniques 
that have minimal effects on non-target species (Quinn, 2000). The results for the GIPM program

The 2019 programmatic EIS provides a solid analytical foundation, but no site-specific suppression 
pesticide treatments are implemented relying entirely on the risk analysis of the EIS and ROD. The 
EIS provides the basic background information needed for the tiering of future project-specific 
analyses on rangelands in accordance with the CEQ regulations for implementing NEPA. APHIS 
instead prepares state-or site-specific EAs to address local issues before implementing suppression 
pesticide treatments. Therefore, APHIS decided to prepare an EA for Oregon to analyze more site-
specific impacts. The EA tiers to the 2019 programmatic EIS and incorporates by reference the 
carbaryl, and diflubenzuron HHERAs also published in 2019. Copies of the 2019 programmatic 
EIS and ROD are available for review at 6035 NE 78th Court, Ste 100 Portland, OR 97218. These 
documents are also available at the Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Program web site 
at www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-pests-diseases/ghmc.

grasshopper infestations within Oregon. Under this alternative, APHIS would

B. Alternatives Considered for Comparative Analysis 
1. No Suppression Program Alternative 
Under Alternative A, the No Action alternative, APHIS would not conduct a program to suppress 
grasshopper infestations within Oregon. Under this alternative, APHIS would continue to conduct 
grasshopper surveys and provide information on ways to manage grasshopper populations in the 
long-term, such as different livestock grazing methods and cultural control by farmers. Any 
suppression program would be implemented by a federal land management agency, a state 
agriculture department, a local government, or a private group or individual. 
2. Insecticide Applications utilizing Reduced Agent Area Treatments 
(RAATs) - Preferred Alternative  
Under Alternative B, the Preferred Alternative, APHIS would manage a grasshopper treatment 
program using techniques and tools discussed hereafter to suppress outbreaks. The insecticides 
available for use by APHIS include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) registered 
carbaryl (bait formulation), and diflubenzuron. These two chemicals have different modes of 
action. Carbaryl inhibits acetylcholinesterase (enzymes involved in nerve impulses). Diflubenzuron 
inhibits the formation of chitin by insects which causes weak exoskeletons. APHIS would make a 
single application per year of one of these chemicals to a treatment area using a Reduced 
Agent/Area Treatments (RAATs) methodology—described further at the University of Wyoming 
entomology department website: www.uwyo.edu/entomology/grasshoppers/raat/index.html.  
APHIS selects which insecticides and coverage

single application per year of one of these chemicals to a treatment area using a Reduced 
Agent/Area Treatments (RAATs) methodology—described further at the University of Wyoming 
entomology department website: www.uwyo.edu/entomology/grasshoppers/raat/index.html.  
APHIS selects which insecticides and coverage rates are appropriate for suppression of a particular 
grasshopper outbreak based on several biological, logistical, environmental, and economical 
criteria. The primary biological factor is the grasshopper species and the most common life stage of 
the dominant species of concern. When grasshoppers populations are mostly comprised of the first 
three instars diflubenzuron is typically selected because it is effective, economical and least 
harmful to non-target species. Diflubenzuron limits the formation of chitin in arthropod 
exoskeletons and can produce 90 to 97% grasshopper mortality in nascent populations with a 
greater percentage of early instars. If the window for the use of diflubenzuron closes, as a result of 
treatment delays, then carbaryl is the remaining control options. Circumstances where the use of 
carbaryl bait would be best are reduced because of the higher cost per acre than liquid insecticide 
formulations and that only certain species consume carbaryl insecticide when it is formulated as a

bait. Bait may be a preferred option when migratory or banding behavior allows targeted treatments

bait. Bait may be a preferred option when migratory or banding behavior allows targeted treatments 
over smaller areas, such as with clearwinged grasshopper (Camnula pellucida) and Mormon cricket 
(Anabrus simplex) species.  
RAATs strategy is effective for grasshopper suppression because the insecticide controls 
grasshoppers within treated swaths while conserving grasshopper predators and parasites in swaths 
not directly treated. RAATs can decrease the rate of insecticide applied by using lower than label 
insecticide concentrations and decreasing the deposition of insecticide applied by alternating 
treated and untreated swaths, with untreated swaths typically of equal or greater width than the 
treated swaths, as determined by various factors such as application method (air or ground) and 
target species. Combined (i.e., reduced pesticide rate and reduced coverage rate), these methods 
significantly lower the total amount of insecticide applied and application costs, while providing 
refugia for non-target invertebrates within the treatment block. Either carbaryl bait or 
diflubenzuron would be utilized at the following application rates to treated swaths for any given 
area treated (Lockwood et al., 2000, Foster et al., 2000, USDA APHIS, 2019): 
• 4.0 pounds (0.2 lbs. or 9.07 grams a.i.) per acre treated of 5% carbaryl bait; or 
• 1.0 fluid ounce (0.0156 lbs. or 7.07 grams a.i.) per acre sprayed of diflubenzuron. 
The width of the area not directly treated (untreated swaths) under RAATs methodology is not 
standardized, though a solid body of research (see below) paved the way for its

; or 
• 1.0 fluid ounce (0.0156 lbs. or 7.07 grams a.i.) per acre sprayed of diflubenzuron. 
The width of the area not directly treated (untreated swaths) under RAATs methodology is not 
standardized, though a solid body of research (see below) paved the way for its broad adoption in 
the early 2000s, and good results have been observed in a variety of sites and situations. Rather 
than suppress grasshopper populations to the greatest extent possible, the goal of this method is to 
suppress grasshopper populations to less than the economic injury level. Typically, 50% untreated 
area is the minimum target utilized for APHIS programs, while in some cases (e.g., bait 
applications by ground or applications targeting Momon cricket by air) a 2/3rds untreated (a.k.a., 
double skip-swath) or even greater have produced good results. Most of the cost savings of RAATs 
methodology comes from maximizing untreated areas, so efforts are made to do this to the best 
extent possible, which still can be relied upon to provide adequate results, from either research or 
shared experience. 
The variation in pesticide deposition resulting from following the RAATs procedures is not 
expected to result in uniformly absent chemical residues within the untreated swaths. Instead, 
swaths with maximum application rates alternate with swaths of low deposition rates. Program 
managers decided to increase the number of deposition dye card samples during 2021 to gather 
more data on actual application rates inside treatment blocks. Field personnel stationed 28 dye 
cards in a 150-foot spaced grid with four transects of seven cards. The long axis of the grid was 
oriented approximately parallel with the direction the aircraft were flying during

 low deposition rates. Program 
managers decided to increase the number of deposition dye card samples during 2021 to gather 
more data on actual application rates inside treatment blocks. Field personnel stationed 28 dye 
cards in a 150-foot spaced grid with four transects of seven cards. The long axis of the grid was 
oriented approximately parallel with the direction the aircraft were flying during the treatment. 
Unfortunately, strong winds caused pesticide drift from the flight swaths that were sprayed to the 
unsprayed swaths. Shortly after the portion of the treatment block containing the dye card grid was 
sprayed, the program managers ceased operations for the morning because wind gusts were 
measured over ten miles per hour. Figure 6 is a graph showing the pesticide concentrations on the 
dye cards as they were positioned in the grid. Despite the strong winds, the linear variation in 
deposition during an application using the RAAT method is evident. The program diflubenzuron 
application rate is 1.0 fluid ounce per acre which is equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2, approximately three 
times greater than the highest dye card concentration.

The concept of reducing the treatment area of insecticides while also applying less insecticide per 
treated acre was developed in 1995, with the first field tests of RAATs in Wyoming (Lockwood 
and Schell, 1997). Applications can be made either aerially or with ground-based equipment 
(Deneke and Keyser, 2011). Studies utilizing RAATs have shown good control (up to 85% of that 
achieved with a total area insecticide application) at a significantly lower cost and less insecticide

and with a markedly higher abundance of non-target organisms following application (Deneke and 
Keyser, 2011; Lockwood et al., 2000). Levels of control may also depend on variables such as 
body size of targeted grasshoppers, growth rate of forage, and the amount of coverage obtained by 
the spray applications (Deneke and Keyser, 2011). Control rates may also be augmented by the 
necrophilic and necrophagic behavior of grasshoppers, in which grasshoppers are attracted to 
volatile fatty acids emanating from cadavers of dead grasshoppers and move into treated swaths to 
cannibalize cadavers (Lockwood et al., 2002; Smith and Lockwood, 2003). Under optimal 
conditions, RAATs decrease control costs, as well as host plant losses and environmental effects 
(Lockwood et al., 2000; Lockwood et al., 2002). 
This methodology has been used very successfully in Oregon since the early 2000s. Focusing in on 
the past 10 years in Oregon, APHIS has protected a quarter million acres of public land through 
applications of 82.7 kg a.i. and four days duration per year, on average.

ur counties, which is less than 1/1000th 
(roughly 0.09%) of the area of these two counties (20,156 square miles). Extensive survey and 
RAAT methodology, as well as cooperative partnerships with land managers, university extension 
and local community leaders, has allowed IPM to be applied to solving landscape scale problems 
with the best ecologically and economically sound practices available, in areas where treatment 
was requested and feasible, showing a mode target reduction of 80% and sustained reduction in 
following years of survey for those protected areas.  
C. Protective Measures and Program Procedures to Avoid or Reduce 
Adverse Impacts  
The Program applies insecticides as liquid ultra-low volume (ULV) sprays or solid-based carbaryl 
baits through aerial or ground applications. Habitat diversity, topographical features, 
meteorological conditions, economic concerns, and environmental considerations all have 
important roles in choosing the best form of treatment (Foster and Onsager, 1996). Aerial 
applications are typical for treatments over large and less accessible areas. Ground applications are 
most likely to be made when treating localized grasshopper outbreaks, border protection, or spot 
treatments of precise areas.  
Compared to liquid formulations, baits are easier to direct toward the target area, are much more 
specific toward grasshoppers, act primarily through ingestion, and affect fewer non-target 
organisms (Peach et al., 1994; Foster, 1996; Latchininsky and VanDyke, 2006). The baits have a 
carrier, such as bran, that absorbs the carbaryl, making it less bioavailable, particularly in dermal 
exposures (USDA APHIS, 2015). Biodegradation of carbaryl occurs readily in soil, but there is 
moderate

 1994; Foster, 1996; Latchininsky and VanDyke, 2006). The baits have a 
carrier, such as bran, that absorbs the carbaryl, making it less bioavailable, particularly in dermal 
exposures (USDA APHIS, 2015). Biodegradation of carbaryl occurs readily in soil, but there is 
moderate potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms. This is unlikely to occur for APHIS 
application however due to program application buffers from aquatic sites as well as the lack of 
significant drift due to the large bait size used during application. 
ULV applications use lower than the conventional label rates, specifically 0.5 gallon or less per 
acre of insecticide in liquid form. Liquid applications typically produce a quicker, greater, and 
more predictable grasshopper mortality rate than bait applications (Catangui et al, 1996). 
Generally, contract costs are substantially lower for applying ULV sprays compared to 
conventional liquid application rates and bait applications because ULV sprays use less product 
(Foster and Onsager, 1996). The program avoids off target drift to protect environmentally 
sensitive areas and maintain treatment efficacy through standard protocols including program 
buffers and monitoring of wind conditions, as well as adjuvants including crop oil concentrate or 
natural oils (e.g., methylated seed oil or canola oil) which increases specific gravity and droplet 
size to further reduce drift.  
As discussed in the previous section, the RAAT strategy reduces the treatment area, the application 
rate of insecticides, or both. RAATs suppress grasshopper populations below the economic injury 
level, rather than to the greatest extent possible, keeping with the IPM principles that have 
governed the program since the 1980s. Insecticides suppress grasshoppers within treated swaths,

 discussed in the previous section, the RAAT strategy reduces the treatment area, the application 
rate of insecticides, or both. RAATs suppress grasshopper populations below the economic injury 
level, rather than to the greatest extent possible, keeping with the IPM principles that have 
governed the program since the 1980s. Insecticides suppress grasshoppers within treated swaths, 
yet RAATs reduce cost and conserve non-target biological resources (including predators and 
parasites of grasshoppers and other beneficial invertebrates) in untreated areas. 
APHIS grasshopper treatments must follow all applicable federal, state, tribal, and local laws and 
regulations regarding pesticide use, including all USEPA and state approved label instructions. 
APHIS has also implemented several measures that go beyond label instructions to protect workers 
and the environment. All aircrafts must have a positive on/off system that will prevent leaks from 
`  
Page | 28 
 
the nozzles and a positive emergency shutoff valve between the tank and the pump. Whenever 
possible, applicators must avoid aerial ferrying and turnaround routes over water bodies and 
sensitive habitats (USDA APHIS, 2013). This will reduce the risk of accidental release of 
insecticides into aquatic habitats and other sensitive habitats. Environmental monitoring and flight 
line review is conducted daily during treatments to ensure accurate applications and buffering, as 
well as appropriate pesticide specifications and rates. 
The program has procedures to limit potential movement of applied insecticides outside of the 
intended treatment area. Operationally, the accurate placement of the ULV spray insecticide is 
essential if grasshopper populations are to be suppressed efficaciously. Winds may displace the 
insecticide, and high air temperatures combined with low humidity may cause fine droplets to 
evaporate and

 has procedures to limit potential movement of applied insecticides outside of the 
intended treatment area. Operationally, the accurate placement of the ULV spray insecticide is 
essential if grasshopper populations are to be suppressed efficaciously. Winds may displace the 
insecticide, and high air temperatures combined with low humidity may cause fine droplets to 
evaporate and drift without reaching the targeted vegetation. During applications, APHIS personnel 
constantly monitor wind conditions because when steady wind speeds exceed 10 miles per hour 
(mph), or wind direction changes towards sensitive habitat treatments are suspended until 
conditions improve. Field personnel measure ground and air temperatures to check for temperature 
inversions characterized by stable air with little mixing. Temperature inversions can cause ULV 
spray droplets to remain aloft increasing the potential for off-site transport of drift.  
The program has also established treatment restriction buffers around water bodies to protect those 
features from insecticide drift and runoff. The labels for all program insecticides prohibit direct 
application to water (defined as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by seasonal streams, springs, 
wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers). APHIS maintains the following additional buffers for 
water bodies that are not designated critical habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot buffer for 
aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground sprays, and a 50-foot buffer for bait applications (USDA 
APHIS, 2013).  
GPS shapefiles showing exact treatment block boundaries and sensitive site buffers are provided to 
contracted applicators or to APHIS staff conducting treatments prior to start of operations, and 
blocks designated for treatment are inspected for unexpected sensitive sites and waterbodies to

III. Environmental Consequences 
A. Description of Affected Environment 
Chapter III identifies the affected environment where the Program will be implemented, identifies 
the types of impacts or effects that will be evaluated, and the environmental issues that will be 
studied. Each environmental issue section addresses a separate environmental resource, and 
includes background information, an evaluation of the impacts on those resources, and a 
conclusion. The alternatives are compared with the environmental consequences of the proposed 
action at the end of each issue section. Determination of significance of the impacts predicted in 
this chapter does not occur in this EA but is made by the APHIS decisionmaker and documented in 
the appropriate decision document. 
The potential suppression program areas covered in this EA fall within seven central and eastern 
Oregon counties which collectively encompass 38,408 square miles, listed in the following table:

The level III ecoregions of these counties that are conducive to grasshopper outbreaks and APHIS 
treatment may be feasible in are Columbia Plateau (10), Blue Mountains (11), and Northern Basin

Columbia Plateau (10): This is an arid sagebrush steppe and grassland, surrounded by wetter, 
mostly forested, mountainous ecoregions. This region is underlain by a thick layer of lava rock. 
Particularly in the region’s eastern portion, where precipitation is greater, deep wind-deposited 
loess soils have been extensively cultivated for wheat. 
Blue Mountains (11): This ecoregion is a complex of mountain ranges that are lower and more 
open than the neighboring Cascades and northern Rocky Mountains. Like the Cascades but unlike 

`

the Rockies, the Blue Mountains region is mostly volcanic in origin. Only its highest ranges, 
particularly the Wallowa and Elkhorn mountains, consist of intrusive rocks that rise above the 
dissected lava surface of the region. Much of this ecoregion is grazed by cattle, unlike the Cascades 
and northern Rockies. 
Northern Basin and Range (80): This ecoregion consists of dissected lava plains, rolling hills, 
alluvial fans, valleys, and scattered mountains. Mountains are more common in the eastern part. 
Overall, it is higher and cooler than the Snake River Plain and has fewer ranges than the Central 
Basin and Range. Sagebrush steppe is extensive here. Juniper dominated woodland occurs on the 
rugged stony uplands. Much of the region is used for rangeland.

Basin and Range. Sagebrush steppe is extensive here. Juniper dominated woodland occurs on the 
rugged stony uplands. Much of the region is used for rangeland.  
As described and listed in Chapter 1.A., certain level IV ecoregions do not appear to be conducive 
to grasshopper outbreaks and therefore will not be included in this EA or therefore be considered 
part of program area as regards to potentially impacting non-target species of concern. In the Blue 
Mountains ecoregion, these areas are 11c - Maritime-Influenced Zone, 11d - Melange, 11e - 
Wallowas/Seven Devils Mountains, 11h - Continental Zone Highlands, 11l - Mesic Forest Zone, 
11m - Subalpine-Alpine Zone. In the Norther Basin and Range ecoregion, these areas are 80j - 
Semiarid Uplands, 80k - Partly Forested Mountains, 80m - Barren Playas.  
APHIS in cooperation with state and university collaborators provides general information to the 
public on grasshoppers in all parts of the state, for example in 2022 a report was received from 
Mary’s Peak Botanical Special Interest Area which stated, “The grasshoppers seem to be 
decimating a robust population of Lupinus albicaulis. They, from what I can tell, are damaging the 
flowers and substantially reducing the number of seed pods and seed produced." It was identified 
by the state entomologist as Melanoplus saltator, “… a native species of grasshopper (family 
Acrididae) first described from specimens from Portland OR. M. saltator is endemic to 
Northwestern Oregon, distributed from Washington and Yamhill Counties south to Linn County in

 of seed pods and seed produced." It was identified 
by the state entomologist as Melanoplus saltator, “… a native species of grasshopper (family 
Acrididae) first described from specimens from Portland OR. M. saltator is endemic to 
Northwestern Oregon, distributed from Washington and Yamhill Counties south to Linn County in 
meadows, open woodlands and woods edges. It is one of two Oregon-endemic flightless 
grasshopper species known to occur at the top of Mary's Peak (the other is Melanoplus immunis, 
the Mary's Peak short-winged grasshopper, a smaller species).” Such outreach or response to 
inquiries is a service that the public has come to expect regardless of potential for further action.  
This EA on the other hand is attempting to focus as closely as possible to areas where treatment 
requests received may be feasible to conduct. At this time, this is primarily limited to federal, state 
or tribally managed rangeland, with the possible incorporation of adjacent private rangeland to a 
limited extent. Cropland, including Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) crops are limited by law 
to 20% of overall project area with no cost share being provided, and of course must also meet 
pesticide label requirements.  
B. Special Management Areas 
APHIS is aware there are areas that have greater scenic and environmental value within or adjacent 
to the rangeland areas considered by this EA. These areas might have remote recreational uses, 
special ecological characteristics or species that are of special concern to land management 
agencies, the public, or other groups and individuals. Many of these areas are excluded from 
grasshopper outbreak habitat and therefore from this EA, as described in Chapter 1.A. and in
Text Len: 1739
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
to the rangeland areas considered by this EA. These areas might have remote recreational uses, 
special ecological characteristics or species that are of special concern to land management 
agencies, the public, or other groups and individuals. Many of these areas are excluded from 
grasshopper outbreak habitat and therefore from this EA, as described in Chapter 1.A. and in the 
above section. For example, the Steens Mountain Wilderness and similar Semiarid Uplands (80j),  
Partly Forested Mountains (80k), as well as the Barren Playas (80m) which typify the Alvord 
Dessert have always been excluded from grasshopper treatments by way of never having 
grasshopper outbreaks ever observed. Similarly, in the Blue Mountains in particular, significant 
`  
Page | 32 
 
portions are forested and or mesic, thus have also always been excluded from grasshopper outbreak 
observations.  
In general, areas designated as wilderness areas and national parks or monuments in Oregon share 
the characteristic of not having outbreaks, or at minimum, not being sources of requests from land 
management submitted to APHIS for help with grasshoppers. Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs) 
have been excluded from treatment requests heretofore as well however this is ultimately a 
decision of the land management agency, specifically the BLM, with APHIS having not authority 
to oversee land management on their behalf. As shown in the following figure, taken from 
www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/oregon-washington, the (salmon colored) 
WSAs cover a significant portion of SE Oregon. Many of these areas correspond with special 
protection areas for Greater Sage Grouse, meaning that treatments are not generally considered in

 their behalf. As shown in the following figure, taken from 
www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/oregon-washington, the (salmon colored) 
WSAs cover a significant portion of SE Oregon. Many of these areas correspond with special 
protection areas for Greater Sage Grouse, meaning that treatments are not generally considered in 
those areas already. If treatment requests do start coming to APHIS for WSAs however, greater 
environmental analysis would be needed prior to proceeding with treatments. 
 
Figure 13. Steens Mountain Wilderness/Special Management Area, Wild Scenic Rivers, and Wilderness Study Areas of SE Oregon. 
As discussed in the Mormon Cricket section of Chapter 1.B., one possible reason why WSAs and 
areas not typically associated with grasshopper outbreaks or requests might need to be reconsidered 
in the future, would be due to expanding ranges of this highly migratory and upland habitat adapted 
species.  
Currently, program activities adjacent to WSAs may occur and be covered by this EA. (This would 
be in areas where grasshopper outbreaks coincide and are otherwise outside of Greater Sage 
Grouse or other sensitive species buffers which extend beyond WSAs.) A representative area for 
this would be along the east slope of Steens Mountain north of Mann Lake, which is an especially 
arid mixed-use rangeland that the BLM has worked to recondition but is prone to frequent 
grasshopper outbreaks due to frequent drought. Nearby survey work conducted by BLM found

expansion of Sullivan’s sulfur butterfly (Colias christina sullivani) out of the WSA and into an 
allotment which APHIS has treated three times in the past decade, indicating that program 
activities are not adversely impacting the adjacent WSA or the rare species of invertebrates in that 
general area. Indeed, since this butterfly is strongly supported by stiff pea (Lathyrus rigidus), 
suppression of herbivory by grasshopper outbreaks may theoretically be helping their population 
expansion. (Based on their detection and delimitation of this rare butterfly population BLM 
buffered the specific area in question out of their potential treatment request for the year.)

A conservation biocontrol agent of grasshoppers, the ground mantis (Litaneutria minor) can also be 
observed in this allotment where frequent treatments have occurred, as with this photo observation 
taken by APHIS personnel in July 2023, providing further evidence of generally sound ecological 
management of this mixed-use rangeland area where APHIS has recently suppressed grasshoppers 
on request from BLM more frequently than anywhere else in the state.

C. Effects Evaluated Including Cumulative Impacts 
Chapter III examines the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each of the alternatives on the 
biological, physical, and sociocultural aspects of the human environment (issues). Direct effects are 
caused by the action and occur at the same time and place (40 CFR § 1508.1(i)(1)). Indirect effects 
are caused by the action but are later in time and farther removed in distance (40 CFR § 
1508.1(i)(2)). Cumulative effects are the effects on the environment that result from the 
incremental effects of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions (40 CFR § 1508.1(i)(3)). 
Cumulative effects can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking 
place over a period of time (40 CFR § 1508.1(i)(3)).  
Cumulative impact, as defined in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA 
implementing regulations (40 CFR § 1508.1) “is the impact on the environment which results from 
the incremental impact of the action when added to the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such 

`

actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions 
taking place over a period of time.” 
Potential cumulative impacts associated with the No Action alternative where APHIS would not 
take part in any grasshopper suppression program include the continued increase in grasshopper 
populations and potential expansion of populations into neighboring range and cropland. In 
addition

 can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions 
taking place over a period of time.” 
Potential cumulative impacts associated with the No Action alternative where APHIS would not 
take part in any grasshopper suppression program include the continued increase in grasshopper 
populations and potential expansion of populations into neighboring range and cropland. In 
addition, State and private land managers could apply insecticides to manage grasshopper 
populations however, land managers may opt not to use RAATs, which would increase insecticides 
applied to the rangeland. Increased insecticide applications from the lack of coordination or 
foregoing RAATs methods could increase the exposure risk to non-target species. In addition, land 
managers may not employ the extra program measures designed to reduce exposure to the public 
and the environment to insecticides.  
Potential cumulative impacts associated with the Preferred Alternative are not expected to be 
significant because the program applies an insecticide application once during a treatment season. 
The program may treat an area with different insecticides but does not overlap the treatments. The 
program does not mix or combine insecticides. Based on historical outbreaks in the United States, 
the probability of an outbreak occurring in the same area where treatment occurred in the previous 
year is unlikely; however, given time, populations eventually may reach economically damaging 
thresholds and require treatment. Since a general outbreak started in Oregon in 2020, areas where 
sufficiently large acreage treatment occurred have seen sustained reductions in grasshoppers based 
on a single treatment. Blocks treated which were smaller or more fragmented however have seen 
some repeated requests for treatments in subsequent years. Treatment by APHIS in 2024 was 
limited due to a shortage of personnel and funding and is not expected to significantly alter 
grasshopper outbreaks on a broad scale

ly large acreage treatment occurred have seen sustained reductions in grasshoppers based 
on a single treatment. Blocks treated which were smaller or more fragmented however have seen 
some repeated requests for treatments in subsequent years. Treatment by APHIS in 2024 was 
limited due to a shortage of personnel and funding and is not expected to significantly alter 
grasshopper outbreaks on a broad scale in coming years on its own.  The Preferred Alternative 
insecticide application reduces the insect population down to levels that cause an acceptable level 
of economic damage. The duration of treatment activity, which is relatively short since it is a one-
time application, and the lack of repeated treatments in the same area in the same year reduce the 
possibility of significant cumulative impacts. 
The insecticides proposed for use in the grasshopper program are not anticipated to persist in the 
environment or bioaccumulate. Therefore, a grasshopper outbreak that occurs in an area previously 
treated for grasshoppers is unlikely to cause an accumulation of insecticides from previous program 
treatments. For a second time in recent years, the Oregon legislature provided enhanced funding to 
private land managers to conduct subsidized treatments in certain counties for the control of 
grasshoppers. No information on how widespread this program was utilized is available, despite 
requests for it made by APHIS, and it is unclear how this alters the continued outbreak observed in 
many parts of the state in previous years or currently. For federal land managers however, these 
funds and potential treatments were not applicable. Having no treatments overlap in location, or 
nearly any being made on federal land by APHIS in 2024, make cumulative impacts from private 
treatments last year also unlikely.

The 2002 EIS Appendix B, Environmental Risk Assessment for Rangeland Grasshopper 
Suppression Program—Insecticides, analyzed effects of various insecticide formulations and 
treatment rates in detail and found minimal negative impacts of any kind for either carbaryl bait or 
diflubenzuron. Cumulative and synergistic effects were also analyzed and found to be minimal or 
non-existent for these. “Diflubenzuron is only reported to be synergistic with defoliant DEF (NLM, 
1988)” (page 134). Def is a defoliant registered for use in cotton crops, which are not grown in

Wieben, 2019 estimates annual agricultural pesticide use by major crop (or crop group) for states 
of the conterminous United States from 1992-2017. The most recent 10-year dataset, 2008-2017, 
establishes general trends for pesticide use by crop in Oregon which are comparable to the recent 
10-year dataset summarizing program chemical use. Estimates specific to the two program 
chemicals are also captured here, though formulations and county level spatial data, are not 
specified.  
In total for the decade, an estimated 76,713,875 kg of pesticides were applied, an average of 
767,139 kg per year. 84% of the estimate was applied to Vegetables & Fruit crops (61%) and 
Orchard & Grape crops (23%). All other crop groups (Wheat, Pasture & Hay, Alfalfa, Corn, and 
Other) received the estimated remainder of 16%.

done, up to 20% of a project may include crops, with no cost share provided. Private rangeland or

The 2022 agricultural census (www.nass.usda.gov) estimates that 42% of acreage harvested for hay 
in Oregon occurred in the seven counties considered in this EA, and were the largest crop in terms 
of land use in the state overall, utilizing 5.8% of the 15.3 million acres of operational farmland. 
(This estimate does not include any acreage for pasture or rangeland.) The next largest commodity 
by harvested acreage statewide was wheat at 4.7%, followed by corn, hazelnuts, and potatoes (with

(This estimate does not include any acreage for pasture or rangeland.) The next largest commodity 
by harvested acreage statewide was wheat at 4.7%, followed by corn, hazelnuts, and potatoes (with 
none greater than 0.6%). In sum, Hay & Pasture crops have a larger geographical size than all other 
agricultural operations in the state, require less than a tenth of agricultural pesticides and no routine 
insecticides at all. 
Management of rangeland varies much more than any agricultural lands, even pasture, however as 
with pasture, weeds are generally considered the leading pests of concern. Invasive grasses are the 
leading pest in rangeland in Oregon, according to the Oregon SageCon Dashboard with 4.1 million 
acres impaired, and 1.1 million acres treated to address invasive plants, as of 2021 
(oe.oregonexplorer.info/externalcontent/sagecon/SageCon_Dashboard.pdf). Though not tracked as 
closely as agricultural statistics, the SageCon partnership clearly sees invasive weeds as a primary 
pest to rangeland, worth treating, especially for their mission of supporting functional sagebrush 
rangeland, summarized on their website as follows: “In 2012, the Oregon Sage-grouse 
Conservation Partnership (SageCon) was convened at the request of the Governor’s office to 
formulate an ‘all lands, all threats’ approach to sage-grouse conservation.” Many noxious weed 
species thrive in arid conditions, increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfire and out 
competing native and more ecologically beneficial species, making their management a priority in 
rangelands. With some notable exceptions such as classical biocontrol agents that specialize in

feeding on a handful of exotic noxious weeds, few if any options besides herbicide are typically 
feasible for treatment of these pests on rangeland. It can be expected therefor that projects utilizing 
herbicide will be occurring on both private and public rangeland, including potential program 
treatment. No cumulative or synergistic effects are anticipated to result from herbicide in general, 
including on rangeland. 
Aside from intermittent requests to APHIS to treat grasshopper outbreaks, insecticide applications, 
especially on public rangeland, are not documented or anticipated. They are also expected to be 
very rare on private rangeland, with little upside benefit to treatments to be found outside of 
grasshopper outbreaks, even in the higher production Hay & Pasture crops, as reflected by the lack 
of insecticide applications to be found in Wieben, C.M, 2019. 
Looking specifically at the pesticides considered in this EA, Wieben, C.M., 2019 show 
diflubenzuron to be generally uncommon, with only three years of treatments estimated in whole 
the decade, all in Orchard & Grape crops, for 1,253 kg total, an average of 125 kg per year across 
the entire state. Based on this limited use and lack of geographic overlap, no cumulative effects are 
anticipated from this agricultural use.

Carbaryl is a faster acting and broader spectrum insecticide, especially in the liquid form that is 
primarily used, and is not a restricted-use pesticide like diflubenzuron, so no special applicator 
license is necessarily required. As expected, it was more widely and consistently used, however 
none was estimated to have occurred in Pasture & Hay crops. Orchards & Grapes made up 71% of 
usage and was the most consistent use over the decade. Vegetable & Fruit crops showed the 2nd 
highest and most consistent usage rates, though a trend of decreased use in the 2nd half of the 
decade is evident. Alfalfa crop usage varied the most, averaging almost the same application rate 
per year over the decade as Vegetable & Fruit crops, despite only being recorded in three years, 
with a massive single year spike recorded in 2009. Other crops (e.g., small grains or legumes) 
showed very slight usage estimates, and zero usage in eight years of the 10 years.

Since no estimates on non-agricultural use were available, and carbaryl is a popular option 
available to home gardeners, it can be assumed that residences, gardeners, and possibly municipal 
green spaces, near potential APHIS treatment areas may be treated with this pesticide. Given the 
Restricted Use Pesticide labeling of Diflubenzuron, public use of that pesticide is less likely.  
Cumulative effects from organophosphate pesticides in Oregon is also a potential concern, since 10 
pesticides of this type occurs in the 10-year data, though again, none for Pasture & Hay. 
Table 8. Estimated Kilograms of Organophosphate Pesticide Applied in Oregon per Crop, 2008-2017 
 
Alfalfa shows a consistent use of these insecticides, as do most other crops. Other sources of these 
pesticides in the environment may be from municipal mosquito abatement programs. Given the 
program formulation of bait only1, the lack of geographic overlap with any of the above treatments, 
and the infrequency of APHIS treatments, the additive effects of carbaryl resulting from the 
program remain insignificant, even though organophosphate use in the greater environment 
continues to be a popular option for agricultural pest and mosquito suppression. 
Based on the above analysis of Wieben, C.M., 2019, which is the best currently available for this 
purpose, there is no reason in evidence that cumulative impacts from the program would occur, 
given the low use of program insecticides in overall, and the lack of geographic or crop usage

purpose, there is no reason in evidence that cumulative impacts from the program would occur, 
given the low use of program insecticides in overall, and the lack of geographic or crop usage 
overlap that is discernable. 
For many years however, APHIS and ODA have provided the interested public with information 
on program pesticides, timing and preferred application methods (i.e., RAATs), so it is likely that 
increases in use of these methods have occurred in areas impacted by pestiferous grasshopper 
outbreaks, which is not adequately captured by these data. ODA in particular has responded to 
public pressure to provide funding mechanisms through the Oregon legislature to aid private 
 
1 2002 EIS Appendix B (page 160) notes that in comparison to liquid carbaryl: “Carbaryl incorporated into bran flakes 
or other solid media acts only upon ingestion by the organism and is considered to be more selective and 
environmentally benign than other chemical control means (Peach et al., 1994). This suppression method may offer a 
viable alternative when grasshopper treatment is required in close proximity to endangered and threatened species, 
water bodies, or other sensitive sites.”

growers impacted by grasshoppers. APHIS will continue to evaluate this source of application data 
as it becomes available. 
Potential cumulative impacts resulting from the use of pesticides include insecticide resistance, 
synergistic chemical effects, chemical persistence and bioaccumulation in the environment. The 
program use of reduced insecticide application rates (i.e. ULV and RAATs) are expected to 
mitigate the development of insect resistance to the insecticides. Grasshopper outbreaks in the 
United States occur cyclically so applications do not occur to the same population over time further 
eliminating the selection pressure that increases the chances of insecticide resistance. 
The insecticides proposed for use in the program have a variety of agricultural and non-agricultural 
uses. There may be an increased use of these insecticides in an area under suppression when 
private, State, or Federal entities make applications to control other pests. However, the vast 
majority of the land where program treatments occur is uncultivated rangeland and additional 
treatments by landowners or managers are very uncommon making possible cumulative or 
synergistic chemical effects extremely unlikely.  
APHIS has prepared this EA for Oregon because treatments could be requested if grasshopper 
populations reach outbreak levels. Past experience and continuing/cyclical grasshopper outbreaks 
impacting rangeland health and agricultural producers, as well as possibility of exacerbating 
drought conditions lead APHIS to believe treatments will be needed in the near future

APHIS has prepared this EA for Oregon because treatments could be requested if grasshopper 
populations reach outbreak levels. Past experience and continuing/cyclical grasshopper outbreaks 
impacting rangeland health and agricultural producers, as well as possibility of exacerbating 
drought conditions lead APHIS to believe treatments will be needed in the near future. 
Unfortunately, the agency can’t accurately predict exact treatment locations and usually discovers 
building grasshopper populations only a few weeks in advance. Additionally, requested treatments 
may be cancelled or change location if land manager priorities and policies shift, APHIS funding 
and staffing is too limited, or higher priority work emerge. Thunderstorms, heat waves or wildfires 
may also make areas inaccessible or delay treatments past the optimal window. 
As summarized in Chapter II.A., all treatments in the past 10 years have occurred on BLM 
rangeland in Harney and Malheur counties. Tentative requests were received from Lake and Baker 
counties for BLM rangeland also, but to date no viable project areas have emerged, primarily due 
to buffers for Greater Sage Grouse or ESA fish critical habitat occurring in the same areas as high 
grasshopper populations. The BLM continues to look at mixed use rangeland locations they 
manage that do not have such limitations (or other special designations) where grasshoppers 
outbreaks have occurred historically, tentatively requesting ongoing assistance with the 
grasshopper upcycle identified starting in 2020, as well as progressive migration of Mormon 
crickets from Idaho and Nevada. Based on spring survey results, they may finalize treatment

areas that have been retreated by APHIS in the past decade to date aside from very arid areas on the 
east slope of Steens Mountain, with most seeing sustained reductions from a single treatment.  
D. Site Specific Considerations and Environmental Issues  
Environmental issues are the resources that may be affected by the proposal, or concerns about the 
risks to humans from implementing the Program. The following issues are analyzed in Section E. 
Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives in the order outlined. 
1. Human Health 
Direct exposure to program chemicals because of suppression treatments is unlikely due to the 
infrequency of treatments and the general lack of humans in treatment areas. In addition, program 
`  
Page | 40 
 
buffers and procedures further reduce the chances of human exposure. Finally, pesticide label 
specifications, standard spill prevention and rapid response measures mitigate the risk of accidental 
human exposure resulting from program activities. 
As summarized in Table 4, approximately 196,529 people live in the seven counties covered by 
this EA which have an area of 38,408 square miles, creating an average population density of 5.1 
persons per square mile overall. Program suppression activities are conducted on rangelands that 
are far more sparsely inhabited however, typically with few or no people present or in residence. 
Most habitation in rangeland areas is comprised of singular houses, but some rangeland areas may 
have denser areas of

, creating an average population density of 5.1 
persons per square mile overall. Program suppression activities are conducted on rangelands that 
are far more sparsely inhabited however, typically with few or no people present or in residence. 
Most habitation in rangeland areas is comprised of singular houses, but some rangeland areas may 
have denser areas of habitation nearby. Such areas are treated as sensitive sites, and provided 
programmatic buffers and notification of treatment activities is provided to residents in advance of 
nearby treatments. A buffer of 1.25 miles from the treatment area to the perimeter of any town and 
other communities will be used. Ranch buildings and structures (such as stock tanks) will have a 
buffer of 200 feet. Federal highways and State roads will have a buffer of 25 feet. Local law 
enforcement, fire departments emergency medical services, hospitals and tribal agencies will be 
notified prior to any treatment as an advisory to access any safety risk, the treatment date and 
location and contact personnel.  
Recreationists are sometimes present on rangelands receiving program treatment, though this is 
very uncommon. Recreationists may theoretically use rangelands in question for hiking, camping, 
bird watching, hunting, rock hunting, or other uses, and ranchers may work be at work. Individuals 
with allergic or hypersensitive reactions to insecticides may live near or may utilize rangelands in 
the proposed suppression program area also, in theory. Some rural schools may be in areas near 
treatment blocks but not observed to date and would be buffered. To date, no recreationists have 
been observed in or near treatment blocks in Oregon (aside from driving past on buffered roads 
inside vehicles) outside of a BLM campground at Mann Lake, which was buffered. Notice is 
routinely provided to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Some rural schools may be in areas near 
treatment blocks but not observed to date and would be buffered. To date, no recreationists have 
been observed in or near treatment blocks in Oregon (aside from driving past on buffered roads 
inside vehicles) outside of a BLM campground at Mann Lake, which was buffered. Notice is 
routinely provided to any recreationist found in areas of treatment, to limit their announce or 
potential exposure to program chemicals, and applicators are advised to avoid direct treatment of 
people, vehicles or buildings unexpected encountered.  
Those most at risk during operations would be persons mixing or applying chemicals. Adherence to 
pesticide label recommendations is therefore mandatory, and APHIS employees receive annual 
health screening to monitor for harmful pesticide exposure. The 2019 EIS contains detailed hazard, 
exposure, and risk analyses for the chemicals available to APHIS. Impacts to workers and the 
general public were analyzed for all possible routes of exposure (dermal, oral, inhalation) under a 
range of conditions designed to overestimate risk. The operational procedures and spraying 
conditions examined in those analyses conform to those expected for operations. Direct exposure to 
program chemicals because of suppression treatments is unlikely due to the infrequency of 
treatments and the general lack of humans in treatment areas. In addition, program buffers and 
procedures further reduce the chances of human exposure. Finally, pesticide label specifications, 
standard spill prevention and rapid response measures mitigate the risk of accidental human 
exposure resulting from program activities. Potential exposures to the public from conventional 
application rates are infrequent and of low magnitude. The RAATs approach reduces this potential 
even further by using reduced rates and less actual directly treated area. The proposed program 
should benefit human and environmental health by reducing the risk of insect annoyance

 prevention and rapid response measures mitigate the risk of accidental human 
exposure resulting from program activities. Potential exposures to the public from conventional 
application rates are infrequent and of low magnitude. The RAATs approach reduces this potential 
even further by using reduced rates and less actual directly treated area. The proposed program 
should benefit human and environmental health by reducing the risk of insect annoyance, blowing 
dust, higher light reflection and higher temperature on the semi-arid land surface.  
Various compounds are released in smoke during wildland fires, including carbon monoxide (CO), 
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, aerosols, polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons contained within fine particulate matter (a byproduct of the combustion of organic 
`  
Page | 41 
 
matter such as wood), aldehydes, and most notably formaldehyde produced from the incomplete 
combustion of burning biomass (Reisen and Brown, 2009; Burling et al., 2010; Broyles, 2013). 
Particulate matter, CO, benzene, acrolein, and formaldehyde have been identified as compounds of 
particular concern in wildland fire smoke (Reinhardt and Ottmar, 2004). Many of the naturally 
occurring products associated with combustion from wildfires may also be present because of 
combustion of program insecticides that are applied to rangeland. These combustion byproducts 
will be at lower quantities due to the short half-lives of most of the program insecticides and their 
low use rates. Other minor combustion products specific to each insecticide may also be present 
because of combustion from a rangeland fire but these are typically less toxic based on available 
human health data. The safety data sheet for each insecticide identifies these combustion products

 to the short half-lives of most of the program insecticides and their 
low use rates. Other minor combustion products specific to each insecticide may also be present 
because of combustion from a rangeland fire but these are typically less toxic based on available 
human health data. The safety data sheet for each insecticide identifies these combustion products 
as well as recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) which is equal to what 
typically is used in fighting wildfires. Material applied in the field will be at a much lower 
concentration than what would occur in a fire involving a concentrated formulation. Therefore, the 
PPE worn by rangeland firefighters would also be protective of any additional exposure resulting 
from the burning of residual insecticides. 
2. Nontarget Species 
a) Ecological Summary 
While the program conducts grasshopper control treatments any other species affected by the 
insecticides can be viewed as non-target effects or unintentional take. The program has established 
and follows procedures to prevent take of species federally listed under the Endangered Species 
Act as endangered or threatened. The programmatic protection measures that resulted from 
consultation with the USFWS also prevent take of state listed species (sensitive species or species 
of concern) in the same habitats or having similar ecological (i.e., the relationship between species 
and their environment) niches as federal listed species. These procedures (e.g., no-spray buffers, 
RAATs, insecticide choices) also limit effects on pollinators (e.g., butterflies, moths, bees) and 
other beneficial insects. 
Grasslands, open forest, shrublands and associated seasonal wetlands, typically below 6,000 feet 
elevation, are most likely to host outbreaks of grasshoppers and potentially be targeted for 
suppression

ATs, insecticide choices) also limit effects on pollinators (e.g., butterflies, moths, bees) and 
other beneficial insects. 
Grasslands, open forest, shrublands and associated seasonal wetlands, typically below 6,000 feet 
elevation, are most likely to host outbreaks of grasshoppers and potentially be targeted for 
suppression programs in Oregon. Collectively, these lands host abundant and diverse terrestrial and 
aquatic organisms. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter III.A, to be viable requests to APHIS 
for grasshopper treatments in Oregon, federally managed lands that do not have other restrictions 
as designated by the land managers such as Wilderness Area/Wilderness Study Area or in 
consultation with governmental wildlife services, such as sensitive species restriction need to be 
the foundation of any project. Croplands also host grasshopper outbreaks, however these can have 
only a very limited role in any program treatments, if any. 
APHIS has ongoing consultation with jurisdictional wildlife management agencies on grasshopper 
programs, both nationally and more focused as shown in Table 5 for Oregon, and further described 
in Appendix C. Species consultation, determinations and mitigations, are summarized for all 82 
species considered in 2025 and available on request as described in Appendix C.

PA requires agencies to use “high-quality information, including reliable data and resources, 
models, and Indigenous Knowledge. Agencies may rely on existing information as well as 
information obtained to inform the analysis. Agencies may use any reliable data sources, such as 
remotely gathered information or statistical models. Agencies shall explain any relevant 
assumptions or limitations of the information, or the particular model or methodology selected for 
use.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6(b).  
Estimating nontarget species population sizes over large areas can be extremely difficult, labor 
intensive, and expensive. State and federal wildlife management agencies have limited resources to 
conduct flora and fauna population surveys and monitor trends. States may monitor the status of 
wildlife populations by assessing sex ratios and age distribution. Plant species surveys often 
identify historical or potential habitat locations. In accordance with CEQ regulations and to 
preserve the professional and scientific integrity of the analysis, this EA uses reliable existing data

The program has suppressed grasshopper populations on at most about a tenth of one percent of the 
area of the seven counties considered by this EA in any given year. As shown in Chapter II.A., 
11,676 acres on average per year were treated in the past decade, out of 24,581,120 acres in the 
seven counties, or 0.0475%; while in the largest treatment year, 33,792 acres were treated or 
0.137%. Within blocks protected through treatments, substantial portions are excluded from direct 
insecticide applications because of buffers around sensitive sites and the alternating spray and skip 
swaths inherent in the RAATs method. In sum, the potential impacts from the program activities on 
nontarget species populations occur in a small portion of the area considered by this EA and for a 
limited duration (happening once per 1-3 years at most, usually just once in a decade or longer). 
According to USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), rangelands comprise about 
30% of the entire land cover of the United States, totaling about 770 million acres. These lands are 
described by the NRCS as lands on which the indigenous vegetation is predominately grasses, 
grass-like plants, forbs, and possibly shrubs or dispersed trees, containing plant communities of 
either native or introduced plants. Grasslands, open forest, shrublands and associated wetlands are 
most likely to host outbreaks of grasshoppers and be targeted for suppression programs. These 
lands host abundant and diverse terrestrial and aquatic organisms.

b) Invertebrates 
Biodiversity of invertebrate organisms is generally recognized as crucial for overall ecosystem 
health in natural environments. In addition to the benefits of general biodiversity, specific groups 
of beneficial invertebrates are identified as providing important ecological services. Biological 
control organisms (species that feed on and help control pests) and pollinators (species that 
pollinate flowering plants) in particular help control pests and provide pollination services which 
are crucial to sustaining diverse ecosystems, while predatory arthropods (carnivores including 
insects, arachnids, and chilopods such as centipedes) help to regulate herbivorous populations and 
maintain balanced food-webs generally. Overuse of broad-spectrum pesticides and other artificial 
disturbances can disrupt the herbivore control and pollination services which populations of 
beneficial invertebrates provide. IPM is largely the practical science of creating the least disruption 
to invertebrate communities, while reducing the population of target pest(s), to prevent larger 
ecological problems from artificial imbalance in these communities. For crop producers this may 
mean preventing a ‘flush’ of very difficult to control pestiferous mites, or the costly replacement of 
honeybees, resulting from overuse of pesticides which broadly impact insects, such as 
organophosphates. For stewards of natural resources, IPM is also crucial for maintaining an overall 
balance of invertebrate biodiversity, not due to cost calculations, but as a primary goal of 
grasshopper outbreak suppression efforts. Currently, the pesticides considered for this program are 
very specific in terms of mode of uptake, requiring ingestion to be effective, which is only likely to

. For stewards of natural resources, IPM is also crucial for maintaining an overall 
balance of invertebrate biodiversity, not due to cost calculations, but as a primary goal of 
grasshopper outbreak suppression efforts. Currently, the pesticides considered for this program are 
very specific in terms of mode of uptake, requiring ingestion to be effective, which is only likely to 
occur from a small subset of invertebrates and most especially, grasshoppers (as discussed further 
in part E. of this chapter, Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives). 
In public comments, concern is often raised about impacts on beneficial invertebrates from blanket, 
broad-spectrum insecticide applications, which have been found to result in significant mortality of 
beneficial invertebrates, including those with the greatest potential to help regulate grasshopper 
populations over the long term (Branson et al 2006). This EA does not consider using such 
methods. An important body of research investigated how methods and materials which were

previously used to control grasshopper outbreaks on rangelands, such as blanket, broad-spectrum 
insecticide applications, were unsustainable and counterproductive. Similar and supporting 
research developed the IPM techniques currently preferred for control of grasshopper outbreaks in 
Oregon, being both ecologically and economically far superior to those known to science 
previously. The USDA Grasshopper IPM User Handbook (https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-

promotes and helps to summarize these IPM resources to land-managers seeking guidance on this 
topic. There are challenges with these resources being taken out of context, oversimplified or 
blatantly misrepresented, however, especially as relates to the topic of biological control of 
grasshoppers.  
Biological pest control is a broad topic that is studied and presented in great detail in these 
resources, and for good reason since it is a cornerstone of any ecological pest control methodology. 
Rarely however is biological control ever a stand-alone alternative to all other control methods. 
Indeed, that would arguably take away from the concept of ‘integrated’ potentially as much as 
relying only on insecticide treatments alone. Specifically as relates to controlling grasshopper 
outbreaks, biological controls typically become saturated and decrease in effectiveness during pest 
outbreaks. This is one of the findings in the USDA Grasshopper IPM User Handbook, including in

VII.14 Grasshopper Population Regulation 
(www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/30320505/grasshopper/Extras/PDFs/IPM%20Handbook/VII14.
pdf). This study aims to describe relationships between available food, weather, and abundance of 
natural enemies, as ecological factors contributing to the regulation of grasshopper populations. 
Public comments citing this study as indicating that grasshopper populations have a high potential 
for being limited by natural enemies. While this is generally presented in the study as a sort of 
ecological first principle, equated in the text to how wolves have a strong potential to regulate deer, 
it is not the conclusion of the study generally. It does not draw any overarching conclusion as to the 
effectiveness of biological control on known outbreaks of grasshoppers. Rather it attempts to 
describe specific instances where survey of grasshopper populations may not be necessary due to 
limiting factors including biological control, weather, and food availability.  
Biological control, specifically conservation biological control (which is the encouragement of 
endemic natural enemies to control a pest species) is generally recognized as an important factor in 
the eventual regulation of outbreaks, particularly as caused by disease when combined with 
difficult weather and food scarcity conditions, and is utilized broadly by default, since insecticide

the methods and materials of the program fully support conservation biocontrol (including limiting 
when treatments occur based on survey results, providing non-treated swaths with RAATs, and 
selecting softer pesticides which do not kill a broad spectrum of invertebrates on contact). 
Conservation biological control agents which help to control grasshopper pests in the Western US

developed for GIPM that are utilized by APHIS and transferred to landmanagers in direct 
consultation and public meetings, support populations of these ‘beneficials’ to help prevent future 
outbreaks and improve rangeland ecosystem health and productivity.

effectively, though it remains an area of study, see Table 4. For example, organic formulations of

Possibly of even greater than concern for maintaining populations of biocontrols, may be that for 
pollinators, especially bees. Based on current available scientific research, there is a decrease in 
quantity of pollinators across the country and in rangeland ecosystems. However, the extent of 
program insecticide's role in this decrease is not clear. Existing research serves to outline the 
impact of these pesticides on pollinators of the order Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera primarily but

also delves into pollinators of other orders to a lesser extent.  
The availability of native floral resources is a primary determinant of the composition and 
abundance of bees and other pollinators in rangeland ecosystems in the United States (Potts et al. 
2003, Gilgert and Vaughan 2011, Tuell et al, 2014). Approximately 4,000 different bee species aid 
in pollination in the United States (Black et al, 2011, Gilgert and Vaughan 2011). Many secondary 
pollinators such as moths and butterflies, wasps, flies, and beetles also contribute to distributing 
pollen despite being less efficient than bees (Larson et al, 2018).  
A
ccording to Goosey et al., rangeland ecosystems are primarily pollinated by bee species. At 27 
pastures in central Montana specimens from 27, 24, and 16 different bee genera were captured 
during 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Lasioglossum (Dialictus), Agapostemon, and Eucera 
were the most common genera captured constituting more than half (58%) of bee specimens. 
Halictus was the fourth most common genera, adding another 7% to the total bee capture. In 2016, 
secondary pollinators were ~8% of total pollinator catch. Lepidopterans were 10-fold more 
abundant than Syrphidae as sec-ond
ary pollinators across all years. Secondary pollinators were 
19% and 13% of the total catch in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

urthermore, the researchers found in 2016 and 2017 bee abundance increased where periodic 
grazing of pastures provided suitable nesting habitat for these rangeland pollinators. They 
suggested forage consumption and hoof action likely created the unvegetated space required for 
reproduction by these mostly solitary, ground-nesting bees.  However, abundances of secondary 
pollinators (i.e., butterflies and hover flies) were unrelated to grazing during two of the three study 
years. According to Gilgert and Vaughan, the diverse plant landscapes that rangelands are 
composed meet the needs of a variety of pollinators, including Hymenopterans and Lepidopterans. 
Idling large swaths of rangelands could be detrimental to bee populations because most ground-
nesting species exhibit breeding-site fidelity, with multiple generations returning to nest in the 
same pasture (Michener 2007). 
The Xerces society promotes a symbiotic relationship between pollinators and rangelands, with 
each benefitting from the others existence (Buxton et al.). Noting rangelands provide large 
contiguous areas of food and shelter habitat for pollinators. Likewise, the pollination of a wide 
array of wildflowers produces valuable forage for cattle and wildlife, supports soil health, and 
makes grasslands more resilient. Information about rangeland pollinators species is generally 
limited, with most of it coming from “uncoordinated, short-term, small-scale sampling focusing on

 and shelter habitat for pollinators. Likewise, the pollination of a wide 
array of wildflowers produces valuable forage for cattle and wildlife, supports soil health, and 
makes grasslands more resilient. Information about rangeland pollinators species is generally 
limited, with most of it coming from “uncoordinated, short-term, small-scale sampling focusing on 
bees and butterflies” (Hanberry et al). Though this information is limited, studies on bees of the 
Great Plains indicate that about two-thirds of the bee species in rangelands are generalists, which 
use many families of plants for nectar and nesting. With this information about generalist nature of 
bees in rangelands, and the increased biodiversity caused by grazing, pollinators of the rangelands 
`

are very likely widespread in both species and location, which can increase their resiliency to 
disturbances.  
Therefore, pesticides applications will also potentially impact a much more abundant and rich 
collection of pollinators due to the unique qualities of rangeland habitats. Additionally, the 
presence of agrochemicals and other pesticides have been found in samples of bee tissue from the 
Great Plains, likely due to the conversion of land from pollinator friendly rangeland to crop fields 
(Hladik et al 2016, Otto et al 2016). In Oregon rangeland, treatments could affect these abundant 
and species rich areas, but nearby untreated areas will allow recolonization if so.  
According to a sampling of native bee communities across broad Canadian ecoregions Kohler et al 
2020, found climate and geographic variables caused differences in species abundance, richness, 
and composition, indicating that assessments on impacts may not be generalizable across the entire 
rangeland ecosystem. The researchers

According to a sampling of native bee communities across broad Canadian ecoregions Kohler et al 
2020, found climate and geographic variables caused differences in species abundance, richness, 
and composition, indicating that assessments on impacts may not be generalizable across the entire 
rangeland ecosystem. The researchers found bee community composition was significantly 
different across regions (i.e., Canadian grassland, parkland and boreal areas) and between land use 
types (i.e., rangeland and canola cropland). Within rangeland communities it may be difficult to 
understand the best conservation measures for bees due to the variance in responses on a larger 
scale. 
Pollinators in Oregon include economically important managed exotic species such as European 
honeybee and alfalfa leafcutting bee, and a vast diversity of native species, including many kinds of 
solitary and eusocial bees. Additional pollinators include wasps and ants, flies, hoverflies and bee-
mimicking flies, many families of beetles, true bugs, moths and butterflies, as well as vertebrate 
pollinators. All pollinators are considered non-target species requiring consideration and protection 
from treatment program impacts, but a large and particularly diverse group of pollinators that 
deserve special attention are native bees. The Oregon Bee Atlas project 
(extension.oregonstate.edu/bee-atlas) funded in part by the USDA, has documented 
approximately 750 species of bees native to Oregon, most of which occur in the more arid parts of 
the state, especially in wilderness areas and areas with diverse floral nectaries. This cooperative

the state, especially in wilderness areas and areas with diverse floral nectaries. This cooperative 
public science project has significantly clarified relationships between bee species and the host 
plants from which they gather nectar and pollen and help to pollinate and reproduce sexually in the 
process. Some species of insects are obligate pollinators of rare plants, meaning the plants cannot 
reproduce without them, and such relationships are helping to be clarified by the project.  
Other ecological services which both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates provide are less obvious 
but equally important, including nutrient cycling, decomposition and stimulating plant regrowth. 
Many species of herbivorous and omnivorous arthropods including a great diversity of 
grasshoppers are in this general category. Finally, as described already, parasitic and predacious 
invertebrates (e.g. arachnids, mantids, and dragonflies) help regulate herbivores while also 
providing food to larger animals. Invertebrates in general are incredibly important to ecosystem 
health and provide quantitatively the greatest animal biodiversity within these ecosystems.  
Two specific non-target invertebrate species of potential concern, which have been previously 
identified in public scoping for the program, are Leona’s little blue butterfly (Philotiella leona) and 
the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The monarch butterfly may potentially be found 
throughout Oregon and is proposed for ESA status. In contrast, the Leona’s little blue butterfly is

the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The monarch butterfly may potentially be found 
throughout Oregon and is proposed for ESA status. In contrast, the Leona’s little blue butterfly is 
only documented in certain areas of Klamath County, particularly near the Upper Klamath Marsh 
National Wildlife Refuge. A request for program treatment in Klamath county by federal land 
managers has not been directed to APHIS since 2013. Subsequent Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
listings have resulted in a lack of federally managed rangeland in the county that does not also have 
`  
Page | 49 
 
an abundance of ESA protected species and critical habitat (see figure 5). For these reasons, 
Klamath County is no longer included in this EA. The program will not have any impact on this 
butterfly therefore, except as described in the No Suppression Program Alternative section of this 
EA (IV.A.1.), in that the absence of an APHIS run program may result in neighboring private 
landowners using more and stronger pesticides, which could potentially impact this species 
negatively.

c) Vertebrates 
Though less directly at risk from many modern pesticides targeting insects, including both 
considered in this EA, many other non-target species occur in areas prone to grasshopper outbreaks 
and potential treatments. Vertebrates occurring in rangelands of Oregon include introduced 
livestock and pets (e.g. cows, goats, sheep, horses, poultry, cats, dogs) and native species including 
carnivores (e.g. coyotes, foxes, wolves, cougars), large herbivorous mammals (

and potential treatments. Vertebrates occurring in rangelands of Oregon include introduced 
livestock and pets (e.g. cows, goats, sheep, horses, poultry, cats, dogs) and native species including 
carnivores (e.g. coyotes, foxes, wolves, cougars), large herbivorous mammals (e.g. deer, elk, 
pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep), smaller ones (e.g. rabbits, gophers), omnivores (e.g. badgers, 
mice, bats). Various reptiles, amphibians and fish are also present.  
Birds comprise a large portion of the vertebrate species complex, and they also include exotic and 
native species. Some exotic game birds, like pheasant and partridge, have been deliberately 
introduced into the area, and other species such as starlings and pigeons have expanded into the 
area. Sage obligate bird species, typified by sage-grouse, are potentially present in much of eastern

Oregon rangeland. Herbivorous vertebrate species may compete with some species of grasshoppers 
for forage, while omnivorous and predacious species can utilize grasshoppers and other insects as 
an important food source. There is special concern about the role of grasshoppers as a food source 
for sage-grouse, sharp-tail grouse, and other bird species. Given program methods and materials, 
impacts on vertebrate species are expected to be minimal, as described in greater detail in various 
parts of the Environmental Consequences Chapter.

 sharp-tail grouse, and other bird species. Given program methods and materials, 
impacts on vertebrate species are expected to be minimal, as described in greater detail in various 
parts of the Environmental Consequences Chapter.  
d) Flora 
A diverse community of terrestrial plants also occur in potential program areas. Non-native plants, 
including invasive weeds such as annual grasses (e.g. cheat grass, venenata), annual forbs (e.g. 
diffuse knapweed, Scotch thistle, yellow starthistle), perennial forbs (e.g. Canada thistle, Russian 
thistle, leafy spurge, white top), and woody plants (e.g. Russian olive, tamarisk) are common in 
areas prone to grasshopper outbreaks and may help to support these populations (see Photos 4 & 5, 
and discussion in part II.B. Description of Grasshopper Species). Land managers can help limit 
future outbreaks by controlling invasive weeds on their property, in some cases, but not always, as 
discussed in part III.b. Description of Grasshopper Species. 
A great diversity of native plants (e.g. sagebrush, bitterbrush, numerous grasses and forbs) are 
endemic to eastern Oregon rangeland. Rare flowering plants may also occur in or near areas where 
treatments are requested. As with buffering of other rare species, this is a collaborative 
responsibility of the land manager, APHIS, and wildlife management agencies, to identify and 
buffer out plants species as dictated by applicable policy or preference from treatment requests 
during the planning phase, or proposed treatment blocks during final review. Though not rare, 
milkweed plants (which support monarch butterfly) would be an example of a plant species that

responsibility of the land manager, APHIS, and wildlife management agencies, to identify and 
buffer out plants species as dictated by applicable policy or preference from treatment requests 
during the planning phase, or proposed treatment blocks during final review. Though not rare, 
milkweed plants (which support monarch butterfly) would be an example of a plant species that 
would be desirable to buffer, as requested by anyone involved. APHIS has done so for all projects 
in Oregon for the past five years. The Oregon Flora project (oregonflora.org) supported in part by 
the USDA, is one helpful resource for reviewing treatment areas for plants of concern. Due to 
methods and materials, impacts to flowering plants, including pollination services, are not 
anticipated to be significant by proposed actions, except for the no action alternative, which may 
results in fewer such plants due to herbivory by damaging grasshopper population outbreaks. 
e) Miscellaneous 
Biological soil crusts, also known as cryptogamic, microbiotic, cryptobiotic, and microphytic 
crusts, occur within the proposed suppression area. Biological soil crusts are formed by living 
organisms and their by-products, creating a crust of soil particles bound together by organic 
materials. Crusts are predominantly composed of cyanobacteria (formerly blue-green algae), green 
and brown algae, mosses, and lichens. Liverworts, fungi, and bacteria can also be important 
components. Crusts contribute to various functions in the environment. Because they are 
concentrated in the top 1 to 4 mm of soil, they primarily affect processes that occur at the land 
surface or soil-air interface. These include stabilizing soil against erosion, fixing atmospheric 
nitrogen, providing nutrients to plants, and

concentrated in the top 1 to 4 mm of soil, they primarily affect processes that occur at the land 
surface or soil-air interface. These include stabilizing soil against erosion, fixing atmospheric 
nitrogen, providing nutrients to plants, and improving soil-plant-water relations, infiltration, 
seedling germination, and plant growth. Finally, sundry other organisms (e.g. fungi and fungus-like 
organisms, algae and lichens, non-vascular plants, earthworms and other annelids, both terrestrial 
and aquatic microorganisms) though less visible in rangelands of eastern Oregon are nonetheless 
present and contribute to these ecosystems in various ways. Given program methods and materials, 
negative impacts on these non-targets are expected to be minimal, as described in greater detail in 
the Environmental Consequences Section.

3. Consultation and Assessment Determinations  
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its implementing regulations require Federal 
agencies to ensure their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed 
threatened or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical 
habitat. Within the seven counties and three level III ecoregions under consideration by this EA 
there are federally listed species and areas of designated critical habitat, although few if any occur 
within or near potential grasshopper suppression areas.  
APHIS considers whether listed species, species proposed for listing, experimental populations, or 
critical habitat are present in the proposed suppression area. Before treatments are conducted, 
APHIS contacts the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the National

 areas of designated critical habitat, although few if any occur 
within or near potential grasshopper suppression areas.  
APHIS considers whether listed species, species proposed for listing, experimental populations, or 
critical habitat are present in the proposed suppression area. Before treatments are conducted, 
APHIS contacts the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS) (where applicable) to determine if listed species are present in the suppression 
area, and whether mitigations or protection measures must be implemented to protect listed species 
or critical habitat.  
APHIS submitted a programmatic biological assessment for grasshopper suppression in the 17-
state program area and requested consultation with USFWS on March 9, 2015. In November 2023 
APHIS revised the biological assessment to address USFWS comments and include species that 
had been listed since 2015. USFWS concurred with APHIS’ determination the grasshopper 
program would have no effect or was not likely to adversely affect listed species and the critical 
habitat on March 21, 2024. USFWS stated:  
As a result of the APHIS program conservation measures such as use of the buffer 
distances discussed above for all taxonomic groups and their designated critical habitats, 
as applicable, along with the reduced application rates as compared to label rates for 
each insecticide, and RAAT treatment procedures, any risk of exposure associated with 
the application of the three insecticides used under the APHIS grasshopper and Mormon 
cricket suppression program is expected to be minimal. Thus, any direct or indirect 
effects from the proposed action to listed species and their designated critical habitats 
are expected to be insignificant due to program conservation measures. 
 
APHIS will also continue to consult with USFWS

cricket suppression program is expected to be minimal. Thus, any direct or indirect 
effects from the proposed action to listed species and their designated critical habitats 
are expected to be insignificant due to program conservation measures. 
 
APHIS will also continue to consult with USFWS field offices at the local level to ensure listed 
species habitats are properly buffered during grasshopper suppression treatments, as summarized in 
Appendix C.  
Nationally, APHIS completed a programmatic Section 7 consultation with NMFS for use of 
carbaryl, malathion, and diflubenzuron to suppress grasshoppers in the 17-state program area 
because of the listed salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) and critical habitat. To minimize the possibility 
of insecticides from reaching salmonid habitat, APHIS implements the following protection 
measures:  
• RAATs are used in all areas adjacent to salmonid habitat. 
• ULV sprays are used, which are between 50% and 66% of the USEPA recommended 
rate. 
• Insecticides are not aerially applied in a 3,500 foot buffer zones for carbaryl or 
malathion, or applied within a 1,500 foot buffer zones for diflubenzuron along stream 
corridors. 
• Insecticides will not be applied when wind speeds exceed 10 miles per hour. APHIS will 
attempt to avoid insecticide application if the wind is blowing towards salmonid habitat. 
`

• Insecticide applications are avoided when precipitation is likely or during temperature 
inversions. 
APHIS determined that with the implementation of these measures, the grasshopper suppression

• Insecticide applications are avoided when precipitation is likely or during temperature 
inversions. 
APHIS determined that with the implementation of these measures, the grasshopper suppression 
program may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect listed salmonids or designated critical 
habitat in the program area. NMFS concurred with this determination in a letter dated April 12, 
2010.  
a) Protective Measures for Vertebrate Species 
(1) Yellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus 
In Oregon, cuckoos, although never common, have become even rarer with the loss of floodplain 
forests along the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The last confirmed breeding records in Oregon 
were in the 1940s. Records of cuckoos continued in eastern Oregon at Malheur National Wildlife 
Refuge in Harney county specifically, and from Malheur and Deschutes counties generally. Over 
the last 20 years however, more recent reports have come from western Oregon. Mature riparian 
stands on the east side such as on the Owyhee, Snake and Umatilla Rivers are expected to continue 
to have cuckoos reported. Two years ago, one was reported from Harney county at Fields. 
Yellow-billed cuckoos are migratory. Historically, cuckoos arrived in Oregon in mid-May and flew 
south to their wintering grounds in September. The bird primarily eats large insects including 
caterpillars, cicadas, grasshoppers, and Mormon crickets. Breeding coincides with the emergence 
of cicadas and tent caterpillars.

-billed cuckoos are migratory. Historically, cuckoos arrived in Oregon in mid-May and flew 
south to their wintering grounds in September. The bird primarily eats large insects including 
caterpillars, cicadas, grasshoppers, and Mormon crickets. Breeding coincides with the emergence 
of cicadas and tent caterpillars. 
The greatest threat to the species has been reported to be loss of riparian habitat. It has been 
estimated that 90 percent of this cuckoo's stream-side habitat has been lost. Habitat loss in the 
Western US is attributed to agriculture, dams, and river flow management, overgrazing and 
invasive plants such as tamarisk. Activities which alter or destroy riparian habitat are of particular 
concern, including unmanaged cattle grazing that contributes to the loss of sub-canopy vegetation 
and cottonwood regeneration. 
APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket program activities may affect the yellow-billed cuckoo. 
While diflubenzuron and carbaryl are highly toxic to insects they are both only slightly toxic to 
birds. These chemicals should have no direct effect to the yellow-billed cuckoo, but they may cause 
a temporary reduction of prey species, though use of RAATs will help to mitigate this. 
Yellow-billed cuckoo distribution has not been systematically surveyed in eastern Oregon in recent 
years, but the existing record of reports do indicate that Harney County has areas where 
observations are more likely to occur, especially in June and July. APHIS will confer with the 
USFWS to consult recent survey records or conduct surveys of high potential for nesting and 
foraging habitat prior to implementing the suppression program to determine locations of 
yellow-billed cuckoo nests or

 of reports do indicate that Harney County has areas where 
observations are more likely to occur, especially in June and July. APHIS will confer with the 
USFWS to consult recent survey records or conduct surveys of high potential for nesting and 
foraging habitat prior to implementing the suppression program to determine locations of 
yellow-billed cuckoo nests or occupied habitat prior to treatment. In addition to this, or if this is 
not possible for any reason,  the water buffers of 500’ for liquid insecticide and 200’ for bait when 
applied by air, 200’ for liquid applied by ground, and 50’ for bait when applied by ground, will be 
extended to begin at the edge of any riparian stands greater than 50 acres or larger, not just from 
the waterbodies present therein, and not exclusive to stands proven to have yellow-billed cuckoo 
populations present. Additionally, the RAATS application method will be used exclusively when 
treating near known, or suspected, yellow-billed cuckoo habitat to preserve non-target insect prey. 
Implementation of these protective measures will assure that the APHIS Grasshopper Suppression 
Program will not likely adversely affect yellow-billed cuckoo.

(2) Oregon Spotted Frog, Rana pretiosa 
Oregon spotted frogs are currently only known to occur in Deschutes, Klamath, Jackson, and Lane 
counties. This species is the most aquatic native frog in the Pacific Northwest. It is almost always 
found in or near a perennial body of water that includes zones of shallow water and abundant 
emergent or floating aquatic plants. Oregon spotted frogs seem to prefer large warm marshes

, Klamath, Jackson, and Lane 
counties. This species is the most aquatic native frog in the Pacific Northwest. It is almost always 
found in or near a perennial body of water that includes zones of shallow water and abundant 
emergent or floating aquatic plants. Oregon spotted frogs seem to prefer large warm marshes 
(approximate minimum size of 4 hectares (9 acres)), as well as riverine corridors with suitably slow 
water or pooling habit, that can support a large enough population to persist despite high predation 
rates and sporadic reproductive failures. Oregon Spotted frogs are known to move several hundred 
meters usually along flooded or saturated corridors. The Oregon spotted frog is now absent from at 
least 76 percent of its former range. Most of the remaining Oregon spotted frog populations are 
small and isolated. 
In central Oregon, spotted frogs breed in mid- to late April. Metamorphosis occurs in mid to late 
summer. Adult spotted frogs are opportunistic feeders, consuming many types of insects, mollusks, 
and other amphibians. Tadpoles are grazers which consume algae and detritus. Spotted frogs are 
highly aquatic and live in or near permanent bodies of water, including lakes, ponds, slow streams 
and marshes; movements of spotted frogs are limited to wet riparian corridors. Standing water, 
flooded meadows, and willows provide breeding, foraging, and overwintering habitat. 
The largest threat to spotted frogs is the destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of wetland 
habitat. Changes in hydrology (from construction of ditches and dams) and water quality, 
development, and livestock overgrazing continue to result in habitat loss, alteration, and/or 
fragmentation. Non-native plant invasions by aggressive species like re

The largest threat to spotted frogs is the destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of wetland 
habitat. Changes in hydrology (from construction of ditches and dams) and water quality, 
development, and livestock overgrazing continue to result in habitat loss, alteration, and/or 
fragmentation. Non-native plant invasions by aggressive species like reed canary grass (Phalaris 
arundinacea), succession of plant communities from marsh to meadow, and invasive predators 
such as bullfrogs, bass and other predatory fish species are believed to contribute to their decline. 
Direct toxic effects could occur to Spotted frogs should they be exposed to program insecticides, 
but this will be mitigated sufficiently by program buffers to prevent any significant impacts. 
Indirect effects through loss of prey items could also occur if program chemicals were to reach 
occupied habitat. The APHIS Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program maintains a 
standard, programmatic 500 foot buffer from water for aerial Dimilin treatments, a 200 foot buffer 
from water for all aerial bait treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground 
treatments, and a 50 foot buffer from water for all ground bait treatments. These standard buffers 
are in place to reduce the chance that a pesticide used for grasshopper suppression will enter water. 
Monitoring of APHIS grasshopper treatments by Beyers and McEwen (1996) concluded that the 
standard buffer resulted in trace amounts of pesticide in aquatic habitats, and that grasshopper 
control operations had no biologically significant effect on aquatic resources. 
APHIS will confer with USFWS to determine locations of spotted frog habitat prior to treatment.

control operations had no biologically significant effect on aquatic resources. 
APHIS will confer with USFWS to determine locations of spotted frog habitat prior to treatment. 
Implementation of these protective measures will assure that the APHIS Grasshopper Suppression 
Program will not likely adversely affect spotted frog. 
b) Protective Measures for Fish Species 
(1) General Protective Measures 
The APHIS Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program does not apply insecticides 
directly to water bodies (defined herein as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by seasonal streams, 
springs, wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers). Furthermore, APHIS provides the following 
`  
Page | 54 
 
buffers for water bodies: 500-foot buffer with aerial liquid insecticide; 200 foot buffer with ground 
liquid insecticide; 200-foot buffer with aerial bait; and 50-foot buffer with ground bait. 
These standard buffers are in place to reduce the chance that a pesticide used for grasshopper 
suppression will enter water. Monitoring of APHIS grasshopper treatments by Beyers and McEwen 
(1996) concluded that the standard buffer resulted in trace amounts of pesticide in aquatic habitats, 
and that grasshopper control operations had no biologically significant effect on aquatic resources.  
However, APHIS recognizes that even trace amounts of pesticides entering locations inhabited by 
listed fish species may be of concern. Therefore, the standard buffers for carbaryl and 
diflubenzuron liquid applications have been increased in distance in order to protect listed fish 
species and their prey, that is no aerial application of liquid pesticides within 0.25 mile of occupied 
habitats. 
Chronic effects to listed fish species are unlikely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 by 
listed fish species may be of concern. Therefore, the standard buffers for carbaryl and 
diflubenzuron liquid applications have been increased in distance in order to protect listed fish 
species and their prey, that is no aerial application of liquid pesticides within 0.25 mile of occupied 
habitats. 
Chronic effects to listed fish species are unlikely even assuming the worst case scenario because: 1) 
the insecticides APHIS uses are non-persistent in water; 2) APHIS applies only a single application 
of a single insecticide to a grasshopper treatment area only one time a year – there are no multiple 
treatments; 3) in the unusual case that APHIS would return to an area treated the previous year, any 
insecticides applied by APHIS would have degraded; and 4) the insecticide APHIS could use and 
at the application rate APHIS would apply, there are few, if any, chronic properties that could 
affect listed fish species. 
There is also some potential for a very effective grasshopper treatment to affect listed fish species 
indirectly and adversely by reduction of prey base. RAATs will be required for use in areas with 
ESA fish or habitat species, to ensure that the suppression treatment does not suppress 
grasshoppers or non-target insects too severely. Additionally, normal treatment buffers for riparian 
areas will help to ensure a continued food source in the area to limit such indirect adverse effects.  
Therefore, when the above protection measures are implemented listed fish species are not likely to 
be adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, by APHIS grasshopper program activities.

 the area to limit such indirect adverse effects.  
Therefore, when the above protection measures are implemented listed fish species are not likely to 
be adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, by APHIS grasshopper program activities. 
(2) Bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus 
Bull trout occur in rivers and tributaries throughout the Columbia Basin in Montana, Idaho, 
Washington, Oregon, and Nevada, as well as the Klamath Basin in Oregon, and several 
cross-boundary drainages in extreme southeast Alaska. They are mostly found in high 
elevation forested areas, not likely to be targeted for grasshopper control or suppression. 
This lack of geographic overlap of program treatment areas with bull trout habitat, as well as 
the above-described general protection measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for 
known ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, 
either directly or indirectly. 
(3) Hutton tui chub, Gila bicolor spp. 
The Hutton tui chub is found in spring systems and outflow channels. The size of the Hutton 
Spring holes range from 20-40 feet in width, and about 15 ft in depth at its center. The smaller 
spring hole is about 10 feet across and 2 feet deep. The spring holes are surrounded by water 
parsley, sedge, saltgrass, and squirreltail, which the chub use for cover. No details of 
reproduction are known, except that fish of 17 millimeters (mm) have been seen in late July, 
which infers that spawning probably takes place in May or June.

reproduction are known, except that fish of 17 millimeters (mm) have been seen in late July, 
which infers that spawning probably takes place in May or June. 
`  
Page | 55 
 
The fish feed on zooplankton, insects, gastropods, and plants. Juvenile Hutton tui chubs feed 
on zooplankton of appropriate size, and apparently feed on small insects as well. At 50 to 60 
mm in length, the fish’s diet shifts toward plant material and they remain omnivorous, 
feeding on vegetation, insect, and gastropods. 
It is found only in Hutton Spring, a small spring system with surface flow in two areas located 
in the now dry alkali lake in Lake County, South Central Oregon and in another small 
unnamed spring 3/8 mile southeast of Hutton Spring (3/8 Mile Spring)(USDOI, USFWS, 1998). 
Threats to the populations of Hutton tui chubs includes pumping of water for agricultural 
irrigation from the springs which occurred in the past but has since decreased. Other threats 
include trampling of habitats by livestock and contamination of ground water by dispersal of 
chemicals from a nearby herbicide-manufacturing residue disposal site south of Hutton 
Spring. 
Hutton Spring and 3/8 Mile Spring are located on private lands in Lake County. It is unlikely 
that the private landowner(s) would make a request to APHIS to apply pesticides on their 
lands around Hutton Spring or 3/8 Mile Spring, however if a treatment in the area did occur, 
standard program buffers would of course apply, whether the habitat was included in the 
treatment area directly or simply adjacent to it.

standard program buffers would of course apply, whether the habitat was included in the 
treatment area directly or simply adjacent to it. The above-described general protection 
measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for known ESA species populations, 
should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, 
Hutton tui chub populations. 
(4) Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii 
henshawi 
The Lahontan cutthroat trout is a lacustrine subspecies, which was isolated as a consequence of 
geologic change. Within southeastern Oregon, Lahontan cutthroat trout occur in Willow Creek and 
Whitehorse Creek and their tributaries, which are within the Coyote Lake watershed which is 
within the larger Alvord Lake basin. In addition, Lahontan cutthroat trout were transferred to 
previously fishless streams flowing off the east side of the Steens and Pueblo Mountains. Willow 
Creek and one unnamed tributary stream to Willow Creek is the entire occupied Lahontan cutthroat 
trout habitat in the Willow Creek watershed.  Whitehorse Creek, Little Whitehorse Creek, 
Sheepline Canyon Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Antelope Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Doolittle 
Creek are tributaries to Whitehorse Creek which are either occupied or historic Lahontan cutthroat 
trout habitat. The streams into which Lahontan cutthroat trout were transferred on the east side of 
the Steens Mountains are Big Alvord

epline Canyon Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Antelope Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Doolittle 
Creek are tributaries to Whitehorse Creek which are either occupied or historic Lahontan cutthroat 
trout habitat. The streams into which Lahontan cutthroat trout were transferred on the east side of 
the Steens Mountains are Big Alvord Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Little Alvord Creek, McCoy 
Creek, Mosquito Creek, Pike Creek, and Willow Creek.  In the Pueblo Mountains, Denio Creek 
and Van Horn Creek were planted with Lahontan cutthroat trout. Within the northern portion of the 
Quinn River watershed, Lahontan cutthroat trout are located in McDermitt Creek and its tributaries. 
Tributaries which are or historically were occupied by Lahontan cutthroat trout include McDermitt 
Creek, North Fork McDermitt Creek, Sage Creek, Line Canyon Creek, Corral Canyon Creek and 
Riser Creek. Lahontan cutthroat trout may have historically occupied Indian Creek; however, the 
current status of the population in Indian Creek is unknown.   
During periods of high precipitation, Lahontan cutthroat trout are believed to ascend river or stream 
waterways to spawn in the gravel riffles, depositing fertilized eggs in the gravel sediment. Upon

hatching, the young remain in that habitat for a time, feeding on aquatic invertebrates or insect 
larvae before migrating downstream. 
The above-described general protection measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for known

or indirectly, Lahontan cutthroat trout populations.

Both the Lost River and shortnose suckers are lake dwelling species, but spawn in tributary streams 
or springs. Larval Lost River and shortnose suckers usually spend little time in tributary streams 
and migrate back to the lake shortly after their swim up. Larval sucker migration from the 
spawning sites can begin in May or June. After emigrating from the parental spawning sites in late 
spring, larval and juvenile Lost River and shortnose suckers inhabited near shore waters, primarily 
under 50 cm in depth. 
The primary refuge for both species is Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath County, Oregon. Hybridized 
populations of both species are also known from the Lost River system and other nearby areas of 
Klamath County, Oregon. Both species also have been collected from J. C. Boyle Reservoir, 
Klamath County, Oregon. Shortnose suckers have also been collected in Winema National Forest 
of Klamath County from Lake of the Woods, although these were reportedly lost in 1952 during a 
fish eradication project aimed at other species. 
The shortnose sucker (Chasmistes brevirostris) and the Lost River sucker (Deltistes luxatus) are 
restricted to the Klamath Basin of south central Oregon and north central California. The Upper 
Klamath Lake and its tributaries are the primary refuge for the species although both have been

The shortnose sucker (Chasmistes brevirostris) and the Lost River sucker (Deltistes luxatus) are 
restricted to the Klamath Basin of south central Oregon and north central California. The Upper 
Klamath Lake and its tributaries are the primary refuge for the species although both have been 
found in Copco Reservoir and Clear Lake Reservoir, California, and Boyle Reservoir, Oregon. 
Shortnose suckers have also been taken from Lake of the Woods, Oregon. Lost suckers have been 
found from Sheepy Lake, Lower Klamath Lake, and Tule Lake in California. 
Forms of water manipulation, such as damming, instream flow diversion, draining of marshes, and 
dredging of the Upper Klamath Lake, have contributed to the widespread decline of both species. 
In addition, hybridization, competition and predation by exotic species, insularization of habitat, 
and water quality problems associated with timber harvest, removal of riparian vegetation, 
livestock grazing, and agricultural practices are also suggested as reasons for their decline. 
The above-described general protection measures for waterways, and the added buffers for known 
ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly 
or indirectly, shortnose sucker populations. 
(5) Warner sucker, Catostomus warnerensis 
The species is endemic to the Warner Basin of south-central Oregon, with known populations that 
include: the Warner Lake Basin of south-central Oregon, Lake County, near the California/Nevada 
line, and Nevada portion of Twelvemile Creek, Nevada. It reported in portions of Crump and Hart 
Lakes; a spillway canal north of Hart Lake; Snyder Creek; Deep (=Warner) Creek; Honey

 south-central Oregon, with known populations that 
include: the Warner Lake Basin of south-central Oregon, Lake County, near the California/Nevada 
line, and Nevada portion of Twelvemile Creek, Nevada. It reported in portions of Crump and Hart 
Lakes; a spillway canal north of Hart Lake; Snyder Creek; Deep (=Warner) Creek; Honey Creek 
(above the dam at Plush, and at its mouth at Hart Lake); Twentymile Creek (between the south end 
of Warner Valley floor and the confluence with Twelvemile Creek); and Twelvemile Creek 
(immediately above and below the O'Keefe Diversion Dam) (Williams et al., 1990). 
The Warner sucker spawns over silt-free gravel substrate in low gradient streams. At least some 
young may move immediately into lakes, but this remains an outstanding question (Lee et al., 
1980). It has been threatened by water diversion structures, siltation of gravel beds used for 
spawning, and the introduction of exotic species which prey upon juveniles. A spreading labyrinth 
`

of irrigation ditches, dams, and canals now block the major creeks that feed the Warner Valley 
lakes thus disrupting spawning runs. 
Understanding of this species complex, obligatory life-cycle and seasonal distribution within its 
limited range, continue to improve, as well as resulting proactive measures to support them: 
“Relatively recent anthropomorphic alterations to the aquatic environment in the valley presents 
challenges to the species’ ability to express the full suite of its life history characteristics. Recently,

there has been a concerted effort among management agencies and landowners to provide fish 
passage through the numerous diversion dams and to screen irrigation canals in the valley. These 
changes, along with other habitat improvements, should help Warner Suckers better carry out all 
aspects of their life history” (ODFW, 2019). 
Since this is a relatively dynamic species and science, any requests for APHIS treatments in the 
Warner Basin will require additional consultation from APHIS with land managers and wildlife 
experts to ensure that the latest population modelling is used for the enhanced ESA protection 
buffers around potential Warner sucker populations. 
The above-described general protection measures for waterbodies, and the added buffers for known 
ESA species populations, should ensure treatments are not likely to adversely affect, either directly 
or indirectly, Warner sucker populations.  
c) Protective Measures for Plant Species 
(1) General Protective Measures 
APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket program activities may adversely affect Applegate’s 
milk-vetch, Howell’s spectacular thelypody, and Spalding’s catchfly (listed plant species). The 
insecticide used for a grasshopper treatment could reduce pollinators of these species and the 
equipment used for a ground application could damage individual plants or modify the habitat. In 
order to protect listed plant species, APHIS will implement the following measures from the edge 
of known listed plant species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used from 
known locations of listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 ft. 
from the edge of known locations of

 damage individual plants or modify the habitat. In 
order to protect listed plant species, APHIS will implement the following measures from the edge 
of known listed plant species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used from 
known locations of listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 ft. 
from the edge of known locations of this plant. When these measures are implemented grasshopper 
program activities are not likely to adversely affect listed plant species. 
The highest potential for a grasshopper treatment to directly affect listed plant species involves the 
use of ground equipment which could physically damage a plant or modify the habitat. Toxicity is 
unlikely because the insecticides that could be used by the APHIS Grasshopper and Mormon 
Cricket Suppression Program are not phytotoxic. However, the successful reproduction of plants is 
often highly dependent upon adequate populations of pollinators, and the insect populations that 
may pollinate listed plant species could be reduced by the insecticide used in a grasshopper 
treatment. 
An important part of the APHIS GIPM project in the 1990’s were studies to better understand the 
reproductive biology of rare rangeland plants and the effects of insecticides on rangeland plant 
pollinators (see Alston and Tepedino 1996, and Tepedino 1996). Among the findings of those 
studies were that carbaryl bait may be a relatively safe option to protect pollinators.  
APHIS recognizes that the pollination and reproductive processes of rare plants are extremely 
complex and not well understood in many cases. While the Grasshopper IPM Program made some 
progress into understanding these issues, sufficient information still does not exist to precisely

 option to protect pollinators.  
APHIS recognizes that the pollination and reproductive processes of rare plants are extremely 
complex and not well understood in many cases. While the Grasshopper IPM Program made some 
progress into understanding these issues, sufficient information still does not exist to precisely 
`  
Page | 58 
 
determine adequate protective measures for rare plant pollinators. In the 1987 BO for the 
Grasshopper Program, the USFWS stipulated a 3-mile buffer zone restricting the use of aerial Ultra 
Low Volume (ULV) applications around occupied habitats with no restrictions on the use of 
carbaryl bait. Although these measures were based more on best guesses rather than accurate 
estimates (Tepedino, 1996), APHIS does not have the resources to conduct the level of research 
that would be needed to refine those measures. Thus, the measures APHIS is proposing to protect 
listed plant species are mostly the same measures derived in 1987. 
The current measures proposed by APHIS include a 3 mile buffer for any liquid pesticide 
application for grasshopper suppression. This is essentially the same as the 1987 buffer, except that 
ground applications were not addressed in 1987, but have now been grouped with aerial 
applications. 
Because the RAATs strategy uses a pesticide at a rate that is less than the rate conventionally used, 
and typically 50% or more of the treatment area is not directly treated (skip swathing), the overall 
pesticide deposition is dramatically reduced and many pollinators within a treatment area would be 
protected from direct exposure to the insecticide. Also, studies have indicated that diflubenzuron 
treatments against rangeland grasshoppers have no effect on pollinators, even one year post-
treatment (Catangui et al

skip swathing), the overall 
pesticide deposition is dramatically reduced and many pollinators within a treatment area would be 
protected from direct exposure to the insecticide. Also, studies have indicated that diflubenzuron 
treatments against rangeland grasshoppers have no effect on pollinators, even one year post-
treatment (Catangui et al., 1996). This reduces impacts to pollinators outside of the 3 mile buffer 
area. 
The 50 foot buffer for carbaryl bait proposed by APHIS is more restrictive than in 1987 when there 
was no restriction on bait. Although carbaryl bait poses little, if any, risk to bees (Alston and 
Tepedino 1996) the 50 foot buffer will prevent equipment used to apply carbaryl bait from 
physically damaging plants or their habitat. 
Therefore, when the above protection measures are implemented listed plant species populations 
are not likely to be adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, by APHIS grasshopper program 
activities. 
(2) Howell’s spectacular thelypody, Thelypodium howellii 
ssp. spectabilis 
Howell’s spectacular thelypody is a biennial herb of the mustard family endemic to a small range 
in eastern Oregon. The plant is currently known from 11 sites (5 populations) ranging in size from 
0.03 acres to 41.4 acres in the Baker-Powder River Valley in Baker and Union counties. The total 
occupied habitat for this species is approximately 100 acres, all of which is privately-owned. The 
entire extant range of this taxon lies within a 13 mile radius of Haines, Oregon.

 Baker and Union counties. The total 
occupied habitat for this species is approximately 100 acres, all of which is privately-owned. The 
entire extant range of this taxon lies within a 13 mile radius of Haines, Oregon. 
Howell’s spectacular thelypody occurs in moist, alkaline meadow habitats at approximately 3,000 
feet to 3,500 feet elevation, usually in and around woody shrubs such as greasewood or 
rabbitbrush. Soils are pluvial-deposited alkaline clays mixed with recent alluvial silts and are 
moderately well-drained. 
This taxon is threatened by a variety of factors including habitat destruction and fragmentation 
from agricultural and urban development; spring and early summer grazing by domestic livestock; 
competition from non-native vegetation; and alterations of wetland hydrology. The use of certain 
pesticides could indirectly affect this taxon since the pesticides could harm the insect pollinators 
that Howell’s spectacular thelypody relies upon to reproduce (USDOI, USFWS, 2002).

(1) Miscellaneous 
APHIS implements best management practices (BMPs) in treatment strategies that are designed to 
protect nontarget invertebrates, including pollinators. APHIS minimizes insecticide use by using 
lower than labeled rates for all Program insecticides, alternating swaths during treatment, making 
only one application per season and minimizing use of liquid broad-spectrum insecticides. APHIS 
also continues to evaluate new monitoring and control methods designed to respond to 
economically damaging populations of grasshoppers and Mormon crickets while protecting 
rangeland resources such as pollinators. APHIS considers the role of pollinators in any 
consultations conducted with the USFWS to protect federally listed plants. Mitigation measures, 
such as no treatment buffers are applied with consideration of the protection of pollinators that are 
important to a listed plant species.

by any means whatever, receive for shipment, transportation or carriage, or export, at any time, or 
in any manner, any migratory bird or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird. 
APHIS will support the conservation intent of the migratory bird conventions by integrating bird 
conservation principles, measures, and practices into agency activities and by avoiding or reducing, 
to the extent practicable, adverse impacts on migratory bird resources when conducting agency 
actions. Impacts are minimized as a result of buffers to water, habitat, nesting areas, riparian areas, 
and the use of RAATs. For any given treatment, only a portion of the environment will be treated, 
therefore minimizing potential impacts to migratory bird populations. 
The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668–668c) prohibits anyone, without a 
permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, from “taking” bald eagles, including their parts, 
nests, or eggs. During the breeding season, bald eagles are sensitive to a variety of human 
activities. Grasshopper management activities could cause disturbance of nesting eagles, depending 
on the duration, noise levels, extent of the area affected by the activity,

 the Secretary of the Interior, from “taking” bald eagles, including their parts, 
nests, or eggs. During the breeding season, bald eagles are sensitive to a variety of human 
activities. Grasshopper management activities could cause disturbance of nesting eagles, depending 
on the duration, noise levels, extent of the area affected by the activity, prior experiences that 
eagles have with humans, and tolerance of the individual nesting pair. However, rangeland 
grasshopper suppression treatments occur during the late spring or early summer, after the nesting 
season when eagle young typically will have already fledged. The program also recognizes 
disruptive activities in or near eagle foraging areas can interfere with bald eagle feeding, reducing 
chances of survival. Program operational procedures that prevent applications near water bodies 
will reduce the possibility of disturbing eagle foraging activities. USFWS has provided 
recommendations for avoiding disturbance at foraging areas and communal roost sites that are 
applicable to grasshopper management programs (USFWS, 2007).  
No toxic effects are anticipated on eagles as a direct consequence of insecticide treatments. Toxic 
effects on the principal food source, fish, are not expected because insecticide treatments will not 
be conducted over rivers or lakes. Buffers protective of aquatic biota are applied to their habitats to 
ensure that there are no indirect effects from loss of prey. 
There may be species that are of special concern to land management agencies, the public, or other 
groups and individuals in proposed treatment areas. For example, the sage grouse populations have 
declined throughout most of their entire range, with habitat loss being a major factor in their 
decline.

groups and individuals in proposed treatment areas. For example, the sage grouse populations have 
declined throughout most of their entire range, with habitat loss being a major factor in their 
decline. 
(2) Protection of Greater Sage-Grouse 
There is special concern about the role of grasshoppers as a food source for sage grouse and other 
insectivorous vertebrate species found in Oregon rangeland. Grasshopper suppression programs 
reduce grasshoppers and potentially non-target insects in the treatment area that are food items for 
such species, including sage grouse chicks. There is low potential that the program insecticides 
would be toxic to these populations, either by direct exposure to the insecticides or indirectly 
through eating moribund grasshoppers. Further, because grasshopper numbers are so high in 
outbreak years, and usually composed of just a few species, treatments would not likely reduce the 
number of grasshoppers below levels present in a normal year and may increase the diversity of 
herbivorous insects overall. What constitutes ‘normal’ grasshopper population levels will vary by 
location, but in general a diversity of grasshopper species at densities of 5 per square yard might be 
considered normal in many areas. Should grasshoppers be unavailable in small, localized areas, 
sage grouse chicks may catch what grasshoppers are available as well as other insects, which  
would be normal in naturally down-cycle years for grasshopper populations. By suppressing 
grasshoppers, rangeland vegetation is available for use by other species, and rangeland areas are

The Oregon Greater Sage-grouse Approved Resource Management Plan (GRSG ARMPA) of 2015

by the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife (ODFW) pursuant to state law

(3) Protection of Columbia Spotted Frog 

`  
Page | 63 
 
The Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) Great Basin Distinct Population Segment is known 
to occur in potential program counties of Lake, Harney, and Malheur, Oregon. USFWS has 
determined that protection under the Endangered Species Act is no longer warranted and has 
withdrawn the species from the candidate species list. However, USFWS is recommending 
protection measures of this species, similar to Oregon spotted frog. The program will work with 
USFWS to avoid areas occupied by Columbia spotted frog and to implement conservation 
objectives and protection measures recommended by USFWS and BLM prior to commencing with 
any treatment projects. 
Program activities may affect spotted frogs, since direct toxic effects could occur to Spotted frogs 
should they be exposed to program insecticides. Further, indirect effects through loss of prey items 
could occur if program chemicals were to reach occupied habitat. The program maintains a 
standard 500 foot buffer from water for all aerial ULV treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for 
all aerial bait treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground treatments, and a 50 
foot buffer from water for all ground bait treatments (also referred to as ‘programmatic buffers’). 
Text Len: 1793
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 chemicals were to reach occupied habitat. The program maintains a 
standard 500 foot buffer from water for all aerial ULV treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for 
all aerial bait treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground treatments, and a 50 
foot buffer from water for all ground bait treatments (also referred to as ‘programmatic buffers’). 
These buffers are in place to reduce the chance that a pesticide used for grasshopper suppression 
will enter water. Monitoring of APHIS grasshopper treatments by Beyers and McEwen (1996) 
concluded that the standard buffer resulted in trace amounts of pesticide in aquatic habitats, and 
that grasshopper control operations had no biologically significant effect on aquatic resources. 
APHIS will confer with USFWS to determine locations of spotted frog habitat prior to treatment 
and apply programmatic buffers to these and other water bodies. Implementation of these 
protective measures will assure that the program will not likely adversely affect spotted frog. 
(4) Protection of Borax Lake Chubb 
The Borax Lake chub (Gila boraxobius) was emergency-listed as endangered in 1980, and a final 
listing rule with critical habitat was published in 1982. A recovery plan was published in 1987. On 
February 26, 2019, USFWS published a proposal to remove the Borax Lake chub, and its critical 
habitat, from the list of Endangered and Threatened Species in the federal register. In 2020, 
USFWS removed the Borax Lake chub from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife on the basis of recovery.

 the federal register. In 2020, 
USFWS removed the Borax Lake chub from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife on the basis of recovery. 
Borax Lake chubs are opportunistic omnivores whose feeding habits vary a great deal with 
maturity level and seasonal occurrence of prey. Diatoms, chironomid larvae, 
microcrustaceans, and adult dipterans are primary food during the spring. In the summer, 
terrestrial insects play a more important role in the diet. Chironomid larvae are important in 
the winter when terrestrial insects are not abundant. Adults tend to consume more 
gastropods and diatoms than juveniles which tend to consume more copepods and 
terrestrial insects. Fish feed by picking food from soft bottom sediments or from rocks. 
Feeding takes place throughout the water column generally all day with a peak just after 
sunset. Relatively little is known about the biology of this species, including how it manages 
to survive in waters with such a high borate concentration. 
  
Borax Lake chubs spawn through the year, but most spawning takes place in early spring. The 
species mature at a small size, standard length of little more than an inch and seldom lives 
more than 1 year.

Borax Lake chub, resides on private land owned by The Nature Conservancy, within an Area

likely to make a request to APHIS to apply pesticides on their lands. Therefore, this area 
could be eliminated from the proposed action. Implementation of APHIS’ protective 
measures will assure that the APHIS Grasshopper Suppression Program will not likely 
adversely affect Borax lake chub. 
 
(5) Protection of Foskett Speckled Dace 
The Foskett speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) was listed as threatened in 1985. The listing rule 
found that the designation of critical habitat was not prudent, as identification of the habitat may 
have led to vandalism of the small, isolated springs that support the species.  A recovery plan was 
published in 1998. Due to the successful implementation of the recovery plan, the species' status 
improved, and on October 15, 2019, USFWS announced the removal of the Foskett speckled dace 
from the list of Endangered and Threatened Species. 
The Foskett speckled dace occurs naturally in Foskett Spring, a small spring system found in the 
Coleman Basin on the west side of the Warner Valley, Lake County, Oregon. Its main natural 
habitat is the small, shallow pool at the spring source. The outflow of the spring at one time

live in tiny outflow rivulets that are at times only a few inches wide and deep. Some are found in 
cattle tracks into which water seeps continuously. It requires clean and fresh water with a fairly 
constant temperature. 
 Little is known about the habits of the Foskett speckled dace. Extensive migration is not known, 
but larval and early juvenile dace have been observed only in the marsh at the edge of the lake bed, 
so there is either a migration of adults downstream to spawn or rivulets to the marsh. There has 
been no complete study of food habits for the Foskett speckled dace, but preliminary observations 
indicate the use of small insects and crustaceans and zooplankton by fry. 
 Trampling by cattle is perceived as the main reason for diminution of the habitat. Other threats 
would include encroachment of vegetation, such as cattails, pumping of ground water or 
channelization which would affect water level, flow and increased silt. 
Based on the status of this species, program treatments will not be conducted near Foskett Spring.

channelization which would affect water level, flow and increased silt. 
Based on the status of this species, program treatments will not be conducted near Foskett Spring. 
This prohibition in addition to programmatic buffers should result in no adverse impacts to Foskett 
speckled dace from the program. 
(6) Protection of Monarch butterfly 
Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is proposed for endangered species status. In the Pacific 
Northwest, monarch butterfly adults migrate from overwintering sites in California to utilize 
seasonal habitat, including Oregon. Adult monarch butterflies feed on flower nectar from a wide 
range of plants. Any impacts from grasshopper treatments to adult monarchs therefore are likely to 
be a positive since grasshopper outbreaks can reduce flowering, with some species such as 
migratory and two-striped grasshoppers preferring forbs when available (Pfadt, 2002). Further, 
`  
Page | 65 
 
neither diflubenzuron nor carbaryl bait are expected to impact adult butterflies due to mode of 
action requiring ingestion. For larval development, monarch caterpillars are obligate to milky-
sapped perennial plant in the dogbane family, primarily showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) in 
the counties considered in this EA. The planting and protection of this host species, coupled with 
and preventing spraying lepidoptera impacting pesticides, has been identified as an important tool 
for supporting monarch butterfly populations. Milkweed is common in much of the state, though 
not necessarily common in areas treated for grasshoppers. Although it is a drought-resistant plant in 
general, it is not thrifty enough to thrive

 protection of this host species, coupled with 
and preventing spraying lepidoptera impacting pesticides, has been identified as an important tool 
for supporting monarch butterfly populations. Milkweed is common in much of the state, though 
not necessarily common in areas treated for grasshoppers. Although it is a drought-resistant plant in 
general, it is not thrifty enough to thrive in arid rangeland areas of the state where grasshopper 
outbreaks are most problematic. Since it is toxic to vertebrates, in many cases it has been managed 
against for decades in agricultural areas. As a result, incidences of milkweed in areas of Malheur 
and Harney County that have been treated for grasshoppers in are extremely limited, mostly 
occurring in small patches in roadside ditches, which is not ideal caterpillar habitat due to patch 
size limitations and disturbances caused by traffic, and would be buffered already if a state hi-way 
or interstate. Impacts caused by the program will further be limited by the infrequency and limited 
scale of treatments, coupled by the relative lack of obligate species habitat, however APHIS in 
Oregon will also work with land-managers to exclude any milkweed sites and buffer them as 
sensitive sites with standard program buffers.

The Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries hosts a highly-detailed interactive map

Figure 18. Generalized Geologic Map of Oregon 
In terms of soils, The Soils of Oregon by Thorson et al (2022) ranks the dominant soil orders in the 
counties listed in this EA as Mollisols followed by Aridisols. Of the Mollisols, which are loamy, 
fertile soils, Xerolls are the most abundant suborder in Oregon which the NRCS characterizes as, 
“the more or less freely drained Mollisols of regions that have Mediterranean climates. Xerolls are 
dry for extended periods in summer, but moisture moves through most of the soils in winter and is 
stored above the deep layers or above bedrock in normal years” (www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-
basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils/mollisols).

In the SE corner of the state as well as the Pendleton area, Aridisols become dominant, which are 
alkaline, moisture limited soils, low in carbon concentrations, often associated with pluvial lakes.

These soils require irrigation as a prerequisite for most agriculture but may naturally host prairie 
ecosystems where adequate seasonal moisture occurs. 
Soil is the basic component of rangeland ecosystems and is associated with nearly all processes that 
occur within the ecosystem. It provides a medium to support plant growth. It is also the home for 
many insects and microorganisms. It is a product of parent material, climate, biological factors, 
topography, and time. The soil formation process is slow, especially in arid and semiarid climates. 
It is believed to take several hundred years to replace an inch of top soil lost by erosion.  Rangeland 
soils, as those found in the Great Plains and Palouse Prairie, have been extensively converted to 
agricultural crop production. Remaining rangeland soils may be rocky, steep, salt affected, or 
otherwise not very productive compared to prime agricultural lands. The chemical and physical 

`  
Page | 68 
 
characteristics of a soil determine: its ability to furnish plant nutrients, the rate and depth of water 
penetration, and the amount of water the soil can hold and its availability to plants. 
b) Hydrology and Water Resources 
Most watersheds in Oregon feed into to the Columbia River. For Baker and Malheur counties, this 
occurs via the Snake River by way of the Powder or Burnt River watersheds, or the Malheur or 
Owyhee River watersheds respectively. Most of Umatilla county drains into the Columbia via the 
Umatilla River, while Jefferson and Wasco counties do so via the Deschutes River. Rivers in

Umatilla River, while Jefferson and Wasco counties do so via the Deschutes River. Rivers in 
Harney and Lake counties drain into pluvial lake basins, especially Malheur, Harney, Summer, 
Abert, Wamer and Goose lakes. National Rivers and Streams Assessments (www.epa.gov/national-
aquatic-resource-surveys/nrsa) do appear to have utilized s ome sampling sites from Harney and 
Malheur counties and the Deschutes River watershed in their Xeric ecoregion report, as shown in 
their sampling sites map.  
 
Figure 20. Map of NRSA 2018-19 Sampling Sites in Each Ecoregion 
In the most recent assessments, only 24% of the 66,540 miles of waterways assessed in the Xeric 
region were in good biological condition, with widespread stressors cited as disturbance and excess 
nutrient runoff leading to toxic microcystins, with 71% of 9,370 lakes assessed having the same 
issue.

c) Air Quality and Climate 
According to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the whole state meets national 
health standards for air pollution, however smoke from wildfire can lead to unhealthy regional 
conditions. Attempts to manage smoke from proscribed burning is an ongoing area of focus and

 Environmental Quality, the whole state meets national 
health standards for air pollution, however smoke from wildfire can lead to unhealthy regional 
conditions. Attempts to manage smoke from proscribed burning is an ongoing area of focus and 
community coordinating. The climate of much of the state lends itself to wildfire, with a 
combination of moist winters and dry summers and strong winds that build in part between the cool 
Pacific Ocean coast and the semi-arid interior of the state. As the introduction of Soils of Oregon 
states, “The origin of the word ‘Oregon’ is disputed. However, three suggestions suggest that it 
originates from (1) the French Canadian word, ouragan, which means ‘windstorm’ after the 
chinook winds on the lower Columbia River; (2) orejón, meaning ‘big ear,’ after Indigenous 
Peoples living in the area; and (3) the spice, orégano, which grew in the territory.” Precipitation in 
Oregon rangeland varies from 5 inches per year in the Alvord Desert, typically from local 
thunderstorms, as the tertiary rain shadow of Steens Mountain pulls away nearly all remaining 
moisture traveling from the Pacific, to a more typical 25 inches per year maximum, which falls 
primarily either in cool season or as summer thunderstorms.  
5. Socioeconomic Issues 
Rangelands are essential to western livestock producers providing forage for a variety of domestic 
animals. Economic values of rangelands also include energy production sites, both fossil and 
renewable, and recreation sites. Two important distinctions are between market and non-market 
values, and between use and non-use values. Market values are associated with goods and services 
sold directly in a marketplace (e.g

 providing forage for a variety of domestic 
animals. Economic values of rangelands also include energy production sites, both fossil and 
renewable, and recreation sites. Two important distinctions are between market and non-market 
values, and between use and non-use values. Market values are associated with goods and services 
sold directly in a marketplace (e.g., livestock); market prices are therefore a good estimate value. 
Non-market values arise from goods and services that are not directly sold in a marketplace (e.g., 
ecosystem services). Similarly, use values arise from goods that are physically used (now or in the 
future), such as forage for livestock (market value) or outdoor recreation (usually a non-market 
value). Non-use values arise from goods that are never physically used. Non-use values, for 
example, include the concept of “existence value” (i.e., the value people place on simply knowing 
something, such as an unspoiled wilderness area, exists). Non-use values are often unrelated to any 
market good, but are real economic values nonetheless. Non-market and non-use values are 
difficult to estimate; therefore, most economic injury level estimates only consider market values 
and, in most cases, only the single market value for the commodity (e.g., forage) being damaged. In 
the case of rangeland, there are a large suite of values, both market and non-market, and use and 
non-use, that can be affected by pests, such as grasshoppers (Rashford et al, 2012).  
Agriculture is an important part of Eastern Oregon’s economy and landscape. More than half the 
area is used for cropland or rangeland (Meacham et.

 both market and non-market, and use and 
non-use, that can be affected by pests, such as grasshoppers (Rashford et al, 2012).  
Agriculture is an important part of Eastern Oregon’s economy and landscape. More than half the 
area is used for cropland or rangeland (Meacham et. al. 2001). Croplands are concentrated on the 
Columbia Plateau with other small, scattered pockets of mainly irrigated cropland in arable valleys. 
Crop growers in areas adjacent to possible suppression areas grow feed for dairies and feedlots as 
well as high value crop such as potatoes, sugar beets, wheat, barley, oats, hay, grass seed, and a 
variety of other crops. Grain production is concentrated on the Columbia Plateau. Umatilla county 
also produces alfalfa, corn, and potatoes. Central Oregon counties produce a variety of vegetable 
seeds, mint, grain, and hay. Malheur County is a major producer of seed crops, potatoes, onions 
and sugar beets. Tree fruit production is important in Wasco and Umatilla Counties (Bradbury 
2001). Processing plants add value in several of the rural communities. 
Livestock grazing is one of the primary uses of rangeland in the area, and is the dominate 
agricultural activity in many areas, including Harney and Lake Counties. Livestock enterprises 
include rangeland grazing by cattle, sheep, and horses; feedlots for beef; and concentrated dairy 
`

and hog farms. Rangeland may be utilized for grazing during the summer or reserved for fall and 
winter grazing.

and hog farms. Rangeland may be utilized for grazing during the summer or reserved for fall and 
winter grazing. 
There is a significant amount of acreage in organic production in the area. In 2019, there was 
196,000 acres in production yielding $454,000 in sales statewide (USDA ERS). 
Beekeepers maintain hives to produce honey and other bee products in central and eastern Oregon, 
especially near crop production areas. Alfalfa, seed crops, and tree fruits rely on pollination 
services from bees, including native bees, which may nest or forage on or near proposed 
suppression areas. Alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata, are intensively managed solitary 
bees used in the production of alfalfa seed. 
Much of the land in the seven counties considered in this EA are publicly owned. They contain 
parts of Malheur, Umatilla, Wallowa-Whitman, Fremont-Winema National Forests which are 
administered by USDA Forest Service (USFS). (Grasshopper outbreaks have not been associated 
with these areas. USFS entomologists are aware of the APHIS grasshopper program, no requests 
for assistance have come from this federal land manager in Oregon.) USFWS administers the Hart 
Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), McKay Creek 
NWR, Cold Springs NWR, and Umatilla NWR. Currently, coordination with APHIS is limited to 
grasshopper survey and outreach only for any NWRs in Oregon. The BLM administers much of the

grasshopper survey and outreach only for any NWRs in Oregon. The BLM administers much of the 
public rangeland in the southeast and south-central part of Oregon.  
Though typically not recreation destinations of note, the public may use some rangelands in the 
seven counties of Oregon included in this EA for a variety of recreational purposes including: 
hiking, horseback riding, camping, fishing, swimming, hot-springs soaking, astronomy, 
photography, general wildlife viewing and bird watching, insect, plant, rock or fossil collecting, 
archeology, hunting, shooting, archery, falconry, road or mountain biking, off-roading, and even 
rocketry. Members of the public may traverse rangelands in or near the proposed suppression area 
by various means including on foot, horseback, all-terrain vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, four-
wheel drive vehicles, snowmobiles, and aircraft, though trails and roads are relatively sparse.  
6. Cultural Resources and Events 
Executive Order 13175 "Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments," calls for 
agency communication and collaboration with tribal officials when proposed Federal actions have 
potential tribal implications. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. §§ 
470aa-mm), secures the protection of archaeological resources and sites on public and tribal lands. 
Prior to the treatment season, program personnel notify Tribal land managers of the potential for 
grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks on their lands. Consultation with local Tribal

 tribal implications. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. §§ 
470aa-mm), secures the protection of archaeological resources and sites on public and tribal lands. 
Prior to the treatment season, program personnel notify Tribal land managers of the potential for 
grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks on their lands. Consultation with local Tribal 
representatives takes place prior to treatment programs to inform fully the Tribes of possible 
actions APHIS may take on Tribal lands. Treatments typically do not occur at cultural sites, and 
drift from a program treatment at such locations is not expected to adversely affect natural surfaces, 
such as rock formations and carvings. APHIS would also confer with the appropriate Tribal 
authority to ensure that the timing and location of a planned program treatment does not coincide 
or conflict with cultural events or observances on Tribal lands. 
Federal actions must seek to avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential negative impacts to cultural 
and historic resources as part of compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 
the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, and NEPA. Section 106 of the NHPA 
requires Federal agencies to provide the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation with an 
opportunity to comment on their findings.

Cultural and historical sites include locations and artifacts associated with Native Americans, 
explorers, pioneers, religious groups and developers. Native American petroglyphs have been 
discovered in several areas within the proposed suppression area, as have artifacts from knapping 
(stone tool making). Elements of the Oregon Trail transect portions of the proposed suppression 
area, and monuments have been erected in several places. Museums, displays, and structures

area, and monuments have been erected in several places. Museums, displays, and structures 
associated with mining, logging, Japanese internment camps, and irrigation development exist in 
Central and Eastern Oregon. 
As described by the Oregon Secretary of State (sos.oregon.gov/), central and eastern Oregon 
includes sovereign tribal governments with land holdings and protected cultural rights, including:  
The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs has a reported tribal member population of 5,363 and a 
1019 square mile reservation, primarily in Wasco and Jefferson counties. 
The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation has 3,152 enrolled members and a 
172,000 acre reservation in Umatilla county.  
The Burns Paiute Tribe has 420 members, a 13,736 acre reservation in Harney county. 
The Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Tribe’s reservation straddles the Oregon-Nevada border, 
18,829 acres are in Oregon in Malheur county.  
The Klamath Tribes, 5,200 members, exercise court affirmed treaty rights within the 1954 former 
Klamath Reservation Boundary, approximately 1.8 million acres in the northern half of the county. 
This area includes the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge and large portions of the 
Freemont-Winema Forests. In addition to treaty resources in this area, cultural resources and tribal 
traditional use areas extend beyond the 1954 Reservation Boundary to the aboriginal homelands of 
the Klamath Tribes.

the Klamath Tribes.  
The 1855 Treaty that created the Warm Springs and Umatilla Reservations reserved specific rights 
including the right to hunt and gather traditional foods and medicines on open and unclaimed lands. 
These rights are generally referred to as ‘Treaty reserved rights’ and extend to approximately 16.4 
million acres of ceded land in Washington and Oregon.  
Other Native Americans may practice traditional food and medicine gathering in or near proposed 
suppression areas.  
7. Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
Executive Order No. 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety 
Risks: 
The increased scientific knowledge about the environmental health risks and safety risks associated 
with hazardous substance exposures to children and recognition of these issues in Congress and 
Federal agencies brought about legislation and other requirements to protect the health and safety 
of children. On April 21, 1997, President Clinton signed E.O. 13045, Protection of Children From 
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks (62 FR 19885). This E.O. requires each Federal 
agency, consistent with its mission, to identify and assess environmental health risks and safety 
risks that may disproportionately affect children and to ensure that its policies, programs, activities, 
and standards address those risks. APHIS has developed agency guidance for its programs to 
follow to ensure the protection of children (USDA, APHIS, 1999).

risks that may disproportionately affect children and to ensure that its policies, programs, activities, 
and standards address those risks. APHIS has developed agency guidance for its programs to 
follow to ensure the protection of children (USDA, APHIS, 1999).   
Children, along with the general populus, in or near rangeland areas likely to have grasshopper 
outbreaks and potential suppression treatments are quite low; and further would have all the 
`  
Page | 72 
 
protective measures that area standardized to protect humans from any program hazards, such as 
buffering of any houses, schools, churches or other areas of potential human congregation.  
E. Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives 
Each alternative described in this EA potentially has adverse environmental effects. The general 
environmental impacts of each alternative are discussed in detail in the 2019 programmatic EIS 
published by APHIS. The specific impacts of the alternatives are highly dependent upon the 
particular action and location of the grasshopper infestation. The principal concerns associated with 
the alternatives are: (1) the potential effects of insecticides on human health (including 
subpopulations that might be at increased risk); and (2) impacts of insecticides on nontarget 
organisms (including threatened and endangered species).   
APHIS has written human health and ecological risk assessments (HHERAs) to assess the 
insecticides and use patterns that are specific to the program. The risk assessments provide an in-
depth technical analysis of the potential impacts of each insecticide to human health, non-target 
wildlife, and its environmental fate in soil, air, and water. The assessments rely on data required by 
USEPA for pesticide product registrations, as well as peer-reviewed and other published literature.
Text Len: 1858

 and use patterns that are specific to the program. The risk assessments provide an in-
depth technical analysis of the potential impacts of each insecticide to human health, non-target 
wildlife, and its environmental fate in soil, air, and water. The assessments rely on data required by 
USEPA for pesticide product registrations, as well as peer-reviewed and other published literature. 
The HHERAs are heavily referenced in the 2019 EIS and this Draft EA is likewise tiered to that 
analysis (USDA APHIS, 2019a, 2019bC). These Environmental Documents can be found at our 
program website: www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-health/grasshopper.  
The program suppresses grasshopper populations on a small portion of the area considered by this 
EA in any given year. In those control treatment areas substantial portions are excluded from direct 
insecticide applications because of buffers around sensitive sites and the alternating spray and skip 
swaths inherent in the RAATs method. The potential harmful effects from the program activities on 
environmental components and nontarget species populations occur in a small portion of the area 
considered by this EA and for a limited duration. Site-specific environmental consequences of the 
alternatives are discussed below. 
1. Alternative 1 - No Suppression Program Alternative 
a) Grasshopper Population Control 
Under this alternative, APHIS would not conduct a program to suppress grasshoppers other than 
provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the implementation of IPM strategies by land 
managers. When cultural or mechanical methods have failed to prevent harmful grasshopper 
populations Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, 
private groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort.

provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the implementation of IPM strategies by land 
managers. When cultural or mechanical methods have failed to prevent harmful grasshopper 
populations Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, 
private groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort. 
Without the coordination that APHIS provides during grasshopper outbreaks, the land managers 
and owners could use insecticides that APHIS considers too environmentally harsh. Multiple 
treatments and excessive amount of insecticide could be applied in efforts to suppress or even 
locally eradicate grasshopper populations. There are approximately 100 pesticide products 
registered by USEPA for use on rangelands and against grasshoppers (Purdue University, 2018). 
Without APHIS’ coordination and funding of grasshopper suppression programs in Oregon the 
responsibility would rest with the BLM, Oregon Department of Agriculture, tribal or municipal 
governments and industry groups to coordinate and perform grasshopper control treatments. The 
conventions of IPM APHIS has incorporated into our standard program procedures could be too 
burdensome for other agencies to observe. While the economic benefits of suppressing 
grasshoppers by using a RAATs method have been widely publicized, less frequent treatments by 
`  
Page | 73 
 
other agencies might encourage widespread complete coverage treatments to ‘eradicate’ 
grasshopper populations or prophylactically treat areas with minimal survey efforts. Adverse 
environmental effect particularly on nontarget species, could be much greater than under the 
APHIS led suppression program alternative due to lack of operational knowledge or coordination 
among the groups.

planning,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 treat areas with minimal survey efforts. Adverse 
environmental effect particularly on nontarget species, could be much greater than under the 
APHIS led suppression program alternative due to lack of operational knowledge or coordination 
among the groups.  
(1) Human Health 
Human exposure and health risks could increase because of the inexperience of other agencies in 
planning, contracting and monitoring treatments. APHIS hygiene and safety protocols establish 
procedures for use of personal protection equipment and handling of hazardous chemicals. Other 
less experienced agencies might underestimate potential worker or bystander exposures, increasing 
health risks.  
(2) Nontarget Species 
Grasshopper treatment programs could occur with more random frequency as various agencies 
allocate funding when it is available. These programs would almost certainly not have the same 
procedures and safeguards incorporated into the APHIS program. The possibility of multiple 
agencies with overlapping jurisdictions could result in multiple treatments per year with the same 
or incompatible insecticides. This overlapping of treatments could cause synergistic chemical 
interactions and more severe effects to nontarget species. It is also unlikely the other agencies will 
be equally equipped as APHIS to incorporate guidance and species location information from 
USFWS. Therefore, adverse effects on protected species and their critical habitat could increase. 
(3) Physical Environment Components 
The potential grasshopper control conducted by third parties could result in increases and a greater 
variety of pesticide residues in the environment. As noted previously, APHIS can only speculate 
which agencies and land owners will decide to control grasshoppers and what chemicals will be 
used. The program has also established treatment restriction buffers around water bodies to protect 
those features from insecticide drift and runoff. The labels for all program insecticides prohibit 
direct application to water (defined as reservoirs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 residues in the environment. As noted previously, APHIS can only speculate 
which agencies and land owners will decide to control grasshoppers and what chemicals will be 
used. The program has also established treatment restriction buffers around water bodies to protect 
those features from insecticide drift and runoff. The labels for all program insecticides prohibit 
direct application to water (defined as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by seasonal streams, 
springs, wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers). APHIS maintains the following additional 
buffers for water bodies that are not designated critical habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot 
buffer for aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground sprays, and a 50-foot buffer for bait applications 
(USDA APHIS, 2013). Almost certainly land management agencies and property owners would 
not observe the same buffers to prevent accidental spray drift to sensitive environments.  
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
In the absence of an APHIS administered grasshopper suppression program the cost of treatments 
would be paid entirely by land management agencies and land owners. Ranchers that lease land for 
grazing livestock might also have to pay third parties to protect rangeland forage from grasshopper 
outbreaks. These additional expenses would increase the cost of rangeland leases and production of 
livestock in general. Rural economies that depend on ranching and farming would experience 
increased economic hardship. The economic effects of infrequent and haphazard grasshopper 
treatments on rangeland forage could be similar to those described below for a scenario where no 
treatments occur.  
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
`

with

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
requent and haphazard grasshopper 
treatments on rangeland forage could be similar to those described below for a scenario where no 
treatments occur.  
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
`  
Page | 74 
 
The potential grasshopper control conducted by third parties might or might not be coordinated 
with Tribes and other cultural or historical observance events. It is reasonable to assume Tribal 
interests would ensure grasshopper treatments would not interfere with events or occur in areas of 
cultural significance.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
Grasshopper suppression programs are likely to occur in the same rural rangeland areas that are 
largely uninhabited. No matter who conducts the treatments, disproportionately high and adverse 
human health or environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a 
program area are unlikely.  
Likewise, potential grasshopper control programs would be conducted in rural rangeland areas, 
where agriculture is a primary industry. These areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural 
dwellings in ranching communities with low population density. The other agencies and land 
owners might notify residents within treatment areas to reduce the potential for incidental exposure 
to residents including children. None the less, treatments would occur on open rangelands where 
children would not be expected to be present during treatment or to enter should there be any 
restricted entry period after treatment. The APHIS grasshopper program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA AP

 period after treatment. The APHIS grasshopper program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA APHIS, 2016). There is a reasonable expectation that treatments 
conducted by third parties would also avoid spraying chemicals where children are present or 
congregate.  
b) No Grasshopper Population Control 
Conversely, in the absence of an APHIS funded grasshopper suppression program the most likely 
environmental effects would result from other agencies and land managers not controlling 
outbreaks. As noted, grasshoppers consuming vast amounts of vegetation in rangelands and 
surrounding areas. Grasshoppers are generalist feeders, eating grasses and forbs first and often 
moving to cultivated crops. High grasshopper density of one or several species and the resulting 
defoliation may reach an economic threshold where the damage caused by grasshoppers exceeds 
the cost of controlling the grasshoppers. Researchers determined that during typical grasshopper 
infestation years, approximately 20% of forage on western rangeland is removed, valued at a 
estimated cost of $1.2 billion per year (Hewitt & Onsager, 1983; dollar amount adjusted). This 
value represents 32 to 63% of the total value of rangeland across the western states (Rashford et al, 
2012). Other market and non-market values such as carbon sequestration, general ecosystem 
services, and recreational use may also be impacted by grasshopper outbreaks in rangeland.

2012). Other market and non-market values such as carbon sequestration, general ecosystem 
services, and recreational use may also be impacted by grasshopper outbreaks in rangeland. 
(1) Human Health 
The risk of accidental exposure to insecticides would be reduced if no grasshopper control 
programs are implemented by APHIS or third parties. Grasshopper outbreaks could cause other 
health hazards including increased runoff, dust storms and road hazards.  
(2) Nontarget Species 
Vegetation damage during serious grasshopper outbreaks may be so severe that all grasses and 
forbs are destroyed causing impaired plant growth for several years. Rare plants may be consumed 
`  
Page | 75 
 
during critical times of their development such as during seed production, and loss of important 
plant species, or seed production may lead to reduced biological diversity of the rangeland habitats, 
potentially creating opportunities for the expansion of invasive and exotic weeds (Lockwood and 
Latchininsky, 2000). Rangeland herbivorous wildlife would have to migrate or suffer food 
shortages caused by the loss of forage. 
(3) Physical Environment Components 
When grasshoppers consume plant cover, soil is more susceptible to the drying effects of the sun, 
making plant roots less capable of holding soil in place. Soil damage results in erosion and 
disruption of nutrient cycling, water infiltration, seed germination, and other ecological processes 
which are important components of rangeland ecosystems (Latchininsky et al, 2011). A reduction

 place. Soil damage results in erosion and 
disruption of nutrient cycling, water infiltration, seed germination, and other ecological processes 
which are important components of rangeland ecosystems (Latchininsky et al, 2011). A reduction 
vegetation will make steep rangeland topography more susceptible to erosion which would cause 
additional sediment loading in streams, rivers, and other water bodies. This would result in a 
decrease in water quality. Likewise the denuded rangeland caused by poor grasshopper control 
would have less evapotranspiration, lower humidity, and higher daily temperature ranges. During 
windstorms the dry soil would be more likely to allow soil particles to become airborne and result 
in poor air quality and possibly health and other physical hazards to humans.  
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
When the density of grasshoppers reaches economic injury levels, grasshoppers begin to compete 
with livestock for food by reducing available forage (Wakeland and Shull, 1936; Belovsky, 2000; 
Pfadt, 2002; Branson et al, 2006; Bradshaw et al, 2018). Ranchers could offset some of the costs by 
leasing rangeland in another area and relocating their livestock, finding other means to feed their 
animals by purchasing hay or grain, or selling their livestock. Local communities and families with 
ranching based incomes could see adverse economic impacts. Grasshoppers that infest rangeland 
could move to surrounding croplands. Crop agriculture farmers could incur economic losses from 
attempts to chemically control grasshopper populations or due to the loss of their crops. The 
general public could see an increase in the cost of meat, crops, and other agricultural products.

 rangeland 
could move to surrounding croplands. Crop agriculture farmers could incur economic losses from 
attempts to chemically control grasshopper populations or due to the loss of their crops. The 
general public could see an increase in the cost of meat, crops, and other agricultural products. 
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
The lack of grasshopper treatments would reduce the possibility of accidental spraying by third 
parties of cultural resources and during activities observing cultural or historically significant 
events. Grasshopper outbreak populations could reduce recreational and cultural uses of rangeland. 
Uncontrolled grasshopper populations would make these effects more severe.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
The risk of accidental human exposure to insecticides would be reduced if no grasshopper control 
programs are implemented by APHIS or third parties.  
As previously noted, the general public could see an increase in the cost of meat, crops, and other 
agricultural products. Low-income populations would suffer greater relative economic hardship 
from this increase in food prices, especially where grocery shopping choices are limited by longer 
travel between small rural villages. Likewise, the cost of food staples for families with children 
could increase.

2. Alternative 2 -Insecticide Applications at Reduced Agent Area 
Treatments with Adaptive Management Strategy 
Under Alternative 2, APHIS would participate in grasshopper programs with the option of using 
one of the insecticides (carbaryl bait or ULV diflubenzuron) depending upon the various factors 
related to the grasshopper outbreak and the site-specific characteristics. The use of an insecticide 
would typically occur at reduced pesticide rate and treatment area following the RAATs strategy.

 in grasshopper programs with the option of using 
one of the insecticides (carbaryl bait or ULV diflubenzuron) depending upon the various factors 
related to the grasshopper outbreak and the site-specific characteristics. The use of an insecticide 
would typically occur at reduced pesticide rate and treatment area following the RAATs strategy. 
APHIS would apply a single treatment to affected rangeland areas to suppress grasshopper 
outbreak populations by a range of 35 to 98 percent, depending upon the insecticide used.   
a) Carbaryl 
Carbaryl is a member of the N-methyl carbamate class of insecticides, which affect the nervous 
system via cholinesterase inhibition. Inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) causes 
nervous system signals to persist longer than normal. While these effects are desired in controlling 
insects, they can have undesirable impacts to non-target organisms that are exposed.  
(1) Human Health 
Carbaryl can cause cholinesterase inhibition (i.e., overstimulate the nervous system) in humans 
resulting in nausea, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and mental confusion, as well as convulsions, 
coma, and respiratory depression at high levels of exposure (NIH, 2009; Beauvais, 2014). USEPA 
classifies carbaryl as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans” based on vascular tumors in mice 
(USEPA, 2007, 2015a, 2017).  
USEPA regulates the amount of pesticide residues that can remain in or on food or feed 
commodities as the result of a pesticide application. The agency does this by setting a tolerance, 
which is the maximum residue level of a pesticide, usually measured in

 to humans” based on vascular tumors in mice 
(USEPA, 2007, 2015a, 2017).  
USEPA regulates the amount of pesticide residues that can remain in or on food or feed 
commodities as the result of a pesticide application. The agency does this by setting a tolerance, 
which is the maximum residue level of a pesticide, usually measured in parts per million (ppm), 
that can legally be present in food or feed. USEPA-registered carbaryl products used by the 
grasshopper program are labeled with rates and treatment intervals that are meant to protect 
livestock and keep chemical residues in cattle at acceptable levels (thereby protecting human 
health). While livestock and horses may graze on rangeland the same day that the land is sprayed, 
in order to keep tolerances to acceptable levels, carbaryl spray applications on rangeland are 
limited to half a pound active ingredient per acre per year (USEPA, 2012a). The grasshopper 
program would treat at or below use rates that appear on the label, as well as follow all appropriate 
label mitigations, which would ensure residues are below the tolerance levels. 
Adverse human health effects from the proposed program bait applications of the carbaryl 5% 
formulations to control grasshoppers are not expected based on low potential for human exposure 
to carbaryl and the favorable environmental fate and effects data. Technical grade (approximately 
100% of the insecticide product is composed of the active ingredient) carbaryl exhibits moderate 
acute oral toxicity in rats, low acute dermal toxicity in rabbits, and very low acute inhalation 
toxicity in rats. Technical carbaryl is not a primary eye or skin irritant in rabbits and is not a dermal 
sensitization in guinea pig (USEPA, 2007). This data can be

acute oral toxicity in rats, low acute dermal toxicity in rabbits, and very low acute inhalation 
toxicity in rats. Technical carbaryl is not a primary eye or skin irritant in rabbits and is not a dermal 
sensitization in guinea pig (USEPA, 2007). This data can be extrapolated and applied to humans 
revealing low health risks associated with carbaryl. 
The proposed use of carbaryl bait, use of RAATs, and adherence to label requirements, 
substantially reduces the potential for exposure to humans. Program workers are the most likely 
human population to be exposed. APHIS does not expect adverse health risks to workers based on 
low potential for exposure to liquid carbaryl when applied according to label directions and use of 
personal protective equipment (e.g., long-sleeved shirt and long pants, shoes plus socks, chemical-
`  
Page | 77 
 
resistant gloves, and chemical-resistant apron) (USEPA, 2012a) during loading and applications. 
APHIS quantified the potential health risks associated with accidental worker exposure to carbaryl 
during mixing, loading, and applications. The quantitative risk evaluation results indicate no 
concerns for adverse health risk for program workers (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-
health/grasshopper). 
Adherence to label requirements and additional program measures designed to reduce exposure to 
workers and the public (e.g., mitigations to protect water sources, mitigations to limit spray drift, 
and restricted-entry intervals) result in low health risk to all human population segments.

 to reduce exposure to 
workers and the public (e.g., mitigations to protect water sources, mitigations to limit spray drift, 
and restricted-entry intervals) result in low health risk to all human population segments. 
(2) Nontarget Species 
The APHIS HHERA assessed available laboratory studies regarding the toxicity of carbaryl on fish 
and wildlife. In summary, the document indicates the chemical is highly toxic to insects, including 
native bees, honeybees, and aquatic insects; slightly to highly toxic to fish; highly to very highly 
toxic to most aquatic crustaceans, moderately toxic to mammals, minimally toxic to birds; 
moderately to highly toxic to several terrestrial arthropod predators; and slightly to highly toxic to 
larval amphibians (USDA APHIS, 2019a). However, adherence to label requirements and 
additional program measures designed to prevent carbaryl from reaching sensitive habitats or 
mitigate exposure of non-target organisms will reduce environmental effects of treatments.  
Acute and chronic risks to mammals are expected to be low to moderate based on the available 
toxicity data and conservative assumptions that were used to evaluate risk. There is the potential 
for impacts to small mammal populations that rely on terrestrial invertebrates for food. However, 
based on the toxicity data for terrestrial plants, minimal risks of indirect effects are expected to 
mammals that rely on plant material for food. Carbaryl has a reported half-life on vegetation of 
three to ten days, suggesting mammal exposure would be short-term. Direct risks to mammals from 
carbaryl bait applications is expected to be minimal based on oral, dermal, and inhalation studies 
(USDA APHIS, 2019a). 
A number of studies have reported no effects on bird populations in areas treated with carbaryl

 half-life on vegetation of 
three to ten days, suggesting mammal exposure would be short-term. Direct risks to mammals from 
carbaryl bait applications is expected to be minimal based on oral, dermal, and inhalation studies 
(USDA APHIS, 2019a). 
A number of studies have reported no effects on bird populations in areas treated with carbaryl 
(Buckner et al, 1973; Richmond et al, 1979; McEwen et al, 1996). Some applications of formulated 
carbaryl were found to cause depressed AChE levels (Zinkl et al, 1977); however, the doses were 
twice those proposed for the full coverage application in the grasshopper program. 
Several field studies that assist in determining impacts of carbaryl on aquatic invertebrates and fish 
have been published (Relyea and Diecks, 2008; USDA FS, 2008a; NMFS, 2009) and are 
summarized in the 2019 EIS. The value of these studies is limited because they all had dosing 
levels or frequencies that are much higher than would occur in the grasshopper program. 
While sublethal effects have been noted in fish with depressed AChE, as well as some impacts to 
amphibians (i.e. days to metamorphosis) and aquatic invertebrates in the field due to carbaryl, the 
application rates and measured aquatic residues observed in these studies are well above values that 
would be expected from current program operations. Indirect risks to amphibian and fish species 
can occur through the loss of habitat or reduction in prey, yet data suggests that carbaryl risk to 
aquatic plants that may serve as habitat, or food, for fish and aquatic invertebrates is very low.

 from current program operations. Indirect risks to amphibian and fish species 
can occur through the loss of habitat or reduction in prey, yet data suggests that carbaryl risk to 
aquatic plants that may serve as habitat, or food, for fish and aquatic invertebrates is very low. 
The majority of rangeland plants require insect-mediated pollination. Native, solitary bee species 
are important pollinators on western rangeland (Tepedino, 1979). Potential negative effects of 
insecticides on pollinators are of concern because a decrease in their numbers has been associated 
with a decline in fruit and seed production of plants.

Research from Gao et al (2022) found that chronic exposure to Carbaryl led to several negative 
effects on adult bees including impacts on nesting performance, foraging ability and gut microbial 
community. The researchers posited the no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of the 
chronic toxicity test of carbaryl (5 mg/L) to A. mellifera larvae were much higher than the field-
realistic levels as well as the residual levels detected in bee products. They designed this study to 
expand the risk assessment to the chronic effects of carbaryl on the transcriptional and metabolic 
level of A. mellifera larvae at the concentration where no adverse reactions were observed. 
Stock solution of carbaryl was prepared by dissolving the powder in acetone and then diluted with 
normal components of bee diet (50% royal jelly, 2% yeast extract, 9% d-glucose, 9% d-fructose). 
The final concentration of 2 mg/L carbaryl was applied to the third instar larvae for four days and 
correspond to the NOAEC determined in a previous study from the researchers (Yang et.al

normal components of bee diet (50% royal jelly, 2% yeast extract, 9% d-glucose, 9% d-fructose). 
The final concentration of 2 mg/L carbaryl was applied to the third instar larvae for four days and 
correspond to the NOAEC determined in a previous study from the researchers (Yang et.al. 2019). 
However, they noted the carbaryl concentration on developing larvae was 48 times the maximum 
residual value in nectar or honey.    
Carbaryl exposure at the NOAEC disrupted the transcriptional and metabolic regulatory networks 
of bees, even though no adverse physiological effects were observed in exposed larvae. 
Metabolome analysis showed that carbaryl treatment led to reduction of amino acids, accumulation 
of nucleic acid components, and disturbed flavonoids and fatty acids in exposed larvae which 
would suggest that chronic exposure to carbaryl might change internal metabolism in bee larvae 
(Gao et al, 2022). 
Research from Novotny et al in a preprint manuscript found that pesticides that are traditionally 
considered contact-based and applied when flowers are unopened can reach pollen and nectar and 
produce measurable risk to bees. The persistence of some agrochemicals in leaves, pollen, and 
nectar up to a week following application merits consideration when managing pollinator-
dependent crops. They analyzed residues of three insecticides (carbaryl, lambda-cyhalothrin, 
permethrin) and three fungicides (chlorothalonil, quinoxyfen, triflumizole) in pumpkin leaves, 
pollen, and nectar collected from five farms in the north-central United States, one day before a 
spray event, and one, three, and seven days after. Bees foraging on pumpkin flowers were

pollen, and nectar collected from five farms in the north-central United States, one day before a 
spray event, and one, three, and seven days after. Bees foraging on pumpkin flowers were collected 
one day before and one day after spraying and screened for the same pesticides. Chemical 
concentrations and application rates were decided by the farmer based on what a typical schedule 
would look like. The pumpkin seeds had a systemic treatment containing three fungicides and the 
neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam.  
The octanol-water partition coefficient (logKow) is the relative concentration of a chemical in n-
octanol versus water at pH 7, 20°C. Higher values of logKow indicate greater lipophilicity (and a 
lower affinity for water). Since carbaryl has a logKow value of 2.36 the chemical is less likely to 
adsorb and accumulate in lipid-rich plant tissues such as cuticular waxes or pollen. A chemical’s 
ionizability is given as pKa, the pH at which a chemical is 50% ionized, or in equilibrium between 
its undissociated and ionized state (calculated as the negative base-10 logarithm of the acid 
dissociation constant at 25°C). Chemicals with pKa < 7 are most likely to reach vascular tissue and 
mobilize systemically throughout the plant. A ‘neutral’ pKa indicates the chemical does not ionize 
under relevant plant conditions. Carbaryl does not offer systemic insecticidal protection because 
the chemical has a pKa of 10.4. However, carbaryl has a molecular weight of

 Chemicals with pKa < 7 are most likely to reach vascular tissue and 
mobilize systemically throughout the plant. A ‘neutral’ pKa indicates the chemical does not ionize 
under relevant plant conditions. Carbaryl does not offer systemic insecticidal protection because 
the chemical has a pKa of 10.4. However, carbaryl has a molecular weight of 201.2 g/mol well 
below 800 g/mol, the molecular weight typical of chemicals that are able to penetrate plant cuticles 
(University of Hertfordshire Agriculture and Environment Research Unit. Pesticide properties 
database (PPDB). 2024. [Cited 1 March 2024]. Available from: http://sitem.herts.ac.uk). 
The researchers found foliar insecticide and fungicide spray residues were detected more 
frequently and in greater concentrations in pumpkin leaves than in pollen, nectar, or foraging bees 
`  
Page | 79 
 
and insecticide concentrations in leaves often exceeded levels of concern. However, the risk indices 
used to examine pollinator exposure against the levels of concern assume that a foraging bee would 
actually come into contact with all the chemical present on or in the leaf sample.   
Carbaryl applied to foliage was present in some plant pollen and nectar samples, and in two or the 
69 bee samples (male X. pruinosa) collected one day after a spraying event. The researchers noted 
the bees that tested positive (male squash bees) have life history traits that bring them into 
prolonged contact with sprayed crop plants. Typically, either the proportion of contaminated 
samples or the maximum concentration of insecticides in pumpkin tissues decreased over the week 
following foliar application. For example, one day after application of carbaryl spray 43% of nectar

 bees that tested positive (male squash bees) have life history traits that bring them into 
prolonged contact with sprayed crop plants. Typically, either the proportion of contaminated 
samples or the maximum concentration of insecticides in pumpkin tissues decreased over the week 
following foliar application. For example, one day after application of carbaryl spray 43% of nectar 
samples tested positive for the insecticide, but carbaryl was not present in nectar samples collected 
one week later. However, the pretreatment data suggested carbaryl residues can persist longer than 
a week in leaves and pollen.   
Carbaryl has only moderate lipophilicity (logKOW = 2.4), giving it more potential to mobilize 
vascularly and be incorporated into developing floral tissue. Consistent with this reasoning, the 
researchers recorded a five-fold increase in carbaryl concentrations in pollen from the first to the 
third day after treatment. Carbaryl has a low molecular weight and is a very weak acid. Therefore, 
the chemical can cross membranes and bind with compounds in plant cells with similar pH before 
it reaches phloem. These properties contribute to its persistence in leaves, instead of translocation 
to pollen and nectar that bees eat. However, this persistence prolongs pollinator risk of exposure. 
The high concentrations of carbaryl in leaves during the week after foliar spray led to the highest 
bee risk quotient values. As previously noted, the assessments may overestimate bee toxicity from 
leaf contact because they assume a bee receives the entire dose of chemical present in the leaf 
sample (Novotny et al, 2024).

 may overestimate bee toxicity from 
leaf contact because they assume a bee receives the entire dose of chemical present in the leaf 
sample (Novotny et al, 2024). 
Researchers analyzed persistence of pesticides in agroecosystems in the Emilia-Romagna region of 
northern Italy (Bogo et al, 2024). They investigated pesticide residue in beebread by analyzing 100 
samples collected in 25 BeeNet national monitoring project stations in March and June of 2021 and 
2022. They looked at the diversity and concentration of the chemicals, their correlation with land 
use, and the risk they posed to the bees. They calculated a toxicity-weighted concentration (TWC) 
of chemicals by computing the ratio between the measured concentration in beebread and the oral 
acute toxicity (LD50) of that chemical for bees. For risk evaluation a risk threshold was assigned by 
dividing the TWC by an order of magnitude to account for chemical degradation, harmful 
synergistic interaction with other chemicals and chronic exposure causing sublethal effects. The 
risk threshold was exceeded in four beebread samples out of 100; one for carbaryl, fipronil, 
imidacloprid and thiamethoxam (Bogo et al, 2024). 
Research from Nogrado et al (2019) investigated the effect of carbaryl pesticides on gut microbiota 
of honeybees, which had come in contact with rapeseed plants (Brassica napus) sprayed with 
carbaryl wettable powder. Honeybee colonies were placed in tunnels covering an area of 70 meters 
squared and containing Brassica napus. Negative controls were sprayed with tap water (400 L/ha),

us) sprayed with 
carbaryl wettable powder. Honeybee colonies were placed in tunnels covering an area of 70 meters 
squared and containing Brassica napus. Negative controls were sprayed with tap water (400 L/ha), 
while the experiments were sprayed with carbaryl (250 g a.i./ha in 400 L tap water/ha) during 
active flight of bees. Bees were collected from the negative control and the carbaryl-treated groups, 
after 2 hours of exposure. The unexposed bees harbored Alphaproteobacteria, which were absent 
in the exposed bees. Microorganisms found in honeybee guts such as Snodgrassella alvi and L. 
kullabergensis, however, were observed only in the exposed bees, but not in the unexposed bees. 
The difference between the two groups was distinctly recognized when copy numbers of 16S 
rRNA genes were compared by quantitative PCR. The researchers noted they could not conclude 
decisively that the differences in the composition of the gut microbial communities from the two 
`  
Page | 80 
 
groups can be attributed directly to the pesticide exposure. However other researchers (Raymann et 
al, 2017) have suggested that one difference between a healthy colony and a colony suffering from 
colony collapse disorder can be a decrease in Alphaproteobacteria in gut bacterial communities. 
Lastly, there were other bacteria that are not commonly found in the gut microbiota of honeybees 
could have been acquired from the environment and could be considered as opportunistic 
pathogens. These uncategorized bacteria were observed in more abundance in the exposed group as 
compared to the unexposed group. Klebsiella was only observed in the unexposed group, while

could have been acquired from the environment and could be considered as opportunistic 
pathogens. These uncategorized bacteria were observed in more abundance in the exposed group as 
compared to the unexposed group. Klebsiella was only observed in the unexposed group, while 
Cronobacter, Edwardsiella, Providencia, Serratia, Erwinia, and Pantoea were observed in the 
exposed group. The researchers suggested the uncategorized bacteria could probably be indicative 
of disruption of balance of gut microbiome or disease as mentioned in previous studies in relation 
to dysbiosis in the presence of a potential cause like chemicals. 
The researchers noted the analysis could measure endpoints of sublethal effects, but there is 
considerable uncertainty in how to relate to adverse effects. Furthermore, there is insufficient data 
to establish plausible adverse outcome pathways with consistent and reproducible linkages between 
molecular initiating events and key events across multiple levels of biological organization to an 
adverse effect at the whole organism or colony or population level (Nogrado.et.al.2019). 
Laboratory studies have indicated that bees can be harmed by acute exposures to carbaryl, but the 
studies were at rates above those proposed in the program. The chronic exposures and effects 
modelled in the studies described above are unlikely to result from one-time applications conducted 
by the program. Potential negative effects of grasshopper program insecticides on bee populations 
may also be mitigated by the more common use of carbaryl baits than the ULV spray formulation. 
Studies with carbaryl bran bait have found no sublethal effects on adults or larvae bees (Peach et al, 
1994, 1995). The reduced rates of carbaryl used in the program and the implementation of 
application buffers should significantly reduce exposure of pollinators to

may also be mitigated by the more common use of carbaryl baits than the ULV spray formulation. 
Studies with carbaryl bran bait have found no sublethal effects on adults or larvae bees (Peach et al, 
1994, 1995). The reduced rates of carbaryl used in the program and the implementation of 
application buffers should significantly reduce exposure of pollinators to carbaryl treatments for 
grasshopper suppression. In areas of direct application where impacts may occur, alternating 
swaths and reduced rates (i.e., RAATs) would reduce risk. The effects on pollinators resulting from 
control of rangeland grasshopper populations with carbaryl based insecticides are not expected to 
cause significant impacts to the human environment.  
(3) Physical Environment Components 
Temperature, pH, light, oxygen, and the presence of microorganisms and organic material are 
factors that contribute to how quickly carbaryl will degrade in water. Hydrolysis, the breaking of a 
chemical bond with water, is the primary degradation pathway for carbaryl at pH 7 and above. In 
natural water, carbaryl is expected to degrade faster than in laboratory settings due to the presence 
of microorganisms. The half-lives of carbaryl in natural waters varied between 0.3 to 4.7 days 
(Stanley and Trial, 1980; Bonderenko et al, 2004). Degradation in the latter study was temperature 
dependent with shorter half-lives at higher temperatures. Aerobic aquatic metabolism of carbaryl 
reported half-life ranged of 4.9 to 8.3 days compared to anaerobic (without oxygen) aquatic 
metabolism range of 15.3 to 72 days (Thomson and Strachan, 1981; USEPA, 2003). Carbaryl’s 
degradation in aerobic soil varies from rapid to slow
Text Len: 1701
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Aerobic aquatic metabolism of carbaryl 
reported half-life ranged of 4.9 to 8.3 days compared to anaerobic (without oxygen) aquatic 
metabolism range of 15.3 to 72 days (Thomson and Strachan, 1981; USEPA, 2003). Carbaryl’s 
degradation in aerobic soil varies from rapid to slow with half-lives ranging from 4 to 253 days 
(USEPA, 2017). Half-lives decrease with increasing pH from acidic to alkaline conditions. Under 
anaerobic soil conditions, carbaryl has a half-life of 72 days. Little transport of carbaryl through 
runoff or leaching to groundwater is expected due to the low water solubility, moderate sorption, 
and rapid degradation in soils. There are no reports of carbaryl detection in groundwater, and less 
than 1% of granule carbaryl applied to a sloping plot was detected in runoff (Caro et al, 1974).

Product use restrictions appear on the USEPA-approved label and attempt to keep carbaryl out of 
waterways. Carbaryl must not be applied directly to water, or to areas where surface water is 
present (USEPA, 2012a). The USEPA-approved use rates and patterns and the additional 
mitigations imposed by the grasshopper program, such as using RAATs and application buffers, 
where applicable, further minimize aquatic exposure and risk. 
It is unlikely that carbaryl will significantly vaporize from the soil, water, or treated surfaces 
(Dobroski et al, 1985). Carbaryl may be found in the atmosphere within air-borne particulates or as 
spray drift and can react with hydroxyl radicals in the ambient atmosphere (Kao, 1994). Once in

 exposure and risk. 
It is unlikely that carbaryl will significantly vaporize from the soil, water, or treated surfaces 
(Dobroski et al, 1985). Carbaryl may be found in the atmosphere within air-borne particulates or as 
spray drift and can react with hydroxyl radicals in the ambient atmosphere (Kao, 1994). Once in 
the air, carbaryl has a half-life of 1 to 4 months, however these minute amounts of carbaryl are not 
expected to reduce air quality. Carbaryl hydrolysis occurs quickly in natural waters with pH values 
of 7 or above, and the presence of microorganisms and organic material also contribute to the rapid 
degradation of the chemical. Adverse effects resulting from carbaryl contamination of water 
resources would harm aquatic organisms (described above) and would be temporary or de minimis.  
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
In addition to the environmental baseline conditions, APHIS also considers other factors such as 
pest population, pest life stage, pest and plant species affected, cost share with State and private 
landowners, and the cost benefit analysis of making a treatment. Because of the cost sharing private 
landowners and land managers typically would only use carbaryl to suppress rangeland 
grasshoppers and preserve forage for livestock. Insecticides applied using the RAATs strategy is 
expected to provide further economic advantages due to effective treatment at reduced costs. The 
economics of the RAATs strategy has been studied by both Foster et al (2000), and Lockwood and 
Schell (1997). In summarizing both studies (which used various rates of insecticide below the 
conventional rates for suppression of rangeland grasshoppers and treated less area), the results 
concluded that treatment costs, under this alternative, when compared to the costs

 the RAATs strategy has been studied by both Foster et al (2000), and Lockwood and 
Schell (1997). In summarizing both studies (which used various rates of insecticide below the 
conventional rates for suppression of rangeland grasshoppers and treated less area), the results 
concluded that treatment costs, under this alternative, when compared to the costs for conventional 
treatments for rangeland grasshopper infestations, were reduced 57 to 66% with carbaryl.  
Another potential economic benefit of chemical treatment of grasshoppers is to crop growers near 
rangelands. Carbaryl bait treatments are sometimes used to reduce the potential for rangeland 
grasshoppers to move to surrounding croplands. This would result in socioeconomic benefits 
because losses, and therefore costs, of meat, crops, and their byproducts should be reduced. 
Additionally, the suppressed grasshopper populations in rangeland surrounding croplands could 
mean less of a need for costly chemical treatments by crop farmers at these sites.  
There is the potential for organic farms adjacent to carbaryl applications in rangeland to control 
grasshopper outbreak populations. However, mitigations such as buffers are meant to protect 
adjacent environments from runoff and insecticide drift. These protective measures are expected to 
protect nearby organic farms, as well as other areas of concern, from the risk of inadvertent 
exposure to rangeland insecticide treatments. It is also likely the organic farms would also benefit 
economically from reductions in crop damage caused by grasshopper populations migrating from 
nearby rangeland. 
The suppression of grasshopper populations with carbaryl should benefit public uses rangelands for 
recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may temporarily 
lose the use

 also likely the organic farms would also benefit 
economically from reductions in crop damage caused by grasshopper populations migrating from 
nearby rangeland. 
The suppression of grasshopper populations with carbaryl should benefit public uses rangelands for 
recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may temporarily 
lose the use of rangeland during and directly after carbaryl insecticide applications. However, the 
preservation of vegetation is expected to benefit recreational activities in the long-term by 
preserving their aesthetic value. This in turn will also increase the economic value of the rangeland 
by preserving and improving recreational opportunities.

(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
There is the potential for impacts to cultural and historical resources if the proposed carbaryl 
treatments occur on or near historic trails or properties. If any proposed actions are at, or adjacent 
to, the site of a historic trail or property, APHIS will consult with the appropriate landowner or land 
management agency, the State Historic Preservation Office, any affected National Trail’s 
administrative office, or other appropriate agencies. Likewise, APHIS would coordinate the timing 
of treatments with Tribes or other cooperators to ensure carbaryl treatments would not occur during 
scheduled cultural events or ceremonies.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
APHIS uses carbaryl insecticide treatments to suppress grasshopper populations in rural rangeland 
areas that are largely uninhabited. Disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas,

aryl insecticide treatments to suppress grasshopper populations in rural rangeland 
areas that are largely uninhabited. Disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas, where 
agriculture is a primary industry. The areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural dwellings in 
ranching communities with low population density. The program notifies residents within 
treatment areas, or their designated representatives, prior to proposed operations to reduce the 
potential for incidental exposure to residents including children. Treatments are conducted 
primarily on open rangelands where children would not be expected to be present during treatment 
or to enter should there be any restricted entry period after treatment. The program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA APHIS, 2016).  
APHIS’ HHERA for carbaryl evaluated the potential exposure to each insecticide used in the 
program and risks associated with these insecticides to residents, including children. The HHERA 
suggest that no disproportionate risks to children, as part of the general public, are anticipated 
(USDA APHIS, 2019a). 
b) Diflubenzuron

supervision may make applications) registered with USEPA as an insect growth regulator. It

(USDA APHIS, 2019a). 
b) Diflubenzuron 
Diflubenzuron is a restricted use pesticide (only certified applicators or persons under their direct 
supervision may make applications) registered with USEPA as an insect growth regulator. It 
specifically interferes with chitin synthesis, the formation of the insect’s exoskeleton. Larvae of 
affected insects are unable to molt properly. While this effect is desirable in controlling certain 
insects, it can have undesirable impacts to non-target organisms that are exposed. 
(1) Human Health 
Adverse human health effects from ground or aerial ULV applications of diflubenzuron to control 
grasshoppers are not expected based on the chemical’s low acute toxicity and low potential for 
human exposure. Diflubenzuron has low acute dermal toxicity in rabbits and very low acute oral 
and inhalation toxicities in rats (USEPA, 2015b). The adverse health effects of diflubenzuron to 
mammals and humans involves damage to hemoglobin in blood and the transport of oxygen. 
Diflubenzuron causes the formation of methemoglobin. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin 
that is not able to transport oxygen (USDA FS, 2004). USEPA classifies diflubenzuron as non-
carcinogenic to humans (USEPA, 2015b).

The proposed use of diflubenzuron and adherence to label requirements substantially reduces the 
potential for exposure to humans and the environment. Program workers are the most likely to be

The proposed use of diflubenzuron and adherence to label requirements substantially reduces the 
potential for exposure to humans and the environment. Program workers are the most likely to be 
exposed by program applications of diflubenzuron. APHIS does not expect adverse health risks to 
workers based on low potential for exposure to diflubenzuron when applied according to label 
directions and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during applications (e.g., long sleeve 
shirt and pants, chemical-resistant gloves). APHIS quantified the potential risks associated with 
accidental exposure of diflubenzuron for workers during mixing, loading, and application based on 
proposed program uses. The quantitative risk evaluation results indicate no concerns for adverse 
health risk for program workers (USDA APHIS, 2019b). 
Dimilin® 2L is labeled with rates and treatment intervals that are meant to protect livestock and 
keep residues in cattle at acceptable levels (thereby, protecting human health). Tolerances are set 
for the amount of diflubenzuron that is allowed in cattle fat (0.05 ppm) and meat (0.05 ppm) (40 
CFR Parts 180.377). The grasshopper program would treat at application rates indicated on product 
labels or lower, which should ensure approved residues levels. 
Adverse health risk to the general public in treatment areas is not expected due to the low potential 
for exposure resulting from low population density in the treatment areas, adherence to label 
requirements, program measures designed to reduce exposure to the public, and low toxicity to 
mammals. APHIS treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas consisting of widely scattered,

single, rural dwellings in ranching communities, where agriculture is a primary industry. 
Applications are not made to farm buildings or homes. Program measures beyond those on the 
label require application buffers from structures as well as aquatic areas reducing the potential for 
exposure to the public from direct exposure due to drift and from drinking water sources. The 
quantitative risk evaluation results indicate no concerns for adverse health risk for humans (USDA 
APHIS, 2019b). 
(2) Nontarget Species 
APHIS’ literature review found that on an acute basis, diflubenzuron is considered toxic to some 
aquatic invertebrates and practically non-toxic to adult honeybees. However, diflubenzuron is toxic 
to larval honeybees (USEPA, 2018). It is slightly nontoxic to practically nontoxic to fish and birds 
and has very slight acute oral toxicity to mammals, with the most sensitive endpoint from exposure 
being methemoglobinemia. Minimal direct risk to amphibians and reptiles is expected, although 
there is some uncertainty due to lack of information (USDA APHIS, 2019b; USEPA, 2018). 
In a review of mammalian field studies, Dimilin® applications at a rate of 60 to 280 g a.i./ha had no 
effects on the abundance and reproduction in voles, field mice, and shrews (USDA FS, 2004). 
These rates are approximately three to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of information (USDA APHIS, 2019b; USEPA, 2018). 
In a review of mammalian field studies, Dimilin® applications at a rate of 60 to 280 g a.i./ha had no 
effects on the abundance and reproduction in voles, field mice, and shrews (USDA FS, 2004). 
These rates are approximately three to 16 times greater than the highest application rate proposed 
in the program. Potential indirect impacts from application of diflubenzuron on small mammals 
includes loss of habitat or food items. Mice on treated plots consumed fewer lepidopteran (order of 
insects that includes butterflies and moths) larvae compared to controls; however, the total amount 
of food consumed did not differ between treated and untreated plots. Body measurements, weight, 
and fat content in mice collected from treated and non-treated areas did not differ.  
Poisoning of insectivorous birds by diflubenzuron after spraying in orchards at labeled rates is 
unlikely due to low toxicity (Muzzarelli, 1986). The primary concern for bird species is related to 
an indirect effect on insectivorous species from a decrease in insect prey. At the proposed 
application rates, grasshoppers have the highest risk of being impacted while other taxa have a 
greatly reduced risk because the lack of effects seen in multiple field studies on other taxa of 
invertebrates at use rates much higher than those proposed for the program. Shifting diets in 
`

insectivorous birds in response to prey densities is not uncommon in undisturbed areas (Rosenberg 
et al, 1982; Cooper et al, 1990; Sample et al, 1993).

insectivorous birds in response to prey densities is not uncommon in undisturbed areas (Rosenberg 
et al, 1982; Cooper et al, 1990; Sample et al, 1993). 
Indirect risk to fish species can be defined as a loss of habitat or prey base that provides food and 
shelter for fish populations, however these impacts are not expected based on the available fish and 
invertebrate toxicity data (USDA APHIS, 2019b). A review of several aquatic field studies 
demonstrated that when effects were observed it was at diflubenzuron levels not expected from 
program activities (Fischer and Hall, 1992; USEPA, 1997; Eisler, 2000; USDA FS, 2004).  
Diflubenzuron applications have the potential to affect chitin production in various other beneficial 
terrestrial invertebrates. Multiple field studies in a variety of application settings, including 
grasshopper control, have been conducted regarding the impacts of diflubenzuron to terrestrial 
invertebrates. Based on the available data, sensitivity of terrestrial invertebrates to diflubenzuron is 
highly variable depending on which group of insects and which life stages are being exposed. 
Immature grasshoppers, beetle larvae, lepidopteran larvae, and chewing herbivorous insects appear 
to be more susceptible to diflubenzuron than other invertebrates. Within this group, however, 
grasshoppers appear to be more sensitive to the proposed use rates for the program. Honeybees, 
parasitic wasps, predatory insects, and sucking insects show greater tolerance to diflubenzuron 
exposure (Murphy et al,
Text Len: 1616
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to be more susceptible to diflubenzuron than other invertebrates. Within this group, however, 
grasshoppers appear to be more sensitive to the proposed use rates for the program. Honeybees, 
parasitic wasps, predatory insects, and sucking insects show greater tolerance to diflubenzuron 
exposure (Murphy et al, 1994; Eisler, 2000; USDA FS, 2004).  
Diflubenzuron is moderately toxic to spiders and mites (USDA APHIS, 2019c). Deakle and 
Bradley (1982) measured the effects of four diflubenzuron applications on predators of Heliothis 
spp. at a rate of 0.06 lb a.i./ac and found no effects on several predator groups. This supported 
earlier studies by Keever et al (1977) that demonstrated no effects on the arthropod predator 
community after multiple applications of diflubenzuron in cotton fields. Grasshopper IPM field 
studies have shown diflubenzuron to have a minimal impact on ants, spiders, predatory beetles, and 
scavenger beetles. There was no significant reduction in populations of these species from seven to 
76 days after treatment. Although ant populations exhibited declines of up to 50 percent, these 
reductions were temporary, and population recovery was described as immediate (Catangui et al, 
1996). 
Due to its mode of action, diflubenzuron has greater activity on immature stages of terrestrial 
invertebrates. Based on standardized laboratory testing diflubenzuron is considered practically non-
toxic to adult honeybees. The contact LD50 value for the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is reported at 
greater than 114.8 μg a.i./

 of action, diflubenzuron has greater activity on immature stages of terrestrial 
invertebrates. Based on standardized laboratory testing diflubenzuron is considered practically non-
toxic to adult honeybees. The contact LD50 value for the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is reported at 
greater than 114.8 μg a.i./bee while the oral LD50 value was reported at greater than 30 μg a.i./bee. 
USEPA (2018) reports diflubenzuron toxicity values to adult honeybees are typically greater than 
the highest test concentration using the end-use product or technical active ingredient. The lack of 
toxicity to honeybees, as well as other bees, in laboratory studies has been confirmed in additional 
studies (Nation et al, 1986; Chandel and Gupta, 1992; Mommaerts et al, 2006). Mommaerts et al 
and Thompson et al documented sublethal effects on reproduction-related endpoints for the bumble 
bee, Bombus terrestris and A. mellifera, respectively, testing a formulation of diflubenzuron. 
However, these effects were observed at much higher use rates relative to those used in the 
program. 
For example, in the Mommaerts et al study researchers exposed bees via a contact application of 
288 mg/L aqueous concentration which was topically applied to the dorsal thorax of each worker 
with a micropipette. Bumblebees also ingested orally sugar/water treated with the same 
concentration of diflubenzuron solution over a period of 11 weeks. Pollen was sprayed with the 
same concentration of diflubenzuron until saturation and then supplied to the nests. The bumble 
bees were not restricted in how much of

with a micropipette. Bumblebees also ingested orally sugar/water treated with the same 
concentration of diflubenzuron solution over a period of 11 weeks. Pollen was sprayed with the 
same concentration of diflubenzuron until saturation and then supplied to the nests. The bumble 
bees were not restricted in how much of these contaminated solutions they could consume. The 
researchers estimated mean LC50 concentrations based on the chronic exposure routes described 
`  
Page | 85 
 
above. These were 25 mg a.i/L dermal contact, 0.32 mg a.i/L ingested sugar-water, and 0.95 mg 
a.i/L pollen. The researchers noted, “In practice, bumblebees will rarely be exposed to such high 
concentrations,” and elaborated, “it is necessary that the laboratory-based results are validated with 
risk assessments for these insecticides in field related conditions.”    
APHIS believes conversion and comparison of program applied foliar spray rates to the 
concentrations of the solutions applied in this study would rely on unrealistic exposure scenarios. 
An exposure scenario where pollinators are exposed continuously for 11-weeks is not expected to 
occur in the APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression program. In field applications 
diflubenzuron levels would decline over the 11-week exposure period due to degradation, 
flowering plants that have diflubenzuron residues would no longer be available for foraging by 
pollinators as flowers naturally die and do not provide pollen and nectar, and other plants would 
bloom after application without residues of diflubenzuron.

 to degradation, 
flowering plants that have diflubenzuron residues would no longer be available for foraging by 
pollinators as flowers naturally die and do not provide pollen and nectar, and other plants would 
bloom after application without residues of diflubenzuron. 
Diflubenzuron has been associated with several potentially harmful effects on bees, even when 
mortality was not recorded. Research from Camp et al used Eastern bumble bee (Bombus 
impatiens) as surrogates to measure the effect that diflubenzuron has on bee behavior. 
Diflubenzuron (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1,000 µg/liter) was formulated as an emulsion of the sugar syrup 
with 0.5% (v/v) Honey-B-Healthy and 1% (v/v) acetone and was delivered in syrup feeders. Drone 
production was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner and the 42-d IC50 (half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration) was calculated to be 28.61 µg/liter diflubenzuron. They found that 
diflubenzuron delivered via dietary exposure of sucrose was associated with decreased pollen 
consumption and decreased drone production in bumble bee without there being a significant 
increase in adult mortalities. (Camp et al, 2020) 
However, the tested solutions of diflubenzuron in the supplied syrup and pollen are greater than the 
range of the pesticide applied during grasshopper suppression treatments. Diflubenzuron is applied 
once per year to foliar vegetation and only a miniscule proportion would be to flowers with nectar 
and pollen. In this experiment the bumble bees were fed syrup and pollen with fresh doses of

enzuron in the supplied syrup and pollen are greater than the 
range of the pesticide applied during grasshopper suppression treatments. Diflubenzuron is applied 
once per year to foliar vegetation and only a miniscule proportion would be to flowers with nectar 
and pollen. In this experiment the bumble bees were fed syrup and pollen with fresh doses of 
diflubenzuron three times per week. The same difficulty of applying this study’s findings to real 
field exposures, as is also the case with Mommaerts et.al., 2006, is described above. 
Research from Krueger et al showed that while diflubenzuron exposure didn’t impact bumble bee 
worker survival, the exposure did result in a significant decrease in drone emergence that is 
indicative of a greater sensitivity to diflubenzuron in the immature life stage. Microcolonies 
exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen (i.e. the pollen was contaminated with 10 parts per 
million of diflubenzuron) produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. 
(Krueger et al, 2021) 
A researcher found that exposure to diflubenzuron in a 10 ppm sucrose solution resulted in 
significant effect on the number of larvae successfully eclosing from eggs three days after 
collection. The researcher posited that bee embryos with poorly formed cuticle could initiate egg 
eclosion and perhaps complete it, though the survivorship of the resultant larvae would likely be 
compromised. The results she reported for diflubenzuron suggest that the larval cuticle was not 
developed, resulting in mortality before or during the hatching process, and that many of the larvae 
observed to have hatched may not have survived

eclosion and perhaps complete it, though the survivorship of the resultant larvae would likely be 
compromised. The results she reported for diflubenzuron suggest that the larval cuticle was not 
developed, resulting in mortality before or during the hatching process, and that many of the larvae 
observed to have hatched may not have survived to the later instar stages. Although the doses 
examined in this work may be high relative to what has been found inside of honeybee colonies, 
the exposure did not have an observable effect on egg production. However, successful hatching 
rates were significantly decreased in response to diflubenzuron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor (Fine 
2020).  
`  
Page | 86 
 
Further investigations examined two-generational effects to diflubenzuron administered at 1 ppm 
through the workers’ diet, thus exposing queens indirectly in a manner similar to what might occur 
in the field (Fine et al., 2023). The researchers tracked queen performance and worker responses to 
queens, then the performance of the exposed queens’ offspring was assessed to identify patterns 
that may contribute to the long-term health and stability of a social insect colony. 
None of the treatments had a significant effect on the total number of eggs laid. Treated worker 
diets had no effect on retinue response. No differences were detected between treatment groups in 
the consumption of pollen supplement. Treatment had no effect on worker survival and over the 
two-week monitoring period, mortality rates remained below 3.2% on average across all groups. 
No difference was detected between treatment groups in queen weight change. Major royal jelly

two-week monitoring period, mortality rates remained below 3.2% on average across all groups. 
No difference was detected between treatment groups in queen weight change. Major royal jelly 
protein-1, MRJP-3, vitellogenin, and vitellogenin precursor proteins were among those quantified, 
but their abundances were not different with respect to the control queens. The researchers 
investigated global patterns of differential protein abundance between exposure groups and found 
no proteins in the diflubenzuron group were significantly altered. 
Receiving care from maternally-exposed workers did not have an effect on the laying rates of new 
queens or their total eggs produced. Receiving care from maternally-exposed workers did not affect 
the egg hatching rate of eggs laid by new queens or rate of adult eclosions relative to controls. 
Treatment also had no effect on worker pollen consumption, queen weight change, or weight at 
adult eclosion. However, treatment had a significant effect on the timing of adult eclosion. 
Maternal exposure to diflubenzuron and methoxyfenozide resulted in significantly longer average 
time to adult eclosion relative to maternal exposure to pyriproxyfen or the control group. Maternal 
pesticide treatment had no effect on worker survival and over the two week monitoring period, 
mortality rates remained below 1.7% on average across all groups, and no queen death was 
observed.

Researchers examined synergistic toxicity of common insecticides and fungicides in California 
almond orchards. Synergistic toxicity is the toxicity of a chemical combination that is greater than 
that predicted from studies of isolated chemical constituents. Young worker larvae were fed diets 
contaminated with 2.28 µg diflubenzuron per larva and a fungicidal dose to achieve comparable 
concentration ratios simulating a tank-mix at the maximum label rate. Diflubenzuron cause 
significantly reduced adult emergence as measured by larval mortality, but no synergistic effect 
was observed when combined with fungicides (Wade et al., 2019). 
During June 2024 the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) collected 58 plant tissue 
samples from flowers within a grasshopper treatment area in Prairie County, Montana. The samples 
were sent to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service – National Science Laboratory for analysis 
to determine the concentration of diflubenzuron residue both 24 hours and 14 days after the 
application. Nine pretreatment flower tissue samples were accidentally collected before the 
insecticide application because of miscommunication between the PPQ program manager, the ARS 
field technician and the pilot. The program uses the RAATs method where spray and no-spray 
swaths are alternated. However, deposition of insecticide within the spray and no-spray swaths is 
variable because of changes in wind direction and speed, as well as the application height which is 
dictated by topography and other hazards. Of the 25 flower samples collected 24 hours after the

diflubenzuron residues 14 days after treatment were collected in skip swaths.  
Ten of the flower samples collected 24 hours after the treatment had measurable amounts of 
diflubenzuron that diminished in samples collected at the same location 14 days later. Laboratory 
analysis showed flower samples collected at five sample locations did not have detectable 
concentrations one day after the treatment, but did have diflubenzuron residues when samples were 
collected at the same or nearby locations 14 days later. Diflubenzuron residues on five flower 
samples collected immediately after treatment either did not attenuate significantly or had greater 
amounts of the chemical when more samples were collected at the same or adjacent locations 14 
days later.

samples collected immediately after treatment either did not attenuate significantly or had greater 
amounts of the chemical when more samples were collected at the same or adjacent locations 14 
days later.  
To assess risk to bees from contact with the rangeland flowers and leaves while collecting pollen 
and nectar after foliar diflubenzuron treatments we calculated the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ 
was calculated as the average concentration of diflubenzuron residues detected on plant tissue for 
both the samples collected 24 hours and 14 days after the treatment divided by acute contact LD50 
(Stoner and Eitzer 2013). Non-detection results were assigned a value of 0.099 parts per million 
(ppm), just below the limit of detection value of 0.100 ppm. Honeybee LD50 was used as LD50 was 
not consistently available for bumble and solitary bees.  
HQ (24 hours) = 245 ppb (0.245 ppm) ÷ 114.8 μg diflubenzuron per bee = 2.134 
HQ (14 days) = 159 ppb (0.159 ppm) ÷ 114.8 μg diflubenzuron per bee = 1.385 
This analysis can be interpreted there is not a significant risk to bees using a common level of 
concern of HQ > 50 (Thompson and Thorbahn 2009; Thompson 2021). Extrapolation to other 
pollinators by multiplying the HQ by an order of magnitude also did not indicate significant acute 
health risk from contact with the flowers with diflubenzuron residues.  
In addition to HQ, we calculated contact Risk Quotient (RQcontact) using the BeeREX tool 
provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is intended for foliar sprays

 HQ by an order of magnitude also did not indicate significant acute 
health risk from contact with the flowers with diflubenzuron residues.  
In addition to HQ, we calculated contact Risk Quotient (RQcontact) using the BeeREX tool 
provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is intended for foliar sprays 
applied to crops in bloom. Risk quotient has the advantage over HQ of taking into account the 
amount of the contaminated substance consumed or encountered by a typical honeybee forager. 
The BeeREX RQcontact is calculated by comparing the chemical application rate, multiplied by a 
constant that represents the typical amount of chemical encountered by a honeybee forager if it 
flies through a cloud of spray, to the contact acute LD50. The BeeREX RQcontact index value for 
1.0 fl.oz. Dimilin/acre (0.0078125 gal. X 2.0 lb. = 0.015625 lbs./acre) = 0.000367.   
To interpret risk to bees from contact with the diflubenzuron residues on flowers and plant tissues 
collected by USDA, the acute RQcontact value is compared to a pre-determined level of concern 
set to 0.4, which and is based on the historic average dose response relationship for acute toxicity 
studies with bees and a 10% mortality level in foragers and worker larvae. Based on calculations in 
the BeeREX risk model the index value of 0.000367 does not represent a significant risk to 
honeybees or a likely risk to other bee pollinators (USEPA 2014). Extrapolation to other pollinators 
by multiplying the RQ by an order of magnitude also did not indicate significant acute health risk

Insecticide applications to rangelands have the potential to impact pollinators, and in turn, 
vegetation and various rangeland species that depend on pollinated vegetation. Based on the review 
of laboratory and field toxicity data for terrestrial invertebrates, applications of diflubenzuron are 
expected to have minimal risk to pollinators of terrestrial plants. The use of RAATs provide 
`  
Page | 88 
 
additional benefits by using reduced rates and creating untreated swaths within the spray block that 
will further reduce the potential risk to pollinators.  
APHIS reduces the risk to native bees and pollinators through monitoring grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket populations and making pesticide applications in a manner that reduces the risk to 
this group of nontarget invertebrates. Monitoring grasshopper and Mormon cricket populations 
allows APHIS to determine if populations require treatment and to make treatments in a timely 
manner reducing pesticide use and emphasizing the use of program insecticides that are not broad 
spectrum. The treatment history of program since the introduction of diflubenzuron demonstrates it 
is the preferred insecticide. Over 90% of the acreage treated by the program has been with 
diflubenzuron. The effects on pollinators resulting from control of rangeland grasshopper 
populations with diflubenzuron are not expected to cause significant impacts to the

 of program since the introduction of diflubenzuron demonstrates it 
is the preferred insecticide. Over 90% of the acreage treated by the program has been with 
diflubenzuron. The effects on pollinators resulting from control of rangeland grasshopper 
populations with diflubenzuron are not expected to cause significant impacts to the human 
environment. 
(3) Physical Environment Components 
USEPA considers diflubenzuron relatively non-persistent and immobile under normal use 
conditions and stable to hydrolysis and photolysis. The chemical is considered unlikely to 
contaminate ground water or surface water (USEPA, 1997). The vapor pressure of diflubenzuron is 
relatively low, as is the Henry’s Law Constant value, suggesting the chemical will not volatilize 
readily into the atmosphere from soil, plants or water. Therefore, exposure from volatilization is 
expected to be minimal. Due to its low solubility (0.2 mg/L) and preferential binding to organic 
matter, diflubenzuron seldom persists more than a few days in water (Schaefer and Dupras, 1977). 
Mobility and leachability of diflubenzuron in soils is low, and residues are usually not detectable 
after seven days (Eisler, 2000). Aerobic aquatic half-life data in water and sediment was reported 
as 26.0 days (USEPA, 1997). Diflubenzuron applied to foliage remains adsorbed to leaf surfaces 
for several weeks with little or no absorption or translocation from plant surfaces (Eisler, 1992, 
2000). Field dissipation studies in California citrus and Oregon apple orchards reported half-live 
values of 68.2 to
Text Len: 1579
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as 26.0 days (USEPA, 1997). Diflubenzuron applied to foliage remains adsorbed to leaf surfaces 
for several weeks with little or no absorption or translocation from plant surfaces (Eisler, 1992, 
2000). Field dissipation studies in California citrus and Oregon apple orchards reported half-live 
values of 68.2 to 78 days (USEPA, 2018). Diflubenzuron persistence varies depending on site 
conditions and rangeland persistence is unfortunately not available. Diflubenzuron degradation is 
microbially mediated with soil aerobic half-lives much less than dissipation half-lives. 
Diflubenzuron treatments are expected to have minimal effects on terrestrial plants. Both 
laboratory and field studies demonstrate no effects using diflubenzuron over a range of application 
rates, and the direct risk to terrestrial plants is expected to be minimal (USDA APHIS, 2019c). 
(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
In addition to the environmental baseline conditions, APHIS also considers other factors such as 
pest population, pest life stage, pest and plant species affected, cost share with State and private 
landowners, and the cost benefit estimate of making a treatment. Because of the cost sharing 
private landowners and land managers typically would only use diflubenzuron to suppress 
rangeland grasshoppers and preserve forage for livestock. Insecticides applied using the RAATs 
strategy is expected to provide further economic advantages due to effective treatment at reduced 
costs. The RAATs strategy reduces treatment costs to half of the costs for conventional treatments 
for rangeland grasshopper infestations (Foster et al., 2000, Lockwood and Schell, 1997). 
Another potential economic benefit of chemical treatment
Text Len: 1718
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 using the RAATs 
strategy is expected to provide further economic advantages due to effective treatment at reduced 
costs. The RAATs strategy reduces treatment costs to half of the costs for conventional treatments 
for rangeland grasshopper infestations (Foster et al., 2000, Lockwood and Schell, 1997). 
Another potential economic benefit of chemical treatment of grasshoppers is to crop growers near 
rangelands. This would result in socioeconomic benefits because losses, and therefore costs, of 
meat, crops, and their byproducts should be reduced. Additionally, the suppressed grasshopper 
`  
Page | 89 
 
populations in rangeland surrounding croplands could mean less of a need for costly chemical 
treatments by crop farmers at these sites.  
There is the potential for organic farms adjacent to diflubenzuron treatments in rangeland to control 
grasshopper outbreak populations. However, mitigations such as buffers are meant to protect 
adjacent environments from runoff and insecticide drift. These protective measures are expected to 
protect nearby organic farms, as well as other areas of concern, from the risk of inadvertent 
exposure to rangeland insecticide treatments. It is also likely the organic farms would also benefit 
economically from reductions in crop damage caused by grasshopper populations migrating from 
nearby rangeland. 
The suppression of grasshopper populations with diflubenzuron should benefit public uses 
rangelands for recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may 
temporarily lose the use of rangeland during and directly after diflubenzuron insecticide 
applications. However, the preservation of vegetation is expected to benefit recreational activities 
in the long-term by preserving their aesthetic

uron should benefit public uses 
rangelands for recreational activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and biking. The public may 
temporarily lose the use of rangeland during and directly after diflubenzuron insecticide 
applications. However, the preservation of vegetation is expected to benefit recreational activities 
in the long-term by preserving their aesthetic value. This in turn will also increase the economic 
value of the rangeland by preserving and improving recreational opportunities.  
(5) Cultural Resources and Events 
There is the potential for impacts to cultural and historical resources if the proposed diflubenzuron 
treatments occur on or near historic trails or properties. If any proposed actions are at, or adjacent 
to, the site of a historic trail or property, APHIS will consult with the appropriate landowner or land 
management agency, the State Historic Preservation Office, any affected National Trail’s 
administrative office, or other appropriate agencies. Likewise, APHIS would coordinate the timing 
of treatments with Tribes or other cooperators to ensure insecticide applications would not occur 
during scheduled cultural events or ceremonies.  
(6) Special Considerations for Certain Populations 
APHIS uses diflubenzuron insecticide treatments to suppress grasshopper populations in rural 
rangeland areas that are largely uninhabited. Disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental impacts on Tribes, and historical and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas, where 
agriculture is a primary industry. The areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural dwellings in 
ranching communities with low population density. The program notifies residents within 
treatment areas, or their designated

 and culturally sensitive sites in a program area are 
unlikely. 
APHIS grasshopper insecticide treatments are conducted in rural rangeland areas, where 
agriculture is a primary industry. The areas consist of widely scattered, single, rural dwellings in 
ranching communities with low population density. The program notifies residents within 
treatment areas, or their designated representatives, prior to proposed operations to reduce the 
potential for incidental exposure to residents including children. Treatments are conducted 
primarily on open rangelands where children would not be expected to be present during treatment 
or to enter should there be any restricted entry period after treatment. The program also implements 
mitigation measures beyond label requirements to ensure that no treatments occur within the 
required buffer zones from structures, such as a 500-foot treatment buffer zone from schools and 
recreational areas. Also, program insecticides are not applied while school buses are operating in 
the treatment area (USDA APHIS, 2016).  
APHIS’ HHERA for diflubenzuron evaluated the potential exposure to each insecticide used in the 
program and risks associated with these insecticides to residents, including children. The HHERA 
suggest that no disproportionate risks to children, as part of the general public, are anticipated 
(USDA APHIS, 2019c).

c) Reduced Area Agent Treatments (RAATs)  
The use of RAATS is the standard methodology used by APHIS in Oregon. The RAATs method is 
an effective IPM strategy because the goal is to suppress grasshopper populations to a desired 
level, rather than to reduce those populations to the greatest possible extent. All APHIS 
grasshopper treatments are conducted in adherence with U.S.

The use of RAATS is the standard methodology used by APHIS in Oregon. The RAATs method is 
an effective IPM strategy because the goal is to suppress grasshopper populations to a desired 
level, rather than to reduce those populations to the greatest possible extent. All APHIS 
grasshopper treatments are conducted in adherence with U.S. EPA approved label directions. 
Labeled application rates for grasshopper control tend to be lower than rates used against other 
pests. The RAATs rates used for grasshopper control by APHIS are lower than rates typically used 
by private landowners. APHIS would apply a single application of insecticide per year, typically 
using a RAATs strategy that decreases the rate of insecticide applied by either using lower 
insecticide spray concentrations, or by alternating one or more treatment swaths. Usually, RAATs 
applications use both lower concentrations and skip treatment swaths. The RAATs strategy 
suppresses grasshoppers within treated swaths, while conserving grasshopper predators and 
parasites in swaths that are not treated.  
The efficacy of a RAATs strategy in reducing grasshoppers is, therefore, less than conventional 
treatments and more variable. Foster et al. (2000) reported that grasshopper mortality using RAATs 
was reduced 2 to 15% from conventional treatments, depending on the insecticide, while 
Lockwood et al. (2000) reported 0 to 26% difference in mortality between conventional and 
RAATs methods. APHIS will consider the effects of not suppressing grasshoppers to the greatest 
extent possible as part of the treatment planning process.

RAATs methods. APHIS will consider the effects of not suppressing grasshoppers to the greatest 
extent possible as part of the treatment planning process.  
(1) Human Health 
The potential effects on human health during the application of pesticides using the RAATs 
method depends on the choice of insecticide. The possible exposure scenarios are described in 
detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. The minimal risk to program workers would 
not decrease because the mixing and formulation of the pesticide procedures would remain the 
same and are expected to prevent exposure. Any potential exposure of bystanders within treatment 
blocks would be reduced because of the lower application rates and skip swaths where insecticides 
are not applied.  
(2) Nontarget Species 
The potential effects on nontarget species during the application of pesticides using the RAATs 
method depends on the choice of insecticide. The possible environmental impacts are described in 
detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. Any exposure of nontarget species within 
treatment blocks would be reduced because of the lower application rates and skip swaths where 
insecticides are not applied. Therefore, the risk of significant impacts to populations of nontarget 
species would be less than if the program used conventional application rates and complete 
coverage of the treatment area. 
(3) Physical Environment Components 
The potential environmental effects of the application of pesticides using the RAATs method 
depends on the choice of insecticide. The expected fate of program applied chemicals, and possible 
environmental impacts are described in detail in the above pesticide specific effects analysis. The

(4) Socioeconomic Issues 
RAATs reduces treatment costs and conserves non-target biological resources in untreated areas. 
The potential economic advantages of RAATs were proposed by Larsen and Foster (1996), and 
empirically demonstrated by Lockwood and Schell (1997). Widespread efforts to communicate the 
advantages of RAATs across the Western States were undertaken in 1998 and have continued on 
an annual basis. The viability of RAATs at an operational scale was initially demonstrated by 
Lockwood et al. (2000), and subsequently confirmed by Foster et al. (2000). The first government 
agencies to adopt RAATs in their grasshopper suppression programs were the Platte and Goshen 
County Weed and Pest Districts in Wyoming; they also funded research at the University of 
Wyoming to support the initial studies in 1995. This method is now commonly used by 
government agencies and private landowners in States where grasshopper control is required.

IV. Conclusions 
This EA examines alternatives available to APHIS when requested to suppress economically 
damaging outbreaks of grasshoppers. The preferred alternative includes insecticide treatments 
which are considered based on the site conditions. APHIS decides whether a suppression of the 
outbreak is warranted based on the IPM principles including an assessment of the economic injury 
level represented by the grasshopper populations. This EA discusses and examines the tools and 
strategies employed by APHIS and their potential effects on the human environment. This EA does 
not decide which alternative will be selected, however, all reasonable options available to

 a suppression of the 
outbreak is warranted based on the IPM principles including an assessment of the economic injury 
level represented by the grasshopper populations. This EA discusses and examines the tools and 
strategies employed by APHIS and their potential effects on the human environment. This EA does 
not decide which alternative will be selected, however, all reasonable options available to the 
agency for dealing with grasshopper infestations have been adequately considered, including 
consideration of direct, indirect and cumulative environmental effects. Decisions about whether, 
how, and when to employ the tools and strategies discussed in the EA will be made as the need to 
suppress grasshopper populations at specific sites arises.  
In June 2002, APHIS completed an EIS describing the agency’s most effective methods of 
reducing the damage caused by grasshopper populations to rangeland in the western United States. 
During November 2019, APHIS published HHERA for the use of carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, 
diflubenzuron and malathion by the program. APHIS also published an updated EIS to consolidate 
and incorporate the available data and analyze the environmental risk of new program tools. The 
risk analysis in the 2019 EIS is incorporated by reference (USDA APHIS, 2019). 
This EA examined a No Action alternative, where APHIS would not conduct a program to 
suppress grasshoppers other than provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the 
implementation of IPM strategies by land managers. Without an APHIS administered program 
Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, private 
groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort. Without the 
coordination that APHIS provides during grasshopper outbreaks, the land managers

 other than provide technical assistance and surveys to assist in the 
implementation of IPM strategies by land managers. Without an APHIS administered program 
Federal land management agencies, State agriculture departments, local governments, private 
groups or individuals, may not effectively combat outbreaks in a coordinated effort. Without the 
coordination that APHIS provides during grasshopper outbreaks, the land managers and owners 
could use insecticides that APHIS considers too environmentally harsh. Multiple treatments and 
excessive amount of insecticide could be applied in efforts to suppress or even locally eradicate 
grasshopper populations. Conversely, in the absence of an APHIS funded grasshopper suppression 
program the most likely environmental effects would result from other agencies and land managers 
not controlling outbreaks. As noted, grasshoppers consuming vast amounts of vegetation in 
rangelands and surrounding areas. Grasshoppers are generalist feeders, eating grasses and forbs 
first and often moving to cultivated crops. 
Under the Preferred Alternative APHIS would participate in grasshopper programs with the option 
of using one of the insecticides [abridge this list and the following risk analysis sections as 
appropriate for this EA] carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, diflubenzuron, or malathion, depending upon 
the various factors related to the grasshopper outbreak and the site-specific characteristics. The use 
of an insecticide would typically occur at half the conventional application rates following the 
RAATs strategy. APHIS would apply a single treatment per year to affected rangeland areas to 
suppress grasshopper outbreak populations.  
Each alternative described in this EA potentially has adverse environmental effects. The general 
environmental impacts of each alternative are discussed in detail in the 2019 programmatic EIS 
published by APHIS. The specific impacts of

Each alternative described in this EA potentially has adverse environmental effects. The general 
environmental impacts of each alternative are discussed in detail in the 2019 programmatic EIS 
published by APHIS. The specific impacts of the alternatives are highly dependent upon the 
particular action and location of the grasshopper infestation. The principal concerns associated with 
the alternatives are: (1) the potential effects of insecticides on human health (including 
subpopulations that might be at increased risk); and (2) impacts of insecticides on nontarget 
organisms (including threatened and endangered species).

Appendix A: APHIS Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression 
Program Treatment Guidelines 
FY-2025 Treatment Guidelines 
Version   1/9/2023 
The objectives of the APHIS Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program are to 1) 
conduct surveys in the Western States; 2) provide technical assistance to land managers and private 
landowners; and 3) when funds permit, suppress economically damaging grasshopper and Mormon cricket 
outbreaks on Federal, Tribal, State, and/or private rangeland.  The Plant Protection Act of 2000 provides 
APHIS the authority to take these actions. 
 
General Guidelines for Grasshopper / Mormon Cricket Treatments 
 
1. All treatments must be in accordance with: 
a. the Plant Protection Act of 2000; 
b. applicable environmental laws and policies such as: the National Environmental Policy Act, the 
Endangered Species Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and the Clean Water 
Act (including National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements – if  applicable);  
c. applicable state laws;  
d. APHIS Directives pertaining to the proposed action; 
e. Memoranda of Understanding with other Federal agencies. 

Text Len: 1503
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and the Clean Water 
Act (including National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements – if  applicable);  
c. applicable state laws;  
d. APHIS Directives pertaining to the proposed action; 
e. Memoranda of Understanding with other Federal agencies. 
 
2. Subject to the availability of funds, upon request of the administering agency, the agriculture department of an 
affected State, or private landowners, APHIS, to protect rangeland, shall immediately treat Federal, Tribal, 
State, or private lands that are infested with grasshoppers or Mormon crickets at levels of economic 
infestation, unless APHIS determines that delaying treatment will not cause greater economic damage to 
adjacent owners of rangeland.  In carrying out this section, APHIS shall work in conjunction with other 
Federal, State, Tribal, and private prevention, control, or suppression efforts to protect rangeland. 
 
3. Prior to the treatment season, conduct meetings or provide guidance that allows for public participation in the 
decision-making process.  In addition, notify Federal, State and Tribal land managers and private landowners 
of the potential for grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks on their lands.  Request that the land manager / 
landowner advise APHIS of any sensitive sites that may exist in the proposed treatment areas. 
 
4. Consultation with local Tribal representatives will take place prior to treatment programs to fully inform the 
Tribes of possible actions APHIS may take on Tribal lands. 
 
5. On APHIS run suppression programs and subject to funding availablity, the Federal government will bear the 
cost of treatment up to 100 percent on Federal and Tribal Trust land, 50 percent of the cost
Text Len: 1781
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ation with local Tribal representatives will take place prior to treatment programs to fully inform the 
Tribes of possible actions APHIS may take on Tribal lands. 
 
5. On APHIS run suppression programs and subject to funding availablity, the Federal government will bear the 
cost of treatment up to 100 percent on Federal and Tribal Trust land, 50 percent of the cost on State land, and 
33 percent of cost on private land.  There is an additional 16.15% charge, however, on any funds received by 
APHIS for federal involvement with suppression treatments.  
6. Land managers are responsible for the overall management of rangeland under their control to prevent or 
reduce the severity of grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks.  Land managers are encouraged to have 
implemented Integrated Pest Management Systems prior to requesting a treatment.  In the absence of 
available funding or in the place of APHIS funding, the Federal land management agency, Tribal authority or 
other party/ies may opt to reimburse APHIS for suppression treatments. Interagency agreements or 
reimbursement agreements must be completed prior to the start of treatments which will be charged thereto. 
 
 
Page | 104 
 
7. There are situations where APHIS may be requested to treat rangeland that also includes small areas where 
crops are being grown (typically less than 10 percent of the treatment area).  In those situations, the crop 
owner pays the entire treatment costs on the croplands.   
 
NOTE: The insecticide being considered must be labeled for the included crop as well as rangeland and current 
Worker Protection Standards must be followed by the applicator and private landowner. 
 
8. In some cases, rangeland treatments may be conducted by other federal agencies (e

 pays the entire treatment costs on the croplands.   
 
NOTE: The insecticide being considered must be labeled for the included crop as well as rangeland and current 
Worker Protection Standards must be followed by the applicator and private landowner. 
 
8. In some cases, rangeland treatments may be conducted by other federal agencies (e.g., Forest Service, Bureau 
of Land Management, or Bureau of Indian Affairs) or by non-federal entities (e.g., Grazing Association or 
County Pest District).  APHIS may choose to assist these groups in a variety of ways, such as: 
a. loaning equipment (an agreement may be required): 
b. contributing in-kind services such as surveys to determine insect species, instars, and infestation levels; 
c. monitoring for effectiveness of the treatment; 
d. providing technical guidance. 
 
9. In areas considered for treatment, State-registered beekeepers and organic producers shall be notified in 
advance of proposed treatments.  If necessary, non-treated buffer zones can be established.  
 
Operational Procedures     
 
GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR ALL AERIAL AND GROUND APPLICATIONS 
 
1. Follow all applicable Federal, Tribal, State, and local laws and regulations in conducting grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket suppression treatments. 
 
2. Notify residents within treatment areas, or their designated representatives, prior to proposed operations.  
Advise them of the control method to be used, proposed method of application, and precautions to be taken. 
 
3. One of the following insecticides that are labeled for rangeland use can be used for a suppression treatment of 
grasshoppers and Mormon crickets:

4. Do not apply insecticides directly to water bodies (defined herein as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, pools left by 
seasonal streams, springs, wetlands, and perennial streams and rivers).  
 
Furthermore, provide the following buffers for water bodies:  
• 500-foot buffer with aerial liquid insecticide. 
• 200-foot buffer with ground liquid insecticide. 
• 200-foot buffer with aerial bait. 
• 50-foot buffer with ground bait. 
   
5. Instruct program personnel in the safe use of equipment, materials, and procedures; supervise to ensure safety 
procedures are properly followed.

7. Each aerial suppression program will have a Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) OR a Treatment 
Manager on site.  Each State will have at least one COR available to assist the Contracting Officer (CO) in 
GH/MC aerial suppression programs.  
 
NOTE: A Treatment Manager is an individual that the COR has delegated authority to oversee the actual 
suppression treatment; someone who is on the treatment site and overseeing / coordinating the treatment and 
communicating with the COR. No specific training is required, but knowledge of the Aerial Application 
Manual and treatment experience is critical; attendance to the Aerial Applicators Workshop is very beneficial.  
 
8. Each suppression program will conduct environmental monitoring as outlined in the current year’s 
Environmental Monitoring Plan. 
 
APHIS will assess and monitor rangeland treatments for the efficacy of the treatment, to verify that a suppression 
treatment program has properly been implemented, and to assure that any environmentally sensitive sites are 
protected.  
 
9. APHIS reporting requirements associated with grasshopper / Mormon cricket suppression treatments include:  
a. Completion of a post-treatment report (Part C of the Project Planning and Reporting Worksheet

a) Wind velocity exceeds 10 miles per hour (unless state law requires lower wind speed); 
b) Rain is falling or is imminent; 
c) Dew is present over large areas within the treatment block; 
d) There is air turbulence that could affect the spray deposition; 
e) Temperature inversions (ground temperature higher than air temperature) develop and deposition 
onto the ground is affected. 
 
3. Weather conditions will be monitored and documented during application and treatment will be suspended 
when conditions could jeopardize the correct spray placement or pilot safety. 
 
4. Application aircraft will fly at a median altitude of 1 to 1.5 times the wingspan of the aircraft whenever

Dear Ms. Willard: 
This letter is in response to the United States Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Services (APHIS) December 13, 2023, request for concurrence on 
determinations of “may affect, not likely to adversely affect,” (NLAA) federally listed, proposed 
and candidate species and designated and proposed critical habitats related to APHIS’ proposal 
to conduct chemical treatments to suppress grasshopper infestations as part of the Rangeland 
Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program (Program) in 17 Western States. In their 
accompanying Biological Assessment for the APHIS Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon 
Cricket Suppression Program, December 2023, revised on January 23, 2024, APHIS uses a risk 
assessment approach to evaluate response data to characterize the potential hazard/risk of the use 
of three of four chemicals in the program to aquatic and terrestrial listed species and their habitat. 
APHIS is adopting the risk assessment and conservation measures from the 2022 U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service Biological Opinion for the reregistration of malathion, and thus, malathion is 
not considered further in their BA. The Service provides this response pursuant to section 7(a)(2) 
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), as amended.

Wildlife Service Biological Opinion for the reregistration of malathion, and thus, malathion is 
not considered further in their BA. The Service provides this response pursuant to section 7(a)(2) 
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), as amended. 
APHIS has made a NLAA determination for their Proposed Action for 201 threatened and 
endangered species, 11 proposed species, 93 designated and 8 proposed critical habitats These 
species include 10 amphibians, 15 birds, 57 fishes, 31 invertebrates, 15 mammals, 78 plants, and 
8 reptiles. A complete list of these species and critical habitats can be found in Enclosure A. 
 
Description of the Proposed Action 
The intent of APHIS’ Program is to reduce populations of various species of grasshoppers and 
Mormon crickets on rangeland in Arizona, California (partial), Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, 
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada (partial), New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma (partial), Oregon 
(partial), South Dakota, Texas (partial), Utah, Washington (partial), and Wyoming. Chemical 
treatments include a seasonal one-time treatment of diflubenzuron, carbaryl, malathion, or

chlorantraniliprole which can be applied from the ground or air. All four chemicals are applied 
at substantially reduced rates, compared to their recommended label uses, and are applied over 
an entire treatment area/spray block, or in alternating swaths within a treatment area/spray 
block. 
Decisions to conduct grasshopper treatments are based on many factors including the number of

 label uses, and are applied over 
an entire treatment area/spray block, or in alternating swaths within a treatment area/spray 
block. 
Decisions to conduct grasshopper treatments are based on many factors including the number of 
grasshoppers present in the area, grasshopper and plant species composition, life-cycle stage of 
the grasshoppers, range condition, the economic significance of the infestation, and whether it is 
economically and logistically feasible to conduct an effective program. 
Toxicity data related to potential direct and indirect effects to listed species were compared to 
exposure estimates for diflubenzuron, carbaryl, and chlorantraniliprole to characterize risk to 
listed species and any designated critical habitat. APHIS reviewed the ecology of the listed 
species, including their distribution throughout the program action area, to determine whether a 
listed entity is found within the program treatment areas and, thus, would likely be exposed to 
any of the program chemicals. 
Based on this review, APHIS identified listed species that could potentially occur in the program 
area, and then used results from the risk characterization for the three chemicals to develop 
program application buffers and other mitigation measures to avoid and/or minimize the 
potential for adverse impacts to listed species and their critical habitat (See Appendix A-9 of the 
BA or Enclosure B). 
 
Best Management Practices (BMPs) 
Surveys 
Prior to any insecticide applications, APHIS conducts immature grasshopper surveys (i.e., 
nymphal surveys) in the spring and early summer (USDA, 2024). The number of grasshopper 
nymphs present within a given area are counted (USDA, 2024). Data gathered includes the stage 
of grasshopper development

veys 
Prior to any insecticide applications, APHIS conducts immature grasshopper surveys (i.e., 
nymphal surveys) in the spring and early summer (USDA, 2024). The number of grasshopper 
nymphs present within a given area are counted (USDA, 2024). Data gathered includes the stage 
of grasshopper development; location of sensitive areas such as bee yards and aquatic resources; 
the condition of the rangeland in relation to grasshopper numbers; and the extent of the 
infestation (USDA, 2024). This data is used for planning large-scale treatment programs and 
fiscal tracking, and for local decisions on treatments within a State (USDA, 2024). 
Adult surveys occur in late summer and early fall (USDA, 2024). This survey is timed to 
coincide with the peak populations (USDA, 2024). Adult survey data are useful in predicting if 
and where potential grasshopper problems are likely to occur in the spring and early summer of 
the next growing season (USDA, 2024). 
The survey data collected by the program is used by the agency and land managers/owners to 
assess whether treatments are warranted. Treatments must be requested from a Federal land 
management agency or a State agriculture department (on behalf of a State or local government, 
or private group or individual) that has jurisdiction over the land before APHIS can begin a 
treatment (USDA, 2024). Upon request, APHIS personnel conduct a site visit to determine 
whether APHIS action is warranted (USDA, 2024). Relevant factors influencing this decision 
may include, but are not limited to, the pest species, timing of treatment relative to the biological 
stage of the pest species, costs and benefits of conducting the action, and ecological impacts

whether APHIS action is warranted (USDA, 2024). Relevant factors influencing this decision 
may include, but are not limited to, the pest species, timing of treatment relative to the biological 
stage of the pest species, costs and benefits of conducting the action, and ecological impacts 
(USDA, 2024). Based on survey results conducted during the growing season, APHIS is better 
able to predict the potential for large grasshopper populations and to respond quickly before 
extensive loss occurs to rangeland (USDA, 2024). Thus, State and Federal officials may initiate 
early coordination of local programs and request APHIS’ assistance in a timely and effective 
cooperative effort (USDA, 2024).

Insecticide Application 
When land managers request direct intervention, APHIS’ role in the suppression of grasshoppers 
is through a single application of an insecticide—carbaryl, diflubenzuron, malathion, or 
chlorantraniliprole (USDA, 2024). All four insecticides are labeled by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs (EPA–OPP) for rangeland use in the control of 
grasshoppers, including Mormon crickets (USDA, 2024). APHIS may conduct insecticide 
treatments in the above mentioned 17 states. With the exception of chlorantraniliprole, the 
remaining three insecticides are registered for use in all states considered in this program (USDA 
2015). 
Program insecticide applications can be applied in two different forms: liquid ultra-low-volume 
(ULV) sprays, or solid-based baits

ments in the above mentioned 17 states. With the exception of chlorantraniliprole, the 
remaining three insecticides are registered for use in all states considered in this program (USDA 
2015). 
Program insecticide applications can be applied in two different forms: liquid ultra-low-volume 
(ULV) sprays, or solid-based baits (USDA, 2024). Both ULV sprays and baits can be distributed 
by aerial or ground applications (USDA, 2024). Aerial applications are typical for treatments 
over large areas (USDA, 2024). Some grasshopper outbreak locations are economically or 
logistically accessible only by aircraft, while other locations may be best treated by ground 
applications (USDA, 2024). Ground applications are most likely to be made when treating 
localized grasshopper outbreaks or for treatments where the most precise placement of 
insecticide is desired (USDA, 2024). 
Buffers and Conservation Measures 
A reduced agent area treatment (RAATs) rate can be used for all four insecticides (USDA, 
2024). This strategy uses insecticides at low rates combined with a reduction in the area treated 
for grasshopper suppression (USDA, 2024). The RAATs strategy relies on the effects of an 
insecticide to suppress grasshoppers within treated swaths, and the conservation of grasshopper 
predators and parasites in swaths not directly treated (untreated). 
The Program has also established treatment restriction buffers around waterbodies to protect 
those features from insecticide drift and runoff (USDA, 2024). APHIS maintains the following 
buffers for water bodies that are not designated critical habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot 
buffer for aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground sprays, and a 50-

The Program has also established treatment restriction buffers around waterbodies to protect 
those features from insecticide drift and runoff (USDA, 2024). APHIS maintains the following 
buffers for water bodies that are not designated critical habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot 
buffer for aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground sprays, and a 50-foot buffer for bait 
applications (USDA, 2024). 
Application buffers as well as additional mitigation measures to protect listed species and their 
critical habitat have also been established for all four pesticides. Parameters specific to the given 
pesticide are used for inputs into the modeling program, AgDrift, to establish additional 
mitigation measure buffer distances for those areas where Program activities and listed species 
and their designated critical habitat are present (USDA, 2024). Specific buffer distances were 
established based on the integration of available effects and exposure data to characterize direct 
and indirect risk to listed species and their critical habitat (USDA, 2024). In addition to the 
standard spray buffers, conservation measures include additional measures for critical habitat 
PCEs, larger buffers for lekking sites (e.g., Greater sage-grouse), larger buffers for species (e.g., 
birds) that rely primarily on insects as food, and additional upstream buffers for fish. These 
additional conservation measures are described in Enclosure B 
In addition to the chemical-specific application buffers, additional label and other requirements 
have been incorporated into the Program to reduce the potential exposure of threatened and 
endangered species and designated critical habitat to Program insecticide treatments: 
• Avoid applications when sustained winds speeds exceed 10 miles per hour (mph). 
• Use RAATs adjacent to locations of listed species and designated critical habitats. 
• Avoid applications under conditions where a temperature inversion is possible or

have been incorporated into the Program to reduce the potential exposure of threatened and 
endangered species and designated critical habitat to Program insecticide treatments: 
• Avoid applications when sustained winds speeds exceed 10 miles per hour (mph). 
• Use RAATs adjacent to locations of listed species and designated critical habitats. 
• Avoid applications under conditions where a temperature inversion is possible or when a 
storm event is imminent. 
 
Page | 111 
 
The use of RAATs will be required for 500 feet from a ground application or 1,000 feet from an 
aerial application (USDA, 2024). This distance will be used from the location of a listed species, 
or its critical habitat when no application buffer is required, or from the distance beyond the no 
application buffer (USDA, 2024). Beyond these distances the program can choose to continue 
RAATs applications or use full applications depending on site-specific conditions and the need 
for greater efficacy (USDA, 2024). 
The avoidance of applications during storm events is required to reduce the probability of off-site 
transport of program insecticides via runoff (USDA, 2024). Variability in weather patterns, even 
within small geographic areas, requires a site-specific evaluation of conditions by program 
personnel prior to application to determine if a rainfall or storm event would result in conditions 
where runoff to sensitive habitats could occur given site conditions and the proposed application 
buffers (USDA, 2024).

Monitoring data from drift cards collected from 2003 to 2022 was reviewed and compared to

Exposure 
Observed Residue Values from Program Applications 
Monitoring data from drift cards collected from 2003 to 2022 was reviewed and compared to 
modeled data to determine if the drift assumptions were representative of the drift expected from 
the Program applications. Drift card data provides a standardized unit of measurement (mg/m2) 
to compare with the outputs of terrestrial deposition estimates in AgDrift. The drift card 
comparisons are made primarily with diflubenzuron as this is the preferred active ingredient to 
be used for the Program activities, and thus, there are data to address the drift assumptions. 
Aquatic residues from the monitoring data are also summarized but are not able to be compared 
to AgDrift outputs due to difficulties with quantifying the waterbody types, sizes, and flow 
regimes. 
Modeling Estimates for all three pesticides using AgDrift 
The aquatic residue values calculated using AgDrift were generated based on conservative 
assumptions and then compared to toxicity values. The parameters used in AgDrift are discussed 
in detail in the Drift Simulations section of the BA (p. 30). While drift card data residue values 
varied, generally the closer to the treatment site, the more residue was detected, but values 
ranged from < LOD (limit of detection) to 1.07 mg/m2 overall. The average drift value estimated 
at 500 feet was 0.246 mg/m2 which is greater than what is observed from most drift card data at 
500 feet (drift card data from 2003 to 2022 at 500 feet ranged from < 0.015 – 0.29 mg/m2 from 
both carbaryl and diflubenzuron applications; BA pp 26-30). 
Run-off residues in waterbodies are considered minimal due to the reduced application rates

 than what is observed from most drift card data at 
500 feet (drift card data from 2003 to 2022 at 500 feet ranged from < 0.015 – 0.29 mg/m2 from 
both carbaryl and diflubenzuron applications; BA pp 26-30). 
Run-off residues in waterbodies are considered minimal due to the reduced application rates and 
the large buffers in place as standard for all aquatic environments and are discussed in more 
detail in the Runoff Simulations section of the BA (p.32). 
Residue Estimates for Terrestrial Non-Target Organisms 
Estimated exposure levels on vegetation and other forage items for terrestrial species were 
calculated using the Terrestrial Residue Exposure Model (T-REX) developed by EPA (US EPA, 
2012). More details on how this model was used and the parameters for the inputs are provided 
in the BA (p.34). Exposure concentrations for birds and mammals are based on mg/kg diet or 
mg/kg body weight. The resulting concentrations from the model estimates (for each insecticide) 
represent what would be expected from a direct application to the listed dietary item and are then 
used to determine residues for different mammals and birds based on their body size and food 
consumption. These values are then compared to the effects data toxicity endpoints. 
 
Page | 112 
 
AgDrift was then used to estimate the amount of drift reduction needed to arrive below the 
toxicity endpoint. The input parameters used for estimating the aquatic residues provided in 
Tables 2-1 and 2-2 of the BA were the same as those used for estimating drift reduction in 
terrestrial environments. APHIS developed the proposed buffers using these input parameters to 
determine removal of 99% of the off-site drift from the

toxicity endpoint. The input parameters used for estimating the aquatic residues provided in 
Tables 2-1 and 2-2 of the BA were the same as those used for estimating drift reduction in 
terrestrial environments. APHIS developed the proposed buffers using these input parameters to 
determine removal of 99% of the off-site drift from the program applications that will be 
protective of listed species and their critical habitat as applicable. 
 
Effects of the Action 
Throughout this section we summarize or describe toxicity effects of the three chemicals used in 
the APHIS grasshopper/cricket suppression program. Toxicity is described for both aquatic and 
terrestrial species using U.S. EPA criteria based on concentrations of a particular chemical 
(practically non-toxic, slightly toxic, moderately toxic, highly toxic, very highly toxic; Aquatic 
and Terrestrial Organism Criteria for Toxicity). Where data were unavailable for certain 
taxonomic groups, surrogate species data are described with assumptions for use of those data 
where indicated. 
For aquatic species, a range of toxicity values is provided for each taxa group to describe the 
potential effects observed from exposure to the three chemicals, carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and 
diflubenzuron. These values are then compared, in the risk section discussion, to the estimated 
concentrations from field monitoring data collected, as well as AgDrift modeled estimates. 
For terrestrial species, toxicity is also described based on route of exposure (i.e., oral, contact, 
dermal) and either acute or chronic (i.e., reproductive or developmental). These values are then 
scaled based on the body weight of the test organism of focus and compared in the risk section 
discussion. APHIS uses

 modeled estimates. 
For terrestrial species, toxicity is also described based on route of exposure (i.e., oral, contact, 
dermal) and either acute or chronic (i.e., reproductive or developmental). These values are then 
scaled based on the body weight of the test organism of focus and compared in the risk section 
discussion. APHIS uses a methodology used by the U.S. EPA (U.S. EPA Ecological Risk 
Assessment Methodology) to describe risk of exposure to different taxonomic groups of 
organisms from each of the three program chemicals. A Risk Quotient (RQ) is calculated by 
dividing a point estimate of exposure (residues on dietary items or thresholds for a given effect) 
by a point estimate of effect and compared to a level of concern (LOC). RQs <1 are not 
expected to result in adverse effects, while RQs >1 are expected to result in adverse effects. 
For critical habitat, APHIS reviewed the primary constituent elements (PCEs) or physical and 
biological features (PBFs) to determine if the Program activities would cause destruction or 
adverse modification of these features. 
In addition, the BA goes into detail to discuss the relevant toxicity of the metabolites that may be 
found in environmental matrices such as soil and water, for all three chemicals as well (see pages 
20, 38, 49, 59 in the BA).  
Carbaryl 
The mode of action of carbamates occurs primarily through acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibition (Klaassen, Andur, & Doull, 1986), (Smith J. G., 1987). The AChE enzyme breaks 
down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that allows for the transfer of

Carbaryl 
The mode of action of carbamates occurs primarily through acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibition (Klaassen, Andur, & Doull, 1986), (Smith J. G., 1987). The AChE enzyme breaks 
down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that allows for the transfer of nerve impulses across nerve 
synapses. Carbamates have a reversible enzyme binding reaction in that the binding will decrease 
as the concentration decreases over time due to metabolism and excretion. 
Aquatic Species 
The 96-hour acute median lethal concentration for carbaryl for fish ranges from 0.14 mg/L for 
channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus; (Brown, Anderson, Jones, Deuel, & Price, 1979) to 1,188 
mg/L for the walking catfish (Clarias batrachus; (Chakrawarti & Chaurasia, 1981). 
 
Page | 113 
 
For chronic effects to fish, chronic NOEC concentrations for studies ranging from 32-35 day 
exposures, are 210, 650, and 445 µg/L for the fathead minnow, bonytail (a listed species 
considered for this consultation) and the Colorado pikeminnow (also a listed species considered 
in the consultation; (Beyers, Keefe, & Carlson, 1994), (Carlson, 1972), respectively. 
For aquatic invertebrates, carbaryl is very highly toxic to all aquatic insects, and highly to very 
highly toxic to most aquatic crustaceans. The toxicity from 96-hour acute static tests ranged from 
1.5 μg/L in the shrimp, Paneaus aztecus, to 22.7 mg/L in the mussel, Mytilus edul

For aquatic invertebrates, carbaryl is very highly toxic to all aquatic insects, and highly to very 
highly toxic to most aquatic crustaceans. The toxicity from 96-hour acute static tests ranged from 
1.5 μg/L in the shrimp, Paneaus aztecus, to 22.7 mg/L in the mussel, Mytilus edulis (Mayer F. 
L., 1987), (US EPA, 2003). EC50/LC50 values for crustaceans range from 5 to 9 μg/L (cladoceran, 
mysid), 8 to 25 μg/L (scud), and 500 to 2,500 μg/L (crayfish) (Peterson, et al., 1994). Aquatic 
insects have a similar range of sensitivity. 
Chronic toxicity of carbaryl to aquatic invertebrates varies by taxa group. Reproductive and 
growth endpoints have been reported for cladocerans that range from 1.0 to 15 µg/L. A NOEC of 
500 µg/L was reported for the chironomid midge (Hanazato, 1991), (USDA Forest Service, 
2008), (US EPA, 2003). 
For aquatic plants, a study testing the effects to the freshwater green algae, Pseudokirchneriella 
subcapitata, reported a EC50 and NOEC of 1.27 and 0.29 mg/L, respectively (USDA Forest 
Service, 2008). (Peterson, et al., 1994) found statistically significant effects at 3.7 mg/L on four 
algal species and the aquatic macrophyte, Lemna minor (duckweed). (Boonyawanich, et al.,

Service, 2008). (Peterson, et al., 1994) found statistically significant effects at 3.7 mg/L on four 
algal species and the aquatic macrophyte, Lemna minor (duckweed). (Boonyawanich, et al., 
2001) reported 96-hour EC50 values of 0.996, 0.785, and 0.334 g/L for three aquatic plants: 
Ipomoea aquatica, Pistia stratiotes, and Hydrocharis dubia (water spinach, water lettuce, and 
frogbit), respectively. 
Terrestrial Species 
Carbaryl is moderate in toxicity when ingested by male and female rats. The oral LD50 in male 
and female rats is 302.6 mg/kg and 311.5 mg/kg, respectively (US EPA, 2003). Low doses can 
cause skin and eye irritation. The acute inhalation LD50 is 721 mg/kg. The acute dermal toxicity 
is low with an LD50 more than 4,000 mg/kg for rats and more than 5,000 mg/kg for rabbits (US 
EPA, 2003). For chronic data, USDA-APHIS provides a discussion on the 4-week dermal study, 
the two-generation reproduction study, and a prenatal developmental study in rats (and one in 
rabbits) on p. 49 in the BA, and also includes discussion on sub-lethal endpoints such as 
neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity thereafter, which are standard toxicity testing 
endpoints for mammalian studies. 
The acute oral LD50 of carbaryl to avian species ranges from 16 mg/kg to > 2,000 mg/kg for

& Haegele, 1984) and (Shafer, Bowles, & Hurlbut, 1983). Several toxicity studies evaluating 
sublethal effects have also been conducted. For a more in-depth discussion on these in the BA, 
see pages 52-53. Here we discuss the results from a standardized reproduction study in the

Platyrhynchos) based on a decrease in the number of eggs produced. 
There are no available studies for reptiles for carbaryl; thus, where reptile data is not available, 
the avian data is used as a surrogate to estimate sensitivity to reptiles. 
For amphibians, the acute oral LD50 for carbaryl exposure in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 
was > 4,000 mg/kg (Hudson, Tucker, & Haegele, 1984). Acute toxicity studies in other species 
have demonstrated lower LC50 values for the tadpole developmental stage and the BA provides 
more detail on these on pages 53-55. (Kirby & Sih, 2015) found carbaryl to be more lethal to the

have demonstrated lower LC50 values for the tadpole developmental stage and the BA provides 
more detail on these on pages 53-55. (Kirby & Sih, 2015) found carbaryl to be more lethal to the 
threatened Foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii) than to the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris 
regilla). The estimated 72-hour LC50 value for R. boylii was 585 µg/L ± 229 and for P. regilla

was 3,006 µg/L ± 955. In addition to mortality endpoints for this study, the authors also 
examined the effect of carbaryl on their competitive interactions with a non-native crayfish 
predator (Pacifastacus leniusculus). R. boylii was found to be more susceptible to pesticide 
exposure than P. regilla and exposure reduced their ability to compete with a 50% increase in 
mortality observed for R. boylii and no change to mortality observed (at 50 µg/L) for P. regilla. 
Several sublethal effect studies have also assessed a variety of endpoints related to direct and 
indirect effects on carbaryl to amphibians. The BA provides a discussion on these reductions in 
swimming behavior in more detail on page 55. 
Carbaryl is very highly toxic to many terrestrial insects. It is very highly toxic to honey bees (A.

Carbaryl is very highly toxic to many terrestrial insects. It is very highly toxic to honey bees (A. 
mellifera) with an acute contact LD50 of 0.0011 mg/bee (US EPA, 2003), A. erythronii females 
(0.543 µg/bee), and M. rotundata females (0.592 µg/bee) as well as bumble bees (B. terrestris) 
where 24- and 72-hour oral LD50 values ranged from 3.92 to 3.84 µg/bee, respectively and B. 
terricola workers 41.16 µg/bee (Helson, Barber, & Kingsbury, 1994). It has also been measured 
in colonies at 111 µg/kg (Mullin, et al., 2010), so there is a potential for population level effects. 
Toxicity to terrestrial plants has been evaluated for agronomic crops based on registrant 
submitted studies for US EPA FIFRA regulation requirements. These studies showed no effects 
to cabbage, cucumber, onion, ryegrass, soybean, and tomato (US EPA, 2003) at 0.803 lb a.i./ 
acre based on an application rate of 0.5 lb a.i. / acre, which is higher than that projected for 
carbaryl used for the grasshopper and Mormon cricket program (0.37 lb a.i. / acre). Plant 
incident reports have also been reported but at doses well above those proposed for the APHIS 
program activities (USDA-APHIS BA p. 56).

Diflubenzuron 
Diflubenzuron is classified as an insect growth regulator. The mode of action for this insecticide 
is inhibition of chitin synthesis (or interference with the formation of the insect’s exoskeleton 
that is comprised of a protein known as chitin). The likely mechanism is through blockage of 
chitin synthetase, the ultimate enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway to form chitin (Cohen, 1993), 
(US EPA, 1997). Diflubenzuron exposure can result in both larvicidal and ovicidal effects either 
from dermal or dietary exposure. Ovicidal effects can occur via direct contact of eggs or through 
exposure to a gravid (i.e., pregnant) female by ingestion or dermal routes. Inhibition of chitin 
synthesis can primarily affect immature insects but can also impact other arthropods and some 
fungi. 
Aquatic species 
Diflubenzuron toxicity in fish is considered low based on available data. The LC50 values range 
from 10 mg/L for smallmouth bass to 660 mg/L in bluegill sunfish (Julin & Sanders, 1978), 
(USDA Forest Service, 2004), (US EPA, 1997), (Willcox & Coffey, 1978). Chronic studies from 
30-days to 10 months indicate NOEC values range from 29 – 300 µg/L when tested on various 
species such as fathead minnow, steelhead trout, guppy (

30-days to 10 months indicate NOEC values range from 29 – 300 µg/L when tested on various 
species such as fathead minnow, steelhead trout, guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and mummichog 
(Fundulus heteroclitus; (Hansen & Garton, 1982), (Julin & Sanders, 1978). 
Aquatic invertebrate sensitivity to diflubenzuron varies among different taxonomic groups. For 
crustaceans the median lethal concentration varies from 0.75 µg/L in D. magna (USDA Forest 
Service, 2004) to 2.95 µg/L in grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio, (Wilson & Costlow, 1986). 
For aquatic insects, values range from 0.5 µg/L in the mosquito (A. nigromaculatum; (Miura & 
Takahashi, 1974) to 57 mg/L in the perloid stonefly Skwala sp.; (Mayer & Ellersieck, 1986). For 
aquatic snails, the median lethal concentration in Physa sp. is > 125 mg/L (Willcox & Coffey, 
1978).

The NOEC and EC50 values for aquatic plants exposed to diflubenzuron are 190 µg/L for

algae, S. capricornutum, respectively. 
Terrestrial species 
Diflubenzuron is not very toxic to mammals via the oral route. The BA discusses the threshold 
values in more detail (see BA p. 41), but the lowest value was the oral LD50 in rats of >4,640 
mg/kg (Eisler, 2000). The BA also goes into more detail to discuss diflubenzuron effects on the 
hematopoietic system as well as neurotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity effects, all 
indicating diflubenzuron has no impact on these physiological systems in mammals (see BA p 
41-42). 
Several reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits provided in the BA 
also indicate diflubenzuron has effects on maternal blood pathologies at a LOAEL of 25 
mg/kg/day (US EPA, 2015) but does not affect other endpoints in these studies (e.g., decreased 
body weight in offspring, fetal abnormalities). 
For birds, acute toxicity data show that diflubenzuron is practically non-toxic to birds, with acute 
oral LD50 values ranging from 2,000 mg/kg to 5,000 mg/kg (Eisler, 2000), (Willcox & Coffey, 
1978), (US EPA, 1997) using a variety of species such as the red-winged blackbird, mallard 
duck, and bobwhite quail. 
Several reproductive studies are also available

oral LD50 values ranging from 2,000 mg/kg to 5,000 mg/kg (Eisler, 2000), (Willcox & Coffey, 
1978), (US EPA, 1997) using a variety of species such as the red-winged blackbird, mallard 
duck, and bobwhite quail. 
Several reproductive studies are also available that evaluated chronic effects to a variety of avian 
species such as mallard duck, bobwhite quail, and chickens (US EPA, 1997), (Kubena, 1982), 
(USDA Forest Service, 2004), (Smalley, 1976), and (Cecil, Miller, & Corely, 1981). The lowest, 
most sensitive endpoint value used is the LOEC of 1,000 ppm value for effects on eggshell 
thickness and egg production in both mallard and bobwhite quail (US EPA, 1997). 
Little information is available for toxicity of diflubenzuron to reptiles but likely it is low, thus 
where reptile data is not available, the avian data is used as a surrogate to estimate sensitivity to 
reptiles. Diflubenzuron would be expected to be practically nontoxic to reptiles based on the 
available avian toxicity data. 
For amphibians one acute toxicity data indicates low sensitivity to diflubenzuron with a 48-hour 
LC50 of 100 mg/L in Rana brevipoda porosa tadpoles (Fryday & Thompson, 2012). Where data 
are scarce for amphibians, a surrogate approach is to use data for fish for diflubenzuron thus the 
chronic endpoint for amphibians from a 30-d NOEC value of > 45 µg/L for rainbow trout 
(Hansen & Garton, 1982) is used to

 tadpoles (Fryday & Thompson, 2012). Where data 
are scarce for amphibians, a surrogate approach is to use data for fish for diflubenzuron thus the 
chronic endpoint for amphibians from a 30-d NOEC value of > 45 µg/L for rainbow trout 
(Hansen & Garton, 1982) is used to assess chronic effects of diflubenzuron to amphibians. 
For terrestrial invertebrates, there are a large amount of data available for diflubenzuron, but 
toxicity can vary by taxonomic group depending on the Order of insect and the life stage being 
exposed. Available toxicity data for diflubenzuron exposed to adult honeybees indicates that it is 
practically non-toxic (Chandel & Gupta, 1992), (Mommaerts, Sterk, & Smagghe, 2006), (Nation, 
Robinson, Yu, & Bolten, 1986). However, diflubenzuron is moderately to highly toxic to 
developing bees based on residues reported in pollen but not on nectar or honey (Mullin, et al., 
2010). Again, this makes sense considering the mode of action of diflubenzuron. The BA 
discusses other studies confirming similar results (see BA p.44). Other insect Orders such as 
grasshoppers, beetles, and Lepidoptera at the immature stages are more susceptible than other 
terrestrial invertebrates, including the bee species discussed above (Eisler, 2000), (Murphy, 
Jepson, & Croft, 1994), (USDA Forest Service, 2004). Within this group, grasshoppers appear to

 other 
terrestrial invertebrates, including the bee species discussed above (Eisler, 2000), (Murphy, 
Jepson, & Croft, 1994), (USDA Forest Service, 2004). Within this group, grasshoppers appear to 
 
Page | 116 
 
be the most sensitive; however, the rates used in the above studies based on label 
recommendations for Dimilin 2L® are still more than 48-50% more than the rates used in the 
APHIS program (0.75-1.0 fluid oz/acre; see Table 3-6 in the BA). Diflubenzuron is also 
moderately toxic to spiders and mites, but there are no listed arachnids in the program action 
area. 
Diflubenzuron treated grasshoppers fed to darkling beetles showed significant mortality but at 
doses 2,000 times the rate of diflubenzuron applied in the grasshopper/cricket APHIS program 
(Smith & Lockwood, 2003). 
For terrestrial plants, toxicity is low due to low absorption and translocation of diflubenzuron 
residues on plant surfaces (Eisler, R., 1992). (Hatzios & Penner, 1978) determined exposure to 
diflubenzuron had no effect on photosynthesis, respiration, and leaf structure of soybeans at 
doses of up to 0.269 kg a.i./ha. 
 
Toxicity of metabolites of carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron

Toxicity of metabolites of carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron 
For carbaryl and chlorantraniliprole, toxicity data indicate the parent compounds are more toxic 
or have comparable toxicity to the metabolites discussed (see BA page 49 and Table 3-2 and 
page 59 and Table 3-7). Diflubenzuron has several metabolites that are discussed in detail in the 
BA (see pages 20 and 39). Environmental degradation of diflubenzuron can result in four 
primary metabolites, including CO2. The other three are 4-chlorophenyl urea, 2-6, 
diflurobenzoic acid, and 4-chloroaniline. 4-chloroaniline is slightly more toxic than 
diflubenzuron to fish and aquatic invertebrates (see p. 39 and Table 3-4). Both 2-6, 
diflurobenzoic acid and 4-chlorophenyl urea are considered less toxic or comparable in toxicity 
to diflubenzuron based on available data for fish and aquatic invertebrates (see p. 39 in the BA). 
4-chloroaniline has also been shown to be slightly carcinogenic in long-term mammalian studies 
(a NOEL for 4-chloroaniline was slightly higher than the NOEL for diflubenzuron) (USDA 
Forest Service, 2004).

Risk Assessment and Effects Determinations 
Aquatic Species 
The distribution of acute and sub-lethal chronic effects data for fish for carbaryl, 
chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron are compared to the estimated concentrations in aquatic 
systems under different applications for the APHIS Program. These values are below the range 
of response data provided. In addition, where data are not available for any program insecticide 
for aquatic phase amphibians, fish toxicity data is used as discussed above and below in the 
“Terrestrial Species” section of this document. The residues estimated using AgDrift also 
suggests that direct acute and sublethal risk of exposure to fish in small, static waterbodies is not 
expected. Estimated expected residues would range from 0.09 – 1.14 µg/L for carbaryl, 0.009 – 
0.4 µg/L for chlorantraniliprole, and 0.007 – 0.21 µg/L diflubenzuron, (see Figures 4-1, 4-2, and 
4-3 and Table 2-3 of the BA) when different buffer sizes are applied for the different application 
types. Field data collected from monitoring of program applications also support these findings 
(see discussions in BA p. 66 and 75 for carbaryl and diflubenzuron, respectively). The BA also 
discusses actual run-off related residues from program applications for carbaryl and 
diflubenzuron from different years and different states (2003 – 2022; see p. 27-30 in the BA).

diflubenzuron from different years and different states (2003 – 2022; see p. 27-30 in the BA).

These values also indicate the measured environmental concentrations in waterbodies within the 
standard 500-foot buffer or several miles downstream from the application site are still well 
below the effect data thresholds for aquatic organisms. 
For indirect effects, consumption of contaminated prey or loss or reduction in prey items is also 
not expected to adversely impact fish based on low residues and a low bioconcentration factor 
(BCF) value for carbaryl (15; values greater than 1,000 are considered to bioconcentrate whereas 
values lower than 20 are considered compounds with very little ability to bioconcentrate) (USDA 
Forest Service, 2008). Based on the distribution of available fish and aquatic invertebrate toxicity 
data for carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron, and the estimated residues discussed 
above, the adverse risks of exposure to prey items for listed fish species such as other fish or 
aquatic invertebrates are not expected based on the different application scenarios modeled in the 
BA. For aquatic plants, risk is discussed with respect to providing habitat and food for other 
aquatic species. For carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron, no adverse impacts to 
aquatic plants are anticipated, and residues in water are anticipated to be 400-1600 times below 
the NOEC value for carbaryl (see BA p. 65), four orders of magnitude below the lowest effect 
concentration (see BA p. 82) for chlorantraniliprole, and 2,000

 diflubenzuron, no adverse impacts to 
aquatic plants are anticipated, and residues in water are anticipated to be 400-1600 times below 
the NOEC value for carbaryl (see BA p. 65), four orders of magnitude below the lowest effect 
concentration (see BA p. 82) for chlorantraniliprole, and 2,000 times below the NOEC 
concentrations for diflubenzuron (see BA p. 74).Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to 
adversely affect listed aquatic species because the proposed conservation measures are expected to 
lower the estimated environmental concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an 
insignificant effect on aquatic species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, 
detected, or evaluated. 
Terrestrial Species 
For the terrestrial vertebrate risk characterization, insecticide exposure was considered based on the 
most significant route: ingestion through the diet. Exposure can also occur through dermal contact, 
ingestion from preening, and water consumption, but the extent of exposure through these means is 
expected to be minor in comparison to that of ingestion of pesticides through diet. Exposure levels 
on different types of vegetation or other terrestrial non-target invertebrates as dietary items were 
calculated using the Terrestrial Residue Exposure Model (T-REX) (US EPA, 2012). To assess the 
acute and chronic risk to mammals, the most sensitive acute and chronic endpoints were used and 
compared to the T-REX estimated residues on dietary items with consideration for the size of the 
bird or mammal. Indirect risk to mammals was evaluated by reviewing impacts on habitat or prey 
base. For carbaryl, direct effects to mammals of all class sizes that feed on grasses, RQ values 
exceeded 1 (

 chronic endpoints were used and 
compared to the T-REX estimated residues on dietary items with consideration for the size of the 
bird or mammal. Indirect risk to mammals was evaluated by reviewing impacts on habitat or prey 
base. For carbaryl, direct effects to mammals of all class sizes that feed on grasses, RQ values 
exceeded 1 (i.e., likely to cause adverse effects). For chlorantraniliprole, RQs were below 1 (i.e., not 
likely to cause adverse effects) for all mammalian class sizes and for diflubenzuron, there is a slight 
risk to small mammals consuming short grass (see Table 4-8 in the BA). For indirect effects for all 
three pesticides, there is some concern for those mammals that rely on terrestrial invertebrate as prey 
items than for those consuming terrestrial or aquatic plants or other small mammals (see p. 69, 83, 
and 77 in the BA). However, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed mammals 
because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on mammals, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
To assess the acute and chronic risk to birds the most sensitive acute and chronic endpoints were 
used and compared to residue values on respective dietary items (based on the size of the bird), 
estimated using T-REX calculations discussed on pages 69, 78, and 84 to generate RQ values. 
RQs greater than 1 were reduced by implementing the proposed buffers to address impacts from 
program insecticides. For carbaryl, which shows a slight acute risk to birds that consume

contaminated prey (see Table 4-5 p. 70 in the BA), additional buffers for carbaryl applications 
were applied for known locations of adults (see Appendix A–9). 
Indirect risk to birds was evaluated by reviewing impacts on habitat or prey base. For carbaryl, 
direct effects to birds in the 20 and 100 g class sizes that feed on grasses, had RQ values 
exceeding 1 as mentioned above (see Table 4-5). For chlorantraniliprole and diflubenzuron, RQs 
were below 1 for all avian class sizes (see p. 69, 84, and 78 in the BA). For indirect effects for all 
three pesticides, RQ values discussed for small mammals which could be prey items for larger 
birds, are discussed above. For small birds as prey items for other avian species, RQ values are 
discussed above as well. For bird species that feed on insects, RQ values were >1 for 20 g and 
100 g birds for carbaryl, but were well below 1 for chlorantraniliprole and diflubenzuron (see p. 
69,70, 76, and 84). Indirect effects to bird species based on impacts to dietary items (insects) for 
insectivorous birds from exposure to diflubenzuron is also discussed. However, the rates used in 
the APHIS Program are such that they would not reach levels or concentrations that would

69,70, 76, and 84). Indirect effects to bird species based on impacts to dietary items (insects) for 
insectivorous birds from exposure to diflubenzuron is also discussed. However, the rates used in 
the APHIS Program are such that they would not reach levels or concentrations that would 
significantly reduce the availability of prey items for these avian species. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed birds because the proposed 
conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of these 
pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on birds, such that the effects cannot 
be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. There are no data for all three pesticides used 
in the APHIS program to assess risks of exposure to reptiles. Although there is uncertainty in 
making the assumption that the range of sensitivities for birds is representative for reptiles, we 
make this assumption in the absence of data. Based on the risk characterization and conclusions 
described above for birds, for both direct and indirect effects, we expect that all three pesticides 
will have insignificant effects on listed reptile species. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed reptiles because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on reptiles, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
For amphibians, direct risk of exposure was determined by using the highest aquatic 
concentration in water and comparing that to the acute and chronic values for each pesticide used 
in the APHIS program. For carbaryl, the highest value in water used was the value discussed 
above for bait considerations and compared to the toxicity threshold values discussed below for

, or evaluated. 
For amphibians, direct risk of exposure was determined by using the highest aquatic 
concentration in water and comparing that to the acute and chronic values for each pesticide used 
in the APHIS program. For carbaryl, the highest value in water used was the value discussed 
above for bait considerations and compared to the toxicity threshold values discussed below for 
the carbaryl bait application exposures. For chlorantraniliprole, there are no data for amphibians. 
Instead, we rely on the fish toxicity data. This assumption is similar to using the toxicity data for 
birds to represent effects for reptiles. While this approach has uncertainty associated with 
whether the data capture the range of sensitivities to amphibians from chlorantraniliprole, we 
make this assumption based on the risk characterization described above for fish exposed to 
chlorantraniliprole. Chlorantraniliprole toxicity in fish is considered low based on available 
toxicity data reporting mortality above the solubility limit (1 mg/L). Two early life-stage tests in 
the rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) and sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) 
showed chlorantraniliprole may have effects at 0.11 and 1.28 mg/L, respectively. 
For diflubenzuron, using the fish data, the 30-d NOEC value of > 45 µg/L for rainbow trout 
(Hansen & Garton, 1982) is compared to the highest residue calculated (0.04 µg/L; described in 
Section II in the BA). Indirect effects to amphibians can include loss of habitat and dietary items.

chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron at all program rates poses minimal risk to aquatic and 
terrestrial plants. This is discussed more in the BA on pages 65, 73, 74, 81, 82, and 85 for the 
program chemicals. For amphibians that feed on aquatic invertebrates or other aquatic 
vertebrates, risk of exposure from all three program insecticides is discussed above in the 
“Aquatic Species” section of this Risk Characterization. We anticipate that the effects to these 
species will be insignificant because pesticide residues for aquatic plants, aquatic invertebrates, 
or fish do not exceed any toxicity endpoint for these taxonomic groups. For the potential indirect 
terrestrial route of exposure to amphibians, terrestrial invertebrates could serve as a food source 
for amphibians (see below discussion). However, the selectivity of diflubenzuron to developing 
insects would not cause significant decreases in food availability for amphibians, nor does it 
bioconcentrate if an amphibian were to consume a contaminated insect. Similarly, for carbaryl or 
chlorantraniliprole, these insecticides do not bioconcentrate. Carbaryl is very highly toxic to 
insects at label rates (see discussion in BA), and chlorantraniliprole is most toxic to those 
developing insects such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae via ingestion and not as toxic

 Similarly, for carbaryl or 
chlorantraniliprole, these insecticides do not bioconcentrate. Carbaryl is very highly toxic to 
insects at label rates (see discussion in BA), and chlorantraniliprole is most toxic to those 
developing insects such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae via ingestion and not as toxic via 
contact exposure (see BA p. 63). Thus, the reduced program application rates would not 
eliminate the insect prey base entirely and would not reduce the availability of prey items to 
amphibians in other insect Orders from exposure to carbaryl or chlorantraniliprole. In addition, 
chlorantraniliprole is not toxic to soil dwelling invertebrates such as isopods, or earthworms (see 
BA p. 63), which could also be considered for terrestrial based dietary items for amphibians. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed amphibians because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on amphibians, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
For terrestrial invertebrates, risk of exposure from all three program insecticides differs among 
various insect Orders. This is discussed in more detail on pages 72, 73, 79, and 85 in the BA. A 
variety of field studies under a variety of application setting, including monitoring from the 
APHIS program applications have been conducted and demonstrate minimal residues of 
diflubenzuron. Minimal to no impacts to non-target arthropods such as honey bees, moths, and

APHIS program applications have been conducted and demonstrate minimal residues of 
diflubenzuron. Minimal to no impacts to non-target arthropods such as honey bees, moths, and 
other insect Orders such as Coleoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera, Heteroptera, Homoptera, 
Neuroptera, and Plecoptera were demonstrated from diflubenzuron exposure (Emmett & Archer, 
1980), (Atkins, Anderson, Kellum, & Heuman, 1976), (Johansen, Mayer, Eves, & Kious, 1983), 
(Schroeder, Sutton, & Beavers, 1980), (Robinson A. F., 1979) (Deakle & Bradley, 1982), 
(Sample, Cooper, & Whitmore, 1993), (Catangui, Fuller, & Walz, 1993), (Weiland, Judge, Pels, 
& Grosscourt, 2002), (Tingle, 1996) (Graham, Brasher, & Close, 2008). In addition, the 
extensive buffers determined via AgDrift modeling and confirmed with field assessments 
indicates the proposed buffers from 250 ft for ground applications and up to 1 mile for some 
aerial applications (buffers of 1,320 ft reduce drift by approximately 89-98%; see BA p. 73)

the program applications rates (0.75 fl. oz/ acre and 1.0 fl. oz/acre for ground and aerial 
applications, respectively) are well reduced from label rates recommended for Orthoptera,

Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed terrestrial invertebrate

environmental concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect 
on terrestrial invertebrate species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, 
detected, or evaluated. 
Risk of adverse effects to terrestrial plants from all three APHIS program insecticides is 
considered minimal. Based on the available toxicity data discussed above for carbaryl, 
chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron, phytotoxic effects are not anticipated from program 
insecticide applications. However, potential indirect effects of carbaryl on pollinators is 
considered. As discussed above in the Effects of the Action section for carbaryl and terrestrial 
invertebrates, laboratory studies have indicated several species of honeybees and bumblebees are 
sensitive to carbaryl, but these are at rates above those used in the program, and effects have not 
been measured extensively in field studies. One study based on a carbaryl application rate of 
0.80 lb a.i./acre in a fruit orchard indicated no effects on honeybee mortality or behavior 7 days 
post application. Any potential impacts to honey bees or

sensitive to carbaryl, but these are at rates above those used in the program, and effects have not 
been measured extensively in field studies. One study based on a carbaryl application rate of 
0.80 lb a.i./acre in a fruit orchard indicated no effects on honeybee mortality or behavior 7 days 
post application. Any potential impacts to honey bees or bumble bees may also be mitigated by 
the reduced application rates for the program, the RAATs (alternating swaths where the 
insecticide is applied), as well as use of carbaryl bait as opposed to ground or aerial spray 
applications (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1994), (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1995). 
Indirect risk to terrestrial plants from impacts to pollinators from chlorantraniliprole is not 
expected to be significant. Grasshopper nymphs appear to be the most impacted compared to 
other insect groups. Various laboratory and field data indicate low toxicity to other insect groups 
such as honeybees and bumblebees (i.e., those groups more likely to be pollinators to terrestrial 
plants), where no mortality or sublethal effects were observed (see Effects of the Action section 
for terrestrial invertebrates discussed above), and application rates 4 to 10 times higher than 
program rates are shown to have better efficacy in controlling Lepidoptera and other insect pests. 
Indirect risk to terrestrial plants is also not expected from impacts to pollinators from 
diflubenzuron. As discussed above in the Effects of the Action section for terrestrial 
invertebrates, a variety of field studies under a variety of application settings, including 
monitoring from the APHIS program applications, have been conducted and demonstrate

 to terrestrial plants is also not expected from impacts to pollinators from 
diflubenzuron. As discussed above in the Effects of the Action section for terrestrial 
invertebrates, a variety of field studies under a variety of application settings, including 
monitoring from the APHIS program applications, have been conducted and demonstrate 
minimal residues of diflubenzuron have minimal to no impacts to non-target arthropods such as 
honeybees, moths, and other insect Orders. Negative effects have been observed in honeybees in 
some studies, but this was observed at application levels and periods of time that exceed those 
expected to be used in the program. (Robinson & Johansen, 1978) found that diflubenzuron 
application rates as high as 0.125 to .25 lbs. a.i./acre (10 and 20 times the program rate for 
diflubenzuron) resulted in no effect on adult mortality and brood production in honeybees. As 
discussed above, the use of RAATS provide additional protection by limiting the area of 
treatment within the spray block to further reduce the potential risk of exposure to pollinators. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed terrestrial plant species 
because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect on terrestrial 
plant species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
 
Bait Applications of Carbaryl 
Bait formulations of carbaryl are primarily composed of a grain such as wheat bran or rolled 
whole grain or a pellet mixed with the carbaryl. They are used mostly to control crickets as some 
species of grasshopper do not eat the bait, but some other advantages are

through ingestion, affect fewer non target organisms, and generate very little drift (Foster, 1996), 
(Latchininsky & Van Dyke, 2006), (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1994) 
For bait applications of carbaryl, direct risk of exposure to mammals was calculated using the 
LD50’s per square foot method described in the BA (Section IV A. Insecticide Risk Assessment 
Methodology). When the LD50 per square foot is greater than 1, there is an assumed risk as a 
conservative estimate that the mammal (or bird as the same approach is used for birds) will 
consume the entire bait. RQs were above 1 for all mammals except the 1,000 g group, when no 
application buffer is applied. With an adjusted buffer of 500 feet, the RQs are below 1.0 for all 
mammalian size classes (see Table 4-3 and p. 68 in the BA), and all estimated residues from bait 
applications are anticipated to be below the acute NOEL value (10mg/kg). 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed mammals because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on mammals, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated
Text Len: 1628
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 to be below the acute NOEL value (10mg/kg). 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed mammals because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on mammals, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
For carbaryl bait applications, direct risk of exposure to birds was also assessed. The lowest 
acute avian LD50 value of 16 mg/kg (European starling; see Carbaryl toxicity section discussed 
above) was used. RQ values were greater than 1 for all size classes without an application buffer; 
however, drift reductions are observed when a 500-ft buffer is applied, and RQ values fall below 
1 (see Table 4-6 in the BA). As previously discussed, we assume similar impacts from carbaryl 
bait applications to reptiles as to that of birds. Indirect effects from carbaryl bait to both 
mammals and birds are also not expected. We do not expect indirect effects to plants used as 
habitat or dietary items for birds and mammals; we also do not expect indirect effects to small 
mammals, small birds, or terrestrial invertebrates exposed to carbaryl bait used as dietary items 
for birds and mammals. This discussion is covered in more detail in the BA p 68-73. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed birds because the proposed 
conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of 
carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on birds, such that the effects 
cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
Direct risk of exposure to amphibians from carbaryl bait applications was assessed by taking the

 affect listed birds because the proposed 
conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of 
carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on birds, such that the effects 
cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
Direct risk of exposure to amphibians from carbaryl bait applications was assessed by taking the 
highest estimated concentration of carbaryl in an aquatic system (1.10 µg/L) and comparing that 
to the acute and chronic values for amphibians. Impacts of carbaryl bait applications on 
amphibians are minimal based on the LC50 values reported for tadpoles (1.73–22.02 mg/L) at 
approximately 1,572 to 20,018 times below the highest calculated carbaryl residue, suggesting 
minimal acute risk of bait applications (and ULV applications based on the same toxicity 
endpoint used for both application methods). Sublethal effects to amphibians are also not 
anticipated based on chronic studies with a NOEC for swimming behavior of 1.25 mg/L and a 
tadpole NOEC for mean age at metamorphosis (0.16 mg/L). 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed amphibians because the 
proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated environmental 
concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on amphibians, 
such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, or evaluated. 
Direct risk of exposure to terrestrial invertebrates from carbaryl bait applications is considered 
but is less likely to impact most Orders of terrestrial insects. Studies with carbaryl bran bait have 
 
Page | 122 
 
 
found that no sublethal effects were observed on adult or larval alfalfa leaf cutting bees (Peach,

Alston, & Tepedino, 1994), (Peach, Alston, & Tepedino, 1995) and see also p. 73 in the BA). 
Carbaryl bait also poses a low risk to most insect Orders as it is preferentially consumed by 
grasshoppers. There also is less exposure to Hymenoptera or Lepidoptera because the active 
ingredient is contained in the bait and not available for dietary or contact exposure (it is not 
sprayed) and would not be found on floral resources that would be visited by Lepidoptera or 
Hymenoptera during normal activities. 
Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect listed terrestrial invertebrate 
species because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated 
environmental concentrations of carbaryl bait to levels that would have an insignificant effect on 
terrestrial invertebrate species, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully measured, detected, 
or evaluated. 
 
Critical Habitat 
For critical habitat, APHIS reviewed the primary constituent elements (PCEs) or physical and 
biological features (PBFs) to determine if the program activities would cause destruction or 
adverse modification of these features. For many species, designated critical habitat PCEs or 
PBFs are aspects of the physical landscape such as geomorphological features, soil types, 
hydrologic regimes, as well as the necessary vegetative features. None of

 physical and 
biological features (PBFs) to determine if the program activities would cause destruction or 
adverse modification of these features. For many species, designated critical habitat PCEs or 
PBFs are aspects of the physical landscape such as geomorphological features, soil types, 
hydrologic regimes, as well as the necessary vegetative features. None of the program 
insecticides are expected to impact geomorphological formations or hydrologic regimes. Other 
PCEs or PBFs for certain species involve an adequate source of invertebrate prey items (many 
listed bird species and fish), specified water quality parameters for certain aquatic species to 
support a healthy system (pH, adequate dissolved oxygen, low salinity, lack of pollutants, low 
turbidity, low ammonia, etc.), and the absence of predators or invasives. 
As discussed earlier, there is minimal risk to designated critical habitat PCEs or PBFs involving 
any vegetative structures for habitat or other plants these species may rely on for feeding, 
breeding, or sheltering, because the program’s proposed use of the insecticides is not expected to 
result in phytotoxic effects. 
There is some risk that the program activities could affect designated critical habitats with PCEs 
or PBFs described as an adequate prey base of terrestrial invertebrates or aquatic invertebrates. 
However, the standard program mitigation involving 500 ft buffers for aerial applications, 200 ft 
buffers for ground applications, and 50 ft for bait applications to all water bodies will minimize 
the impacts to aquatic invertebrate prey items from drift. Table 5-2 in the BA provides a list of 
all proposed buffers to protect fish and designated critical habitats. Program designated buffers 
and reduced application rates along with RAAT applications will also minimize impacts to the 

Text Len: 1853

buffers for ground applications, and 50 ft for bait applications to all water bodies will minimize 
the impacts to aquatic invertebrate prey items from drift. Table 5-2 in the BA provides a list of 
all proposed buffers to protect fish and designated critical habitats. Program designated buffers 
and reduced application rates along with RAAT applications will also minimize impacts to the 
terrestrial invertebrate prey base for designated critical habitats. For example, because nesting 
success and brood survival are directly linked to adequate invertebrate prey available to 
developing lesser prairie chicken chicks, and ultimately lesser prairie chicken success, adequate 
buffers protecting lesser prairie chicken are warranted. Adults rely on a variety of food items 
throughout the year but predominantly vegetation during the fall, winter, and early spring (US 
FWS, 2012). Additional buffer distances to protect leks and allow for adequate prey items for 
adults and developing chicks were applied for carbaryl, as it demonstrated some toxicity to 
terrestrial invertebrates as discussed above (see also p. 52-53 and 93 in the BA). Similar 
mitigations are also applied for other prairie birds, such as the Gunnison and greater sage grouse.

Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect designated critical habitat PCEs or 
PBFs because the proposed conservation measures are expected to lower the estimated 
environmental concentrations of these pesticides to levels that would have an insignificant effect 
on designated critical habitat PCEs or PBFs, such that the effects cannot be meaningfully 
measured, detected, or evaluated.

Summary and Conclusion 
APHIS evaluated their grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression program application of 
three insecticides, carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, and diflubenzuron to listed species and their 
designated critical habitat as applicable. They provide an overview of the exposure and response 
analyses for terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate groups, as well as plants, and 
considered all the relevant pathways of exposure for each. As such they established several 
avoidance and minimization measures to ensure that the use of these insecticides for their 
program activities is not likely to adversely impact listed species and their designated critical 
habitat as applicable. APHIS ensures that buffers established based on modeled estimates and 
program application data will be applied during all program activities. In addition to substantial 
buffers used within species’ ranges and designated critical habitats, reduced program application 
rates and RAAT treatment methods will minimize direct and indirect risk of adverse effects from 
exposure of pesticides to listed mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, terrestrial insects, 
aquatic invertebrates, and plants. Therefore, the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect 
listed species and designated critical habitat because the proposed conservation measures are 
expected to lower the estimated environmental concentrations of these pesticides to levels that 
would have an insignificant effect on these species and their designated critical habitats. 
 
Aquatic Species 
For all listed aquatic species within the program action area, the following buffers are applied for 
each pesticide (Table 1, adapted from Table 5-2 see also Appendix A-9 in the BA or Enclosure

The estimated residues from the application methods and application concentrations in Table 1 
are the expected range of concentrations where adverse effects to fish or amphibians are 
expected to occur. These buffers are applied as such because they are protective of all aquatic 
species as well as their designated critical habitats, as applicable, and any indirect effects to 
listed fish species’ prey items such as aquatic invertebrates, or terrestrial invertebrates (which are 
more sensitive; see Figures 2-2, 2-3, and Table 2-3 in the BA for how these buffer distances were 
determined) are also minimized.

Bait Applications for Carbaryl 
Run-off or drift from bait applications to water bodies is expected to be minimal as the active 
ingredient is contained within the bait/bran or grain mix and not susceptible to off-site transport 
via rain events or volatilization. Labels for carbaryl also do not allow the product to enter water 
bodies, and thus, to preclude the possibility of the bait moving into aquatic systems, there are

 expected to be minimal as the active 
ingredient is contained within the bait/bran or grain mix and not susceptible to off-site transport 
via rain events or volatilization. Labels for carbaryl also do not allow the product to enter water 
bodies, and thus, to preclude the possibility of the bait moving into aquatic systems, there are 
standard buffers for water bodies used for all program activities, regardless of the presence of 
listed species or critical habitat. An example of such a scenario is described on p. 28 in the BA, 
where carbaryl was detected downstream from where bait applications were made when an area 
 
Page | 125 
 
 
that was treated was irrigated. Residues were measured upstream and downstream of the 
discharge. Residue values upstream were 1.2 μg/L while residue values at 5.5 and 8.0 miles 
below the discharge were 2.0 and 1.6 μg/L, respectively. However, there is uncertainty regarding 
whether these values represent any contribution from APHIS applications. 
 
APHIS also implements additional buffers for water bodies that are not designated as critical 
habitat for listed aquatic species: 500-foot buffer for aerial sprays, 200-foot buffer for ground 
sprays, and a 50-foot buffer for bait applications. Thus, the buffers for bait applications of 
carbaryl for aquatic species are uniformly applied for all species (see Appendix A-9 in the BA, 
Enclosure B, and Table 1 above) and are sufficiently protective to avoid the likelihood of any 
adverse effects. 
Buffers for bait application of carbaryl vary by terrestrial species taxonomic group and habitat

Enclosure B, and Table 1 above) and are sufficiently protective to avoid the likelihood of any 
adverse effects. 
Buffers for bait application of carbaryl vary by terrestrial species taxonomic group and habitat 
(see Appendix A-9 in the BA, Enclosure B, and Table 2 above). These buffers are generally less 
distance than for aerial or other ground application methods, except for what is applied for 
prairie birds or riparian mammals (see discussion below and on p. 93 in the BA, Appendix A-9 
in the BA, or Enclosure B), as this application method results in less drift and therefore 
subsequently less exposure (see p. 6-7 in the BA). In addition, the nature of the bait is also such 
that because it is a solid and absorbed by the bran or other carrier (see p. 6 in the BA for bait 
preparation methods), it is less bioavailable, especially for potential dermal contact exposure for 
all terrestrial species. Drift reductions expected for all size classes of mammals and birds from 
the application of a 500-ft buffer are estimated at greater than 99% (see Tables 4-3 and 4-6 in the 
BA). For terrestrial invertebrates, program buffers for bait applications are similar to that of 
mammals and birds. Any indirect effects to listed species’ prey items are discussed above for the 
different taxonomic groups, and effects to designated critical habitat for listed species from 
carbaryl bait applications is also expected to be insignificant.

carbaryl bait applications is also expected to be insignificant. 
As a result of the APHIS program conservation measures such as use of the buffer distances 
discussed above for all taxonomic groups and their designated critical habitats, as applicable, 
along with the reduced application rates as compared to label rates for each insecticide, and 
RAAT treatment procedures, any risk of exposure associated with the application of the three 
insecticides used under the APHIS grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression program is 
expected to be minimal. Thus, any direct or indirect effects from the proposed action to listed 
species and their designated critical habitats are expected to be insignificant due to program 
conservation measures. 
This concludes consultation. As stated in 50 CFR § 402.16, reinitiation of consultation is 
required and shall be requested by APHIS or the Service, where discretionary Federal 
involvement or control over the action has been retained or is authorized by law and: (1) If new 
information reveals effects of the action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a 
manner to an extent not previously considered; (2) If the identified action is subsequently 
modified in a manner that causes an effect to the listed species or critical habitat that was not 
considered in this concurrence letter; or (3) If a new species is listed or critical habitat designated 
that may be affected by the identified action.

Grasshopper Mitigation by USDA APHIS PPQ 
 
Dear Mr. Park: 
 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has reviewed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine 
(PPQ) program’s request for concurrence that the Grasshopper Mitigation Program (Program) 
may affect but is not likely to adversely affect species or habitats listed under the

) has reviewed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine 
(PPQ) program’s request for concurrence that the Grasshopper Mitigation Program (Program) 
may affect but is not likely to adversely affect species or habitats listed under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; Act). Your March 7, 2022 request for 
informal consultation and accompanying biological assessment (Assessment; APHIS 2022) was 
received by the Service on the same day. The species and their critical habitats subject to 
informal consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Act are presented in Table 1 below. 
APHIS also determined that implementation of the Program will have no effect on the following 
species: Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), Gray wolf (Canis lupus), Northern spotted owl (Strix 
occidentalis caurin), Gentner's fritillary (Fritillaria gentneri), MacFarlane’s four-o’clock 
(Mirabilis macfarlanii), Malheur wire-lettuce (Stephanomeria malheurensis), Whitebark pine 
(Pinus albicaulis), Slender Orcutt grass (Orcuttia tenuis), and Green’s Tuctoria (Tuctoria 
greenei). The regulations implementing section 7 of the Act do not require the Service to review 
or concur with no effect determinations. However, the Service acknowledges that the basis for 
these no effect determinations is clear and reasonable. 
APHIS also included protective measures for formerly designated candidate species (greater

s Tuctoria (Tuctoria 
greenei). The regulations implementing section 7 of the Act do not require the Service to review 
or concur with no effect determinations. However, the Service acknowledges that the basis for 
these no effect determinations is clear and reasonable. 
APHIS also included protective measures for formerly designated candidate species (greater 
sage-grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus and the Columbia spotted frog, Rana luteiventris); and 
recently delisted species (Borax Lake chub, Gila boraxobius and Foskett speckled dace, 
Rhinichthys osculus). Legally, APHIS does not have to implement conservation 
recommendations for candidate and non-listed species; however, addressing these species at this 
stage of consultation may minimize or avoid adverse effects to the species and may avert 
potential future conflicts.

In November 2019, APHIS published an updated Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
document, from the original 2002 EIS, concerning suppression of grasshopper (Camnula 
pellucida) and Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) populations in 17 western states, and 
incorporated the available data and analysis of the environmental risk of new program tools. The 
EIS described the actions available to APHIS to reduce the damage caused by grasshopper

pper (Camnula 
pellucida) and Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) populations in 17 western states, and 
incorporated the available data and analysis of the environmental risk of new program tools. The 
EIS described the actions available to APHIS to reduce the damage caused by grasshopper 
populations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and 
Wyoming. APHIS includes discussion of information cited in the 2019 EIS and refers to it as 
“incorporated by reference” in the Assessment. The Service would like to clarify that the 
Service is not concurring on the 2019 EIS proposed action. The reference to the 2019 EIS is for 
informational purposes only and not as a request for consultation on that proposed action. 
The proposed action which is being consulted on, is the “Site-Specific Environmental 
Assessment Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Suppression Program - Oregon” (OR- 
22-01) prepared by APHIS (EA) which describes site specific issues related to potential 
grasshopper suppression programs. The described action is located in Baker, Crook, Deschutes, 
Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Jefferson, Klamath, Lake, Malheur, Morrow, Sherman, Umatilla, Union, 
Wallowa, Wasco, and Wheeler counties of Oregon. Cropland of any kind (including lands

Wallowa, Wasco, and Wheeler counties of Oregon. Cropland of any kind (including lands

enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program) is not eligible for treatment under this 
Assessment. Implementation of the Program will only be conducted when potential 
economically damaging populations of grasshoppers occur, funding exists, there is a written 
request from the land manager(s), and APHIS determines that treatment is necessary. 
After several coordination meetings between APHIS and the Service prior to the informal 
consultation conducted in 2003, APHIS developed a proposed action with protective buffers 
designed to prevent application of pesticides within a prescribed distance of federally-listed 
species to prevent effects from spray application. In order to implement the avoidance buffers, 
APHIS will need to survey for certain species whose distributions are unknown or poorly 
understood. Such surveys are not likely needed for fish species or frogs for whose distributions 
are limited to specific habitats such as waterways, or plants that are sessile and whose 
distributions are well known. Since yellow-billed cuckoo distribution is not well understood or 
unknown in the project area, APHIS will confer with the Service to consult recent survey records 
or conduct surveys of high potential for nesting and foraging habitat prior to implementing the 
suppression program. 
 
PROPOSED ACTION 
 
The proposed action is a statewide program for grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression 
activities described in the site-specific EA (OR-22-01) tiered to the 2002 EIS. APHIS treatment 
programs also follow the Treatment Guidelines (included in the EA) and the Grasshopper 
Program Statement of Work (or Prospectus) developed by APHIS. Suppression treatments are

 grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression 
activities described in the site-specific EA (OR-22-01) tiered to the 2002 EIS. APHIS treatment 
programs also follow the Treatment Guidelines (included in the EA) and the Grasshopper 
Program Statement of Work (or Prospectus) developed by APHIS. Suppression treatments are 
typically implemented from May through early June. Treatments later in the growing season are 
strongly discouraged due to lack of effect for the available pesticides in the Program, as well as a 
greatly reduced likelihood of preventing damage in the current year. However, treatments may 
still be advisable with sites or grasshopper populations exhibiting unusual phenology and will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis through July and into August. 
 
The chemical control methods used by APHIS include the use of liquid sprays of diflubenzuron 
and a bait formulation of carbaryl, applied at conventional rates and as reduced agent area 
treatments (RAATs). The preferred chemical control methods for treatment of grasshoppers in 
Oregon by APHIS PPQ include the use of liquid spray diflubenzuron and carbaryl in a bait 
formulation applied as RAATs. 
 
Under this Program, APHIS would make a single application per year to a treatment area and 
could apply insecticide at rate conventionally used for grasshopper suppression treatments, or 
more typically as RAATs. APHIS will select which insecticides and rates are most appropriate 
for suppression of a grasshopper outbreak based on several biological, logistical, environmental, 
and economical criteria. The identification of grasshopper species and their life stage largely 
determines the choice of insecticides used among those available to the program. RAAT

 or 
more typically as RAATs. APHIS will select which insecticides and rates are most appropriate 
for suppression of a grasshopper outbreak based on several biological, logistical, environmental, 
and economical criteria. The identification of grasshopper species and their life stage largely 
determines the choice of insecticides used among those available to the program. RAATs are the 
most common application method for all program insecticides, and only rarely do rangeland pest 
conditions warrant full coverage and higher rates. Under this Program, carbaryl or diflubenzuron 
would cover all treatable sites within the designated treatment block per label directions, 
typically at the following application rates: 
• 10.0 pounds (0.20 lb a.i.) of 2 percent carbaryl bait per acre; 
• 0.75 or 1.0 fluid ounce (0.012 lb a.i.) of diflubenzuron per acre.

Insecticide applications at conventional rates and complete area coverage, is an approach that 
APHIS has used in the past but is currently uncommon. Under this Program, carbaryl bait or 
diflubenzuron would cover all treatable sites within the designated treatment block per label 
directions. The application rates under this Program are typically at the following application 
rates: 
• 10.0 pounds (0.50 lbs. a.i.) of 5 percent carbaryl bait per acre; 
• 2.0 fluid ounce (0.032 lbs. a.i.) of diflubenzuron per acre.

be considered for use in the program in 2022 and is not included in this consultation. Service 
concurrence is limited to the use of liquid diflubenzuron and carbaryl bait as described in the 
proposed action in APHIS’ 2022 Assessment. 
The proposed action maintains a standard, programmatic 500 foot buffer from water for all aerial 
ultra low volume (ULV) treatments, a 200 foot buffer from water for all aerial bait treatments, a 
200 foot buffer from water for all liquid ground treatments, and a 50 foot buffer from water for 
all ground bait treatments. These standard buffers are in place to reduce the chance that a 
pesticide used for grasshopper suppression will enter water. In order to protect listed plant 
species, APHIS will implement the following measures from the edge of known listed plant 
species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used for from known locations of 
listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 feet from the edge of 
known locations of listed plant species.

species, APHIS will implement the following measures from the edge of known listed plant 
species locations: a 3 mile buffer for aerial applications will be used for from known locations of 
listed plant species. Carbaryl bait ground application may be used up to 50 feet from the edge of 
known locations of listed plant species. 
 
EFFECTS TO FEDERALLY LISTED WILDLIFE AND THEIR CRITICAL HABITAT 
 
The buffers are mandatory as part of the proposed action and are designed to avoid 
contamination of federally-listed species habitats. APHIS’s assessment concludes the buffers 
reduce or eliminate the potential for direct exposure to the federally-listed species and reduces 
the chance of indirect effects being substantial enough to adversely affect the federally-listed 
species. The buffers were not derived by specific impact and distance data, but are based on 
field tests demonstrating the absence of detectable levels of chemical. APHIS’s determination is 
the Project’s protective measures reduce the potential effects of the action to the point that the 
effects are insignificant or the probability of adverse effect is discountable and therefore the 
project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the federally-listed species listed in Table 
1. 
CONCURRENCE 
The Service reviewed the Project described in the Assessment in accordance with section 7(a)(2) 
of the Act. Based on the Service’s review of the Assessment and other information, we concur 
with APHIS’s determination that the Program actions proposed for 2022, in 17 counties of 
Oregon (described previously) may affect, but are not likely to adversely affect the 11 
endangered and threatened species listed in Table 1, nor their designated critical habitats, where 
applicable.

with APHIS’s determination that the Program actions proposed for 2022, in 17 counties of 
Oregon (described previously) may affect, but are not likely to adversely affect the 11 
endangered and threatened species listed in Table 1, nor their designated critical habitats, where 
applicable.

Our concurrence with your “not likely to adversely affect” determination for threatened and 
endangered species is based on the conservation measures that will be incorporated into the 
action. Risk of adverse effects to the federally-listed species listed in Table 1 is minimal due the 
following factors as described in the proposed action: 
1. All applicable Federal, State, Tribal, and local environmental laws and regulations will be 
followed in conducting suppression activities. 
2. Information displayed in the Assessment on effects from application of diflubenzuron 
and carbaryl support the conclusion that adverse effects to federally-listed species are 
avoided under the proposed action. APHIS will restrict or avoid insecticide applications 
such that indirect effects to federally-listed species and their habitats will be insignificant 
and discountable. 
 
3. APHIS will avoid applying pesticides in areas of known or potentially occupied 
threatened and endangered species habitat to reduce direct and indirect effects consistent 
with Table 2 of the Assessment. Potential indirect effects described in the Assessment 
include reductions in insect prey for local populations of birds, impacts to aquatic 
environments, and effects on plant productivity from reductions in non-target pollinator 
insect populations. 
 
4. Pesticides will not be applied in areas known to have a high water table, or where sub 
surface leaching is likely. Carbaryl bait will not be applied within 500 feet
Text Len: 1851
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 in insect prey for local populations of birds, impacts to aquatic 
environments, and effects on plant productivity from reductions in non-target pollinator 
insect populations. 
 
4. Pesticides will not be applied in areas known to have a high water table, or where sub 
surface leaching is likely. Carbaryl bait will not be applied within 500 feet of any water 
which contains threatened and endangered species at any time. Designated critical habitat 
that is currently unoccupied would be treated as occupied habitat unless otherwise 
directed by the Service prior to treatment. 
 
5. Aerial spray applications of diflubenzuron or carbaryl will not be conducted within 0.5 
mile of any flowing or standing water which contains threatened and endangered fish 
species at any time. Aerial spray applications will not occur within 500 feet of occupied 
Oregon spotted frog habitat at any time. Ground application of diflubenzuron or 
carbaryl, will not be conducted within 500 feet of any flowing or standing water which 
contains threatened and endangered fish species at any time. Ground application will not 
be conducted within 200 feet of occupied Oregon spotted frog habitat at any time. 
Designated critical habitat that is currently unoccupied would be treated as occupied 
habitat unless otherwise directed by the Service prior to treatment. Aerial application of 
pesticides will not be conducted when winds exceed ten miles per hour. To avoid drift 
and volatilization, aerial application of pesticides will not be conducted when it is raining 
or rain is imminent, when foliage is wet, when it is foggy, when temperature exceeds 80 
degrees Fahrenheit, when there is air turbulence, or when a temperature inversion exists 
in the project area. Boundaries and buffers will be clearly marked. Aircraft used in aerial 
application will be equipped with systems

 application of pesticides will not be conducted when it is raining 
or rain is imminent, when foliage is wet, when it is foggy, when temperature exceeds 80 
degrees Fahrenheit, when there is air turbulence, or when a temperature inversion exists 
in the project area. Boundaries and buffers will be clearly marked. Aircraft used in aerial 
application will be equipped with systems to prevent nozzle dribble when the spray 
mechanism is disabled and emergency shut off valves to minimize pesticide loss in the 
event of broken lines, or system malfunctions. 
 
6. All mixing and loading will be done in approved areas where spills cannot enter any body 
of water. All pesticide tanks will be leak proof and constructed of corrosion resistant 
135

materials. Aircraft used in aerial application will be equipped with APHIS-approved 
differentially corrected global positioning systems that guide pilots along desired flight 
paths with an accuracy of plus or minus three feet. Free flying will not be allowed. 
 
7. APHIS will monitor insecticide applications and will document compliance with the 
protective measures in the Assessment. Emphasis should be on determining the 
effectiveness of avoidance buffers for federally-listed species including indirect affects to 
prey animals and pollinators and indirect transportation of insecticide products to non- 
target areas, including all water bodies. 
 
8. APHIS will notify the Service before any application of pesticide and determine the 
location of any federally-listed or proposed threatened or endangered listed species. 
APHIS will provide the Service with maps and GIS shape files of proposed treatment 
areas for the Service to use to determine accurate locations of the action in relation to 
known species locations. 
 
This concurrence is based on APHIS’s implementation

location of any federally-listed or proposed threatened or endangered listed species. 
APHIS will provide the Service with maps and GIS shape files of proposed treatment 
areas for the Service to use to determine accurate locations of the action in relation to 
known species locations. 
 
This concurrence is based on APHIS’s implementation of the avoidance and mitigation measures 
outlined above. To assist in future consultations we request APHIS provide the Service a 
summary of environmental monitoring activities conducted each year in which suppression 
activities are conducted. The report shall be submitted on or before January 1 (or an APHIS and 
Service mutually agreed upon date) every year prior to initiation of the next grasshopper and 
cricket suppression activity. 
This concludes informal consultation on the subject action. This informal consultation does not 
exempt APHIS from prohibition of take under section 7(a)(2) of the ESA for any of the 11 
species listed above. This informal consultation may be superseded by a future programmatic 
consultation and covers only those activities carried out in 2021 as described in the Assessment. 
As provided in 50 CFR § 402.16, reinitiation of consultation may be necessary if: (1) new 
information reveals effects of the agency action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in 
a manner or to an extent not considered herein; (2) the action is subsequently modified in a 
manner that causes an effect to listed species or critical habitat that was not considered herein; or 
(3) a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the action. 
 
ADDITIONAL (CANDIDATE AND NON-LISTED) SPECIES PROTECTION 
 
In addition to the above species listed under the Act, the Service maintains
Text Len: 1821
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ner that causes an effect to listed species or critical habitat that was not considered herein; or 
(3) a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the action. 
 
ADDITIONAL (CANDIDATE AND NON-LISTED) SPECIES PROTECTION 
 
In addition to the above species listed under the Act, the Service maintains a list of species that 
are candidates for listing. Candidate species are plants and animals for which the Service has 
sufficient information on their biological status and threats to propose them as endangered or 
threatened under the Act, but for which development of a proposed listing regulation is 
precluded by other higher priority listing activities. Candidate species are separate from species 
that are listed as threatened or endangered, in that they do not receive the regulatory protections 
of the Act. In previous consultations, APHIS considered protective measures for the greater 
sage-grouse and Columbia spotted frog; however, these species have subsequently been removed 
(USFWS 2015, 2016) from the candidate list. In addition, APHIS will continue to provide 
protective measures and consult the Service annually on Borax Lake chub and Foskett speckled 
dace which were delisted on July 13, 2020 and October 15, 2019, respectively, due to recovery. 
The Service is also recommending protection of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), a 
candidate under the Act. The Service values ongoing conservation and protection of these 
136

species to prevent the need to list in the future, thus we are including the following conservation 
recommendations. 
 
Greater Sage-Grouse

species to prevent the need to list in the future, thus we are including the following conservation 
recommendations. 
 
Greater Sage-Grouse 
In March 2010, the Service determined that protection of the greater sage-grouse (hereafter, 
sage-grouse) under the Act was warranted. However, listing sage-grouse was precluded by the 
need to address other species’ listings facing greater risk of extinction (USFWS 2010). On 
October 2, 2015, the Service announced a 12-month finding on petitions to list sage-grouse both 
rangewide and the Columbia Basin population, as an endangered or threatened species under the 
Act (USFWS 2016). After review of the best available scientific and commercial information, 
the Service found that the Columbia Basin population does not qualify as a distinct population 
segment (DPS). In addition, the Service found listing sage- grouse was not warranted for 
protection under the Act at the time. 
 
Sage-grouse in Oregon are found in Union, Baker, Deschutes, Crook, Lake, Harney and Malheur 
counties. Sage-grouse have not been observed in Klamath County since 1993 (USFWS 2010). 
In 2015, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) finalized the “The Oregon Sage- 
Grouse Action Plan” to help manage sage-grouse populations in Oregon. This plan was an 
update to previous versions from 2005 and 2011 (Hagen 2005, ODFW 2011, Sage-Grouse 
Conservation Partnership 2015). The strategy relies upon Core Areas of habitat that are essential 
to sage-grouse conservation. The maps and data provide a tool

Grouse Action Plan” to help manage sage-grouse populations in Oregon. This plan was an 
update to previous versions from 2005 and 2011 (Hagen 2005, ODFW 2011, Sage-Grouse 
Conservation Partnership 2015). The strategy relies upon Core Areas of habitat that are essential 
to sage-grouse conservation. The maps and data provide a tool for planning and identifying 
appropriate avoidance areas and mitigation in the event of human development in sage-grouse 
habitats. The Core Area maps, available on ODFW’s website, define areas that should be 
targeted for conservation actions or avoided when large scale disturbances are proposed. Core 
Area maps also provide a broad-scale filter to assist planners, County, State and Federal agencies 
in identifying areas of likely high and low resource conflicts associated with development 
proposals. APHIS should ensure that all suppression activities conducted in Oregon are 
consistent with the measures identified within the 2015 plan, specifically those found in Section 
IV and Appendix 4 (Sage-Grouse Conservation Partnership 2015). 
 
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) developed protective measures for sage-grouse to be 
implemented on BLM-administered lands. The Service recommends APHIS follow 
recommendations in the “Oregon Greater Sage-Grouse Approved Resource Management Plan 
Amendment” (BLM 2015), such as, Required Design Features, including seasonal restrictions. 
The Service also recommends following information found in the BLM Instructional 
Memorandum (IM) Number 2016-115, dated June 24, 2016, for all spray activity on BLM- 
administered lands (BLM 2016), which the APHIS references in the proposed action. Within, 
Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMA) and occupied habitat the IM requires that

The Service also recommends following information found in the BLM Instructional 
Memorandum (IM) Number 2016-115, dated June 24, 2016, for all spray activity on BLM- 
administered lands (BLM 2016), which the APHIS references in the proposed action. Within, 
Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMA) and occupied habitat the IM requires that sage- 
grouse nesting/early brood-rearing habitat or summer/late brood-rearing habitat areas are not 
treated (spray or bait) during the respective seasonal use periods, unless: 
 
1) An emergency case exists as determined locally by both BLM and APHIS, or 
 
2) Habitat conditions are unsuitable for sage-grouse and the area is not likely to be 
occupied by sage-grouse at the time of treatments. 
137 
 
Page | 137 
 
3) If treatments in PHMAs and occupied habitat cannot be avoided, treat the minimum 
amount of area needed to ensure grasshopper and Mormon cricket control objectives. 
 
Within General Habitat Management Areas (GHMA), the IM requires treatment of the minimum 
amount of area needed to ensure grasshopper or Mormon cricket control objectives, as agreed to 
by BLM and APHIS locally, while avoiding occupied or likely occupied nesting or late brood- 
rearing habitat to the extent possible. 
Insect reduction as a result of rangeland grasshopper control has been found to reduce brood 
sizes in a wild sage-grouse population (Johnson 1987). The Service recommends APHIS works 
with the BLM to plan around areas occupied by sage-grouse during periods of sage-grouse chick 
foraging and development in May and June (or as appropriate to local circumstances) to provide 
insect availability for

pper control has been found to reduce brood 
sizes in a wild sage-grouse population (Johnson 1987). The Service recommends APHIS works 
with the BLM to plan around areas occupied by sage-grouse during periods of sage-grouse chick 
foraging and development in May and June (or as appropriate to local circumstances) to provide 
insect availability for early development of sage-grouse chicks. In addition, sage-grouse brood 
areas should be located if not already known, and protected from insecticide spraying (Johnson 
1987). Grasshopper control should also be delayed in brood- rearing areas to allow for maximal 
chick development before spraying reduces their insect forage (Johnson 1987). Treatment areas 
near active or pending leks will be evaluated by wildlife specialists prior to being considered for 
treatment. In general, a 4-mile buffer around active and pending leks will be avoided to protect 
nesting and early brood-rearing of sage-grouse chicks and food sources unless close to heavily 
infested private lands or areas within the buffer are determined by a wildlife biologist to not be 
suitable habitat for nesting or early brood-rearing. The Service recommends APHIS use these 
guidelines to avoid pesticide spraying of nesting and brood-rearing areas for sage-grouse in order 
to prevent further declines from current sage-grouse population levels. Exceptions to buffer 
restrictions for aerial spray and ground application of diflubenzuron or carbaryl should be made 
in consultation with the Service, appropriate ODFW area biologists, and BLM District resource 
specialists, on a case-by-case basis. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS study the potential effect of the rangeland grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket control program on sage-grouse, particularly

The Service recommends APHIS study the potential effect of the rangeland grasshopper and 
Mormon cricket control program on sage-grouse, particularly related to reduction in insects as 
forage, within nesting and brood-rearing habitat. We request that APHIS provide us with 
information regarding how they will avoid areas occupied by sage-grouse during time periods of 
sage-grouse chick foraging and development. The Service is available to assist APHIS to 
minimize and avoid impacts to sage-grouse. 
 
Columbia spotted frog Great Basin DPS 
 
The Columbia spotted frog Great Basin DPS (Great Basin DPS) is known to occur in Lake, 
Harney, Malheur, and Grant counties, Oregon. In addition to the counties in Oregon, the Great 
Basin DPS is also known to occur in portions of Idaho and Nevada. The Great Basin DPS is 
widely distributed throughout southeastern Oregon, and local populations are isolated from each 
other by natural or human-induced habitat barriers. Threats to the Great Basin DPS include poor 
management of habitat including water development, improper grazing, mining activities, and 
nonnative species. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS avoid pesticide spraying of habitat for the Great Basin DPS and 
buffer the area surrounding Columbia spotted frog habitat similar to measures taken for Oregon 
spotted frog covered under this consultation in order to reduce risk of exposure of the Great 
Basin DPS to pesticide chemicals. We recommend that APHIS provide information to the

Service regarding how they will avoid areas occupied by the Great Basin DPS prior to 
commencing with spray projects. The Service is available to assist APHIS to minimize and 
avoid impacts to the Great Basin DPS. 
 
Borax Lake Chub 
Borax Lake chub was delisted from the Act on July 13, 2020, due to recovery. This species is 
found in Borax Lake, a shallow 10-acre, thermal spring fed lake in Harney County, Oregon. The 
lake is named for its concentration of borax, and its ecosystem is considered highly susceptible to 
modification due to irrigation and geothermal projects. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS avoid pesticide spraying of habitat for Borax Lake chub and 
buffer the area surrounding Borax Lake chub habitat similar to measures taken for other 
federally-listed fish species covered under this consultation in order to reduce the risk of 
exposure of Borax Lake chub to pesticide chemicals. We recommend that APHIS provide 
information to the Service regarding how they will avoid areas occupied by Borax Lake chub 
prior to commencing with spray projects. The Service is available to assist APHIS to minimize 
and avoid impacts to Borax Lake chub.

Foskett Speckled Dace 
 
The Foskett speckled dace was delisted from the Act on October 15, 2019, due to recovery. This 
species occurs naturally in Foskett Spring, a small spring system found in the Coleman Basin on 
the west side of the Warner Valley, Lake County, and an introduced subpopulation at nearby 
Dace Springs. Trampling by cattle is perceived as the main reason for diminution of the habitat. 
Other threats include encroachment of vegetation, such as cattails, pumping of ground water or 
channelization which would affect water level, flow and increased silt. 
 
The Service recommends APHIS avoid pesticide spraying of habitat for Foskett speckled dace 
and buffer the area surrounding Foskett speckled dace habitat similar to measures taken for other 
federally-listed fish species covered under this consultation in order to reduce the risk of 
exposure of Foskett speckled dace to pesticide chemicals. We recommend that APHIS provide 
information to the Service regarding how they will avoid areas occupied by Foskett speckled 
dace prior to commencing with spray projects. The Service is available to assist APHIS to 
minimize and avoid impacts to Foskett speckled dace.
