Hierochloe odorata(L.) P.Beauv. - Holy-grass  -Gramineae / Poaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)Holy grass is a fairly recent discovery in Ireland, having been found at its only known site in the island as recently as 1946 by two eminent local amateur botanists, Desmond Meikle and the late Norman Carrothers who both appear in the black and white photograph, taken soon after the plant was discovered. The site is near Selshan, beside Lough Neagh and is in danger of drying out because of lowering of the lake water level. The species is protected by law, and is also very rare in Great Britain, being confined to only four counties in Scotland.All names:Hierochloe odorata(L.) P.Beauv.;Hierochloe borealis(Schrad.)
