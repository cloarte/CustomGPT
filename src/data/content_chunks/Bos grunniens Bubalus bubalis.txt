PHIS has agreed and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has indicated 
they will advise exporters to use this combination: an Alphanumeric EID (UHF or Low 
frequency) and associated dangle tag with the following order: CAN-Premise ID (PID - 
issued by the province) - individual animal numbers from 1 to infinity) when  ordering 
tags from manufacturers. 
B
ecause these species are outside of the “approved indicators” tags, they will have to 
ensure they do not stamp the IDs with any of the logos on approved tags. There are 
currently 3 logos for CFIA tags. Once for CCIA, one for Dairy Trace and one for

USED ENTRY
An

noncompliance with the requirements of this protocol must be removed from the country
within a time period specified by the Administrator, standardly within 30 days, or it will be
considered abandoned by the importer. Pending removal or abandonment, the animal will be
subject to such safeguards as the APHIS inspector determines necessary to prevent the
possible introduction of ectoparasites or disease into the United States. If an animal that has
been refused entry is not removed from the United States within a prescribed time period or
is abandoned, it may be seized and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of as the Administrator
determines necessary to prevent the possible introduction of disease into the United States.

5.3. Premises-based number system.

6. If the animals are not branded or tattooed, two official ear tags, (one RFID or UHF tag 
and the other a visual-only tag with the animal number clearly readable) are required. 
Both numbers must be listed on the health certificate for correct ID of each animal.  
2.7. No person may alter, deface, remove, or otherwise tamper with the official identification 
while the animal is in the United States or moving into or through the United States, except 
the identification may be removed at the time of slaughter.

A
PHIS has agreed and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has indicated 
they will advise exporters to use this combination: an Alphanumeric EID (UHF or Low 
frequency) and associated dangle tag with the following order: CAN-Premise ID (PID - 
issued by the province) - individual animal numbers from 1 to infinity) when  ordering 
tags from manufacturers. 
B
ecause these species are outside of the “approved indicators” tags, they will have to 
ensure they do not stamp the IDs with any of the logos on approved tags. There are 
currently 3 logos for CFIA tags. Once for CCIA, one for Dairy Trace and one for

steps are required if inspection will be deferred to the destination facility: 
5.1
.1. Contact information for the USDA APHIS VS Northern Border Port Services:

6. REF
USED ENTRY
An
y animal designated as a “refused- for- entry import” into the United States for
noncompliance with the requirements of this protocol must be removed from the country
within a time period specified by the Administrator, standardly within 30 days, or it will be
considered abandoned by the importer. Pending removal or abandonment, the animal will be
subject to such safeguards as the APHIS inspector determines necessary to prevent the
possible introduction of ectoparasites or disease into the United States. If an animal that has
been refused entry is not removed from the United States within a prescribed time period or
is abandoned, it may be seized and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of as the Administrator
determines necessary to prevent the possible introduction of disease into the United States.

regulations and requirements for the proposed import ( State Regulations and Import
Requirements).
