Background 
• Ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) is a 
contagious viral disease of bivalve shellfish 
species with a wide host range.1  
 
• In 2001-2003, OsHV-1 was discovered to be 
associated with larval Pacific oyster mortalities 
occurring in Tomales Bay, California, followed 
by detections in Inner Bay, Outer Bay, and San 
Diego Bay, California.2 
  
• OsHV-1 is not a threat to human health. 
  
Distribution 
• Globally, OsHV-1 detections have been 
reported in Australia, China, France, Ireland, 
Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, 
Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States.1 
 
• The OsHV-1 virus was identified in diseased 
Pacific oysters in France in the 1990s. 
Variants of OsHV-1 have since been identified 
and are classified as variants and 
microvariants, depending on genetic 
sequencing.  
 
 
• In the United States, OsHV-1 has been 
detected in areas along the California 
coast.  
 
Susceptible Species 
• In the United States, susceptible 
commercially cultured shellfish include 
abalone,

microvariants, depending on genetic 
sequencing.  
 
 
• In the United States, OsHV-1 has been 
detected in areas along the California 
coast.  
 
Susceptible Species 
• In the United States, susceptible 
commercially cultured shellfish include 
abalone, Manila clam, Mediterranean 
mussel, Eastern oyster, European flat 
oyster, Kumamoto oyster, Pacific 
oyster, and scallops.1, 4 
 
• Susceptible cultured and wild shellfish 
are present in all  U.S. coastal waters, 
including Alaska and Hawaii. 5 
 
• OsHV-1 is most often associated with 
high mortality disease outbreaks in 
Pacific oysters. Variable mortality and 
latent or subclinical infection occur in 
other shellfish species.  
  
Transmission and Clinical Signs 
• Transmission occurs via water.  
• Clinical signs are often observed in 
larvae and typically develop 3-4 days 
after spawning. These signs include 
slowed growth; reduced feeding; weak, 
circular swimming; and loss of ability to 
swim. 1, 6  
• Infected oysters may be found dead 
before clinical signs are observed.6 
 
• Occurrence of OsHV-1 is affected by 
environmental factors, husbandry 
practices, and co-infection with other 
pathogenic agents. There is an 
association between increased water 
temperatures and development of 
disease. In California, OsHV-1 tends to 
occur in the summer when water 
temperatures rise above 24o C (72.5

• No treatment or vaccine is currently 
available.

Disease control and prevention methods 
include: 
• Identifying infected and susceptible 
cultured and wild shellfish populations 
and developing risk management plans 
and biosecurity protocols to mitigate 
exposure.1 
 
• Placing culture facilities in areas away 
from infected shellfish populations and 
water currents that pass through these 
areas.1, 7 
 
• Using certified disease-free or disease-
resistant seed.3, 4  
 
• Using personal protective equipment 
that is single-use or site-specific and 
can be disinfected.1 
 
• Regulating shellfish importation and 
movement (local, regional, global).6 
  
Report Suspicious Cases 
Suspect cases should be reported to your 
State animal health official. Currently (2020), 
OsHV-1 is not listed as notifiable by the 
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).
