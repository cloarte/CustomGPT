Castor canadensis (hereafter beaver) is endemic to North Amer­
ica and is one of two extant species in the genus Castor. Castor ﬁber 
(hereafter Eurasian beaver) is endemic to Europe and Asia, although 
its current range is severely reduced relative to its historical range. The 
general physical appearance of the two species is similar, but their kary­
otypes and several cranial and behavioral patterns are distinct (Lavrov 
and Orlov 1973). Multilocus allozyme electrophoresis can distinguish 
C. canadensis from C. ﬁber using tissue or blood samples from either 
live or dead animals, which makes the technique useful as a manage­
ment tool for restoration of C. ﬁber in Europe (Sieber et al. 1999). 
C. c. acadicus, C. c. canadensis, C. c. carolinensis, and C. c. mis­
souriensis are the most widespread subspecies of beaver in North Amer­

C. c. acadicus, C. c. canadensis, C. c. carolinensis, and C. c. mis­
souriensis are the most widespread subspecies of beaver in North Amer­
ica (Hall 1981); however, reintroductions following extirpation have 
substantially altered pristine geographic variation among subspecies. 
The gene pools of some subspecies have been altered through introduc­
tions and subsequent mixing with other subspecies. Some subspecies 
may have disappeared entirely. Because subspecies are difﬁcult to de­
termine even with an animal in hand, subsequent discussions will be 
limited to species. 
Fossil remains of a giant beaver, genus Casteroides, and a number 
of closely related prehistoric mammals also have been found in North 
America (Cahn 1932). The family Castoridae dates to the Oligocene 
and was highly diversiﬁed in the Tertiary period in North America 
(Kowalski 1976). The genus Castor dates to the Pleistocene (Garrison 
1967) or late Tertiary (M. Schlosser 1902). 
DISTRIBUTION 
Historical Range. Seton (1929) estimated the beaver population at 
60–400 million before European settlement of North America. Beaver 
occurred throughout the subarctic of mainland Canada below the north­
ern tundra and the mouth of the MacKenzie River in the Northwest Ter­
ritories (Novakowski 1965). They were widespread in Alaska, except 
along the Arctic Slope from Point Hope east to the Canadian border 
(Hakala 1952). Within the contiguous United States, they occupied 
suitable wetland and riparian habitat from coast to coast, even in the

ra and the mouth of the MacKenzie River in the Northwest Ter­
ritories (Novakowski 1965). They were widespread in Alaska, except 
along the Arctic Slope from Point Hope east to the Canadian border 
(Hakala 1952). Within the contiguous United States, they occupied 
suitable wetland and riparian habitat from coast to coast, even in the 
arid southwest. They were generally absent from the Florida peninsula 
and parts of southern California and southern Nevada. Although their 
original range in Mexico is difﬁcult to determine, they were present in 
the Colorado River and Rio Grande River (Leopold 1959) as well as 
some coastal streams along the Gulf of Mexico. 
Despite their legendary abundance, most beaver populations were 
decimated by fur trappers during the 1700s and 1800s, primarily to 
support the European fashion for felt hats (Bryce 1904). Large trading 
companies, such as the Hudson Bay Company, employed Europeans and 
Native Americans who supplied furs without regard for method or sea­
son of take. Because trappers continually moved to new territory, they 
likely were unaware of their cumulative effects on entire populations. 
In addition, intense harvest likely caused the local destruction of pop­
ulation structures, contributing to regional declines (Ingle-Sidorowicz 
1982). Beaver populations in the eastern United States were largely 
extirpated by fur trappers before 1900. 
Growing public concern over declines in beaver and other wildlife 
populations eventually led to regulations that controlled harvest through 
seasons and methods of take, initiating a continent-wide recovery of 
beaver populations. To supplement natural recovery, during the mid­
1900s beaver were livetrapped and successfully reintroduced into much

 public concern over declines in beaver and other wildlife 
populations eventually led to regulations that controlled harvest through 
seasons and methods of take, initiating a continent-wide recovery of 
beaver populations. To supplement natural recovery, during the mid­
1900s beaver were livetrapped and successfully reintroduced into much 
of their former range, a remarkable achievement of early wildlife man­
agers. Although the area of pristine beaver habitat has been much re­
duced by human land-use practices, beaver have proved to be highly 
adaptable and occupy a variety of human-made habitats. In addition, 
beaver have been intentionally or accidentally introduced into areas 
outside their original range. Thus, the present range of beaver is a result 
of natural recovery and reintroduction to their original range, introduc­
tion and expansion into areas beyond their original range, the limits of 
native habitat as modiﬁed by human land uses, and adaptability to new 
human-made habitats such as urban areas, croplands, and areas with 
exotic vegetation. 
Present Range. Beaver populations were estimated at 6–12 million 
by Naiman et al. (1988). Beaver now occupy much of their former 
range in North America, although habitat loss and other causes have 
severely restricted populations in many areas (Fig. 15.1) (Hall 1981; 
Larson and Gunson 1983). For example, since 1834, about 195,000– 
260,000 km2 of wetlands has been converted to agricultural or other use 
in the United States, much of which was likely beaver habitat (Naiman 
et al. 1988). Nonetheless, beaver are remarkably adaptable. They can

in the United States, much of which was likely beaver habitat (Naiman 
et al. 1988). Nonetheless, beaver are remarkably adaptable. They can 
marginally subsist above timberline in mountainous areas; however, 
beaver have been unable to colonize Alaskan or Canadian arctic tun­
dra, perhaps because tundra vegetation lacks essential woody plants 
for winter food and lodge construction or because thick ice limits sur­
face access in winter. Although suitable beaver habitat in Canada has 
been reduced since pre-European settlement, fur harvest records indi­
cate that beaver populations have fully recovered in many areas, per­
haps a result of a return to earlier successional stages of forest cover 
(Ingle-Sidorowicz 1982). In the United States, beaver populations have 
continued to increase since major reintroductions ended in the 1950s. 
Populations in southeastern states have grown large enough to become 
a major nuisance to the timber industry and others (Larson and Gunson 
1983). In the Far West, they have been reestablished in the Santa Ana 
and Colorado River systems of southern California. In Mexico, beaver 
may still subsist in some northern areas of Nuevo Leon and Chihuahua 
(Leopold 1959), although populations there likely are marginal (Landin 
1980).

the range map by Deems and Pursley (1978) include populations in Mexico, 
southern California, west-central Florida, and Delaware and the absence of 
beaver in the North Slope of Alaska. 
Introductions of beaver in Finland (Lahti and Helminen 1974), 
Asian Kamchatka (Safonov 1979), Argentina (Lizarralde 1993), and 
other locations have resulted in the establishment of viable populations 
beyond their original range in North America. For example, 25 mated 
pairs of beaver were introduced (as a captive population) to Tierra del 
Fuego, Argentina, in 1946 to establish a fur industry. Animals that later 
escaped or were intentionally released resulted in a viable wild pop­
ulation. This population rapidly expanded in the absence of predators 
and other natural population controls, causing a substantial impact on 
native southern beech (Nothofagus) forests (Lizarralde 1993). 
DESCRIPTION 
Beaver are the largest rodents in North America. Most adults weigh 
16–31.5 kg and attain a total length of up to 120 cm. They have heavily 
muscled bodies supported by large bones. Forelegs are shorter than hind 
legs, which results in greater height at the hips than at the shoulders. 
Viewed dorsally, beaver are short and thick, broadest just anterior to the

 Most adults weigh 
16–31.5 kg and attain a total length of up to 120 cm. They have heavily 
muscled bodies supported by large bones. Forelegs are shorter than hind 
legs, which results in greater height at the hips than at the shoulders. 
Viewed dorsally, beaver are short and thick, broadest just anterior to the 
hips, and taper gradually toward the nose; a short, thick neck appears 
almost continuous with the shoulders and head. Their most character­
istic feature is a dorsoventrally ﬂattened, paddle-like tail, the unfurred 
portion of which in most adults varies from 230 to 323 mm long and 
from 110 to 180 mm wide (Davis 1940). The distal three fourths of 
the tail is covered with black, leathery, uncorniﬁed scales (Kowalski 
1976) containing a few scattered, coarse hairs. The caudal vertebrae 
are dorsoventrally ﬂattened, with a complex arrangement of muscles 
and tendons to support the ﬂat tail (Mahoney and Rosenburg 1981). In­
cisors are generally orangish in color, with the anterior surface in adults 
>5 mm wide, a feature that helps distinguish beaver damage from other 
rodent damage on the basis of toothmark width. 
Beaver move with an awkward waddle on land, but can gallop if 
frightened. Adult beaver can walk upright in a bipedal fashion (par­
tially supported by the tail) while carrying mud or sticks held against 
the chest with their chin and front legs. In water, they swim by alternate 
kicks of the hind legs, appearing graceful and efﬁcient, though

, but can gallop if 
frightened. Adult beaver can walk upright in a bipedal fashion (par­
tially supported by the tail) while carrying mud or sticks held against 
the chest with their chin and front legs. In water, they swim by alternate 
kicks of the hind legs, appearing graceful and efﬁcient, though slow 
and deliberate. Beaver are shaped more like marine mammals than like 
other terrestrial mammals, with a ﬁneness ratio (a hydrodynamic in­
dex of streamlining) of 4.8, a value similar to that for phocid seals 
(Reynolds 1993). In addition, the surface area of unfurred extremities 
(hind feet and scaly tail) is 30% of the total, perhaps a compromise 
between the need for propulsion and minimization of the area for heat 
exchange. Webbed toes on large hind feet (up to 200 mm long) facili­
tate swimming, and short, heavily clawed front feet facilitate digging. 
Great forepaw dexterity enables beaver to fold individual leaves into 
their mouth and to rotate small, pencil-sized stems as they gnaw off bark. 
The ears are rounded, short (30 mm), ﬂeshy, and placed high on the rear 
of the head. The small eyes also are located high on the head, about 
midway between the nose and the base of the skull. Both these adapta­
tions enable beaver to swim with minimum exposure above the water 
surface. 
Pelt coloration is variable within and among populations, with 
reddish, chestnut, nearly black, and yellowish-brown specimens pos­
sible in the same watershed. Fur of the ﬂanks, abdomen, and cheeks

tions enable beaver to swim with minimum exposure above the water 
surface. 
Pelt coloration is variable within and among populations, with 
reddish, chestnut, nearly black, and yellowish-brown specimens pos­
sible in the same watershed. Fur of the ﬂanks, abdomen, and cheeks 
is usually shorter and lighter than back fur. Guard hairs are about 10 
times the diameter of the hairs constituting the underfur, giving the pelt 
a coarse appearance. Guard hairs attain their greatest length (50 mm) 
and density along the back. Underfur is longest on the back (25 mm) 
and has wavy individual hairs, which give the pelt a downy softness. It 
may be dark gray to chestnut in color on the back and, like the guard 
hair, becomes lighter in color on the sides and ventral areas. Unlike the 
case in many furbearers, coloration of individual guard hairs is usually 
consistent throughout their length. 
The two inside (medial) toes of each hind foot have movable, split 
nails, which beaver use as combs to groom their fur (Wilsson 1971). 
Beaver have closable nostrils, valvular ears, nictitating eye membranes, 
and lips that close behind large incisors, adaptions important to their 
semiaquatic existence. During periods of active lactation and when par­
turition is near, four pectoral mammae are discernible on the chest of 
the adult female. During pregnancy, beaver have a subplacenta located 
between the placenta and uterine tissues. Although its morphology has 
been well described, its function is unknown (Fischer 1985). The repro­

ation and when par­
turition is near, four pectoral mammae are discernible on the chest of 
the adult female. During pregnancy, beaver have a subplacenta located 
between the placenta and uterine tissues. Although its morphology has 
been well described, its function is unknown (Fischer 1985). The repro­
ductive organs of both sexes are internal and lie anterior to a common 
anal cloaca containing the castor and anal glands (Svendsen 1978). A 
notable characteristic of beaver is the strong aroma from the paired 
castor glands. Contents of the castor glands (castoreum) and anal gland 
secretion may be deposited during scent marking. Castoreum has been 
used as a base aroma in perfume and in making trappers’s lures. 
Beaver skeletons are massive when compared to those of other 
mammals of similar length. The skull and the mandible are thick and 
heavy, providing a strong foundation for large incisors (Fig. 15.2). A 
less rugged skull would be unable to withstand the physical stress and 
strain of jaw muscle contractions of sufﬁcient strength to cut hardwoods 
such as oak (Quercus spp.) and maple (Acer spp.). The braincase is 
narrow and there is a small infraorbital canal. A prominent rostrum 
is anterior to the massive zygomatic arch. Adult skulls are very large 
(120–148 mm condylobasal length), which minimizes the possibility 
of confusing them with other North American rodents. Juvenile skulls 
are smaller and may be similar in size to those of adult nutria (My­
ocastor coypus), porcupine (Erethizon

of confusing them with other North American rodents. Juvenile skulls 
are smaller and may be similar in size to those of adult nutria (My­
ocastor coypus), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), or mountain beaver 
(Aplodontia rufa); however, differences other than size are apparent on 
close examination. As in other semiaquatic mammals, the acetabulum 
is shifted dorsally (Kowalski 1976). The male beaver has a baculum that 
generally enlarges with age (Friley 1949) and can be palpated as an aid 
in determining the sex of live beavers and unskinned carcasses (Denney 
1952). Osteological changes during growth and development of beaver 
were described by Robertson and Shadle (1954). The dental formula is 
I 1/1, C 0/0, P 1/1, M 3/3. Incisors grow continuously and the chiseled 
edge is sharpened by grinding the uppers against the lowers (Wilsson 
1971). The hard enameled front surface of incisors serves as the cutting 
edge to fell trees and peel bark. Cheek teeth are hypsodont and grow 
only through the deposition of cementum at the root base. Deciduous 
premolars are replaced at about 11 months of age by permanent pre­
molars. Specializations such as large size; type and location of ears, 
eyes, and nose; size and function of front and hind legs; and a large, 
ﬂattened tail appear to have individually and collectively enhanced the

PHYSIOLOGY 
Growth. Size of the adult beaver depends on latitude, climate, quality 
of available food, and extent of exploitation. In Alabama, a sample of 
1450 beaver from an unexploited population showed mean body weight 
stabilized at 4 or 5 years of age and then diminished slightly after 9 years 
of age. Average weight of all specimens was 18.6 kg; maximum was 
19.3 kg (review by Hill 1982). The relatively moderate climate of the 
midcontinent region may produce the largest beaver, where maximum 
weight can reach nearly 40 kg. 
Growth of adults (body weight and tail size) occurs only in sum­
mer; however, kits (juveniles) continue to grow throughout their ﬁrst 
winter (Novakowski 1965; Smith and Jenkins 1997). For northern 
beaver, winter ice formation on ponds and streams restricts

aver, where maximum 
weight can reach nearly 40 kg. 
Growth of adults (body weight and tail size) occurs only in sum­
mer; however, kits (juveniles) continue to grow throughout their ﬁrst 
winter (Novakowski 1965; Smith and Jenkins 1997). For northern 
beaver, winter ice formation on ponds and streams restricts or eliminates 
access to surface food, and adults and yearlings lose weight as fat stores 
are depleted. In southern beaver, adults and yearlings also lose weight 
in winter, even though their habitat typically remains ice free. Failure to 
maintain fat reserves during winter for beaver living in ice-free regions 
is likely not due to lack of adequate energy from available food, as it 
may be in the northern range, but instead may be associated with sea­
sonal changes in physiology. Reduced food consumption, as described 
for captive beaver of a northern population, may also occur in southern 
beaver with the onset of warming trends in February and March, as 
beaver are frequently observed sunning themselves on lodges during 
clear sunny days of late winter, and early spring (review by Hill 1982). 
In northern populations, Smith and Jenkins (1997) found that win­
ter loss of body weight and tail size can vary among colonies by severity 
of winter, and sex and age composition of the colony. Beaver lost more 
body weight and tail size when winters were longer. Adults and year­
lings that overwintered with young in the colony lost more weight than 
those without young. This supports Novakowski ’s (1965) conclusion 
that older members of the colony eat less stored food when young are 
present, and rely instead on other adaptations to survive the winter.

those without young. This supports Novakowski ’s (1965) conclusion 
that older members of the colony eat less stored food when young are 
present, and rely instead on other adaptations to survive the winter. 
Thermoregulation. Northern populations of beaver in winter must 
contend with the thermoregulatory cost of foraging under the ice in 
near-freezing water and must subsist primarily on stored food and me­
tabolized fat (Dyck and MacArthur 1992). Some mammals can con­
serve energy in winter by reducing their body temperature through 
seasonal torpor. Researchers have suspected torpor in beaver, but stud­
ies of change in body temperature in response to freezing ambient 
temperatures have been equivocal. Dyck and MacArthur (1992:1671) 
found the body temperature of free-ranging beaver averaged about 37
◦ 
C 
throughout the year, with “no evidence of shallow torpor in either kits 
or adults.” In contrast, D. W . Smith et al. (1991) found the mean daily 
body temperature of adult beaver declined by 1
◦ 
C from fall to win­
ter, but remained constant for kits. Body temperature can also vary 
by daily activity level. Before freeze-up, body temperature is higher 
during daylight hours, when beaver spend more time in the lodge, and 
lower at night, when they are away from the lodge (Dyck and MacArthur 
1992). Thus, thermoregulation likely contributes to overwinter survival 
in beaver in combination with several other adaptations described in this

 daylight hours, when beaver spend more time in the lodge, and 
lower at night, when they are away from the lodge (Dyck and MacArthur 
1992). Thus, thermoregulation likely contributes to overwinter survival 
in beaver in combination with several other adaptations described in this 
chapter, including warmer winter fur, increased body fat, a stored food 
cache, a warmer microclimate in the lodge, huddling together in the 
lodge, and reduced activity in winter (D. W . Smith et al. 1991). 
Digestion. Beaver are hind-gut fermenters. Digestion is enhanced by 
a prominent and unusual cardiogastric gland on the lesser curvature 
of the stomach (Vispo and Hume 1995), a glandular digestive area 
(Kowalski 1976), and a large trilobed cecum containing commensal 
microbiota. Beaver consume a high percentage of cellulose, but maxi­
mize the nutritional value of woody plants by eating only the bark. They 
can digest about 32% of available cellulose by microbial action in the 
cecum, which is similar to the case in some other mammals (review by 
Hill 1982, Buech 1984). Beaver have a relatively long small intestine, 
70% longer than in the porcupine, which suggests a high absorptive ca­
pacity (Vispo and Hume 1995). Consumption of soft green excrement 
directly from the cloaca (coprophagy) occurs diurnally in the beaver 
(observed as early as 10 days of age; Buech 1984) as well as in the 
Eurasian beaver (Wilsson 1971), lagomorphs, and other rodents. Feces

(observed as early as 10 days of age; Buech 1984) as well as in the 
Eurasian beaver (Wilsson 1971), lagomorphs, and other rodents. Feces 
are reingested and chewed by the beaver and pass quickly through the 
digestive system (Buech 1984). In contrast, lagomorphs reingest and 
swallow mucous-covered entire pellets. 
Circulation. Beaver heart weight averages 0.40% of body weight, 
which is consistent with heart ratios for other terrestrial mammals, but

relatively small compared to fully aquatic mammals (Bisaillon 1982). 
The cardiac blood vessels are not specialized, but are typically mam­
malian and resemble those of both terrestrial and aquatic mammals 
(Bisaillon 1981). Beaver have no unusual oxygen storage capacity, but 
certain changes in blood parameters, heart rhythm, and circulation en­
able them to make dives lasting up to 15 min without asphyxiation 
(review by Hill 1982). Aleksiuk (1970a:145) noted that “minute blood 
vessels permeate the entire tail, and a countercurrent heat exchange sys­
tem is present at the base.” This specialized circulatory feature helps 
conserve heat energy in extremely cold water and radiate heat during 
hot weather.

conserve heat energy in extremely cold water and radiate heat during

REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
Sexual Maturity. Beaver reach sexual maturity (de ﬁned as age at 
breeding that results in the ﬁrst litter) at 1.5 –3 years of age, although 
puberty may be reached several months before ﬁrst breeding. Most 
studies have found at least some beaver had reached sexual maturity 
as yearlings (1.5–2.0 years old), although regional variation is evident. 
Gunson (1970) estimated that two thirds to three fourths of 2-year-
old beaver produced young, and believed that early sexual maturity 
in Saskatchewan beaver was enhanced by high-quality habitat. Repro­
duction in yearlings may cease where >40% of suitable beaver habitat 
is occupied by established colonies. In Newfoundland, 24% of year­
ling females had bred (Payne 1975). In northern Canada, Novakowski 
(1965) found ﬁrst pregnancies in 3 of 21 females that were approach­
ing their third birthday, but no indications of conception in females that 
were almost 2 years old. In Alabama, in 2.5- to 3-year-old females, 
only 16 of 65 had ovulated, and there were no indications of ovulation 
or pregnancy in 50 yearlings. However, in Tennessee, Lizotte (1994) 
found sexual maturity occurred at 1.5–2.0 years of age, with a 25% 
pregnancy rate in this age class.

found sexual maturity occurred at 1.5–2.0 years of age, with a 25% 
pregnancy rate in this age class. 
Breeding. Beaver are monogamous, described by Svendsen 
(1989:339) as “characterized by a single adult pair and young 
forming a family, a relatively long pair-bond where desertion of a 
mate is rare, and turnover of mates usually occurs after the death of 
one of the pair.” Beaver typically breed in winter and give birth in late 
spring, producing only 1 litter/year. The potential breeding season is 
very long, with conception reported between November and March 
and parturition between February and November (review by Wigley 
et al. 1983). Latitude and climate can affect the breeding season, 
which is generally shorter in colder climates and longer in warmer 
climates (Hill 1982; Wigley et al. 1983). Breeding takes place in 
water (Kowalski 1976), bank dens, or lodges. Wilsson (1971) reported 
that C. ﬁber remains in estrus 10–12 hr and has a second estrus in 
14 days if not fertilized. A gestation period of 100 days is typical for 
C. canadensis (Wigley et al. 1983), with a range of 98 –111 days 
(review by Hill 1982).

Sex Ratios. Sex ratios in monogamous species are important because 
they can in ﬂuence pregnancy rates. When averaged across age class, 
region, and harvest level, the sex ratio of beaver may be nearly even, 
but substantial variation among populations suggests caution in mak­
ing this assumption. Sex ratios of trapped populations may reﬂect bias 
inherent in trapping methods, although results of different studies are 
inconsistent. For example, some studies found no difference in sus­
ceptibility of sexes to baited Conibear traps set under ice, but others 
suggested trapping was selective for adult females. Others have noted 
higher mortality from trapping and other causes for adult males (review 
by Hill 1982). In a review of 15 studies, Woodward (1977) found an 
average sex ratio of 98.5 males:100 females, but a ratio of 90.7:100 for 
adults and 111.4:100 for subadults. The combined average from studies 
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, Vermont, and Alabama was 105:100 
(N = 4867) (review by Hill 1982). 
Pregnancy Rates. Knowledge of pregnancy rates among age groups 
in monogamous species increases accuracy in computing estimates 
of reproductive performance. Pregnancy rates usually increase from 
1.5 years of age until about age 4 years, remain high until old age, 
and then decrease (Lizotte 1994). Where populations are not exploited 
and suitable habitat is fully occupied, there likely is less dispersal and 
therefore less breeding among young adults, which remain in colonies 
containing older dominant pairs. Thus, both habitat quality and extent 
of exploitation should be considered when using pregnancy rates to

and then decrease (Lizotte 1994). Where populations are not exploited 
and suitable habitat is fully occupied, there likely is less dispersal and 
therefore less breeding among young adults, which remain in colonies 
containing older dominant pairs. Thus, both habitat quality and extent 
of exploitation should be considered when using pregnancy rates to 
calculate reproductive performance. 
Reproductive Performance. Placental scar counts (Hodgdon 1949), 
counts of developing embryos, and, with some limitations, counts of 
corpora lutea and corpora albicantia are useful indices of reproductive 
performance in beaver (Provost 1958). In Mississippi, counts of fe­
tuses, placental scars, and corpora lutea all yielded statistically similar 
estimates of litter size, despite pre- or postimplantation losses (Wigley 
et al. 1984). Preimplantation losses from unfertilized ova or failure 
of fertilized ova to implant and postimplantation losses resulting in re-
sorptions account for differences between ovulation rates and litter size. 
Intrauterine mortality was 16% in 48 beaver from Ohio and almost 19% 
in 40 beaver from western Massachusetts (review by Hill 1982). Where 
rates of prenatal loss are high, correction factors should be developed 
to obtain more precise estimates of litter size and annual productivity 
(Wigley et al. 1984). 
In areas where carcasses are available from fall or early winter 
trapping, counts of placental scars and persisting corpora albicantia, 
corrected for current resorption rates and prenatal loss, respectively, 
provide an index of litter size from the previous spring. Sources of er­

In areas where carcasses are available from fall or early winter 
trapping, counts of placental scars and persisting corpora albicantia, 
corrected for current resorption rates and prenatal loss, respectively, 
provide an index of litter size from the previous spring. Sources of er­
ror, such as regression or discoloration of implantation sites by some 
preservatives and degeneration of corpora albicantia with the onset of 
the breeding season (Provost 1962), make estimates of reproductive per­
formance in fall less accurate than those made at other times. Where 
trapping seasons overlap the breeding season, a combination of pla­
cental scar counts corrected for the past season resorption rates and 
corpora lutea counts corrected for current resorption rates can provide 
information on litter size. However, early in gestation, it is difﬁcult to 
distinguish between corpora lutea of ovulation and corpora lutea of 
pregnancy, which introduces a potential source of error in estimates 
of reproductive performance (Provost 1962). Also, embryo counts and 
ovulation rates of females trapped in January and February may not 
provide precise estimates of current-year breeding among yearlings 
and subadults. These age groups may breed later than adults (Grinnell 
et al. 1937), particularly at southern latitudes or if they had dispersed 
during the summer. Thus, winter samples may not reﬂect reproductive 
performance as well as those from May or June. 
Where trapping seasons occur after the breeding season, counts 
of developing embryos, corrected for current resorption rates, provide 
an accurate index of litter size among age groups. Resorption is neg­
ligible if

during the summer. Thus, winter samples may not reﬂect reproductive 
performance as well as those from May or June. 
Where trapping seasons occur after the breeding season, counts 
of developing embryos, corrected for current resorption rates, provide 
an accurate index of litter size among age groups. Resorption is neg­
ligible if embryos are in an advanced stage of development. Where 
possible, delaying the trapping season until breeding has occurred may 
lower the incidence of unbred females whose mates were trapped from 
the population before breeding (Hodgdon and Hunt 1953). Such de­
lay also facilitates measurement of current litter size through embryo 
counts. 
The litter size of beaver is typically two to four, although local 
averages may be as high as six, and the number can vary from one to 
nine (reviews by Hill 1982; Wigley et al. 1983). These reviews suggest 
that beaver in the southeastern United States tend to have smaller litters, 
whereas northern and perhaps western beaver tend to have larger litters. 
Large litters may be associated with better quality habitats and increased 
weight of the mother. In Mississippi, age of mother was only weakly 
correlated with litter size, but weight of mother was strongly correlated. 
Litter size can also be reduced by lack of food (e.g., due to ice on ponds) 
or quality of food (e.g., limited supply of preferred plants) (Rutherford 
1955). Because fewer yearlings breed in relatively dense populations 
and litter size may be inversely related to the number of beaver in 
the family, reproduction in beaver may be density dependent (Payne 
1984). Some evidence also suggests that beaver may breed only during

needs further investigation (D. W . Smith, pers. commun., 2001).

Development of Y oung. Growth curves of the fetus were developed 
by Woodward (1977) for a 100-day gestation period. Curves may be 
useful for estimating peak periods of conception and parturition through 
extrapolation (Hodgdon and Hunt 1953). 
Beaver kits are born precocial and fully furred, and weigh about 
0.5 kg (review by Hill 1982). Lancia and Hodgdon (1983) studied the 
ontogeny of behavior in captive kits and found they were able to swim 
at 4 days and could dive and stay submerged at 2 months of age. Bipedal 
walking was noted at 1 month of age, and carrying construction materi­
als while walking on the hind legs occurred at 90 days of age. Suckling 
peaked at 25 ml of milk/day at 1 month and decreased until weaned 
at 45–50 days. Zurowski et al. (1974) noted that the anterior nipples 
produced 50–75% less milk than the posterior nipples. Kits can take 
some solid food at 1 –4 weeks of age and switch to mostly solid food 
by 1 month. However, they may

 of milk/day at 1 month and decreased until weaned 
at 45–50 days. Zurowski et al. (1974) noted that the anterior nipples 
produced 50–75% less milk than the posterior nipples. Kits can take 
some solid food at 1 –4 weeks of age and switch to mostly solid food 
by 1 month. However, they may suckle for up to 3 months even though 
they obtain little milk, perhaps to maintain the mother–infant bond. 
The fur of kits is not water repellent at birth, but after 3–4 weeks of age 
they begin to spread anal gland secretions on their fur, which creates 
water repellency by 5–8 weeks. Captive kits began to dive underwater 
in response to alarm at 8 –10 days of age and initiated tail slapping in 
response to alarm at 3 –4 weeks of age (Lancia and Hodgdon 1983). 
Rudimentary scent marking began at 13 –14 days of age. Thus, very 
young kits express some adult behaviors, but require a long period in 
the family to develop their complex construction ability and other skills 
required for independent life.

Social Organization. Individual beaver spend most of their lives in 
small, closed, extended-family units traditionally called colonies. Al­
though the term “colony” is commonly used for beaver, its use has been 
questioned (Hodgdon and Lancia 1983) because a colony more often 
describes a spatially associated collection of individual families rather 
than a single family unit. For example, a family of prairie dogs (Cyno­
mys spp.) living in the same burrow system is called a coterie and a 
group of families is called a colony. However,

describes a spatially associated collection of individual families rather 
than a single family unit. For example, a family of prairie dogs (Cyno­
mys spp.) living in the same burrow system is called a coterie and a 
group of families is called a colony. However, to maintain consistency 
with previous beaver literature, we use colony to represent an extended 
beaver family. Thus, a beaver colony typically contains the adult pair; 
young of the current year, or kits (<12 months old); and young of the 
previous year, or yearlings (12–24 months old). Sometimes older young 
may remain with the colony as subadults (>24 months old) before they 
disperse, especially if the available habitat is near carrying capacity 
(Busher 1987). A small percentage of colonies may contain more than 
one adult male or female (Busher 1983). Established colonies inhabit 
discrete and defended territories. Dispersing beaver of both sexes, also 
calledﬂoaters, remain transient until they settle with an unpaired beaver 
or they build dams or lodges, which may help attract a mate. Compared 
to many other mammals, especially other rodents, beaver populations 
are characterized by relatively low natality, low mortality of young, pro­
longed behavioral development, high parental care, and adult longevity 
(Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). 
Social interactions involving close contact are fairly infrequent 
outside the lodge, perhaps an adaptation to minimize predation risk on 
land. The most common interaction among individual beaver concerns 
food items and usually involves kits begging for food from older siblings 
or adults (Busher 1983). Adults discourage yearlings from begging by

Social interactions involving close contact are fairly infrequent 
outside the lodge, perhaps an adaptation to minimize predation risk on 
land. The most common interaction among individual beaver concerns 
food items and usually involves kits begging for food from older siblings 
or adults (Busher 1983). Adults discourage yearlings from begging by 
snapping their head toward the yearling. Grooming fur to maintain wa­
ter repellency is a common activity inside the lodge. Beaver groom 
themselves wherever they can reach, but rely on other family mem­
bers to groom their back fur (Patenaude and Bovet 1984). This social 
grooming appears to be primarily to maintain a layer of air in the fur, 
as does self-grooming, rather than to maintain social bonds or as an 
appeasement gesture (Brady and Svendsen 1981). Aggressive interac­
tions are rare among family members, with most aggression directed 
as threats that do not result in ﬁghts. Studies of dominance hierarchy 
systems in beaver have been equivocal. Hodgdon and Larson (1973) de­
scribed dominance hierarchy as age class (older dominant over younger) 
and sexual (adult females dominant over adult males). Busher (1983), 
however, found only age-class hierarchy, and Brady and Svendsen 
(1981) found no clear patterns in any groups. 
V ocalizations and Tail Slapping. Although seven vocal sounds have 
been described for beaver, most investigators recognize only three that 
are used outside the lodge: a whine, a hiss, and a growl (Hodgdon and 
Lancia 1983). The whine is the most frequent vocalization and can be 
repeated in rapid succession. Beaver of

 ocalizations and Tail Slapping. Although seven vocal sounds have 
been described for beaver, most investigators recognize only three that 
are used outside the lodge: a whine, a hiss, and a growl (Hodgdon and 
Lancia 1983). The whine is the most frequent vocalization and can be 
repeated in rapid succession. Beaver of all ages whine, but kits account 
for two thirds of events, either when food is at risk of being taken away or 
when begging for food. Food begging by kits is usually effective, which 
provides kits with food without the risk of obtaining it from land (Brady 
and Svendsen 1981; Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). V ocalizations are also 
used to initiate grooming and play. Although beaver are typically docile 
with humans, they sometimes become aggressive, a behavior sometimes 
preceded by a hiss or a growl. 
Probably the most familiar sound produced by beaver is the tail 
slap. The sound is made when a beaver forcefully strikes the water 
with its heavy paddle-like tail, a behavior that may precede diving un­
derwater when alarmed (tail-slap dive). Tail slapping may function to 
(1) issue a warning signal to family members, which typically respond 
by moving to deep water or to the lodge (especially kits); (2) drive away 
potential predators; and (3) elicit a response from the source of dis­
turbance (Brady and Svendsen 1981; Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). Tail 
slapping is used by all ages and both sexes, but studies of variation in 
frequency of use by sex and age have been equivocal. Hodgdon (1978) 
found older beaver slapped more often than younger ones, females were

 from the source of dis­
turbance (Brady and Svendsen 1981; Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). Tail 
slapping is used by all ages and both sexes, but studies of variation in 
frequency of use by sex and age have been equivocal. Hodgdon (1978) 
found older beaver slapped more often than younger ones, females were 
more easily provoked than males, and males slapped more times per 
event than females. Sudden alarm often elicits immediate tail slapping. 
However, if beaver are unsure, they often move to deep water and ori­
ent toward the disturbance with their nose in the air, a behavior that 
often precedes tail slapping. Smell, sound, sight, and movement are all 
important stimuli, either separately or in combination. The response of 
individual beaver to tail slapping also varies by age. Tail slapping by 
adults elicits the most response from all age classes, but adult beaver 
are the most responsive to tail slapping of other beaver. Kits are least 
likely to move or to elicit a response and yearlings are intermediate 
(Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). 
Scent Marking. Scent marking is a highly developed communication 
method in beaver. Castor glands produce castoreum, a strong-smelling, 
urine-based brown paste containing phenolic, neutral, basic, and acidic 
compounds. Anal glands (also called oil glands) produce anal gland se­
cretions consisting of waxy esters and fatty acids. Castoreum is likely 
derived from diet and thus subject to seasonal variation in odor; how­
ever, anal gland secretions are unique chemical identiﬁers of individual 
beaver (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1998). Beaver use castoreum

 oil glands) produce anal gland se­
cretions consisting of waxy esters and fatty acids. Castoreum is likely 
derived from diet and thus subject to seasonal variation in odor; how­
ever, anal gland secretions are unique chemical identiﬁers of individual 
beaver (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1998). Beaver use castoreum and 
anal gland secretions as scent marks, which they actively deposit on 
piles of mud and debris called scent mounds. Beaver deposit castoreum 
by rubbing it on scent mounds during and after construction; it is not 
clear how and when anal gland secretion is applied (Svendsen 1980a). 
Most scent mounds are constructed by adult males, who gather mate­
rial in their forepaws and carry it to scent mounds in a bipedal fashion. 
Large numbers of scent mounds (>100) can be constructed within a 
territory, and they are usually placed on or near lodges, dams, and trails 
<1 m from water. Beaver of all ages place scent on mounds, but the 
frequency of marking increases with age. Males of all ages place the 
most scent marks (Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). In colder climates, con­
struction and marking of scent mounds peaks soon after ice melts in 
the spring as beaver reoccupy their full territory and reapply scent that 
faded during the winter. In warmer, ice-free regions, scent marking can 
occur all year, but still may be more intense during the spring dispersal 
period. Scent marking has been observed in December and January in 
Alabama, where mounds can reach 35.5 cm in height. 
The primary function of scent marking appears to be territorial.

occur all year, but still may be more intense during the spring dispersal 
period. Scent marking has been observed in December and January in 
Alabama, where mounds can reach 35.5 cm in height. 
The primary function of scent marking appears to be territorial. 
Scent marks may de ﬁne the location and limits of the territory by 
creating a “scent fence” (Muller-Schwarze and Heckman 1980), which 
minimizes aggressive encounters with neighbors and discourages col­
onization by dispersing beaver. Beaver can distinguish the scent of cas­
tor ﬂuid among family members, neighbors, and nonneighbors (beaver

from beyond adjacent territories). They “overmark” the scents from 
strangers more often than scents from family members (Schulte 1998). 
Use of foreign castor scent (as in trapping) may elicit investigation, 
intense scent marking, or destruction of the foreign scent as well as 
hissing and tail slapping behavior. In Ohio, an adult female built over 
70 mounds in 1 week, likely in response to the presence of castor bait 
applied by trappers (Brady and Svendsen 1981). In New Y ork, beaver 
obliterated foreign scent by pawing the mud, overmarking foreign scent, 
and transferring the mud to their own scent mounds (Muller-Schwarze 
et al. 1983). In addition, a territorial function for scent mounds may

obliterated foreign scent by pawing the mud, overmarking foreign scent, 
and transferring the mud to their own scent mounds (Muller-Schwarze 
et al. 1983). In addition, a territorial function for scent mounds may 
be expressed as a change in the motivational state of beaver. Svendsen 
(1980a) suggested that scent may increase the conﬁdence of resident 
beaver, which smell their own scent, and decrease the con ﬁdence of 
nonresident dispersing beaver, thus increasing the likelihood nonresi­
dents will ﬂee a territory “defended” by scent mounds. Experimental 
ﬁeld studies support a territorial function for scent marking, as Schulte 
(1998) found that beaver could distinguish among the scents of adjacent 
neighbors, far neighbors, and family members. Beaver spent more time 
investigating and overmarking scent from unrelated beaver than from 
family members. 
The ability of beaver to recognize relatives from nonrelatives via 
anal gland secretions (but not castoreum) may help prevent inbreeding 
as related individuals meet each other following dispersal outside their 
home territory (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1997). Experimental com­
parisons of compounds in anal gland secretions have not yet clearly 
identiﬁed underlying mechanisms, but have shown that perhaps as few 
as two or three compounds may be important in communicating fam­
ily membership (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1998). In addition, scent 
marking may help orient beaver within their territory at night, although 
this has not been experimentally demonstrated

marking may help orient beaver within their territory at night, although 
this has not been experimentally demonstrated. 
Scent marking by beaver may be density dependent and vary by 
season and location. In Maine, beaver colonies with close neighbors 
had more scent mounds than isolated colonies (Muller-Schwarze and 
Heckman 1980). In South Carolina, scent marking was positively cor­
related with colony density. Peak scent marking occurred in fall and 
winter, with very little marking activity in summer (Davis et al. 1994). 
Southern beaver may increase marking activity in the fall in response to 
increased food competition among colonies (Davis et al. 1994). Thus, 
scent marking in southern beaver may differ from that in northern 
beaver, which exhibit a peak of marking in the spring. 
Daily Activity Patterns. Beaver are crepuscular and nocturnal. In ice-
free areas, they follow a normal 24-hr period yearlong, but in northern 
latitudes, they do so only during spring, summer, and fall. Winter activ­
ity periods of northern beaver commonly exhibit a free-running circa­
dian rhythm of about 26–29 hr, likely because relatively constant light 
conditions preclude entrainment of a photoperiod (Lancia et al. 1982). 
To survive extreme cold in winter, beaver remain under the ice or in­
side a lodge, where temperatures are nearer a relatively moderate 0

When beaver venture above the ice, ambient air temperatures below

C cause substantial energy de ﬁcits. During extreme cold, 
beaver may exhibit no detectable movement inside the lodge (Aleksuik 
and Cowan 1969; Lancia et al. 1982), an energy-saving mechanism that 
may reduce caloric needs by 20% (McKab 1963). 
Dispersal and Other Movements. Bergerud and Miller (1977) clas­
siﬁed the major movements of beaver as (1) movement of the entire 
colony between ponds within a territory; (2) short-term wandering of 
yearlings; (3) dispersal of beaver, usually at age 2 years, to establish new 
colonies; and (4) miscellaneous movement of adults, often following 
loss of a mate. Dispersal of 2-year-old beaver is the primary mechanism 
of population expansion. Dispersing individuals may return to the home 
colony for short periods of time, which suggests that dispersal is innate 
rather than learned from or encouraged by any aggressive behavior of 
parents (Hodgdon 1978). Dispersal of subadults often coincides with 
the birth of kits in the spring and/or high runoff, especially where ice 
in winter limits movements (Van Deelen and Pletscher 1996). Move­
ments in ice-free areas are less restricted, as some dispersal occurs in

 by any aggressive behavior of 
parents (Hodgdon 1978). Dispersal of subadults often coincides with 
the birth of kits in the spring and/or high runoff, especially where ice 
in winter limits movements (Van Deelen and Pletscher 1996). Move­
ments in ice-free areas are less restricted, as some dispersal occurs in 
late February and March, and scent marking and territorial defense may 
occur throughout the winter. Beaver in poor-quality habitat, or where 
trapping or other control measures have reduced populations below car­
rying capacity, may disperse at a higher rate than those in good-quality 
saturated habitat. Thus, habitat conditions may affect the length of time 
beaver remain in the family unit as subadults. However, beaver also may 
exhibit high dispersal in fully occupied habitat, which suggests disper­
sal patterns are inconsistent (Gunson 1970; Van Deelen and Pletscher 
1996). Stochastic models of beaver population growth have assumed 
density-dependent dispersal rates (Molini et al. 1980). Distance of nat­
ural dispersal varies greatly, sometimes depending on the location of 
suitable but unoccupied habitat. Direction of dispersal can be either 
upstream or downstream within a watershed, or beaver can cross wa­
tersheds by overland travel of up to several kilometers. In a study of 46 
dispersing beaver in New Y ork, 74% initiated dispersal downstream, 
35% moved to neighboring colonies, and females moved farther than 
males (Sun et al. 2000). In that study, 14% of dispersers were 1 year old, 
64% were 2 years old, and 21% were 3 years old. If the entire colony

 Y ork, 74% initiated dispersal downstream, 
35% moved to neighboring colonies, and females moved farther than 
males (Sun et al. 2000). In that study, 14% of dispersers were 1 year old, 
64% were 2 years old, and 21% were 3 years old. If the entire colony 
moves to a new location, then movement usually occurs before partu­
rition; single animals usually disperse before pairs (Hodgdon 1978). 
Distances moved and time of movement are important considerations 
in formulating management strategies. 
Home Range. Home range of a beaver depends on sex, age, social 
organization of the family unit, type of occupied habitat, and seasonal 
constraints. During the summer, parental care for kits in and near the 
lodge or den can restrict the distance that adults can forage, with females 
staying closer to kits than do males. As young become more independent 
in the fall, the home range of adults may increase, although this is not 
always the case. In areas where ice conﬁnes movements in winter, home 
range is also constrained. For example, a radiotelemetry study of beaver 
in the taiga of southeastern Manitoba showed those in family units had 
smaller average summer home ranges (8 ha) than those in nonfamily 
units (18 ha) and that home ranges were larger in summer and fall than 
in winter (Wheatley 1997a, 1997b). 
Habitat features, especially shoreline conﬁguration, strongly affect 
home range shape and size. Home ranges tend to follow the irregular 
shoreline patterns of lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. Small ponds may 
contain only a single family unit with a relatively circular home range,

 winter (Wheatley 1997a, 1997b). 
Habitat features, especially shoreline conﬁguration, strongly affect 
home range shape and size. Home ranges tend to follow the irregular 
shoreline patterns of lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. Small ponds may 
contain only a single family unit with a relatively circular home range, 
but in lakes, streams, and rivers, the home ranges of beaver are typically 
larger and more linear (Novak 1987; Wheatley 1997c). However, these 
habitat-related patterns may break down when beaver are not living 
in a sedentary family unit or during seasonal movements (Wheatley 
1997c). In addition, intraspeciﬁc competition, or territoriality, is an im­
portant mechanism, which helps to regulate population density. Boyce 
(1981a) suggested that territoriality likely was responsible for a mini­
mum intercolony distance of 1 km. Beyond that distance, availability of 
suitable sites for foraging, dams, and lodges more strongly inﬂuenced 
the distribution of colonies. 
Population Density. Beaver population density varies spatially and 
temporally. Because the home ranges of adjacent beaver families are 
usually separated by unoccupied habitat, density estimates typically in­
clude some unoccupied habitat. Factors that contribute to variation in 
density of beaver populations include human exploitation (trapping), 
water quality, habitat suitability, area available for new colonization, 
length of habitation time relative to available resources, epizootic dis­
eases, local predation events, and territoriality. There is a wide range in 
the density of beaver colonies, from near zero to at least 4.6/km 2 (re­

eases, local predation events, and territoriality. There is a wide range in 
the density of beaver colonies, from near zero to at least 4.6/km 2 (re­
views by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). Observers in different regions have 
attempted to estimate the maximum density or saturation point in local 
populations. Saturation has been reported to vary from 0.4 colony/km 
of stream in northern Alberta to 1.2 colonies/km of stream in New Y ork 
and Utah (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). In the headwaters of four 
Alabama watersheds, saturation approached 1.9 colonies/km of stream 
(Hill 1976). 
Trapping can suppress beaver populations below habitat-based 
carrying capacity and is an important consideration in understanding 
population dynamics. Trapping often removes a larger percentage of 
adult beaver than it does other age classes; thus, it can increase adult

mortality and affect both the density and age structure of populations. 
Intense trapping over many years can entirely decimate populations, as 
it did during European settlement of North America. In previously un­
exploited populations, trapping can cause rapid population reductions. 
In a Wisconsin study, where trapping was resumed after 19 years of 
protection, beaver populations were reduced by 21% in the ﬁrst year 
and 53% in the second year (Zeckmeister and Payne 1998). Trapping

 of North America. In previously un­
exploited populations, trapping can cause rapid population reductions. 
In a Wisconsin study, where trapping was resumed after 19 years of 
protection, beaver populations were reduced by 21% in the ﬁrst year 
and 53% in the second year (Zeckmeister and Payne 1998). Trapping 
can also alter the age structure of populations as removal of adults 
from established territories frees suitable habitat, allowing beaver to 
disperse earlier from their natal colony and increasing their survival 
(Boyce 1981b). Comparing harvested and unharvested beaver popu­
lations in New Y ork, Muller-Schwarze and Schulte (1999) found that 
in unharvested populations, beaver colonized steeper stream gradients, 
young remained longer in the natal colony, preferred forage species 
were depleted and less preferred species were used more often, and 
beaver foraged further from their pond, lodge, or den. 
Density of beaver populations that occupy particular sites may also 
vary as a function of the length of time sites have been occupied. For ex­
ample, after beaver returned to the Prescott Peninsula in Massachusetts 
following an absence of more than 200 years, the population showed 
slow growth the ﬁrst 15 years, then 15 years of very rapid growth, and 
then a rapid decline in numbers until it stabilized at 23% of its peak. 
Populations in Sagehen Creek, California, also followed a pattern char­
acterized ﬁrst by slow growth, then rapid growth, then rapid decline to 
a level of relative stability (Busher and Lyons 1999).

Populations in Sagehen Creek, California, also followed a pattern char­
acterized ﬁrst by slow growth, then rapid growth, then rapid decline to 
a level of relative stability (Busher and Lyons 1999). 
Observers monitoring short-term trends in beaver populations 
should consider these and other intrinsic population regulation mech­
anisms (such as territoriality) as factors that might explain population 
change. These intrinsic factors can be important confounding variables 
when attempting to understand extrinsic factors affecting beaver popu­
lations, such as trapping, anthropogenic habitat alteration, and compe­
tition with other species. 
Construction of Dams, Ponds, and Canals. Beaver are unique in 
their ability to create favorable aquatic habitat by building dams to 
restrict the ﬂow of moving water, a behavior richly described in early 
literature on beaver and in many popular texts (Hilﬁker 1991). The 
widely recognized beaver dam and beaver pond have made this seldom 
seen nocturnal rodent a familiar and well-studied mammal in North 
America. 
Dams may be initiated by pushing sediment, rocks, or sticks into 
a ridge formed perpendicular to the ﬂow of moving water or by locat­
ing sites to take advantage of existing substrate (Hodgdon and Lancia 
1983). Structure is added by anchoring leafy branches, peeled branches, 
or other material to the substrate (stream bottom, stream banks, large 
rocks, or coarse, woody debris). Branches in the bulk of the dam may 
be anchored and intertwined perpendicular or parallel to the ﬂow of 
water; however, material on the downstream side is usually placed with 
the

 anchoring leafy branches, peeled branches, 
or other material to the substrate (stream bottom, stream banks, large 
rocks, or coarse, woody debris). Branches in the bulk of the dam may 
be anchored and intertwined perpendicular or parallel to the ﬂow of 
water; however, material on the downstream side is usually placed with 
the cut end pushed into the stream bottom or bank and the branched 
end pointing upstream to support and stabilize the dam. 
Beaver use woody vegetation (bark may be peeled and eaten be­
fore placement in dams) and many other materials in dams. Dams can 
include conifers, sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), tamarisk (Tamarix 
pentandra), aquatic plants, corncobs, cornstalks, plastic, metal, or 
other debris. Interestingly, when preferred foods are limited and less-
preferred foods are more abundant, beaver will select stems that are 
less palatable for dams and save the more palatable stems for food, 
especially for use in their winter food cache (Barnes and Mallik 1996; 
B. W . Baker, unpublished data). For example, Barnes and Mallik (1996) 
found that beaver preferred stems that were 1.5–3.5 cm in diameter and 
grew close to shore for dam-building material (mostly alder, Alnus 
spp.). They searched for and selected larger stems (>4.5 cm) that were 
further from the shore as food items. Thus, beaver increased risk of pre­
dation to obtain food but not dam-building material. Barnes and Mallik 
(1996) speculated that smaller stems were also better for construction 
of dams, as they might be easier to work with and provide a tighter

 and selected larger stems (>4.5 cm) that were 
further from the shore as food items. Thus, beaver increased risk of pre­
dation to obtain food but not dam-building material. Barnes and Mallik 
(1996) speculated that smaller stems were also better for construction 
of dams, as they might be easier to work with and provide a tighter 
seal against leaks. However, conventional wisdom suggests that larger 
material might make stronger dams in regions that experience high 
spring ﬂows, although this hypothesis has not been tested experimen­
tally. When woody material is in place, beaver seal the upstream side 
of the dam with mud and herbaceous vegetation (grass, leaves). They 
typically use mud from the stream bottom immediately upstream of the 
dam, making this area of the pond the deepest. If the pond overﬂows 
the channel as it develops behind the dam, then beaver will often extend 
the dam laterally by adding shallow wings. Often several dams are built 
in succession, with water from each pond backed up to the base of the 
upstream dam, creating a stair-step pattern of dams and ponds, which 
ﬂattens the slope of the drainage. 
The sound of running water is the primary cue for beaver to main­
tain and sometimes initiate dams (e.g., a noisy road culvert). Although 
beaver typically work on dams individually, sudden or loud sounds of 
running water may elicit cooperative behavior, especially to repair a 
breach in the dam (Aeschbacher and Pilleri 1983). Beaver of all ages 
inspect and repair dams, but adults perform most of the work. The lit­
erature is inconsistent about the relative efforts of males and females 
(Hodgdon 1978

 or loud sounds of 
running water may elicit cooperative behavior, especially to repair a 
breach in the dam (Aeschbacher and Pilleri 1983). Beaver of all ages 
inspect and repair dams, but adults perform most of the work. The lit­
erature is inconsistent about the relative efforts of males and females 
(Hodgdon 1978; Busher 1983). Beaver may initiate and maintain dams 
at any ice-free time of year; however, in many areas there is a peak of 
activity in the fall before freeze-up and again in the spring after high 
ﬂows have subsided. 
The size and number of dams in a colony and the surface area 
and volume of water in ponds vary greatly depending on duration of 
occupancy, topography, substrate, ﬂow levels, available vegetation, and 
other factors. As water spreads from primary dams within main chan­
nels, beaver often build small dams on the surface of the ﬂoodplain to 
further spread and direct water. Thus, individual dams and ponds can 
be very large or very small, with area inundated generally increasing 
through the ﬁrst few years of beaver occupancy. 
Beaver often dig canals to facilitate movement of food and building 
material within and among their ponds or increase water depth for ice-
free access to a lodge or food cache. The longer that beaver occupy a 
site, the more likely it is that they will build or extend canals to access 
new foraging areas. Canals built within the pond may not be visible 
unless the pond is drained, but canals built in theﬂoodplain may become 
obvious features of the landscape. Some canals may contain burrows 
with an underwater entrance to provide a

site, the more likely it is that they will build or extend canals to access 
new foraging areas. Canals built within the pond may not be visible 
unless the pond is drained, but canals built in theﬂoodplain may become 
obvious features of the landscape. Some canals may contain burrows 
with an underwater entrance to provide a refuge from predators. 
Beaver also create surface trails or“slides” as they transport woody 
material from their foraging area back to ponds and canals. These trails 
make it easier for beaver to drag material across the ground, permitting 
them to move material across greater distances. This is especially obvi­
ous in steep terrain, where gravity aids movement of material and can 
increase the effective foraging distance by several hundred meters. 
Lodges and Bank Dens. Beaver construct bank dens and lodges, which 
are used for protection from predators and weather. Bank dens are often 
dug under a large tree or shrub on the stream bank to provide support 
for the roof of the den. They have a nest area above the water level, an 
underwater entrance, and small holes in the surface soil to permit air 
exchange. Where beaver live exclusively in rivers or deep lakes, bank 
dens are typically the only housing structures that are built. Even where 
beaver eventually build dams and lodges, they often live in a bank den 
until more permanent structures are completed. The only place that 
bank burrows are completely absent is where the substrate prohibits 
their construction, such as areas with very rocky soils or permafrost. In 
many areas, lodges and bank dens are used. 
Lodges can be built in ponds or shallow lakes, where they are 
surrounded by water

until more permanent structures are completed. The only place that 
bank burrows are completely absent is where the substrate prohibits 
their construction, such as areas with very rocky soils or permafrost. In 
many areas, lodges and bank dens are used. 
Lodges can be built in ponds or shallow lakes, where they are 
surrounded by water, or they can be built on the shore, often as an 
upward extension of a bank den. In this case, in which they often are 
called a bank lodge, beaver add sticks on top of the bank den and cut a 
hole to create a nest chamber. This process can be extended over several 
years if dam height and water level increase. Construction of a lodge in 
open water is similar, with sticks piled high enough to enable beaver to 
cut a nest chamber above the water surface. Mud is added to the surface 
of the lodge to provide a weather seal, but a portion of the top remains 
unsealed to allow air exchange. Beaver may have multiple active and 
inactive lodges within their territory. In addition to mud and freshly cut 
branches or dead sticks, beaver lodges may include some rocks or other

material, although not as much as in dams. The presence of fresh mud 
or green branches on lodges is often used as an indicator of an active 
colony. As with dams, lodge construction is often most active in the 
fall immediately before freeze-up. In ice-free regions, construction of 
dams and lodges occurs all year, but is less active in the summer.

colony. As with dams, lodge construction is often most active in the 
fall immediately before freeze-up. In ice-free regions, construction of 
dams and lodges occurs all year, but is less active in the summer. 
Food Caches. In regions where ponds or streams freeze during the 
winter, beaver build food caches, which they access from their lodge 
by swimming under the ice. The use of food caches is uncommon or 
absent where beaver inhabit ice-free regions. Beaver typically build a 
cache by ﬁrst ﬂoating cut branches in a deep part of the pond and then 
adding new material under this raft. The branches eventually become 
water-logged and sink to the bottom, holding the cache in place. The 
upper layer of the cache, called a cap or raft, becomes frozen in ice and 
unavailable to beaver. Interestingly, beaver often use inedible or less-
preferred species for the cap and place more-preferred food items deep 
enough in the cache to remain ice free and accessible throughout the 
winter (Slough 1978; B. W . Baker, unpublished data). Differential use 
of woody plants in food caches and dams can also occur. For example, 
beaver in Ontario preferentially used conifers and alder in dams and 
aspen (Populus tremuloides) and maple in food caches (Doucet et al. 
1994a). Quality of food items in caches is especially important in colder 
climates, where gestation, parturition, and feeding of newborn young 
occur under the ice. Construction of a winter food cache usually occurs

aspen (Populus tremuloides) and maple in food caches (Doucet et al. 
1994a). Quality of food items in caches is especially important in colder 
climates, where gestation, parturition, and feeding of newborn young 
occur under the ice. Construction of a winter food cache usually occurs 
in late fall and is often initiated by the ﬁrst hard frost. Beaver may 
build multiple food caches in a single colony and often do not consume 
the entire cache during the winter. In the spring, barked stems from the 
cache may be used to maintain the dam. During ice-free months, beaver 
sometimes forage by cutting stems on land and returning to a favored 
location at the edge of a pond to consume them in safety, leaving a pile 
of peeled stems suggestive of a winter food cache. 
ECOLOGY 
Diet. Beaver are choosy generalist herbivores, consuming a diet of 
herbaceous and woody plants, which varies considerably by region and 
season. The number of plant species in the diet is highest in the southern 
part of the range and decreases toward the northern and alpine limits of 
the range (Novak 1987). Herbaceous plants make up much of the diet 
when they are available and succulent (actively growing). In the central 
and southern United States, beaver eat a variety of aquatic and riparian 
forbs and grasses as well as cultivated row crops and grains. Roberts 
and Arner (1984) found that beaver in Mississippi depended on the bark 
of woody plants in late fall and winter, but abruptly shifted their diet to 
herbaceous species after spring greenup in March. Using stomach anal­
ysis, they identiﬁed 16 genera of herbaceous

es as well as cultivated row crops and grains. Roberts 
and Arner (1984) found that beaver in Mississippi depended on the bark 
of woody plants in late fall and winter, but abruptly shifted their diet to 
herbaceous species after spring greenup in March. Using stomach anal­
ysis, they identiﬁed 16 genera of herbaceous plants, 15 species of trees 
and shrubs, and four woody vines in the yearlong diet. Woody material 
constituted 53% of the annual diet (86% in winter, 16% in summer); 
grasses occurred in 25% of stomach samples, including some collected 
in midwinter. In an Ohio study, herbaceous plants accounted for 90% 
of the feeding time during summer and 40–50% during spring and 
fall (Svendsen 1980b). In the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, 
leaves and the growing tips of willow (Salix spp.) were the main foods in 
July and August. Bark of willow (76%), poplar (Populus balsamifera) 
(14%), and alder (A. crispa) (10%) made up the diet the rest of the year 
(Aleksiuk 1970b). The protein:calorie ratio was 40 mg/cal in summer 
and 8 mg/cal for the rest of the year, indicating that beaver in northern 
areas shift their diet to high-protein willow leaves whenever they are 
available. In northern latitudes, water lily (Nymphaea, Nuphar) is often 
the most important herbaceous component of the diet (Novak 1987). Its 
edible rhizomes remain succulent after cutting and are often stored in a 
food cache for winter use (Jenkins 1981). A variety

-protein willow leaves whenever they are 
available. In northern latitudes, water lily (Nymphaea, Nuphar) is often 
the most important herbaceous component of the diet (Novak 1987). Its 
edible rhizomes remain succulent after cutting and are often stored in a 
food cache for winter use (Jenkins 1981). A variety of grasses, sedges 
(Carex), rushes (Scirpus), and cattails (Typha) is important in the West 
and Southwest. 
Deciduous woody plants are usually the most important compo­
nent of the diet of beaver and often are the primary limiting factor 
where ice forces subsistence on a winter food cache. Beaver eat the 
leaves, buds, twigs, noncorky bark, roots, and fruits of deciduous woody 
plants, as well as acorns when available (Grinnell et al. 1937; Novak 
1987). There is wide regional variation in the number and composi­
tion of woody plant species used. As few as 3 species may be used 
by colonies in the northern range (Aleksiuk 1970), but in the southern 
range, 22 species were reported in Louisiana and 38 species in South 
Carolina (review by Hill 1982). In a review of regional food habits, No­
vak (1987) suggested that local populations of beaver in southern areas 
included more woody plant species in their diets than did northern pop­
ulations, but at regional scales the number of woody species used was 
similar. 
Conifers also are cut or gnawed by beaver and used for food or 
building material, although their value varies greatly by region and 
availability of preferred deciduous species. In the eastern United States,
Text Len: 1551
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 more woody plant species in their diets than did northern pop­
ulations, but at regional scales the number of woody species used was 
similar. 
Conifers also are cut or gnawed by beaver and used for food or 
building material, although their value varies greatly by region and 
availability of preferred deciduous species. In the eastern United States, 
loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and Virginia pine (P . virginiana) may make 
up over half of the woody material cut by beaver (Novak 1987). They 
may repeatedly gnaw the bark of pine trees to obtain sap (Svendsen 
1980b) or sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciﬂua) trees to obtain storax, 
an aromatic balsam, which they lick from the injured site. In many areas, 
especially in their northern and western range, any substantial use of 
conifer is considered unusual and a sign that more-preferred species 
are lacking (Novak 1987). Dietary use of conifer also may be seasonal, 
as beaver in Massachusetts selected against pine during the fall, but not 
during the rest of the year (Jenkins 1979). 
Food Preference. Preference for a particular food item indicates “it 
constitutes a signiﬁcantly larger fraction of the diet than an unbiased 
sample of items of the various food types available” (Jenkins 1981:560). 
Thus, some foods may constitute a large percentage of the diet, but may 
not be preferred over less available, but more favored species. 
Willow is often the most available and the most used woody ri­
parian species in much of the beaver ’s range. In many areas of the

Thus, some foods may constitute a large percentage of the diet, but may 
not be preferred over less available, but more favored species. 
Willow is often the most available and the most used woody ri­
parian species in much of the beaver ’s range. In many areas of the 
far north, Rocky Mountains, and intermountain west, beaver may de­
pend entirely on willow to supply winter forage and building material 
(Aleksiuk 1970b). Where aspen or poplar is available, it is usually 
more preferred than willow (Jenkins 1981). Cafeteria-style feeding ex­
periments in Ontario showed the following preferences (in descending 
order): aspen, white water lily (Nymphaea odorata), raspberry (Rubus 
idaeus), speckled alder (A. rugosa), and red maple (A. rubrum). Similar 
experiments in Nevada showed that beaver preferred aspen and avoided 
Jeffery pine (P . jeffreyi) (Basey 1999). 
Selection of forage items by beaver may be related to a variety of 
physical and chemical factors. Evidence suggests that beaver may select 
aspen resprouts based on their age-related growth form (Basey et al. 
1988, 1990). Aspen reproduces asexually by resprouting within a clone. 
Aspen clones that have been repeatedly cut by beaver produce juvenile-
form root sprouts (large leaves with an absence of lateral branching), 
which are avoided by beaver when compared to available adult-form 
root sprouts (small leaves with lateral branching). Although juvenile-
form aspen sprouts have more protein and likely provide better nutrition, 
they contain secondary metabolites that apparently cause

 that have been repeatedly cut by beaver produce juvenile-
form root sprouts (large leaves with an absence of lateral branching), 
which are avoided by beaver when compared to available adult-form 
root sprouts (small leaves with lateral branching). Although juvenile-
form aspen sprouts have more protein and likely provide better nutrition, 
they contain secondary metabolites that apparently cause avoidance 
by beaver. The importance of secondary metabolites to selection was 
further demonstrated in experiments where leaf extracts from different 
deciduous and coniferous species were painted on aspen leaves and then 
presented to beaver. Selection favored aspen leaves painted with extracts 
from deciduous species more so than those painted with extracts from 
coniferous species (Basey 1999). 
Retention time of forage passed through the digestive tract varies 
with diet composition (likely due to lignin and ﬁber content) and may 
also inﬂuence food selection by beaver. Experiments have shown that 
food preference and retention time are correlated; species with a shorter 
retention time, such as aspen, are more preferred than those with a 
longer retention time. Beaver “select a diet that maximizes long-term 
energy intake, subject to digestive limitations” (Doucet and Fryxell 
1993:201). Thus, retention time may inﬂuence intake rates and energy 
gained from different forage species, indicating it may be an important 
factor in food selection by beaver (Fryxell et al. 1994). 
Physical features of the food item may also inﬂuence selection. In 
an experimental study of foraging behavior, Doucet et al. (1994b) found

that beaver could only distinguish differences in canopy biomass on a 
very coarse scale, which suggests they selected stems using diameter as 
an index of biomass. Beaver also select foods by taste, sometimes biting 
off small samples of bark before cutting down an entire tree. In feeding 
experiments, beaver avoided aspen that had been painted with an extract 
of red maple (Muller-Schwarze et al. 1994). In areas with a variety of 
trees available for food, red maple may be the only tree left standing 
at the edge of an older beaver pond. Odor may also affect selection. In 
a similar experiment using extracts of predator feces painted on aspen 
logs, there was a strong preference against the odors of coyote, lynx, 
and river otter. Thus, predator odors may be a useful management tool 
for preventing beaver damage (Engelhart and Muller-Schwarze 1995). 
Central-Place Foraging. Beaver typically cut woody vegetation from 
terrestrial locations for food or construction material and bring it back 
to a central place, such as a pond, cache, aquatic feeding station, lodge, 
burrow, or dam. Because this behavior creates exposure to predation 
and has high energetic costs, beaver have been used to test general pre­
dictions of central-place

 cut woody vegetation from 
terrestrial locations for food or construction material and bring it back 
to a central place, such as a pond, cache, aquatic feeding station, lodge, 
burrow, or dam. Because this behavior creates exposure to predation 
and has high energetic costs, beaver have been used to test general pre­
dictions of central-place foraging theory. These predictions suggest that 
beaver should modify their behavior to concentrate foraging near the 
central place and should increase their selectivity for size and species 
away from the central place (Fryxell 1992). Most studies have con­
ﬁrmed these general predictions, but exceptions to these patterns occur. 
For example, studies conﬁrmed that beaver typically cut increasingly 
smaller stems (less provisioning time) further from the central place, as 
predicted by optimal foraging models (Jenkins 1980; Belovsky 1984; 
Fryxell and Doucet 1990). In contrast, where relatively small (1.5– 
30 mm) stems are the only woody plants available, beaver may select 
larger stems even when located further from the central place (McGinley 
and Whitman 1985). Selection for larger stems is particularly evident 
where beaver occupy shrub habitats, such as those containing only 
smaller species of willow and alder. In some cases, repeated cutting by 
beaver can cause trees to develop and maintain a shrubby growth form 
(e.g., Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii; McGinley and Whitman 
1985). 
The size–distance relation in food selection by beaver also may 
be affected by species preferences. For example, Jenkins (1980) found 
that beaver cut larger stems of preferred species, such as
Text Len: 1656
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 develop and maintain a shrubby growth form 
(e.g., Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii; McGinley and Whitman 
1985). 
The size–distance relation in food selection by beaver also may 
be affected by species preferences. For example, Jenkins (1980) found 
that beaver cut larger stems of preferred species, such as oak and cherry 
(Prunus), further from the central place than less-preferred species. 
In contrast, although Belovsky (1984) did ﬁnd that beaver had strong 
food preferences, preferences did not change relative to distance from 
beaver ponds. In many cases, the interaction of species preferences 
with stem size and distance from the central place has been difﬁcult to 
document in the ﬁeld because depth to water and other plant-growing 
conditions preclude equal availability of stems to beaver. Modeling the 
diet of beaver is one way to overcome limitations of ﬁeld experiments. 
For example, Belovsky (1984:220) found that beaver at Isle Royale 
selected their diet “consistent with an energy-maximizing solution to 
a linear-programming model.” This energy maximization model was 
further conﬁrmed by Fryxell (1992) with a second line of evidence, 
which found both density and distance were important predictors of 
food selection by beaver. 
Chemical factors and stem size may also inﬂuence stem selection 
by beaver. If aspen responds to repeated beaver cutting by producing 
a juvenile growth form, then higher concentrations of phenolic com­
pounds (secondary metabolites) may inhibit further cutting by beaver 
and inﬂuence the

food selection by beaver. 
Chemical factors and stem size may also inﬂuence stem selection 
by beaver. If aspen responds to repeated beaver cutting by producing 
a juvenile growth form, then higher concentrations of phenolic com­
pounds (secondary metabolites) may inhibit further cutting by beaver 
and inﬂuence the predictive value of optimal foraging models for beaver. 
Basey et al. (1988) found beaver avoided aspen stems <4.5 cm in diam­
eter in favor of those >19.5 cm in diameter near a 20-year-old beaver 
pond where 51% of stems had been previously cut by beaver and the 
remaining 49% of stems were in juvenile form. In contrast, beaver at 
a newly occupied site selected smaller aspen stems and against larger 
ones. Taken together, these results suggest that phenolic compounds, 
or other factors in addition to size of stem, may inﬂuence selection by 
beaver. 
Food Consumption and Production. Estimates of daily forage con­
sumption rates (wet woody biomass) for beaver vary from 0.5 kg/day 
(Dyck and MacArthur 1993) to 2.0 kg/day (review by Stegeman 1954). 
ln an interesting account of a Colorado beaver colony fed by a Forest 
Service contractor in the 1920s, it was estimated that each beaver con­
sumed (although possible use in dams was not described) an average 
of about 900 kg of green aspen/year (Warren 1940). In a study of the 
energy content and digestibility of cached woody biomass, Dyck and 
MacArthur (1993) concluded that the total winter energy requirements 
could not be met from the submerged

 each beaver con­
sumed (although possible use in dams was not described) an average 
of about 900 kg of green aspen/year (Warren 1940). In a study of the 
energy content and digestibility of cached woody biomass, Dyck and 
MacArthur (1993) concluded that the total winter energy requirements 
could not be met from the submerged food cache in their study colony. 
Supporting research has shown that when food is limited, beaver may 
metabolize body tissue during winter. 
Estimates of beaver food (twigs and bark) produced by trees and 
shrubs may be useful for predicting the carrying capacity of beaver 
where woody biomass limits population density. Beaver food estimates 
are derived from graphs or equations that model annual production 
(current annual growth) and total biomass based on measures of basal 
stem diameter. Estimates have been derived for aspen (Aldous 1938; 
Stegeman 1954), willow (Baker and Cade 1995), and ﬁve species of ri­
parian shrubs in Minnesota (Buech and Rugg 1995). The maximum 
diameter of twigs that are entirely consumed by beaver is a criti­
cal consideration in deriving estimates of beaver food. The diameter 
used is often based on assumptions made from observing the size of 
peeled stems, but may vary greatly by species and region. For example, 
Aldous (1938) assumed beaver ate all stem portions <12.7 mm in di­
ameter for aspen, Buech and Rugg (1995) assumed <5 mm for Min­
nesota shrubs, and Baker and Cade (1995) assumed <3 mm for coyote

nesota shrubs, and Baker and Cade (1995) assumed <3 mm for coyote 
willow (S. exigua). Application of results among studies and differ­
ent woody species requires caution. In addition, intense ungulate or 
livestock herbivory of the terminal leaders on shrubs may strongly re­
duce the biomass of beaver food relative to unbrowsed stems of equal 
diameter (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). 
Habitat Requirements. The ability of beaver to alter existing habi­
tat conditions to meet their needs has allowed populations to inhabit a 
variety of natural and human-made habitats in North America. They 
have successfully colonized tundra and taiga in the far North, bottom­
land hardwood forests and marshes in the deep South, riparian areas 
in both cold and hot deserts, and elevations that vary from sea level to 
above 3400 m (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). Although beaver 
can occupy a wide variety of habitats, some generalizations are evi­
dent. A comprehensive evaluation of beaver habitat requirements in the 
Rocky Mountains showed they generally preferred wide valleys with 
a low (<6%) stream gradient, which offered relatively more food and 
reduced risk of severe ﬂoods (Retzer et al. 1956). Beaver typically in­
habit streams with at least intermittent ﬂow and lakes or ponds with 
standing water, but they can also inhabit bogs that lack open water. In 
Minnesota, they occur in sedge-moss and other

, which offered relatively more food and 
reduced risk of severe ﬂoods (Retzer et al. 1956). Beaver typically in­
habit streams with at least intermittent ﬂow and lakes or ponds with 
standing water, but they can also inhabit bogs that lack open water. In 
Minnesota, they occur in sedge-moss and other bogs, where they can 
enlarge natural moats to create ponds of standing water and build ﬂoat­
ing lodges able to adjust to ﬂuctuating water levels, and thus maintain 
protection from predators (Rebertus 1986). 
Early studies of beaver formed the foundation for later math­
ematical models, which quanti ﬁed habitat requirements and created 
a framework for making and testing predictions. Slough and Sadleir 
(1977) sampled colony density and associated habitat conditions at 
136 lakes and 45 stream sites in Ontario and used regression analysis 
to develop a land classiﬁcation system for beaver. Howard and Larson 
(1985) used principal component analysis of habitat variables to predict 
beaver colony density in Massachusetts. Percentage hardwood vegeta­
tion, watershed size, stream width, and stream gradient were important 
predictors in their classiﬁcation system. Allen (1983) used existing lit­
erature and expert opinion to develop a general habitat suitability index 
(HSI) model for beaver, which used nine variables to rate habitat qual­
ity on a scale of 0.0–1.0. These variables included measures of canopy 
cover, height, stem diameter, species of trees and shrubs, stream gradi­
ent, water level ﬂuctuation, and shoreline development (ratio of length 
and area). The HSI model assumed a

ity on a scale of 0.0–1.0. These variables included measures of canopy 
cover, height, stem diameter, species of trees and shrubs, stream gradi­
ent, water level ﬂuctuation, and shoreline development (ratio of length 
and area). The HSI model assumed a minimum habitat area of 0.8 km of 
stream or 1.3 km2 of lake or marsh as a prerequisite of suitable beaver 
habitat. This model has been widely used by environmental planners 
to quantify potential impacts from development projects and mitigate 
habitat loss.

Other researchers have developed alternative habitat models and 
modiﬁed existing models for different habitats and regions. For ex­
ample, researchers in prairie regions found beaver selected riverine 
lodge-site locations in areas that had thick, concealing vegetation cover 
(which was often left uncut) and steep shoreline banks (Dieter and 
McCabe 1989). In the Truckee River basin of California, physical fea­
tures of the stream, such as a lower gradient and a greater depth and 
width, were more important than vegetation in describing the location 
of lodge sites selected by beaver (Beier and Barrett 1987). In contrast, 
Barnes and Mallik (1997) found that concentration of woody plants 1.5– 
4.4 cm in diameter and size of the stream and its upstream watershed 
area were important predictors of dam-site location in northern Ontario. 
In Oregon streams, McComb et al. (1990) found that

 (Beier and Barrett 1987). In contrast, 
Barnes and Mallik (1997) found that concentration of woody plants 1.5– 
4.4 cm in diameter and size of the stream and its upstream watershed 
area were important predictors of dam-site location in northern Ontario. 
In Oregon streams, McComb et al. (1990) found that beaver selected 
dam sites where the substrate was less rocky, the water was shallower, 
the channel had a lower gradient, and woody vegetation (e.g., Alnus) 
had a greater canopy cover. They concluded that Allen ’s (1983) HSI 
model was useful in predicting habitat quality for beaver at their sites, 
but required some site-speciﬁc modiﬁcations. 
In contrast, others have found that Allen’s HSI model was a poor 
predictor of beaver habitat quality in their region. For example, a Kansas 
study suggested that water quality, river substrate type, and adjacent 
agricultural land-use practices are important predictors of riverine habi­
tat quality for beaver in the central United States (Robel et al. 1993). 
In an Oregon study, many potential beaver sites were highly rated by 
the HSI model even though they were unoccupied by beaver at the time 
of study, which suggested poor model performance to the investiga­
tors (Suzuki and McComb 1998). However, low density or absence of 
beaver in apparently suitable habitat is not unusual and may be caused 
by many non-habitat-based factors, such as trapping, disease, territori­
ality, or simply the inherent variation of natural systems. At occupied

beaver in apparently suitable habitat is not unusual and may be caused 
by many non-habitat-based factors, such as trapping, disease, territori­
ality, or simply the inherent variation of natural systems. At occupied 
sites, cutting of preferred species by beaver may alter the density and 
species composition of vegetation, and thus affect how the habitat might 
be rated by habitat models (Suzuki and McComb 1998). 
MORTALITY 
Predation. Predation by the timber wolf (Canis lupus) can be an im­
portant limiting factor of beaver populations where they occur together. 
Wolves prey on beaver during the ice-free period, when nearly half their 
diet may consist of beaver (Potvin et al. 1992). In Algonquin Park, 
Ontario, as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations de­
clined over a 9-year period, beaver gradually became the most important 
prey item: 55% of wolf scats had beaver remains (V oigt et al. 1976). In 
an experimental study in Quebec, density of beaver colonies increased 
20% after 3 years of wolf control and then declined again after wolf 
control ceased, indicating wolf predation may have suppressed popu­
lations below the carrying capacity of the habitat (Potvin et al. 1992). 
Habitat conditions that force beaver to forage farther from water may in­
crease predation rates by wolves. On Isle Royale, beaver foraged further 
(>100 m) from ponds when wolf populations were low and closer (<35 
m) to ponds when wolf populations were high (D. W .

 habitat (Potvin et al. 1992). 
Habitat conditions that force beaver to forage farther from water may in­
crease predation rates by wolves. On Isle Royale, beaver foraged further 
(>100 m) from ponds when wolf populations were low and closer (<35 
m) to ponds when wolf populations were high (D. W . Smith, unpub­
lished data). Thus, the impact of wolf predation on beaver populations 
can be locally signiﬁcant, but varies greatly depending on wolf density, 
alternative prey availability, and other factors. 
Coyotes (Canis latrans) and mountain lions (Puma concolor) also 
prey on beaver, as do some other mammalian predators of generally 
minor importance, such as bears (Ursus spp.), wolverines (Gulo gulo), 
river otters (Lontra canadensis), lynx (Lynx canadensis), bobcat (Lynx 
rufus), and mink (Mustela vison) (review by Hill 1982). However, un­
usual circumstances can alter typical predation patterns. Black bear (U. 
americanus) predation strongly suppressed beaver populations on an is­
land in Lake Superior (Smith et al. 1994). In this case, bears colonized 
one of two similar islands in the 1970s that beaver had colonized in the 
late 1940s or early 1950s. As the bear population grew, they focused 
predation on beaver, the only source of meat on the island, digging into 
18 of 26 beaver lodges and causing surviving beaver to concentrate 
foraging on trees <30 m from water.

predation on beaver, the only source of meat on the island, digging into 
18 of 26 beaver lodges and causing surviving beaver to concentrate 
foraging on trees <30 m from water. 
Disease. Water-borne tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the 
bacterium Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B), which 
commonly occurs in semiaquatic mammals such as beaver and muskrat 
(Ondatra zibethicus) and occasionally becomes epizootic. T ype B tu­
laremia is not fatal to humans and is responsible for only 5 –10% of 
human tularemia infections in North America. T ype A tularemia is re­
sponsible for the remaining human infections. It can be fatal to humans 
and has a terrestrial cycle in rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) and ticks (Morner 
1992). Tularemia infections in beaver are typically subclinical without 
noticeable effects on the individual or the population, but they can be fa­
tal to beaver and cause mass mortality from local or regional epizootics. 
Tularemia in beaver sometimes can be traced to infections in terrestrial 
rodents that deposit urine or feces in water, or die in water, which then 
harbors F . tularensis bacteria. For example, an outbreak of tularemia 
in Montana during 1939–1940 caused widespread mortality of beaver 
(several hundred carcasses were found) and coincident infection and 
mortality of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) that inhabited 
the grassy streambanks (Jellison et al. 1942

(several hundred carcasses were found) and coincident infection and 
mortality of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) that inhabited

been documented in beaver, but little is known about its pathogene­
sis or epizootiology (J. Rupprecht, 47th Wildlife Disease Association 
Conference, oral commun., 1998). 
Other Mortality. Starvation can be an important cause of mortality, 
especially at northern latitudes, when beaver are unable to construct a 
food cache large enough to sustain them through the winter (Gunson 
1970; Bergerud and Miller 1977). Sudden snowmelts in midwinter or 
violent spring breakups can raise water levels in streams and may de­
stroy lodges and occupants or drown large numbers of beaver under the 
ice (Hakala 1952). 
BEA VER AS A KEYSTONE SPECIES AND 
AN ECOSYSTEM ENGINEER 
A keystone species is one that greatly in ﬂuences the species compo­
sition and physical appearance of ecosystems (Paine 1969) and whose 
effects on ecosystem structure and function are both large overall and 
disproportionately large relative to its abundance (Power et al. 1996). 
An ecosystem engineer is a species that directly or indirectly controls 
resource availability by causing “physical state changes in biotic or 
abiotic materials” (Jones et al. 1997:1946). The beaver is a de ﬁnitive 
example of both a keystone species and an ecosystem engineer.

 to its abundance (Power et al. 1996). 
An ecosystem engineer is a species that directly or indirectly controls 
resource availability by causing “physical state changes in biotic or 
abiotic materials” (Jones et al. 1997:1946). The beaver is a de ﬁnitive 
example of both a keystone species and an ecosystem engineer. 
The dam-building, canal-building, and foraging activities of 
beaver have profound effects on ecosystem structure and function. 
Beaver dams slow current velocity, increase deposition and retention of 
sediment and organic matter in the pond, reduce turbidity downstream 
of the dam, increase the area of soil–water interface, elevate the water 
table, change the annual stream discharge rate by retaining precipita­
tion runoff during high ﬂows and slowly releasing it during low ﬂows, 
alter stream gradients by creating a stair-step pro ﬁle, and increase re­
sistance to disturbance (reviews by Naiman et al. 1988; Gurnell 1998). 
Canals dug by beaver spread impounded water across a larger surface 
area, and thus magnify the effects of single dams. The foraging ac­
tivity of beaver alters the species composition, density, growth form, 
and distribution of woody vegetation. These effects on vegetation and 
the physical characteristics of streams strongly alter the composition 
of the animal community. Because research did not begin until after 
beaver populations recovered following near extinction by presettle­
ment trapping and extensive habitat loss, researchers have observed a 
human-impacted and likely conservative picture of how beaver have 
altered ecosystem structure and function (Naiman et al. 1988).

altered ecosystem structure and function (Naiman et al. 1988). 
Effects of Beaver on Geological Processes. In 1938, researchers eval­
uating the formation of broad, ﬂat alluvial valleys in the Catskill region 
of New Y ork discovered that geological processes alone could not ex­
plain observed sediment deposition rates (Ruedemann and Schoon­
maker 1938). They suggested that during the 25,000 years since the 
last glaciation, layer on layer of sediment-ﬁlled beaver ponds caused 
the “complete aggrading of valleyﬂoors, originally in small descending 
steps, which disappear in time and leave a gently graded, even valley

plain horizontal from bank to bank” (Ruedemann and Schoonmaker 
1938:525). Unfortunately, the theory of beaver-assisted alluvial val­
ley formation remains largely unproven by rigorous research across 
varied landscapes. One exception is a study in Glacier National Park, 
Montana, where comparisons of sediment depth and pond age con­
ﬁrmed that beaver ponds gradually accumulated sediment as they aged 
(Meentemeyer and Butler 1999). Thus, unless dams fail, beaver ponds 
will eventually ﬁll with sediment and become beaver meadows. This 
process of accelerated meadow development by beaver dams is likely 
more important in meandering, low-gradient, valley-bottom streams,

aver ponds gradually accumulated sediment as they aged 
(Meentemeyer and Butler 1999). Thus, unless dams fail, beaver ponds 
will eventually ﬁll with sediment and become beaver meadows. This 
process of accelerated meadow development by beaver dams is likely 
more important in meandering, low-gradient, valley-bottom streams, 
where conditions favor stable dams that spread sediment-laden water 
over a large surface area, rather than in steep, V-shaped, high-energy 
streams, where beaver dams tend to fail at a greater rate. 
Beaver dams also affect erosional processes within stream chan­
nels, typically increasing channel aggradation. As sediment-loaded 
water enters a beaver pond, it slows in velocity and drops sediment, 
increasing aggradation. However, water downstream of dams can be 
underloaded with sediment and increase erosional forces as the stream 
regains lost sediment (Meentemeyer and Butler 1999). This can lead 
to a localized increase in bank sloughing below beaver dams in areas 
with erosive soils. In most cases, the net effect of beaver dams is to 
decrease channel and streambank erosion and increase channel aggra­
dation (Parker et al. 1985). Catastrophic beaver dam failures are rare 
events, but can occur following unusually large rainfalls or high spring 
runoffs. In 1994, a beaver dam in central Alberta failed and released 
7500 m3 of water, causing a ﬂood wave that was 3.5 times the maxi­
mum recorded discharge for the stream (Hillman 1998). In this case, the 
ﬂood wave was largely attenuated by downstream wetlands, including 
several beaver ponds.

mum recorded discharge for the stream (Hillman 1998). In this case, the 
ﬂood wave was largely attenuated by downstream wetlands, including 
several beaver ponds. 
Beaver dams may also act as a ﬁlter to decrease nonpoint-source 
water pollution. In a study of Currant Creek, Wyoming, a highly erosive 
second-order stream, concentrations of suspended solids, total phos­
phorus, sodium hydroxide-extractable phosphorus (biologically avail­
able P), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were reduced in water ﬂowing 
through beaver ponds during high spring runoff (Maret et al. 1987). 
The effect of beaver ponds on these parameters continued during sum­
mer lowﬂows, but was of lower magnitude. Effects disappeared at about 
1.6 km below the beaver dams, likely due to inputs from bank erosion 
(Parker et al. 1985; Maret et al. 1987). Beaver ponds may also inﬂuence 
water quality by affecting the number and composition of bacteria in 
the stream. In Wyoming, some species of bacteria apparently increased 
and others decreased as water ﬂowed through beaver ponds; however, 
results were confounded by the effects of different livestock grazing 
systems (Skinner et al. 1984).

systems (Skinner et al. 1984). 
Effects of Beaver on Ecological Processes. In addition to geologi­
cal affects, beaver alter the landscape by creating layers of spatially 
distinct volumetric units, or patch bodies, which include the bedrock, 
the water-saturated anerobic soil under the pond, the moist aerobic soil 
at the water’s edge, the pond, the browse zone concentric to the pond 
or central place, and the overlying atmosphere (Johnston and Naiman 
1987). These patch bodies create a shifting mosaic of conditions in the 
landscape, which varies spatially and temporally as beaver populations 
colonize new territory or abandon old sites (Naiman et al. 1988). The 
inherent habitat matrix strongly inﬂuences how these patch bodies af­
fect ecosystem process. Effects are greatest where contrast is greatest. 
Beaver that create dams in existing wetlands have less effect than those 
that dam streams in upland forest or desert shrubland. Basin geomor­
phology and length of occupancy also affect the magnitude of inﬂuence. 
Beaver typically select the best pond sites ﬁrst and move to less desir­
able sites as populations grow or as resources are depleted. Ponds built 
in better sites have greater longevity and affect the disturbance dynam­
ics in the system. In a Minnesota study, a series of aerial photographs 
between 1940 and 1986 showed the rate of patch formation was much 
greater during the ﬁrst two decades following colonization than during 
the second two decades, which suggests that geomorphology eventually 
limited the availability of pond sites after the initial better sites were 
occupied (Johnston and Naiman 1990

limited the availability of pond sites after the initial better sites were 
occupied (Johnston and Naiman 1990a). 
Beaver activity strongly alters the biogeochemical characteristics 
of watersheds through the accumulation, availability (standing stocks), 
and translocation of nutrients and ions (Naiman et al. 1994). In a com­
parison of stream rifﬂe areas to beaver ponds, Naiman et al. (1988) 
showed rifﬂes had only 48% of the carbon inputs, 5% of the carbon 
standing stock, and 6% of the carbon outputs as did beaver ponds. In 
addition, the turnover time of carbon in beaver ponds averaged 161 
years, much slower than the 24 years found in rif ﬂes. Beaver ponds 
affect the amount and distribution of nitrogen in the system, as ponds 
create anerobic conditions, slow ﬂows, and increase oxygen demand by 
retaining organic matter. In Quebec, a beaver-modiﬁed section of stream 
“accumulated 103 times more nitrogen than before alteration” (Naiman 
and Melillo 1984:150). Anerobic conditions caused by water-saturated 
soils in beaver ponds fundamentally alter biogeochemical pathways 
(Naiman et al. 1994). When beaver create ponds in forested uplands,

 Anerobic conditions caused by water-saturated 
soils in beaver ponds fundamentally alter biogeochemical pathways 
(Naiman et al. 1994). When beaver create ponds in forested uplands, 
most upland vegetation dies from inundation and woody material cut 
by beaver is moved to the stream for dams and lodges. The organic 
horizons of pond sediments accumulate chemical elements from for­
merly upland plants that become available for vegetative growth when 
the ponds ﬁll with sediments or dams fail and abandoned sites be­
come beaver meadows. Even small dams can accumulate a tremendous 
amount of sediment. For example, dams containing 4 –18 m3 of wood 
retained 2000–6500 m3 of pond sediment in a boreal forest system in 
Quebec (Naiman et al. 1986). In a long-term Minnesota study, beaver 
activities increased the standing stock of chemical elements in the or­
ganic horizon of ponds by 20–295% (Naiman et al. 1994). Transport 
of water through beaver ponds can also neutralize acids, increase pH, 
and increase dissolved oxygen concentrations in acidic stream sys­
tems (M. E. Smith, et al. 1991). Thus, the activities of beaver can 
strongly modify the biogeochemical characteristics of stream systems 
and fundamentally inﬂuence forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape 
scales. 
Effects of Beaver on Invertebrates. Beaver ponds affect the species 
composition and abundance of stream invertebrates as the commu­

Effects of Beaver on Invertebrates. Beaver ponds affect the species 
composition and abundance of stream invertebrates as the commu­
nity responds to increased sediment deposition and still water behind 
dams. Invertebrate taxa that prefer running water are replaced by pond 
taxa. Community function is changed as collectors and predators in­
crease in importance and shredders and scrapers decrease in importance 
(McDowell and Naiman 1986; Naiman et al. 1988). In Quebec, density 
and biomass of invertebrates in pond sites were two toﬁve times greater 
than in rifﬂe sites in the spring and summer, but were similar in the fall 
(McDowell and Naiman 1986). The number of species in ponds was 
similar to that in the natural stream channel, but resembled that in slow-
water habitats of larger order streams, indicating that invertebrates in the 
beaver ponds may not be unique in the watershed (Naiman et al. 1988). 
In a study that compared stream rifﬂe sites above and below beaver 
dams in the Adirondack Mountains, sites immediately below dams had 
lower invertebrate richness and diversity, but higher total invertebrate, 
predator, and collector–gatherer densities (M. E. Smith et al. 1991). 
Beaver may also affect the invertebrate community by changing 
the structure and chemistry of plant hosts. In a study of leaf beetles 
(Chrysomela conﬂuens) and their cottonwood (P . fremontii × P . angus­
tifolia) hosts, beetles were attracted to beaver-cut cottonwood regrowth 
even though it contained twice the level of defensive chemicals (to pro­

the structure and chemistry of plant hosts. In a study of leaf beetles 
(Chrysomela conﬂuens) and their cottonwood (P . fremontii × P . angus­
tifolia) hosts, beetles were attracted to beaver-cut cottonwood regrowth 
even though it contained twice the level of defensive chemicals (to pro­
tect the plant from herbivory) as normal juvenile regrowth (Martinsen 
et al. 1998). In this case, beetles may have sequestered these chemicals 
for their own defense against mammalian predators. Beetles also may 
have obtained a nutritional beneﬁt from beaver-cut regrowth because it 
contained more total nitrogen than nonresprout growth. Thus, beetles 
grew faster and were heavier at maturity. 
Beaver impoundments also may affect local mosquito populations, 
but not necessarily as conventional wisdom might suggest. At a New 
Y ork site, observers noted marked reductions in mosquito populations 
after beaver impounded an area of poorly drained forest (Butts 1992). 
Before impoundment, the area supported large larval populations of 
the Aedes mosquito, which is unable to breed in the permanent water 
developed by beaver.

may alter the density, distribution, species composition, and population 
characteristics of ﬁsh populations. Trout habitat in streams is usually 
improved by beaver where low ﬂows or cold water temperatures limit 
trout distribution or production. However, trout may be harmed if water 
is warmed beyond their tolerance. Beaver beneﬁt trout by creating deep 
pools, which resist freezing in winter (often capped with ice and snow, 
which prevents formation of anchor ice) and maintain cooler tempera­
tures in summer. Beaver provide additional beneﬁts by increasing the 
size of the wetland area, improving physical cover, and increasing the 
invertebrate forage base because of changes in the substrate and higher 
water temperatures in ponds (reviews by Hill 1982; Olson and Hubert 
1994). In Wyoming, standing stock (kg/ha) and density of brook trout 
(Salvelinus fontinalis) in beaver ponds were correlated with surface 
area, mean water depth, water volume, discharge into pond, elevation, 
and a morphoedaphic index (Winkle et al. 1990). However, where trout 
populations are limited by high water temperature in the eastern United 
States, beaver ponds may increase temperatures beyond tolerable limits, 
and beaver dams are often removed to improve trout habitat. However, a 
study of the thermal effects of beaver dams in Wisconsin found no con­

 a 
study of the thermal effects of beaver dams in Wisconsin found no con­
sistent relationship between size or number of beaver ponds and degree 
of downstream warming (McRae and Edwards 1994). They found that 
large ponds may act as thermal buffers, which dampen dailyﬂuctuations 
in water temperature and only slightly raise downstream temperatures. 
Thus, large-scale beaver dam removal in headwater streams may have 
net negative consequences on trout populations as their positive effects 
on invertebrates and ecosystem processes are lost. 
Beaver dams may be detrimental to populations of trout and salmon 
if they restrict or prevent ﬁsh passage. However, some studies have 
shown that trout can pass over dams during high water and may pass 
through newly constructed dams at any season (review by Olson and 
Hubert 1994). In the Paciﬁc Northwest, many beaver dams are par­
tially washed out each year by winter high water. However, dams can 
still beneﬁt ﬁsh that use the remaining ends for cover, thus providing 
value as coarse, woody debris. During summer low ﬂows in this area, 
beaver dams improved rearing habitat for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus 
kisutch), as beaver ponds were larger and contained more coho fry than 
pools without beaver (Leidholt-Bruner et al. 1992). 
Beaver activities can have profound effects on ﬁsh community 
structure. In an experimental study of a headwater stream in north­

Beaver activities can have profound effects on ﬁsh community 
structure. In an experimental study of a headwater stream in north­
ern Minnesota, beaver ponds appeared to act as reproductive “source” 
populations for ﬁsh, which dispersed to adjacent streams, which func­
tioned as reproductive “sinks” in the landscape. Thus, the boundary 
inﬂuences of beaver ponds were “critical in controlling ﬁsh dispersal 
between ponds and streams and the subsequent abundance and compo­
sition of ﬁsh in lotic ecosystems” (I. J. Schlosser 1995:908). The age 
and size of beaver ponds also affect stream dynamics. In Georgia, ﬁsh 
species richness per pond increased until ponds were 9 –17 years old 
and then decreased as ponds aged in headwater streams, but showed lit­
tle change relative to pond age in downstream sections (Snodgrass and 
Meffe 1998). In larger ponds, ﬁsh species shifted from lotic to lentic 
species, and larger predators replaced small-bodied minnows in older 
ponds. The size of beaver ponds is also important. As expected from 
general species–area relationships, ﬁsh species richness increases with 
size of pond, but very small beaver ponds can have higher than expected 
richness compared to ponds of a similar size not impounded by beaver 
(Keast and Fox 1990). Thus, beaver have a strong effect on ﬁsh species 
richness, but the effect is dependent on the size and age of beaver ponds 
and how ponds are distributed within the landscape.

(Keast and Fox 1990). Thus, beaver have a strong effect on ﬁsh species 
richness, but the effect is dependent on the size and age of beaver ponds 
and how ponds are distributed within the landscape. 
Effects of Beaver on V egetation. Beaver affect vegetation by building 
dams and removing woody plants as food and building material. Beaver 
dams raise the water table by creating a pond area that may be inundated 
by several meters of water and an umbrella-shaped zone of inﬂuence 
that radiates out from the pond, creating a new water table gradient 
controlled by soil texture and other factors. The soil behind dams can 
act like a sponge, retaining water during wetter months and slowly re­
leasing it during drier months. In areas of low or irregular precipitation, 
beaver dams may convert streams from intermittent ﬂow to perennial 
ﬂow. Changes in the amount, timing, or duration of available water can 
create a competitive advantage for many species of riparian–wetland 
plants, thus increasing their survival and dominance in the landscape. 
For example, in some western shrub–steppe ecosystems, beaver may 
help control invasive tamarisk by creating a competitive advantage for 
willow as dams alter hydrological and ecological conditions within in­
cised stream channels (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). Higher water tables 
caused by beaver ponds generally kill upland vegetation and promote 
establishment and growth of wetland vegetation.

low, cottonwood, and other riparian species. Sediment deposited behind

establishment and growth of wetland vegetation. 
Beaver can improve conditions for seedling establishment of wil­
low, cottonwood, and other riparian species. Sediment deposited behind 
beaver dams creates an ideal moist soil substrate, which can become 
exposed as water levels in the pond decrease due to a dam washout or 
other cause. Beaver cuttings may be an important mechanism of plant 
establishment for some woody species such as willow (Cottrell 1995). 
Stems that are cut by beaver but not eaten can become imbedded in 
dams, lodges, or moist soil in or near ponds and sprout adventitious 
roots and new stem growth. Because a high percentage of stem seg­
ments is not consumed by beaver, they may substantially contribute to 
plant establishment, although the relative importance of this method is 
not well understood at the community level. 
Cutting by beaver can stimulate vigorous resprouting, which may 
increase biomass production in many woody riparian species. Plants 
can sprout new shoots by activating dormant meristems located below 
the cut on the same stem or on below ground plant tissue, or from pre­
viously developed root suckers. In a study of red willow (S. lasiandra) 
in Oregon, trees that had a higher percentage of stems cut by beaver 
responded by producing a higher percentage of regrowth the follow­
ing season (Kindschy 1985). Where stem cutting is concentrated in 
late fall to build dams or prepare a food cache, plants are dormant 
when cut and respond with new shoots in the next spring in an attempt 
to recover former root:shoot ratios,

 higher percentage of stems cut by beaver 
responded by producing a higher percentage of regrowth the follow­
ing season (Kindschy 1985). Where stem cutting is concentrated in 
late fall to build dams or prepare a food cache, plants are dormant 
when cut and respond with new shoots in the next spring in an attempt 
to recover former root:shoot ratios, maximizing plant production and 
minimizing plant damage. Cutting by beaver can also stimulate plants to 
initiate growth earlier in the spring, further increasing stem production 
(Kindschy 1989). However, biomass of new shoots can be decreased if 
regrowth is browsed by native ungulates or livestock. 
The interaction of stem cutting by beaver and intense browsing by 
livestock or native ungulates can strongly suppress regrowth and may 
result in declining riparian plant communities. Summer browsing by 
livestock that congregate along riparian areas can be particularly detri­
mental to recovery of beaver-cut willow, when new green shoots become 
highly preferred as grasses cure and become less palatable (Kindschy 
1989). Intense browsing by native herbivores can also severely suppress 
regrowth of beaver-cut stems. When beaver cut tall stems, regrowth oc­
curs at or near ground level, placing the apical portions of stems within 
easy reach of herbivores. Browsing the tips of stems (leaders) releases 
apical dominance and may cause plants to develop a short stature. In 
an experimental study at Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, in­
tense elk (Cervus elaphus) browsing of willow (S. monticola) regrowth

an experimental study at Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, in­
tense elk (Cervus elaphus) browsing of willow (S. monticola) regrowth 
during 3 years following simulated beaver cutting produced plants of 
low vigor, which were small, short, and hedged with a high percentage 
of dead stems (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). In contrast, regrowth of 
unbrowsed plants was vigorous, large, tall, highly branched, and leafy 
with a low percentage of dead stems. Browsed and unbrowsed plants re­
covered more stems per plant (about 70 after 3 years) than were present 
before simulated beaver cutting, but elk browsing strongly suppressed 
recovery of plant biomass. After 2 years of regrowth, browsed plants 
had recovered only 6% of their precut biomass, whereas unbrowsed 
plants had recovered 84%. Thus, beaver cutting and elk browsing may 
interact to decrease woody plant height and biomass, eventually re­
ducing beaver habitat suitability and the positive effects of beaver on 
community structure and function. 
Foraging by beaver can signiﬁcantly alter forest composition and 
plant succession. Besides humans, beaver are the only species in 
North America that can affect overstory vegetation by felling mature 
trees (Johnston and Naiman 1990b). In contrast to many other herbi­
vores, beaver foraging is restricted to a central place within riparian

communities where their habit of felling much more woody material 
than they actually consume dramatically increases the magnitude of 
their effects relative to other woody-plant foragers. In a Minnesota 
study, intense foraging by beaver decreased tree density and basal area 
by up to 43% near ponds, where individual beaver harvested an average 
of 1400 kg/ha/year of woody biomass over a 6-year period (Johnston 
and Naiman 1990b). Selective foraging decreased aspen and increased 
alder and conifer, with long-term effects on forest succession. In Wis­
consin, beaver substantially reduced the density of preferred understory 
tree species (W . J. Barnes and Dibble 1988). Because understory species 
normally replace overstory species in areas without beaver, it was pre­
dicted that selective foraging by beaver strongly altered riparian forest 
succession. Donkor and Fryxell (1999) also found that the foraging ac­
tivity of beaver altered forest succession by replacing deciduous species 
with conifers. They suggested this detracted from the keystone role of 
the beaver because the already dominant conifer community was in­
creased. 
Woody plant communities along major river systems can also be

creased. 
Woody plant communities along major river systems can also be 
affected by the foraging behavior of beaver. In rivers too large for beaver 
to dam, bank-dwelling beaver can have signiﬁcant effects on the struc­
ture of woody riparian vegetation. Regulation of rivers by major dams 
can modify the effects of beaver as peak ﬂows are decreased and base 
ﬂows are increased, which affects growth of woody vegetation and its 
use by beaver. In a comparative study of the unregulated Y ampa River 
and the regulated Green River in northwestern Colorado, Breck (2001) 
found that beaver harvested a higher percentage of willow and cotton­
wood on the regulated river, where the constant ﬂow regime caused 
vegetation patches to be more uniformly available to beaver. In the un­
regulated river, shifting channels constantly changed access to shoreline 
vegetation. 
Abandonment of beaver ponds creates new habitat for plant es­
tablishment. Beaver meadows dominated by grasses and sedges often 
develop on the rich sediment that settles in beaver ponds. Meadows 
may eventually be replaced by forests, but in some cases succession is 
slower than expected. In northern forests, beaver meadows may resist 
invasion by conifers and persist for many decades as graminoid mead­
ows (Terwilliger and Pastor 1999). Successful conifer (Abies, Picea) 
invasion requires the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form 
an obligate association with tree roots. Because past ﬂ

aver meadows may resist 
invasion by conifers and persist for many decades as graminoid mead­
ows (Terwilliger and Pastor 1999). Successful conifer (Abies, Picea) 
invasion requires the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form 
an obligate association with tree roots. Because past ﬂooding would 
have killed these necessary fungi, beaver meadows require dispersal of 
fungi from nearby forest soils before conifers can invade. One possible 
mechanism of ectomycorrhizal fungi dispersal is via small-mammal 
feces. However, an evaluation of the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys 
gapperi) as a vector showed only about one third of plants grown in 
beaver meadow soils inoculated with vole feces had ectomycorrhizae 
present, compared to 100% of plants grown in forest soil. In addition, 
the potential of red-backed voles to facilitate dispersal of fungi is limited 
by their general avoidance of beaver meadows (Terwilliger and Pastor 
1999). Thus, persistence of beaver meadows in forest communities may 
be controlled by complex ecological mechanisms. 
Effects of Beaver on Mammals. A variety of mammals use the lush 
vegetation around beaver ponds as food and cover or rely on beaver 
to provide aquatic habitat (review by Olson and Hubert 1994). Beaver 
ponds are often important habitat for moose (Alces alces) because they 
increase production of woody plants and aquatic vegetation, which can 
contribute substantially to their total diet. In some cases, moose may 
compete with beaver for limited food supplies; however, the extent of

ponds are often important habitat for moose (Alces alces) because they 
increase production of woody plants and aquatic vegetation, which can 
contribute substantially to their total diet. In some cases, moose may 
compete with beaver for limited food supplies; however, the extent of 
their interaction and its effect on riparian vegetation are not well under­
stood. Elk and deer can also be attracted to the increased abundance, 
palatability, or availability of woody and herbaceous forage at beaver 
ponds. Beaver ponds also create habitat for other semiaquatic mammals, 
such as river otter, mink, and muskrat, some of which may occur in a 
large percentage of active or abandoned ponds. In Idaho, the density and 
standing crop biomass of small-mammal populations was two to three 
times higher in willow-dominated beaver pond habitat than in adjacent 
riparian habitat (Medin and Clary 1991). Montane voles (M. montanus) 
and shrews (Sorex spp.) were the most abundant small mammals in the 
beaver pond habitat, and their populations accounted for most of the 
differences. However, neither species richness nor species diversity of 
small mammals was inﬂuenced by beaver in this study. 
Effects of Beaver on Reptiles and Amphibians. Beaver ponds and 
associated riparian habitat likely alter the species composition and abun­
dance of regional herpetofauna throughout the range of beaver. How­
ever, few studies have quantiﬁed these effects and some conclusions 
have been equivocal. For example, Russell et al. (1999) compared new

ever, few studies have quantiﬁed these effects and some conclusions 
have been equivocal. For example, Russell et al. (1999) compared new 
(<5 years) and old (>10 years) beaver ponds to unimpounded streams 
in South Carolina. They found that richness and abundance did not dif­
fer among sites for amphibians, but both were higher for reptiles at the 
older beaver ponds than at new ponds or unimpounded streams. Reptile 
species diversity was highest at old ponds, intermediate at new ponds, 
and lowest at unimpounded sites. They suggested that beaver have gen­
erally beneﬁted herpetofauna in the Piedmont of South Carolina, as the 
range of several species, such as common musk turtle (Sternotherus 
odoratus) and eastern mud turtle ( Kinosternon subrubrum), has in­
creased concurrent with the range expansion of beaver. 
Effects of Beaver on Birds. Waterfowl use beaver ponds for nesting 
and brood-rearing habitat and as stopover sites during migration. Beaver 
ponds enhance vegetation growth, which improves dense nesting cover 
and enhances interspersion of cover and water, improving nest isola­
tion for territorial waterfowl pairs and increasing nest density (review 
by McCall et al. 1996). When beaver pondsﬂood timber, dead trees pro­
vide nesting sites for waterfowl (cavity nesters) that are relatively safe 
from predators. Beaver ponds increase the production of invertebrates

vide nesting sites for waterfowl (cavity nesters) that are relatively safe 
from predators. Beaver ponds increase the production of invertebrates 
and aquatic vegetation, which improves brood-rearing habitat. The ben­
eﬁts of beaver ponds to waterfowl may be expressed by increased 
production of waterfowl as regional beaver populations increase. For 
example, when beaver populations in south-central Maine increased in 
the 3–4 years following a trapping closure, density of Canada geese 
(Branta canadensis), hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus), and 
mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) also increased, as did the number of 
wetlands used by these species (McCall et al. 1996). Waterfowl in Fin­
land also responded positively to increasing beaver populations, but 
response varied by species. Teal (Anas crecca, the European race of the 
green-winged teal) increased to become the dominant species during 
the ﬁrst 2 years following ﬂooding by beaver, but populations of mal­
lards and wigeon (Anas penelope) did not respond (Nummi and Poysa 
1997). 
Beaver ponds can be preferred to similar open-water wetlands by 
breeding waterfowl. In Ontario, open-water lakes made up 47% of the 
study area, but were avoided by blue-winged teal (Anas discors), mal­
lards, and wood duck (Aix sponsa). However, beaver ponds constituted

Beaver ponds can be preferred to similar open-water wetlands by 
breeding waterfowl. In Ontario, open-water lakes made up 47% of the 
study area, but were avoided by blue-winged teal (Anas discors), mal­
lards, and wood duck (Aix sponsa). However, beaver ponds constituted 
only 25% of the area and were preferred by wood ducks (Merendino 
et al. 1995). Preference for beaver ponds may be due to their increased 
production of invertebrates important to waterfowl broods. For exam­
ple, populations of water ﬂeas (Cladocera spp.), a small invertebrate 
preferred by young ducklings, were abundant inﬁrst-year beaver ponds, 
with populations of larger invertebrates more important in 2- and 3-year-
old ponds (Nummi 1992). Beaver ponds substantially enhance water­
fowl habitat in the western United States, where riparian areas constitute 
<2% of the landscape. Breeding waterfowl surveys in Wyoming found 
that streams with beaver ponds had 7.5 ducks/km, but similar streams 
without beaver ponds had only 0.1 duck/km (McKinstry et al. 2001). A 
survey of 125 land managers found that beaver had been removed from 
23% of 28,297 km of Wyoming streams and that >3500 km of streams 
without beaver had potential for beaver reintroduction to improve water­
fowl nesting habitat (McKinstry et al. 2001). Finally, beaver ponds can 
be highly important for migrating waterfowl throughout North America 
and for wintering waterfowl in ice-free southern regions (Ringelman 
1991).

In addition to waterfowl, a variety of other bird species bene ﬁt 
from beaver activity. Beaver ponds can increase the area of open wa­
ter, length of the shoreline, density of dead standing trees, and biomass, 
height, and canopy cover of shrubs. The abundance and diversity of ter­
restrial insects important to foraging birds are enhanced by changes in

riparian and aquatic vegetation and availability of standing water for lar­
val development. These habitat changes may dramatically increase bird 
species richness, diversity, and abundance (Krueger 1985; Medin and 
Clary 1990). Active beaver sites contained 92% of 106 bird species ob­
served in 70 New Y ork wetlands (Grover and Baldassarre 1995). Beaver 
sites also were important habitat for red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius 
phoeniceus), Brewer’s blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus), common 
snipe (Gallinago gallinago), and spotted sandpipers ( Actitis hypoleu­

were an important avian habitat in all seasons, but reached maximum 
bird diversity in spring and summer and maximum number of indi­
viduals (all bird species combined) during fall migration (Reese and 
Hair 1976). Beaver ponds are especially important in arid environments, 
where riparian–wetland habitat provides an oasis for birds. Any increase 
in area or structural complexity of riparian vegetation usually beneﬁts 
the avian community. 
ECONOMIC STATUS, MANAGEMENT, 
AND CONSERV ATION 
Economic V alue. The ecological role of beaver discussed in the previ­
ous section has tremendous indirect economic beneﬁt through wetland 
creation, water storage, improved water quality, erosion control, sedi­
ment deposition, and recreation. These indirect beneﬁts may far out­
weigh the direct monetary value obtained from their fur, and may offset 
any direct or indirect costs due to beaver damage. However, because 
the monetary value of these indirect ecological beneﬁts has not been 
quantiﬁed, fur trapping and damage control are typically considered of 
primary economic importance. 
Native Americans valued beaver for food and clothing and early 
Europeans valued the underfur of beaver pelts for the manufacture of felt 
hats. In 1610, France granted Samuel de Champlain the ﬁrst fur-trading

Native Americans valued beaver for food and clothing and early 
Europeans valued the underfur of beaver pelts for the manufacture of felt 
hats. In 1610, France granted Samuel de Champlain the ﬁrst fur-trading 
monopoly in North America, initiating 200 years of intensive beaver 
trapping, which continued until the early 1900s, when beaver popula­
tions had been nearly extirpated and demand for felt hats had declined 
(reviews by Hill 1982; Hill and Novakowski 1984; Novak 1987). Since 
then, strict harvest regulations, reintroduction programs, and cutting 
and burning of climax boreal forests (setting back succession) have 
greatly beneﬁted beaver populations. Annual harvests during the 1980s 
sometimes exceeded 1 million beaver pelts, more than recorded at any 
other time (Novak 1987). Although beaver trapping is still an impor­
tant part of the fur industry in Canada and the United States, erratic 
and relatively low pelt prices have caused the economic importance of 
trapping beaver (numbers marketed and value of pelts) to decline rel­
ative to furbearers such as red fox (Vulpes vulpes), mink, and several 
other species (Hill and Novakowski 1984; Novak 1987). In addition, the 
value of beaver pelts varies by region, with those from warmer south­
ern climates valued lower and those of colder northern climates valued 
higher. Pelt prices are a primary incentive for most trappers. Prices in­

ﬂuence annual harvest levels and the ability of resource managers to use 
recreational trapping as a tool to reduce beaver populations or remove 
unwanted individuals. 
Strict trapping regulations or trapping bans can limit beaver trap­
ping as a management tool. In recent years, recreational trapping has 
been the target of animal rights groups, which have successfully used the 
public initiative/ballot referendum process in some states (e.g., Amend­
ment 14 in Colorado, November 1996) to eliminate or severely curtail 
trapping of furbearers. The long-term implications of trapping bans on 
beaver populations in these areas remain to be determined. One possi­
ble outcome may be that in some areas where private landowners once 
considered beaver a valuable fur resource they may instead be viewed 
as a pest species, with negative consequences to populations (Hill 
1982). Regulations that control or ban recreational trapping in many 
jurisdictions do not apply to landowners who are protecting private 
property. 
Beaver Damage. Expanding populations of humans and beaver in­
evitably lead to property damage. From the point of view of a landowner 
or other person experiencing damage, the cause is “nuisance beaver”; 
however, from the point of view of a beaver or some concerned citizens, 
the cause is “nuisance people.” From either view, beaver damage can 
be prevalent, severe, and costly.

 view of a beaver or some concerned citizens, 
the cause is “nuisance people.” From either view, beaver damage can 
be prevalent, severe, and costly. 
Beaver damage varies by type, magnitude, and region. Common 
complaints regarding beaver damage include ﬂooding of roads (often 
by plugging culverts) and pastures, eating orﬂooding agricultural crops 
(e.g., corn), damage to timber by ﬂooding and cutting (mainly in the 
relativelyﬂat Southeast), burrowing damage to dikes, ditches, and dams 
(mainly the arid West), cutting or ﬂooding ornamental plants around 
homes or businesses, ﬂooding habitat of rare plants or animals, dam­
aging wild trout habitat, damaging ﬁsh ponds by plugging the over­
ﬂow pipe, and potentially increasing the risk of human infection via 
Giardia lamblia, although some data suggest this is unlikely (Hill 1982; 
Woodward et al. 1985; Hammerson 1994; Olson and Hubert 1994). An­
nual cost of damage can be very high. In the early 1980s, annual beaver 
damage in the United States was estimated at $75–100 million; in the 
Southeast, the 40-year cumulative damage was estimated at $4 billion 
(review by Novak 1987). 
The importance of timber damage in the southeastern states was 
recognized soon after beaver were reintroduced; timber damage there 
far exceeds all other types of complaints (review by Hill 1982). Timber 
damage was reported by 67% of respondents to landowner question­
naires in Alabama (Hill 1976). In South Carolina, a 1984 survey showed

The importance of timber damage in the southeastern states was 
recognized soon after beaver were reintroduced; timber damage there 
far exceeds all other types of complaints (review by Hill 1982). Timber 
damage was reported by 67% of respondents to landowner question­
naires in Alabama (Hill 1976). In South Carolina, a 1984 survey showed 
beaver ﬂooded >35,000 ha of timber, often ﬂooding trees during the 
entire growing season with low dams <0.5 m high (Woodward et al. 
1985). If the root systems remain inundated for one to two growing 
seasons, many species of tree usually will die. Beaver kill timber of all 
size classes, with loss of larger trees causing greater ﬁnancial impact 
on producers. Beaver frequently gnaw bark from hardwoods, which 
increases the risk of disease and subsequent rotting. 
Damage Control. Killing unwanted individual beavers and controlled 
harvests of beaver populations are the most common, and often the 
most effective, methods of reducing beaver damage, even though lethal 
control is becoming increasingly less acceptable to the public. In Mis­
sissippi, about 20,000 beaver are harvested annually, with 80% of the 
carcasses discarded without use of meat or fur (Schulte and Muller-
Schwarze 1999). Nonetheless, annual harvest may be the most prudent 
approach to animal damage problems, particularly where such harvest 
can involve citizen participants with no resultant public expense (Hill 
1974, 1976). Trapping techniques for taking beaver vary with trapper 
preference and climatic conditions, the greatest differences occurring 
between areas that have extremely thick ice and those that are ice free.

preference and climatic conditions, the greatest differences occurring 
between areas that have extremely thick ice and those that are ice free. 
Successful harvest techniques involve shooting, snaring, and trapping 
with either No. 3 or No. 4 leghold traps or No. 330 Conibear traps (Hill 
1982; Miller and Y arrow 1994). Shooting beaver from boats or from 
land may or may not be an effective control method (Hill 1982; Olson 
and Hubert 1994) and raises signiﬁcant safety concerns. Alligators (Al­
ligator mississippiensis) have been evaluated as a control method in 
the Southeast, but are generally not effective (Hill 1982). Poison bait 
substances, such as strychnine alkaloid baits and compound 1080, have 
been evaluated as a lethal control method, but are not approved for this 
purpose. They also pose political and practical problems, which will 
likely preclude their development (Hill 1982; Hammerson 1994). Thus, 
if the decision is to kill problem beaver, then trapping likely remains 
the most effective method. 
However, trapping beaver can be an ineffective control measure if 
landowners create a sink population by trapping beaver from their own 
land but fail to reach consensus for control among adjacent landown­
ers containing a source population of beaver. Even when consensus 
for control is reached, migration of beaver from less-controlled sites to 
more-controlled sites imposes an external cost (negative diffusion ex­
ternality) when landowners must incur the future cost of repeated trap­
ping (Bhat et al

for control is reached, migration of beaver from less-controlled sites to 
more-controlled sites imposes an external cost (negative diffusion ex­
ternality) when landowners must incur the future cost of repeated trap­
ping (Bhat et al. 1993). When attempting to minimize beaver damage to 
timber resources, the cost of trapping must be weighed against the ben­
eﬁt of increased timber production. Integrating a trapping plan with a 
timber plan via a cost-minimizing, area-wide bioeconomic model may

help strike the optimal balance between timber damage and trapping 
costs and maintain a more even density and distribution of beaver in 
the management area (Bhat et al. 1993). 
Timing of trapping is also important where inundation of timber is 
the primary problem. In this case, it may be most effective to eradicate 
problem beaver colonies by the end of May and continue to remove im­
migrants from June to September, or until dispersal rates are relatively 
low (Houston et al. 1995). In some cases, trees may tolerate relatively 
high levels of beaver damage without any major effect on the forest. In 
a study of beaver damage to bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) trees 
in Texas, 85% of the trees near lodges had their bark peeled by beaver 
with only minimal effects on tree survival (King et al. 1998). Thus,

with only minimal effects on tree survival (King et al. 1998). Thus, 
managing timber damage requires understanding the response of the 
particular tree species to foraging and ﬂooding by beaver, gaining co­
operation of all landowners within the affected area, and evaluating 
costs and beneﬁts of beaver control relative to timber production. 
Livetrapping and relocation of problem beaver is more acceptable 
to the general public and has become fairly popular in urban areas. 
However, this can be cost prohibitive without volunteer labor and is 
not an option if suitable relocation sites are not available (Hammerson 
1994). Moreover, released beaver may suffer high mortality from pre­
dation or from their inability to successfully assimilate into established 
populations. Hancock traps are usually preferred to Bailey traps for 
removing problem beaver, although properly used snares may be more 
effective and less costly than either trap type (Hill 1982; Novak 1987; 
Hammerson 1994; McKinstry and Anderson 1998). In some situations, 
hand-held nets can help capture beaver on land or in shallow water from 
boats (Rosell and Hovde 2001). Chemosterilents and surgical steriliza­
tion also have been evaluated for beaver control, but remain impractical 
for treating wild populations (reviews by Hill 1982; Hammerson 1994).

Beaver repellents or wire fencing may be an effective means of 
protecting plants from cutting or discouraging beaver occupancy of se­
lected sites. Tree trunks can be protected by hardware cloth, chain link, 
or similar wire mesh connected at the ends (leaving room to allow tree 
growth) and extending about 1 m above the ground (Hammerson 1994). 
A solution of 10% creosote and 90% diesel fuel sprayed or painted on 
tree trunks reduces gnawing damage by beaver, as does a mixture of 
acrylic paint and sand, which acts as an unpalatable abrasive. Com­
mercial deer repellents (Thiram, Magic Circle) may also be effective 
chemical repellents (Hammerson 1994). Chemical extracts from native 
tree species that beaver avoid (Jeffery pine) also may be effective as a 
beaver repellent (Basey 1999). Marking areas with beaver scent (artiﬁ­
cial scent mounds) may discourage occupancy in the short term, but this 
method is likely an ineffective long-term solution. Scent marking by 
beaver more likely acts as a form of territoriality rather than as a scent 
fence (Welsh and Muller-Schwarze 1989; Sun and Muller-Schwarze 
1998; Schulte and Muller-Schwarze 1999).

1998; Schulte and Muller-Schwarze 1999). 
Flooding by beaver can often be prevented or managed by instal­
lation of beaver-proof road culverts and other water control structures 
or by installation of ﬂow control devices in existing beaver dams (Fig. 
15.3). Damage occurs when beavers plug culverts or impound water 
against the beds of roads or railroads, causing ﬂooding or washouts. 
Techniques for minimizing or preventing beaver from plugging road 
culverts include using oversized pipe-arch culverts (Fig. 15.3A), low-
proﬁle box culverts (Fig. 15.3B), and various designs of beaver exclo­
sure fencing (Fig. 15.3C) which prevent beaver from building a dam 
at the upstream end of a road culvert (Buech 1985; Hammerson 1994; 
Olson and Hubert 1994; Jensen et al. 1999; S. Lisle, oral communica­
tion, Beaver and Common-Sense Conﬂict Solutions Conference, 1999). 
In most cases, preventing damage with proper culvert design is far more 
cost-effective than the repeated, labor-intensive unplugging of dammed 
culverts or removing unwanted beaver (Jensen et al. 1999). Flow con­
trol devices installed in existing beaver dams have been very effective 
at mitigating damage to roads or other developments while maintaining 
the ecological and esthetic values of beaver presence. For example, the 
Clemson beaver pond leveler (Fig. 15.3D) can control the water level in 
beaver ponds by using tubes or similar structures laid perpendicular to 
the dam with the upstream end porous and protected from plugging

at mitigating damage to roads or other developments while maintaining 
the ecological and esthetic values of beaver presence. For example, the 
Clemson beaver pond leveler (Fig. 15.3D) can control the water level in 
beaver ponds by using tubes or similar structures laid perpendicular to 
the dam with the upstream end porous and protected from plugging by 
beaver (Buech 1985; Hammerson 1994; Olson and Hubert 1994). The 
most widely used method to control ﬂooding is to dynamite or other­
wise remove problem beaver dams. However, this method is usually the 
least effective because beaver will often rebuild dams within a few days 
if building materials are still available. Altering habitat to make sites 
unsuitable to beaver may be possible in some cases, but may require 
habitat changes that are unacceptable to landowners. 
Methods for controlling beaver or their damage often require spe­
cial training, materials, and permits. State and local regulations should 
be consulted before attempting to control populations or to mitigate 
damage, such as by installing water control structures that affect in-
stream ﬂow. 
Public Opinion. Public opinion is an important consideration when 
choosing methods to control beaver damage. Many people have an 
emotional attachment to beaver and are vehemently opposed to any 
control methods that may cause their pain, suffering, or death. However, 
attitudes toward beaver control methods vary greatly among individ­
uals, communities, regions, and type of land tenure. Rural residents, 
especially in agricultural areas, may have less opposition to lethal con­
trol than urban residents. People who experience beaver problems may 
accept harsher control than those without problems. Cultural values

attitudes toward beaver control methods vary greatly among individ­
uals, communities, regions, and type of land tenure. Rural residents, 
especially in agricultural areas, may have less opposition to lethal con­
trol than urban residents. People who experience beaver problems may 
accept harsher control than those without problems. Cultural values 
attributed to the presence of beaver also vary by region. Beaver may 
be more socially and economically valued in regions of Canada and 
the northern United States than in the Southeast, where fur values are 
lower, damage to timber and development is more severe, and beaver 
have less historical and cultural value. 
Social acceptability of beaver control depends on many factors. 
Residents in suburban areas of New Y ork were willing to accept increas­
ingly invasive control when they had increasingly severe concerns about 
problems (Loker et al. 1999). Contrary to predictions, residents were 
willing to use more severe control measures for nuisance and economic 
damage problems than for concerns about public health and safety (re­
sults combined for white-tailed deer, Canada geese, and beaver). In 
another New Y ork survey, nearly 50% of stakeholders took lethal ac­
tions to solve beaver problems; highway superintendents were more 
likely than the general public to attempt to solve beaver problems and 
to use actions that were nonlethal but invasive (Enck et al. 1997). In 
Wyoming, managers of private and public lands were concerned that 
beaver caused problems when they blocked irrigation ditches, girdled 
timber, blocked culverts, andﬂooded pastures, roads, crops, and timber.

Population and Harvest Management. Do beaver populations“need” 
to be harvested so they do not“eat themselves out of house and home ?” 
This management philosophy is pervasive in the culture of laypeople 
and professional wildlife managers. But is it true ? Why would beaver 
need the help of humans to control their populations, whereas nongame 
mammals seem to manage just ﬁne without it (aside from pervasive 
anthropogenic stressors) ? How does the absence of wolves or other 
predators affect beaver carrying capacity ? Clearly, answers to these 
questions are beyond the scope of this chapter, but recent evidence 
provides some interesting discussion points. For example, densities of 
beaver colonies did not differ in a comparison of unexploited, saturated 
populations and exploited, thinned-out populations. Beaver in the sat­
urated populations, however, colonized steeper gradients, had families 
with a larger percentage of 3-year-olds, depleted preferred trees and 
fed on less palatable species, and extended trails to more distant forag­
ing sites (Muller-Schwarze and Schulte 1999). Because the maximum 
density of colonies (usually a minimum distance of about 0.9 km be­
tween colonies) may be controlled by territorial behavior rather than

 3-year-olds, depleted preferred trees and 
fed on less palatable species, and extended trails to more distant forag­
ing sites (Muller-Schwarze and Schulte 1999). Because the maximum 
density of colonies (usually a minimum distance of about 0.9 km be­
tween colonies) may be controlled by territorial behavior rather than 
by habitat conditions, beaver populations in optimum habitat may be­
come saturated or self-limiting below habitat-based carrying capacity. 
Beaver typically maintain intercolony distances and body weight re­
gardless of population density. In some areas, forage near the central 
place may become temporarily depleted or ponds may become silted-in, 
causing colonies to periodically move to former beaver habitat that has

nitely within the same stream reach. In the Rocky Mountains, beaver 
may temporarily abandon mixed aspen–conifer sites after removing 
available aspen from nearby uplands, but may indeﬁnitely occupy 
riparian–willow sites, where dams create moist, bare soil and a high 
water table, which helps establish and perpetuate the willow commu­
nity. Despite lack of any inherent control needs, beaver harvest pro­
vides valuable recreational and income opportunities for trappers and 
is the primary means of reducing beaver damage to timber and other 
resources. Thus, justiﬁcation for beaver harvest should be based on 
the economic value of fur trapping or “managerial decisions [that] ad­
dress conﬂicts between beaver and humans, and not necessarily any 
requirements of the beaver themselves” (Muller-Schwarze and Schulte 
1999:176). 
Beaver populations are managed by state, provincial, and territo­
rial wildlife agencies in the United States and Canada. Agencies are 
responsible for setting seasons, setting bag limits or area-speciﬁc quo­
tas, licensing trappers, stamping or tagging pelts, licensing fur dealers 
and auction houses, and enforcing laws and regulations (Novak 1987). 
Trapper education is an important part of beaver management. Trap­

Trapper education is an important part of beaver management. Trap­
pers in the ﬁeld inﬂuence the age, sex, and distribution of animals 
removed as they make decisions about how, when, and where to set and 
check traps. Harvest rates, or quotas, are based on allowable harvest 
to maintain sustained yield. Rates suggested by different studies have 
varied from 10% to 70%, depending on habitat type, elevation, and 
region. The most typical recommended annual harvest rate is 20–30% 
of the population, which is about 1.0 –1.5 beaver/colony/year. Beaver 
are highly vulnerable to overharvest, so managers must closely mon­
itor populations. Their slow rate of reproduction and delayed sexual 
maturity preclude reproduction as a means to offset intensive annual 
harvest. 
Regional differences among habitat types and land management 
prescriptions warrant regional beaver management plans (Snodgrass 
1997). Managing beaver by managing their food supply may be possible 
in some regions. For example, prescribed burning may encourage aspen 
production in mixed conifer habitat, but may be of limited value where 
multiple forage species are available. 
Using Beaver for Habitat Restoration and Improvement. The abil­
ity of beaver to store water, trap sediment, reduce channel erosion, 
and enhance establishment and production of riparian vegetation can 
be used as a proactive management tool to restore degraded riparian 
habitat. Beaver were abundant in forested, shrub–steppe, and some hot 
desert habitats in the western United States until fur trapping deci­
mated populations. Ranchers followed trappers in settlement of the

habitat. Beaver were abundant in forested, shrub–steppe, and some hot 
desert habitats in the western United States until fur trapping deci­
mated populations. Ranchers followed trappers in settlement of the 
West, and immense numbers of sheep and cattle subjected newly beaver-
free riparian areas to intense overgrazing. Overgrazing stripped stream-
banks of soil-binding vegetation, and channels responded with accel­
erated erosion and severe downcutting (see Elliott et al. [1999] for a 
discussion of possible mechanisms to explain observed channel inci­
sion). Mechanical restoration and revegetation (willow, cottonwood) 
of incised channels can be expensive, labor-intensive, and often

unsuccessful. Thus, natural restoration of riparian systems can be an 
attractive alternative. 
Reintroduction of beaver into degraded riparian systems has shown 
promise as a restoration tool, even where willow or other suitable winter 
food may be lacking (Fig. 15.4). Livestock grazing must be managed be­
fore beaver reintroduction to allow development of an adequate biomass 
of herbaceous aquatic and riparian vegetation for summer beaver food 
and to permit establishment and growth of willow or other woody ri­
parian vegetation for winter beaver food. Aspen, cottonwood, or willow 
can be provided at reintroduction sites, or where beaver have initiated 
dam building on their own, to encourage beaver to remain at the site 
and to provide them with stronger dam-building material, which might

 and growth of willow or other woody ri­
parian vegetation for winter beaver food. Aspen, cottonwood, or willow 
can be provided at reintroduction sites, or where beaver have initiated 
dam building on their own, to encourage beaver to remain at the site 
and to provide them with stronger dam-building material, which might 
otherwise be lacking (Apple et al. 1985). In some cases where over­
winter food is lacking, beaver may subsist on herbaceous vegetation 
long enough to build dams and ponds. These features may initiate a 
positive riparian response, which stimulates growth of willow or other 
woody vegetation suitable as winter food. A winter food cache provides 
beaver with more permanent habitat and the ability to successfully raise 
young. Thus, beaver can create a positive feedback mechanism by tem­
porarily expanding into marginal habitat (naturally or by introduction), 
improving conditions for the establishment and survival of woody ri­
parian vegetation, and persisting long enough to raise young, which can 
disperse to new marginal habitat. 
Beaver restoration in western riparian areas may also help control 
tamarisk, an invasive woody species (Fig. 15.4). In northwestern Col­
orado, beaver used tamarisk, sagebrush, and greasewood ( Sarcobatus 
vermiculatus) as building material for a series of dams, which coincided 
with increase in the distribution and abundance of coyote willow (S. ex­
igua) relative to tamarisk (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). A similar 
response was observed on the Zuni Indian Reservation in New Mexico 
following the relocation of 23 beaver to seven restoration sites (Albert 
and Trimble 2000).

 which coincided

igua) relative to tamarisk (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). A similar 
response was observed on the Zuni Indian Reservation in New Mexico 
following the relocation of 23 beaver to seven restoration sites (Albert 
and Trimble 2000). As beaver selectively cut vegetation and impound 
water and sediment behind dams, they alter conditions driving estab­
lishment and survival in riparian plant communities. Thus, beaver may 
create a competitive advantage for willow relative to tamarisk in some 
riparian systems, although speciﬁc mechanisms need further study at 
various spatial and temporal scales (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). 
Beaver have also been useful as a timber management tool in the 
southeastern United States. Flooding by beaver ponds kills existing 
noncommercial vegetation, thus preparing sites for reforestation with 
commercially valuable timber. By draining ponds and removing beaver, 
landowners can reduce the cost of clearing land, often a major compo­
nent of timber production (Houston et al. 1992). 
Population Estimation. Population density of beaver is usually ex­
pressed as number of colonies or individuals in areal or linear units. 
Areal estimates are more appropriate where wetlands are diffuse and 
linear estimates are better where beaver habitat is limited to well-
deﬁned watercourses. Estimates of number of individuals are often 
derived from colony counts, but are not meaningful unless the mean 
number of beaver per colony is based on local data and not the gen­
eral literature. Multiplying number of colonies by the general average 
of 5 or 6 beaver per colony only adds false precision to population

deﬁned watercourses. Estimates of number of individuals are often 
derived from colony counts, but are not meaningful unless the mean 
number of beaver per colony is based on local data and not the gen­
eral literature. Multiplying number of colonies by the general average 
of 5 or 6 beaver per colony only adds false precision to population 
estimates. 
Estimates of mean colony size are very dif ﬁcult to obtain and 
vary temporally and spatially, but are important in setting harvest quo­
tas (Novak 1987). Colony size can be estimated by using night-vision 
scopes to count beaver as they move about their territory, driving beaver 
from their lodges using smoke or dogs, draining the pond and disman­
tling the lodge (not recommended), attempting to trap all the beaver in a 
colony (difﬁcult to accomplish, thus a conservative estimate), and em­
ploying models that use age and reproductive data from populations of 
trapped beaver (Novak 1987) or data on the interactions among natality, 
mortality, and dispersal (Bishir et al. 1983). 
Size of the food cache may be a useful predictor of colony size, but 
more research is needed to better understand relationships, as studies in 
different regions have been equivocal. In Montana, aerial cache surveys 
of prairie rivers located about 90% of caches, but colony size varied 
among years and areas. Thus, cache counts alone are not good predictors 
of population size or trend (Swenson et al. 1983). Estimates of cache size 
were a signiﬁcant predictor of colony size in a Montana study (Easter-
Pilcher 1990). This was not the case in

were a signiﬁcant predictor of colony size in a Montana study (Easter-
Pilcher 1990). This was not the case in a Wyoming study, however, 
perhaps due to variation in cache-building behavior among different 
age cohorts (Osmundson and Buskirk 1993).

Aerial surveys have been widely used to estimate the size and 
distribution of beaver populations, but evaluations of their ef ﬁciency, 
accuracy, and precision in terms of costs and beneﬁts suggest their value 
is highly variable (Novak 1987). Surveys are usually conducted in the 
fall after leaf drop but before freeze-up. Results depend on search meth­
ods, topography, overstory vegetation, type of aircraft, and behavior of 
beaver (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). For example, aerial sur­
veys only located 41 of 146 ground-located beaver colonies in Kansas

veys only located 41 of 146 ground-located beaver colonies in Kansas 
riverine habitat, where beaver lived in bank dens and did not build food 
caches (Robel and Fox 1993). 
Various combinations of aerial photography, aerial videography, 
and geographic information systems (GIS) can also be used to survey 
beaver populations and evaluate habitat conditions. Aerial photographs 
can be used as a reconnaissance aid to locate beaver habitat in remote 
locations for later ground or aerial survey; to map locations of dams, 
ponds, and lodges via photointerpretation methods; to ﬁnd and/or plot 
colony locations during ground surveys (<1:3000-scale best); and to 
create overlays of beaver colony locations and habitat features that can 
be digitized into a GIS (Parsons and Brown 1978; Novak 1987; Baker 
et al. 1992; Werth and Boyd 1997). A GIS is essential for some types of 
landscape-level analysis of beaver habitat and may be better than man­
ual methods for others, depending on costs and technical requirements 
(Johnston and Naiman 1990c). Global positioning systems (GPS) al­
low users to plot exact locations of active or inactive lodges and dens, 
which can be integrated with GIS systems to develop highly accurate 
beaver habitat models or monitoring programs. Aerial videography via

itoring beaver populations, especially in meandering riparian systems

a helicopter-mounted video camera may be useful for locating and mon­
itoring beaver populations, especially in meandering riparian systems 
that are difﬁcult to observe from low-level, ﬁxed-winged aircraft (B. W . 
Baker, pers. obs.). Video has the advantage of instant availability on 
return from the ﬂight and can be integrated with on-board GPS systems 
to create georeferenced data for computer analysis; however, videogra­
phy is less useful than aerial photography for creating images for use 
in the ﬁeld. 
Sex Determination. Sex of beaver carcasses can be determined by the 
presence of the baculum and testes in males and the uterus in females, 
but the lack of any obvious external sex characteristics makes sex de­
termination in live animals difﬁcult (Novak 1987). The sex of live adult 
beaver can be determined by probing the cloaca or palpating the ab­
dominal region for the baculum and testes, by noting the presence of 
four enlarged pectoral mammae in pregnant females (after 2 months), 
by giving beaver the anesthetic combelen (which causes the penis to 
lapse into the cloaca), by detecting Barr bodies in blood smears, and 
by using radiographs that reveal the presence of the baculum (review 
by Novak 1987). Each of these methods has some level of uncertainty 
or practical constraints for adult beaver and is especially difﬁcult for 
young (reviews by Novak 1987; Schulte et al. 1995). A recently devel­
oped technique uses the color and

by Novak 1987). Each of these methods has some level of uncertainty 
or practical constraints for adult beaver and is especially difﬁcult for 
young (reviews by Novak 1987; Schulte et al. 1995). A recently devel­
oped technique uses the color and viscosity of anal gland secretion to 
determine the sex of adult and juvenile beaver. This method produced 
relatively accurate and consistent results from three different regions in 
New Y ork, which suggests it may have general ﬁeld application for sex 
identiﬁcation in beaver (Schulte et al. 1995). 
Age Estimation. Characteristics of tooth eruption and annual cemen­
tum layers have been in standard use for age determination since the 
1960s (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). A reﬁnement in the cemen­
tum layer method used the independent variables cementum length and 
noncementum length to fairly accurately predict ages for a sample of 28 
beaver (≥4 years old) with an exponential model, suggesting practical 
application in cases where more exact data are not necessary (Houston 
and Pelton 1995). Techniques for estimating age of live beaver are gen­
erally less accurate than the cementum method used for carcasses. The 
most common methods have used weight and skull measures, despite 
large error rates (Novak 1987; Hartman 1992). A reﬁnement using re­
gression models to estimate the age of live beaver based on live weight,

 and skull measures, despite 
large error rates (Novak 1987; Hartman 1992). A reﬁnement using re­
gression models to estimate the age of live beaver based on live weight, 
tail width, and tail length was useful in identifying three age classes: 
kits, yearlings, and ≥ 2-year olds (Van Deelen 1994). A technique using 
dental radiographs to observe tooth root closure and annual deposition 
of cementum and dentine layers appears useful for estimating age of 
either live or dead beaver (Hartman 1992). 
Livetrapping. Beaver can be captured alive using Hancock traps, Bai­
ley traps, box traps, snares, or nets. Hancock traps are set on the sides of 
steep banks and Bailey traps are set in shallow water. Both are suitcase-
type traps, which hold the beaver in a wire cage above water until 
released. Hancock traps are usually more effective than Bailey traps 
and are preferred in most situations (Novak 1987). Snares are cheap, 
light, and easy to set. They permit trappers to increase capture rates 
by saturating an area with traps, but have a greater mortality rate than 
Hancock traps due to increased risk of predation, entanglement lead­
ing to suffocation, and drowning (Hill 1982; McKinstry and Anderson 
1998). Box traps baited with aspen and scent lure were effective for 
all age classes in spring and early summer when set along shoreline 
travel lanes in Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers. commun., 2001). In all 
cases, multiple traps per trapnight percolony will increase the likeli­
hood of trapping all colony members or speciﬁc targeted individuals 
before colony members become trap shy. In some cases,

all age classes in spring and early summer when set along shoreline 
travel lanes in Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers. commun., 2001). In all 
cases, multiple traps per trapnight percolony will increase the likeli­
hood of trapping all colony members or speciﬁc targeted individuals 
before colony members become trap shy. In some cases, beaver can be 
captured by nets or by hand after being ﬂushed from lodges or dens 
by dogs or other means (Hill 1982; Rosell and Hovde 2001). In large 
river systems or lakes, surface-swimming beaver can be captured using 
a dip net. A dive net can be pushed down over the top of swimming 
beaver in shallow water, after locating them with the aid of spotlights 
and headlights from a motorboat (Rosell and Hovde 2001). 
Tagging. Beaver can be individually marked with ear tags, neck col­
lars, tail tags, and other methods (Novak 1987). Beaver may retain ear 
tags for several years, but retention rates have varied greatly among 
studies (review by Novak 1987). The tail can be marked with holes, 
notches, rivets, waterproof paint, branding, cryobranding with liquid 
nitrogen, and cattle ear tags (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.), and the fur can 
be bleached or dyed. Hind feet webs also can be tattooed or punched 
to individually mark beaver. Subcutaneously placed passive integrated 
transponder tags can positively identify recaptured beaver as well as 
free-ranging beaver, which can be scanned with a tag reader as they 
enter or exit burrows or lodges (although this method has not been ﬁeld 
tested). These techniques

 tattooed or punched 
to individually mark beaver. Subcutaneously placed passive integrated 
transponder tags can positively identify recaptured beaver as well as 
free-ranging beaver, which can be scanned with a tag reader as they 
enter or exit burrows or lodges (although this method has not been ﬁeld 
tested). These techniques all vary in their effectiveness and in trauma 
caused to beaver during and after marking, important considerations 
when selecting an appropriate marking technique. 
Telemetry. Beaver are nocturnal and difﬁcult to observe, so telemetry 
is often valuable in studies of their behavior and movements. However, 
transmitter attachment has been problematic. Neck collars often slip 
off because beaver have a thick neck relative to head size, and tail col­
lars slip off if tail size decreases following release (B. W . Baker, pers. 
obs.). Free-ﬂoating intraperitoneal transmitter implants have proven 
successful in several studies, although their range can be relatively 
short (ground-to-ground signal of 0.1 km for beaver inside burrows 
and 2 km for active beaver; Davis et al. 1984). Implanted transmit­
ters become tightly encapsulated with necrotic ﬁbrous tissue and may 
be well tolerated by beaver (Guynn et al. 1987). Implants have been 
performed via dorsal (Davis et al. 1984) and ventrolateral (Wheatley 
1997d) incisions. Although both techniques have been successful, the 
ventrolateral method appears to involve less risk to the animal. 
Tail-mounted transmitters have shown variable success in 
Wyoming (Bothmeyer et al. 2002), Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers

 (Davis et al. 1984) and ventrolateral (Wheatley 
1997d) incisions. Although both techniques have been successful, the 
ventrolateral method appears to involve less risk to the animal. 
Tail-mounted transmitters have shown variable success in 
Wyoming (Bothmeyer et al. 2002), Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers. 
commun., 2001), and Colorado (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). This method 
uses a livestock ear tag transmitter attached to the dorsal surface of a 
beaver’s tail. Dimensions and weight of tail-mounted transmitters can 
be designed to ﬁt beaver tails of various sizes (kits, adults) and allow 
for variation in tail thickness. Durability and attachment effects (e.g., 
tearing the tail) of tail-mounted transmitters have yet to be determined, 
although preliminary evidence suggests short retention time for a rela­
tively high percentage of individuals (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). 
Reintroduction. The ﬁrst step in any reintroduction program should be 
to determine the purpose and feasibility of attempting to establish new

beaver populations. This includes an understanding of why beaver are 
absent from the site, why they are important to the site, justiﬁcation for 
relocation rather than natural dispersal, likelihood of movement beyond 
the intended relocation site, and potential conﬂicts or interaction with 
other resources or landowners. Relocation decisions and expectations 
are usually based on professional judgment after considering all avail­
able data, but also may be based on mathematical simulation models

 to the site, justiﬁcation for 
relocation rather than natural dispersal, likelihood of movement beyond 
the intended relocation site, and potential conﬂicts or interaction with 
other resources or landowners. Relocation decisions and expectations 
are usually based on professional judgment after considering all avail­
able data, but also may be based on mathematical simulation models. 
South et al. (2000) developed a spatially explicit model to evaluate the 
proposed reintroduction of Eurasian beaver to Scotland. Their model 
simulated births and deaths of individuals and dispersal between habitat 
patches based on a land cover map and predicted that a reintroduction 
of 20 beaver would be sufﬁcient to establish an initial population that 
would eventually expand and ﬁll suitable habitat. 
Most beaver do not stay at release sites and may move great dis­
tances following release. Average dispersal distances were 14.6 km in 
a North Dakota study, 16.7 km in a Colorado study, 11.7 km in a Maine 
study, 18 km in a Quebec study, and 7.4 km for beaver transplanted 
to streams and 3.2 km for beaver transplanted to lakes in a Wisconsin 
study (review by Novak 1987). Beaver can sometimes be encouraged 
to stay at speci ﬁc release sites by providing aspen or other preferred 
species as food and building material or creating a base for a beaver 
dam by placing posts, wire fencing, silt-retaining fabric, rock, or other 
material (Apple et al. 1985; B. W . Baker, pers. obs.).

 base for a beaver 
dam by placing posts, wire fencing, silt-retaining fabric, rock, or other 
material (Apple et al. 1985; B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). 
Survival of relocated beaver can depend on suitability of available 
habitat, timing of release (late summer in areas that freeze allows time 
to establish ponds and food cache), sex, age, composition, and num­
ber released (entire family units may improve establishment success), 
predation, and disease. In a study of 57 released Eurasian beaver in the 
Netherlands, 19 animals were found dead within the ﬁrst year and 50% 
of these had died of infectious diseases (Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, 
Y. enterocolitica, Leptospirosis, and others) (Nolet et al. 1997). Stress 
during handling may increase risk of disease following release. Vac­
cination against likely disease agents and attention to animal hygiene 
before release may reduce mortality. Holding beaver in a cool, damp en­
vironment, providing adequate food and water, and minimizing length 
of captivity should improve survival following release (Novak 1987). 
RESEARCH NEEDS 
Beaver research has evolved from descriptions of beaver and their habi­
tat to attempts to better understand mechanisms that explain behavior, 
population structure, and their keystone role in ecosystem structure and 
function. New knowledge about beaver will likely come from cross-
discipline studies that stretch the boundaries of our already rich litera­
ture base on beaver. For example, a better understanding of the role of 
beaver as geological agents in the formation of alluvial ﬂoodplain val­
leys begs for the integration of the ecological sciences with new methods

function. New knowledge about beaver will likely come from cross-
discipline studies that stretch the boundaries of our already rich litera­
ture base on beaver. For example, a better understanding of the role of 
beaver as geological agents in the formation of alluvial ﬂoodplain val­
leys begs for the integration of the ecological sciences with new methods 
in geology and geomorphology, such as dating of buried organic layers 
that represent beaver dams and pond sediments. An important research 
need is to develop independent lines of evidence about how beaver 
affect ecosystem structure and function over the full range of ecolog­
ical conditions inhabited by beaver, especially in the less well-known 
communities such as southeastern forests, western shrub–steppe, and 
desert grasslands. These studies should include the sequential events 
of development and abandonment that make up the life history of a 
beaver pond ecosystem. In South America and Europe, beaver are an 
invasive species with an ecological role that likely will require a differ­
ent level of understanding than in their native North American habitat. 
The economic values of beaver wetlands in storing water, improving 
water quality, restoring wetland function, and mitigating development 
will be of critical importance as human populations expand and strain 
the land’s ability to absorb their impact. The human dimensions of 
beaver management and control methods need improved understand­
ing to better educate a public that is becoming more removed from 
the land and more inclined to use legislative or judicial means rather 
than the judgment of wildlife professionals to manage wildlife popula­
tions. Techniques need further reﬁnement to more effectively estimate

 better educate a public that is becoming more removed from 
the land and more inclined to use legislative or judicial means rather 
than the judgment of wildlife professionals to manage wildlife popula­
tions. Techniques need further reﬁnement to more effectively estimate 
beaver populations, determine sex and age of live beaver in theﬁeld, and 
better use advanced telemetry as a research and management tool. For 
example, no radio-attachment technique has simultaneously solved 
problems of minimal effects to the animal, long retention time, long 
signal range, and long battery life.

Castor canadensis (hereafter beaver) is endemic to North Amer­
ica and is one of two extant species in the genus Castor. Castor ﬁber 
(hereafter Eurasian beaver) is endemic to Europe and Asia, although 
its current range is severely reduced relative to its historical range. The 
general physical appearance of the two species is similar, but their kary­
otypes and several cranial and behavioral patterns are distinct (Lavrov 
and Orlov 1973). Multilocus allozyme electrophoresis can distinguish 
C. canadensis from C. ﬁber using tissue or blood samples from either 
live or dead animals, which makes the technique useful as a manage­
ment tool for restoration of C. ﬁber in Europe (Sieber et al. 1999). 
C. c. acadicus, C. c. canadensis, C. c. carolinensis, and C. c. mis­
souriensis are the most widespread subspecies of beaver in North Amer­

C. c. acadicus, C. c. canadensis, C. c. carolinensis, and C. c. mis­
souriensis are the most widespread subspecies of beaver in North Amer­
ica (Hall 1981); however, reintroductions following extirpation have 
substantially altered pristine geographic variation among subspecies. 
The gene pools of some subspecies have been altered through introduc­
tions and subsequent mixing with other subspecies. Some subspecies 
may have disappeared entirely. Because subspecies are difﬁcult to de­
termine even with an animal in hand, subsequent discussions will be 
limited to species. 
Fossil remains of a giant beaver, genus Casteroides, and a number 
of closely related prehistoric mammals also have been found in North 
America (Cahn 1932). The family Castoridae dates to the Oligocene 
and was highly diversiﬁed in the Tertiary period in North America 
(Kowalski 1976). The genus Castor dates to the Pleistocene (Garrison 
1967) or late Tertiary (M. Schlosser 1902). 
DISTRIBUTION 
Historical Range. Seton (1929) estimated the beaver population at 
60–400 million before European settlement of North America. Beaver 
occurred throughout the subarctic of mainland Canada below the north­
ern tundra and the mouth of the MacKenzie River in the Northwest Ter­
ritories (Novakowski 1965). They were widespread in Alaska, except 
along the Arctic Slope from Point Hope east to the Canadian border 
(Hakala 1952). Within the contiguous United States, they occupied 
suitable wetland and riparian habitat from coast to coast, even in the

ra and the mouth of the MacKenzie River in the Northwest Ter­
ritories (Novakowski 1965). They were widespread in Alaska, except 
along the Arctic Slope from Point Hope east to the Canadian border 
(Hakala 1952). Within the contiguous United States, they occupied 
suitable wetland and riparian habitat from coast to coast, even in the 
arid southwest. They were generally absent from the Florida peninsula 
and parts of southern California and southern Nevada. Although their 
original range in Mexico is difﬁcult to determine, they were present in 
the Colorado River and Rio Grande River (Leopold 1959) as well as 
some coastal streams along the Gulf of Mexico. 
Despite their legendary abundance, most beaver populations were 
decimated by fur trappers during the 1700s and 1800s, primarily to 
support the European fashion for felt hats (Bryce 1904). Large trading 
companies, such as the Hudson Bay Company, employed Europeans and 
Native Americans who supplied furs without regard for method or sea­
son of take. Because trappers continually moved to new territory, they 
likely were unaware of their cumulative effects on entire populations. 
In addition, intense harvest likely caused the local destruction of pop­
ulation structures, contributing to regional declines (Ingle-Sidorowicz 
1982). Beaver populations in the eastern United States were largely 
extirpated by fur trappers before 1900. 
Growing public concern over declines in beaver and other wildlife 
populations eventually led to regulations that controlled harvest through 
seasons and methods of take, initiating a continent-wide recovery of 
beaver populations. To supplement natural recovery, during the mid­
1900s beaver were livetrapped and successfully reintroduced into much 
of their former range, a remarkable achievement of early

 public concern over declines in beaver and other wildlife 
populations eventually led to regulations that controlled harvest through 
seasons and methods of take, initiating a continent-wide recovery of 
beaver populations. To supplement natural recovery, during the mid­
1900s beaver were livetrapped and successfully reintroduced into much 
of their former range, a remarkable achievement of early wildlife man­
agers. Although the area of pristine beaver habitat has been much re­
duced by human land-use practices, beaver have proved to be highly 
adaptable and occupy a variety of human-made habitats. In addition, 
beaver have been intentionally or accidentally introduced into areas 
outside their original range. Thus, the present range of beaver is a result 
of natural recovery and reintroduction to their original range, introduc­
tion and expansion into areas beyond their original range, the limits of 
native habitat as modiﬁed by human land uses, and adaptability to new 
human-made habitats such as urban areas, croplands, and areas with 
exotic vegetation. 
Present Range. Beaver populations were estimated at 6–12 million 
by Naiman et al. (1988). Beaver now occupy much of their former 
range in North America, although habitat loss and other causes have 
severely restricted populations in many areas (Fig. 15.1) (Hall 1981; 
Larson and Gunson 1983). For example, since 1834, about 195,000– 
260,000 km2 of wetlands has been converted to agricultural or other use 
in the United States, much of which was likely beaver habitat (Naiman 
et al. 1988). Nonetheless, beaver are remarkably adaptable. They can

 about 195,000– 
260,000 km2 of wetlands has been converted to agricultural or other use 
in the United States, much of which was likely beaver habitat (Naiman 
et al. 1988). Nonetheless, beaver are remarkably adaptable. They can 
marginally subsist above timberline in mountainous areas; however, 
beaver have been unable to colonize Alaskan or Canadian arctic tun­
dra, perhaps because tundra vegetation lacks essential woody plants 
for winter food and lodge construction or because thick ice limits sur­
face access in winter. Although suitable beaver habitat in Canada has 
been reduced since pre-European settlement, fur harvest records indi­
cate that beaver populations have fully recovered in many areas, per­
haps a result of a return to earlier successional stages of forest cover 
(Ingle-Sidorowicz 1982). In the United States, beaver populations have 
continued to increase since major reintroductions ended in the 1950s. 
Populations in southeastern states have grown large enough to become 
a major nuisance to the timber industry and others (Larson and Gunson 
1983). In the Far West, they have been reestablished in the Santa Ana 
and Colorado River systems of southern California. In Mexico, beaver 
may still subsist in some northern areas of Nuevo Leon and Chihuahua 
(Leopold 1959), although populations there likely are marginal (Landin 
1980).

F 15.1. Distribution of the beaver (Castor canadensis). Modiﬁcations of 
the range map by Deems and Pursley (1978) include populations in Mexico, 
southern California, west-central Florida, and Delaware and the absence of 
beaver in the North Slope of Alaska. 
Introductions of beaver in Finland (Lahti and Helminen 1974), 
Asian Kamchatka (Safonov 1979), Argentina (Lizarralde 1993), and 
other locations have resulted in the establishment of viable populations 
beyond their original range in North America. For example, 25 mated 
pairs of beaver were introduced (as a captive population) to Tierra del 
Fuego, Argentina, in 1946 to establish a fur industry. Animals that later 
escaped or were intentionally released resulted in a viable wild pop­
ulation. This population rapidly expanded in the absence of predators 
and other natural population controls, causing a substantial impact on 
native southern beech (Nothofagus) forests (Lizarralde 1993). 
DESCRIPTION 
Beaver are the largest rodents in North America. Most adults weigh 
16–31.5 kg and attain a total length of up to 120 cm. They have heavily 
muscled bodies supported by large bones. Forelegs are shorter than hind 
legs, which results in greater height at the hips than at the shoulders. 
Viewed dorsally, beaver are short and thick, broadest just anterior to the

 Most adults weigh 
16–31.5 kg and attain a total length of up to 120 cm. They have heavily 
muscled bodies supported by large bones. Forelegs are shorter than hind 
legs, which results in greater height at the hips than at the shoulders. 
Viewed dorsally, beaver are short and thick, broadest just anterior to the 
hips, and taper gradually toward the nose; a short, thick neck appears 
almost continuous with the shoulders and head. Their most character­
istic feature is a dorsoventrally ﬂattened, paddle-like tail, the unfurred 
portion of which in most adults varies from 230 to 323 mm long and 
from 110 to 180 mm wide (Davis 1940). The distal three fourths of 
the tail is covered with black, leathery, uncorniﬁed scales (Kowalski 
1976) containing a few scattered, coarse hairs. The caudal vertebrae 
are dorsoventrally ﬂattened, with a complex arrangement of muscles 
and tendons to support the ﬂat tail (Mahoney and Rosenburg 1981). In­
cisors are generally orangish in color, with the anterior surface in adults 
>5 mm wide, a feature that helps distinguish beaver damage from other 
rodent damage on the basis of toothmark width. 
Beaver move with an awkward waddle on land, but can gallop if 
frightened. Adult beaver can walk upright in a bipedal fashion (par­
tially supported by the tail) while carrying mud or sticks held against 
the chest with their chin and front legs. In water, they swim by alternate 
kicks of the hind legs, appearing graceful and efﬁcient, though

frightened. Adult beaver can walk upright in a bipedal fashion (par­
tially supported by the tail) while carrying mud or sticks held against 
the chest with their chin and front legs. In water, they swim by alternate 
kicks of the hind legs, appearing graceful and efﬁcient, though slow 
and deliberate. Beaver are shaped more like marine mammals than like 
other terrestrial mammals, with a ﬁneness ratio (a hydrodynamic in­
dex of streamlining) of 4.8, a value similar to that for phocid seals 
(Reynolds 1993). In addition, the surface area of unfurred extremities 
(hind feet and scaly tail) is 30% of the total, perhaps a compromise 
between the need for propulsion and minimization of the area for heat 
exchange. Webbed toes on large hind feet (up to 200 mm long) facili­
tate swimming, and short, heavily clawed front feet facilitate digging. 
Great forepaw dexterity enables beaver to fold individual leaves into 
their mouth and to rotate small, pencil-sized stems as they gnaw off bark. 
The ears are rounded, short (30 mm), ﬂeshy, and placed high on the rear 
of the head. The small eyes also are located high on the head, about 
midway between the nose and the base of the skull. Both these adapta­
tions enable beaver to swim with minimum exposure above the water 
surface. 
Pelt coloration is variable within and among populations, with 
reddish, chestnut, nearly black, and yellowish-brown specimens pos­
sible in the same watershed. Fur of the ﬂanks, abdomen, and cheeks

tions enable beaver to swim with minimum exposure above the water 
surface. 
Pelt coloration is variable within and among populations, with 
reddish, chestnut, nearly black, and yellowish-brown specimens pos­
sible in the same watershed. Fur of the ﬂanks, abdomen, and cheeks 
is usually shorter and lighter than back fur. Guard hairs are about 10 
times the diameter of the hairs constituting the underfur, giving the pelt 
a coarse appearance. Guard hairs attain their greatest length (50 mm) 
and density along the back. Underfur is longest on the back (25 mm) 
and has wavy individual hairs, which give the pelt a downy softness. It 
may be dark gray to chestnut in color on the back and, like the guard 
hair, becomes lighter in color on the sides and ventral areas. Unlike the 
case in many furbearers, coloration of individual guard hairs is usually 
consistent throughout their length. 
The two inside (medial) toes of each hind foot have movable, split 
nails, which beaver use as combs to groom their fur (Wilsson 1971). 
Beaver have closable nostrils, valvular ears, nictitating eye membranes, 
and lips that close behind large incisors, adaptions important to their 
semiaquatic existence. During periods of active lactation and when par­
turition is near, four pectoral mammae are discernible on the chest of 
the adult female. During pregnancy, beaver have a subplacenta located 
between the placenta and uterine tissues. Although its morphology has 
been well described, its function is unknown (Fischer 1985). The repro­

ation and when par­
turition is near, four pectoral mammae are discernible on the chest of 
the adult female. During pregnancy, beaver have a subplacenta located 
between the placenta and uterine tissues. Although its morphology has 
been well described, its function is unknown (Fischer 1985). The repro­
ductive organs of both sexes are internal and lie anterior to a common 
anal cloaca containing the castor and anal glands (Svendsen 1978). A 
notable characteristic of beaver is the strong aroma from the paired 
castor glands. Contents of the castor glands (castoreum) and anal gland 
secretion may be deposited during scent marking. Castoreum has been 
used as a base aroma in perfume and in making trappers’s lures. 
Beaver skeletons are massive when compared to those of other 
mammals of similar length. The skull and the mandible are thick and 
heavy, providing a strong foundation for large incisors (Fig. 15.2). A 
less rugged skull would be unable to withstand the physical stress and 
strain of jaw muscle contractions of sufﬁcient strength to cut hardwoods 
such as oak (Quercus spp.) and maple (Acer spp.). The braincase is 
narrow and there is a small infraorbital canal. A prominent rostrum 
is anterior to the massive zygomatic arch. Adult skulls are very large 
(120–148 mm condylobasal length), which minimizes the possibility 
of confusing them with other North American rodents. Juvenile skulls 
are smaller and may be similar in size to those of adult nutria (My­
ocastor coypus), porcupine (Erethizon

(120–148 mm condylobasal length), which minimizes the possibility 
of confusing them with other North American rodents. Juvenile skulls 
are smaller and may be similar in size to those of adult nutria (My­
ocastor coypus), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), or mountain beaver 
(Aplodontia rufa); however, differences other than size are apparent on 
close examination. As in other semiaquatic mammals, the acetabulum 
is shifted dorsally (Kowalski 1976). The male beaver has a baculum that 
generally enlarges with age (Friley 1949) and can be palpated as an aid 
in determining the sex of live beavers and unskinned carcasses (Denney 
1952). Osteological changes during growth and development of beaver 
were described by Robertson and Shadle (1954). The dental formula is 
I 1/1, C 0/0, P 1/1, M 3/3. Incisors grow continuously and the chiseled 
edge is sharpened by grinding the uppers against the lowers (Wilsson 
1971). The hard enameled front surface of incisors serves as the cutting 
edge to fell trees and peel bark. Cheek teeth are hypsodont and grow 
only through the deposition of cementum at the root base. Deciduous 
premolars are replaced at about 11 months of age by permanent pre­
molars. Specializations such as large size; type and location of ears, 
eyes, and nose; size and function of front and hind legs; and a large,

PHYSIOLOGY 
Growth. Size of the adult beaver depends on latitude, climate, quality 
of available food, and extent of exploitation. In Alabama, a sample of 
1450 beaver from an unexploited population showed mean body weight 
stabilized at 4 or 5 years of age and then diminished slightly after 9 years 
of age. Average weight of all specimens was 18.6 kg; maximum was 
19.3 kg (review by Hill 1982). The relatively moderate climate of the 
midcontinent region may produce the largest beaver, where maximum 
weight can reach nearly 40 kg. 
Growth of adults (body weight and tail size) occurs only in sum­
mer; however, kits (juveniles) continue to grow throughout their ﬁrst 
winter (Novakowski 1965; Smith and Jenkins 1997). For northern 
beaver, winter ice formation on ponds and streams restricts

aver, where maximum 
weight can reach nearly 40 kg. 
Growth of adults (body weight and tail size) occurs only in sum­
mer; however, kits (juveniles) continue to grow throughout their ﬁrst 
winter (Novakowski 1965; Smith and Jenkins 1997). For northern 
beaver, winter ice formation on ponds and streams restricts or eliminates 
access to surface food, and adults and yearlings lose weight as fat stores 
are depleted. In southern beaver, adults and yearlings also lose weight 
in winter, even though their habitat typically remains ice free. Failure to 
maintain fat reserves during winter for beaver living in ice-free regions 
is likely not due to lack of adequate energy from available food, as it 
may be in the northern range, but instead may be associated with sea­
sonal changes in physiology. Reduced food consumption, as described 
for captive beaver of a northern population, may also occur in southern 
beaver with the onset of warming trends in February and March, as 
beaver are frequently observed sunning themselves on lodges during 
clear sunny days of late winter, and early spring (review by Hill 1982). 
In northern populations, Smith and Jenkins (1997) found that win­
ter loss of body weight and tail size can vary among colonies by severity 
of winter, and sex and age composition of the colony. Beaver lost more 
body weight and tail size when winters were longer. Adults and year­
lings that overwintered with young in the colony lost more weight than 
those without young. This supports Novakowski ’s (1965) conclusion 
that older members of the colony eat less stored food when young are 
present, and rely instead on other adaptations to survive the winter.

those without young. This supports Novakowski ’s (1965) conclusion 
that older members of the colony eat less stored food when young are 
present, and rely instead on other adaptations to survive the winter. 
Thermoregulation. Northern populations of beaver in winter must 
contend with the thermoregulatory cost of foraging under the ice in 
near-freezing water and must subsist primarily on stored food and me­
tabolized fat (Dyck and MacArthur 1992). Some mammals can con­
serve energy in winter by reducing their body temperature through 
seasonal torpor. Researchers have suspected torpor in beaver, but stud­
ies of change in body temperature in response to freezing ambient 
temperatures have been equivocal. Dyck and MacArthur (1992:1671) 
found the body temperature of free-ranging beaver averaged about 37
◦ 
C 
throughout the year, with “no evidence of shallow torpor in either kits 
or adults.” In contrast, D. W . Smith et al. (1991) found the mean daily 
body temperature of adult beaver declined by 1
◦ 
C from fall to win­
ter, but remained constant for kits. Body temperature can also vary 
by daily activity level. Before freeze-up, body temperature is higher 
during daylight hours, when beaver spend more time in the lodge, and 
lower at night, when they are away from the lodge (Dyck and MacArthur 
1992). Thus, thermoregulation likely contributes to overwinter survival 
in beaver in combination with several other adaptations described in this 
chapter, including warmer winter fur, increased body fat, a stored food

 daylight hours, when beaver spend more time in the lodge, and 
lower at night, when they are away from the lodge (Dyck and MacArthur 
1992). Thus, thermoregulation likely contributes to overwinter survival 
in beaver in combination with several other adaptations described in this 
chapter, including warmer winter fur, increased body fat, a stored food 
cache, a warmer microclimate in the lodge, huddling together in the 
lodge, and reduced activity in winter (D. W . Smith et al. 1991). 
Digestion. Beaver are hind-gut fermenters. Digestion is enhanced by 
a prominent and unusual cardiogastric gland on the lesser curvature 
of the stomach (Vispo and Hume 1995), a glandular digestive area 
(Kowalski 1976), and a large trilobed cecum containing commensal 
microbiota. Beaver consume a high percentage of cellulose, but maxi­
mize the nutritional value of woody plants by eating only the bark. They 
can digest about 32% of available cellulose by microbial action in the 
cecum, which is similar to the case in some other mammals (review by 
Hill 1982, Buech 1984). Beaver have a relatively long small intestine, 
70% longer than in the porcupine, which suggests a high absorptive ca­
pacity (Vispo and Hume 1995). Consumption of soft green excrement 
directly from the cloaca (coprophagy) occurs diurnally in the beaver 
(observed as early as 10 days of age; Buech 1984) as well as in the 
Eurasian beaver (Wilsson 1971), lagomorphs, and other rodents. Feces

(observed as early as 10 days of age; Buech 1984) as well as in the 
Eurasian beaver (Wilsson 1971), lagomorphs, and other rodents. Feces 
are reingested and chewed by the beaver and pass quickly through the 
digestive system (Buech 1984). In contrast, lagomorphs reingest and 
swallow mucous-covered entire pellets. 
Circulation. Beaver heart weight averages 0.40% of body weight, 
which is consistent with heart ratios for other terrestrial mammals, but

relatively small compared to fully aquatic mammals (Bisaillon 1982). 
The cardiac blood vessels are not specialized, but are typically mam­
malian and resemble those of both terrestrial and aquatic mammals 
(Bisaillon 1981). Beaver have no unusual oxygen storage capacity, but 
certain changes in blood parameters, heart rhythm, and circulation en­
able them to make dives lasting up to 15 min without asphyxiation 
(review by Hill 1982). Aleksiuk (1970a:145) noted that “minute blood 
vessels permeate the entire tail, and a countercurrent heat exchange sys­
tem is present at the base.” This specialized circulatory feature helps 
conserve heat energy in extremely cold water and radiate heat during 
hot weather.

conserve heat energy in extremely cold water and radiate heat during

REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
Sexual Maturity. Beaver reach sexual maturity (de ﬁned as age at 
breeding that results in the ﬁrst litter) at 1.5 –3 years of age, although 
puberty may be reached several months before ﬁrst breeding. Most 
studies have found at least some beaver had reached sexual maturity 
as yearlings (1.5–2.0 years old), although regional variation is evident. 
Gunson (1970) estimated that two thirds to three fourths of 2-year-
old beaver produced young, and believed that early sexual maturity 
in Saskatchewan beaver was enhanced by high-quality habitat. Repro­
duction in yearlings may cease where >40% of suitable beaver habitat 
is occupied by established colonies. In Newfoundland, 24% of year­
ling females had bred (Payne 1975). In northern Canada, Novakowski 
(1965) found ﬁrst pregnancies in 3 of 21 females that were approach­
ing their third birthday, but no indications of conception in females that 
were almost 2 years old. In Alabama, in 2.5- to 3-year-old females, 
only 16 of 65 had ovulated, and there were no indications of ovulation 
or pregnancy in 50 yearlings. However, in Tennessee, Lizotte (1994) 
found sexual maturity occurred at 1.5–2.0 years of age, with a 25% 
pregnancy rate in this age class. 
Breeding. Beaver are monogamous, described by Svendsen 
(1989:339) as “

or pregnancy in 50 yearlings. However, in Tennessee, Lizotte (1994) 
found sexual maturity occurred at 1.5–2.0 years of age, with a 25% 
pregnancy rate in this age class. 
Breeding. Beaver are monogamous, described by Svendsen 
(1989:339) as “characterized by a single adult pair and young 
forming a family, a relatively long pair-bond where desertion of a 
mate is rare, and turnover of mates usually occurs after the death of 
one of the pair.” Beaver typically breed in winter and give birth in late 
spring, producing only 1 litter/year. The potential breeding season is 
very long, with conception reported between November and March 
and parturition between February and November (review by Wigley 
et al. 1983). Latitude and climate can affect the breeding season, 
which is generally shorter in colder climates and longer in warmer 
climates (Hill 1982; Wigley et al. 1983). Breeding takes place in 
water (Kowalski 1976), bank dens, or lodges. Wilsson (1971) reported 
that C. ﬁber remains in estrus 10–12 hr and has a second estrus in 
14 days if not fertilized. A gestation period of 100 days is typical for 
C. canadensis (Wigley et al. 1983), with a range of 98 –111 days 
(review by Hill 1982). 
Sex Ratios. Sex ratios in monogamous species are important because 
they can in ﬂuence pregnancy rates. When averaged across age class, 
region, and harvest level, the sex ratio of beaver may be nearly even, 
but substantial variation among populations suggests caution in mak­

 range of 98 –111 days 
(review by Hill 1982). 
Sex Ratios. Sex ratios in monogamous species are important because 
they can in ﬂuence pregnancy rates. When averaged across age class, 
region, and harvest level, the sex ratio of beaver may be nearly even, 
but substantial variation among populations suggests caution in mak­
ing this assumption. Sex ratios of trapped populations may reﬂect bias 
inherent in trapping methods, although results of different studies are 
inconsistent. For example, some studies found no difference in sus­
ceptibility of sexes to baited Conibear traps set under ice, but others 
suggested trapping was selective for adult females. Others have noted 
higher mortality from trapping and other causes for adult males (review 
by Hill 1982). In a review of 15 studies, Woodward (1977) found an 
average sex ratio of 98.5 males:100 females, but a ratio of 90.7:100 for 
adults and 111.4:100 for subadults. The combined average from studies 
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, Vermont, and Alabama was 105:100 
(N = 4867) (review by Hill 1982). 
Pregnancy Rates. Knowledge of pregnancy rates among age groups 
in monogamous species increases accuracy in computing estimates 
of reproductive performance. Pregnancy rates usually increase from 
1.5 years of age until about age 4 years, remain high until old age, 
and then decrease (Lizotte 1994). Where populations are not exploited 
and suitable habitat is fully occupied, there likely is less dispersal and 
therefore less breeding among young adults, which remain in colonies 
containing older dominant pairs. Thus, both habitat quality and extent 
of exploitation should be considered when using pregnancy rates to 
calculate reproductive

 age, 
and then decrease (Lizotte 1994). Where populations are not exploited 
and suitable habitat is fully occupied, there likely is less dispersal and 
therefore less breeding among young adults, which remain in colonies 
containing older dominant pairs. Thus, both habitat quality and extent 
of exploitation should be considered when using pregnancy rates to 
calculate reproductive performance. 
Reproductive Performance. Placental scar counts (Hodgdon 1949), 
counts of developing embryos, and, with some limitations, counts of 
corpora lutea and corpora albicantia are useful indices of reproductive 
performance in beaver (Provost 1958). In Mississippi, counts of fe­
tuses, placental scars, and corpora lutea all yielded statistically similar 
estimates of litter size, despite pre- or postimplantation losses (Wigley 
et al. 1984). Preimplantation losses from unfertilized ova or failure 
of fertilized ova to implant and postimplantation losses resulting in re-
sorptions account for differences between ovulation rates and litter size. 
Intrauterine mortality was 16% in 48 beaver from Ohio and almost 19% 
in 40 beaver from western Massachusetts (review by Hill 1982). Where 
rates of prenatal loss are high, correction factors should be developed 
to obtain more precise estimates of litter size and annual productivity 
(Wigley et al. 1984). 
In areas where carcasses are available from fall or early winter 
trapping, counts of placental scars and persisting corpora albicantia, 
corrected for current resorption rates and prenatal loss, respectively, 
provide an index of litter size from the previous spring. Sources of er­

. 1984). 
In areas where carcasses are available from fall or early winter 
trapping, counts of placental scars and persisting corpora albicantia, 
corrected for current resorption rates and prenatal loss, respectively, 
provide an index of litter size from the previous spring. Sources of er­
ror, such as regression or discoloration of implantation sites by some 
preservatives and degeneration of corpora albicantia with the onset of 
the breeding season (Provost 1962), make estimates of reproductive per­
formance in fall less accurate than those made at other times. Where 
trapping seasons overlap the breeding season, a combination of pla­
cental scar counts corrected for the past season resorption rates and 
corpora lutea counts corrected for current resorption rates can provide 
information on litter size. However, early in gestation, it is difﬁcult to 
distinguish between corpora lutea of ovulation and corpora lutea of 
pregnancy, which introduces a potential source of error in estimates 
of reproductive performance (Provost 1962). Also, embryo counts and 
ovulation rates of females trapped in January and February may not 
provide precise estimates of current-year breeding among yearlings 
and subadults. These age groups may breed later than adults (Grinnell 
et al. 1937), particularly at southern latitudes or if they had dispersed 
during the summer. Thus, winter samples may not reﬂect reproductive 
performance as well as those from May or June. 
Where trapping seasons occur after the breeding season, counts 
of developing embryos, corrected for current resorption rates, provide 
an accurate index of litter size among age groups. Resorption is neg­

during the summer. Thus, winter samples may not reﬂect reproductive 
performance as well as those from May or June. 
Where trapping seasons occur after the breeding season, counts 
of developing embryos, corrected for current resorption rates, provide 
an accurate index of litter size among age groups. Resorption is neg­
ligible if embryos are in an advanced stage of development. Where 
possible, delaying the trapping season until breeding has occurred may 
lower the incidence of unbred females whose mates were trapped from 
the population before breeding (Hodgdon and Hunt 1953). Such de­
lay also facilitates measurement of current litter size through embryo 
counts. 
The litter size of beaver is typically two to four, although local 
averages may be as high as six, and the number can vary from one to 
nine (reviews by Hill 1982; Wigley et al. 1983). These reviews suggest 
that beaver in the southeastern United States tend to have smaller litters, 
whereas northern and perhaps western beaver tend to have larger litters. 
Large litters may be associated with better quality habitats and increased 
weight of the mother. In Mississippi, age of mother was only weakly 
correlated with litter size, but weight of mother was strongly correlated. 
Litter size can also be reduced by lack of food (e.g., due to ice on ponds) 
or quality of food (e.g., limited supply of preferred plants) (Rutherford 
1955). Because fewer yearlings breed in relatively dense populations 
and litter size may be inversely related to the number of beaver in 
the family, reproduction in beaver may be density dependent (Payne 
1984). Some evidence also suggests that beaver may breed only during

1955). Because fewer yearlings breed in relatively dense populations 
and litter size may be inversely related to the number of beaver in 
the family, reproduction in beaver may be density dependent (Payne 
1984). Some evidence also suggests that beaver may breed only during 
alternate years in very poor quality habitat, although this hypothesis 
needs further investigation (D. W . Smith, pers. commun., 2001).

Development of Y oung. Growth curves of the fetus were developed 
by Woodward (1977) for a 100-day gestation period. Curves may be 
useful for estimating peak periods of conception and parturition through 
extrapolation (Hodgdon and Hunt 1953). 
Beaver kits are born precocial and fully furred, and weigh about 
0.5 kg (review by Hill 1982). Lancia and Hodgdon (1983) studied the 
ontogeny of behavior in captive kits and found they were able to swim 
at 4 days and could dive and stay submerged at 2 months of age. Bipedal 
walking was noted at 1 month of age, and carrying construction materi­
als while walking on the hind legs occurred at 90 days of age. Suckling 
peaked at 25 ml of milk/day at 1 month and decreased until weaned 
at 45–50 days. Zurowski et al. (1974) noted that the anterior nipples 
produced 50–75% less milk than the posterior nipples. Kits can take 
some solid food at 1 –4 weeks of age and switch to mostly solid food 
by 1 month. However, they may

 of milk/day at 1 month and decreased until weaned 
at 45–50 days. Zurowski et al. (1974) noted that the anterior nipples 
produced 50–75% less milk than the posterior nipples. Kits can take 
some solid food at 1 –4 weeks of age and switch to mostly solid food 
by 1 month. However, they may suckle for up to 3 months even though 
they obtain little milk, perhaps to maintain the mother–infant bond. 
The fur of kits is not water repellent at birth, but after 3–4 weeks of age 
they begin to spread anal gland secretions on their fur, which creates 
water repellency by 5–8 weeks. Captive kits began to dive underwater 
in response to alarm at 8 –10 days of age and initiated tail slapping in 
response to alarm at 3 –4 weeks of age (Lancia and Hodgdon 1983). 
Rudimentary scent marking began at 13 –14 days of age. Thus, very 
young kits express some adult behaviors, but require a long period in 
the family to develop their complex construction ability and other skills 
required for independent life.

Social Organization. Individual beaver spend most of their lives in 
small, closed, extended-family units traditionally called colonies. Al­
though the term “colony” is commonly used for beaver, its use has been 
questioned (Hodgdon and Lancia 1983) because a colony more often 
describes a spatially associated collection of individual families rather 
than a single family unit. For example, a family of prairie dogs (Cyno­
mys spp.) living in the same burrow system is called a coterie and a 
group of families is called a colony. However,

describes a spatially associated collection of individual families rather 
than a single family unit. For example, a family of prairie dogs (Cyno­
mys spp.) living in the same burrow system is called a coterie and a 
group of families is called a colony. However, to maintain consistency 
with previous beaver literature, we use colony to represent an extended 
beaver family. Thus, a beaver colony typically contains the adult pair; 
young of the current year, or kits (<12 months old); and young of the 
previous year, or yearlings (12–24 months old). Sometimes older young 
may remain with the colony as subadults (>24 months old) before they 
disperse, especially if the available habitat is near carrying capacity 
(Busher 1987). A small percentage of colonies may contain more than 
one adult male or female (Busher 1983). Established colonies inhabit 
discrete and defended territories. Dispersing beaver of both sexes, also 
calledﬂoaters, remain transient until they settle with an unpaired beaver 
or they build dams or lodges, which may help attract a mate. Compared 
to many other mammals, especially other rodents, beaver populations 
are characterized by relatively low natality, low mortality of young, pro­
longed behavioral development, high parental care, and adult longevity 
(Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). 
Social interactions involving close contact are fairly infrequent 
outside the lodge, perhaps an adaptation to minimize predation risk on 
land. The most common interaction among individual beaver concerns 
food items and usually involves kits begging for food from older siblings 
or adults (Busher 1983). Adults discourage yearlings from begging by

outside the lodge, perhaps an adaptation to minimize predation risk on 
land. The most common interaction among individual beaver concerns 
food items and usually involves kits begging for food from older siblings 
or adults (Busher 1983). Adults discourage yearlings from begging by 
snapping their head toward the yearling. Grooming fur to maintain wa­
ter repellency is a common activity inside the lodge. Beaver groom 
themselves wherever they can reach, but rely on other family mem­
bers to groom their back fur (Patenaude and Bovet 1984). This social 
grooming appears to be primarily to maintain a layer of air in the fur, 
as does self-grooming, rather than to maintain social bonds or as an 
appeasement gesture (Brady and Svendsen 1981). Aggressive interac­
tions are rare among family members, with most aggression directed 
as threats that do not result in ﬁghts. Studies of dominance hierarchy 
systems in beaver have been equivocal. Hodgdon and Larson (1973) de­
scribed dominance hierarchy as age class (older dominant over younger) 
and sexual (adult females dominant over adult males). Busher (1983), 
however, found only age-class hierarchy, and Brady and Svendsen 
(1981) found no clear patterns in any groups. 
V ocalizations and Tail Slapping. Although seven vocal sounds have 
been described for beaver, most investigators recognize only three that 
are used outside the lodge: a whine, a hiss, and a growl (Hodgdon and 
Lancia 1983). The whine is the most frequent vocalization and can be 
repeated in rapid succession. Beaver of

 ocalizations and Tail Slapping. Although seven vocal sounds have 
been described for beaver, most investigators recognize only three that 
are used outside the lodge: a whine, a hiss, and a growl (Hodgdon and 
Lancia 1983). The whine is the most frequent vocalization and can be 
repeated in rapid succession. Beaver of all ages whine, but kits account 
for two thirds of events, either when food is at risk of being taken away or 
when begging for food. Food begging by kits is usually effective, which 
provides kits with food without the risk of obtaining it from land (Brady 
and Svendsen 1981; Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). V ocalizations are also 
used to initiate grooming and play. Although beaver are typically docile 
with humans, they sometimes become aggressive, a behavior sometimes 
preceded by a hiss or a growl. 
Probably the most familiar sound produced by beaver is the tail 
slap. The sound is made when a beaver forcefully strikes the water 
with its heavy paddle-like tail, a behavior that may precede diving un­
derwater when alarmed (tail-slap dive). Tail slapping may function to 
(1) issue a warning signal to family members, which typically respond 
by moving to deep water or to the lodge (especially kits); (2) drive away 
potential predators; and (3) elicit a response from the source of dis­
turbance (Brady and Svendsen 1981; Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). Tail 
slapping is used by all ages and both sexes, but studies of variation in 
frequency of use by sex and age have been equivocal. Hodgdon (1978) 
found older beaver slapped more often than younger ones, females were

 from the source of dis­
turbance (Brady and Svendsen 1981; Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). Tail 
slapping is used by all ages and both sexes, but studies of variation in 
frequency of use by sex and age have been equivocal. Hodgdon (1978) 
found older beaver slapped more often than younger ones, females were 
more easily provoked than males, and males slapped more times per 
event than females. Sudden alarm often elicits immediate tail slapping. 
However, if beaver are unsure, they often move to deep water and ori­
ent toward the disturbance with their nose in the air, a behavior that 
often precedes tail slapping. Smell, sound, sight, and movement are all 
important stimuli, either separately or in combination. The response of 
individual beaver to tail slapping also varies by age. Tail slapping by 
adults elicits the most response from all age classes, but adult beaver 
are the most responsive to tail slapping of other beaver. Kits are least 
likely to move or to elicit a response and yearlings are intermediate 
(Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). 
Scent Marking. Scent marking is a highly developed communication 
method in beaver. Castor glands produce castoreum, a strong-smelling, 
urine-based brown paste containing phenolic, neutral, basic, and acidic 
compounds. Anal glands (also called oil glands) produce anal gland se­
cretions consisting of waxy esters and fatty acids. Castoreum is likely 
derived from diet and thus subject to seasonal variation in odor; how­
ever, anal gland secretions are unique chemical identiﬁers of individual 
beaver (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1998). Beaver use castoreum

 oil glands) produce anal gland se­
cretions consisting of waxy esters and fatty acids. Castoreum is likely 
derived from diet and thus subject to seasonal variation in odor; how­
ever, anal gland secretions are unique chemical identiﬁers of individual 
beaver (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1998). Beaver use castoreum and 
anal gland secretions as scent marks, which they actively deposit on 
piles of mud and debris called scent mounds. Beaver deposit castoreum 
by rubbing it on scent mounds during and after construction; it is not 
clear how and when anal gland secretion is applied (Svendsen 1980a). 
Most scent mounds are constructed by adult males, who gather mate­
rial in their forepaws and carry it to scent mounds in a bipedal fashion. 
Large numbers of scent mounds (>100) can be constructed within a 
territory, and they are usually placed on or near lodges, dams, and trails 
<1 m from water. Beaver of all ages place scent on mounds, but the 
frequency of marking increases with age. Males of all ages place the 
most scent marks (Hodgdon and Lancia 1983). In colder climates, con­
struction and marking of scent mounds peaks soon after ice melts in 
the spring as beaver reoccupy their full territory and reapply scent that 
faded during the winter. In warmer, ice-free regions, scent marking can 
occur all year, but still may be more intense during the spring dispersal 
period. Scent marking has been observed in December and January in 
Alabama, where mounds can reach 35.5 cm in height. 
The primary function of scent marking appears to be territorial.

occur all year, but still may be more intense during the spring dispersal 
period. Scent marking has been observed in December and January in 
Alabama, where mounds can reach 35.5 cm in height. 
The primary function of scent marking appears to be territorial. 
Scent marks may de ﬁne the location and limits of the territory by 
creating a “scent fence” (Muller-Schwarze and Heckman 1980), which 
minimizes aggressive encounters with neighbors and discourages col­
onization by dispersing beaver. Beaver can distinguish the scent of cas­
tor ﬂuid among family members, neighbors, and nonneighbors (beaver

from beyond adjacent territories). They “overmark” the scents from 
strangers more often than scents from family members (Schulte 1998). 
Use of foreign castor scent (as in trapping) may elicit investigation, 
intense scent marking, or destruction of the foreign scent as well as 
hissing and tail slapping behavior. In Ohio, an adult female built over 
70 mounds in 1 week, likely in response to the presence of castor bait 
applied by trappers (Brady and Svendsen 1981). In New Y ork, beaver 
obliterated foreign scent by pawing the mud, overmarking foreign scent, 
and transferring the mud to their own scent mounds (Muller-Schwarze 
et al. 1983). In addition, a territorial function for scent mounds may

obliterated foreign scent by pawing the mud, overmarking foreign scent, 
and transferring the mud to their own scent mounds (Muller-Schwarze 
et al. 1983). In addition, a territorial function for scent mounds may 
be expressed as a change in the motivational state of beaver. Svendsen 
(1980a) suggested that scent may increase the conﬁdence of resident 
beaver, which smell their own scent, and decrease the con ﬁdence of 
nonresident dispersing beaver, thus increasing the likelihood nonresi­
dents will ﬂee a territory “defended” by scent mounds. Experimental 
ﬁeld studies support a territorial function for scent marking, as Schulte 
(1998) found that beaver could distinguish among the scents of adjacent 
neighbors, far neighbors, and family members. Beaver spent more time 
investigating and overmarking scent from unrelated beaver than from 
family members. 
The ability of beaver to recognize relatives from nonrelatives via 
anal gland secretions (but not castoreum) may help prevent inbreeding 
as related individuals meet each other following dispersal outside their 
home territory (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1997). Experimental com­
parisons of compounds in anal gland secretions have not yet clearly 
identiﬁed underlying mechanisms, but have shown that perhaps as few 
as two or three compounds may be important in communicating fam­
ily membership (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1998). In addition, scent 
marking may help orient beaver within their territory at night, although 
this has not been experimentally demonstrated

ily membership (Sun and Muller-Schwarze 1998). In addition, scent 
marking may help orient beaver within their territory at night, although 
this has not been experimentally demonstrated. 
Scent marking by beaver may be density dependent and vary by 
season and location. In Maine, beaver colonies with close neighbors 
had more scent mounds than isolated colonies (Muller-Schwarze and 
Heckman 1980). In South Carolina, scent marking was positively cor­
related with colony density. Peak scent marking occurred in fall and 
winter, with very little marking activity in summer (Davis et al. 1994). 
Southern beaver may increase marking activity in the fall in response to 
increased food competition among colonies (Davis et al. 1994). Thus, 
scent marking in southern beaver may differ from that in northern 
beaver, which exhibit a peak of marking in the spring. 
Daily Activity Patterns. Beaver are crepuscular and nocturnal. In ice-
free areas, they follow a normal 24-hr period yearlong, but in northern 
latitudes, they do so only during spring, summer, and fall. Winter activ­
ity periods of northern beaver commonly exhibit a free-running circa­
dian rhythm of about 26–29 hr, likely because relatively constant light 
conditions preclude entrainment of a photoperiod (Lancia et al. 1982).

beaver may exhibit no detectable movement inside the lodge (Aleksuik 
and Cowan 1969; Lancia et al. 1982), an energy-saving mechanism that 
may reduce caloric needs by 20% (McKab 1963). 
Dispersal and Other Movements. Bergerud and Miller (1977) clas­
siﬁed the major movements of beaver as (1) movement of the entire 
colony between ponds within a territory; (2) short-term wandering of 
yearlings; (3) dispersal of beaver, usually at age 2 years, to establish new 
colonies; and (4) miscellaneous movement of adults, often following 
loss of a mate. Dispersal of 2-year-old beaver is the primary mechanism 
of population expansion. Dispersing individuals may return to the home 
colony for short periods of time, which suggests that dispersal is innate 
rather than learned from or encouraged by any aggressive behavior of 
parents (Hodgdon 1978). Dispersal of subadults often coincides with 
the birth of kits in the spring and/or high runoff, especially where ice 
in winter limits movements (Van Deelen and Pletscher 1996). Move­
ments in ice-free areas are less restricted, as some dispersal occurs in

 by any aggressive behavior of 
parents (Hodgdon 1978). Dispersal of subadults often coincides with 
the birth of kits in the spring and/or high runoff, especially where ice 
in winter limits movements (Van Deelen and Pletscher 1996). Move­
ments in ice-free areas are less restricted, as some dispersal occurs in 
late February and March, and scent marking and territorial defense may 
occur throughout the winter. Beaver in poor-quality habitat, or where 
trapping or other control measures have reduced populations below car­
rying capacity, may disperse at a higher rate than those in good-quality 
saturated habitat. Thus, habitat conditions may affect the length of time 
beaver remain in the family unit as subadults. However, beaver also may 
exhibit high dispersal in fully occupied habitat, which suggests disper­
sal patterns are inconsistent (Gunson 1970; Van Deelen and Pletscher 
1996). Stochastic models of beaver population growth have assumed 
density-dependent dispersal rates (Molini et al. 1980). Distance of nat­
ural dispersal varies greatly, sometimes depending on the location of 
suitable but unoccupied habitat. Direction of dispersal can be either 
upstream or downstream within a watershed, or beaver can cross wa­
tersheds by overland travel of up to several kilometers. In a study of 46 
dispersing beaver in New Y ork, 74% initiated dispersal downstream, 
35% moved to neighboring colonies, and females moved farther than 
males (Sun et al. 2000). In that study, 14% of dispersers were 1 year old, 
64% were 2 years old, and 21% were 3 years old. If the entire colony

 Y ork, 74% initiated dispersal downstream, 
35% moved to neighboring colonies, and females moved farther than 
males (Sun et al. 2000). In that study, 14% of dispersers were 1 year old, 
64% were 2 years old, and 21% were 3 years old. If the entire colony 
moves to a new location, then movement usually occurs before partu­
rition; single animals usually disperse before pairs (Hodgdon 1978). 
Distances moved and time of movement are important considerations 
in formulating management strategies. 
Home Range. Home range of a beaver depends on sex, age, social 
organization of the family unit, type of occupied habitat, and seasonal 
constraints. During the summer, parental care for kits in and near the 
lodge or den can restrict the distance that adults can forage, with females 
staying closer to kits than do males. As young become more independent 
in the fall, the home range of adults may increase, although this is not 
always the case. In areas where ice conﬁnes movements in winter, home 
range is also constrained. For example, a radiotelemetry study of beaver 
in the taiga of southeastern Manitoba showed those in family units had 
smaller average summer home ranges (8 ha) than those in nonfamily 
units (18 ha) and that home ranges were larger in summer and fall than 
in winter (Wheatley 1997a, 1997b). 
Habitat features, especially shoreline conﬁguration, strongly affect 
home range shape and size. Home ranges tend to follow the irregular 
shoreline patterns of lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. Small ponds may 
contain only a single family unit with a relatively circular home range,

 winter (Wheatley 1997a, 1997b). 
Habitat features, especially shoreline conﬁguration, strongly affect 
home range shape and size. Home ranges tend to follow the irregular 
shoreline patterns of lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. Small ponds may 
contain only a single family unit with a relatively circular home range, 
but in lakes, streams, and rivers, the home ranges of beaver are typically 
larger and more linear (Novak 1987; Wheatley 1997c). However, these 
habitat-related patterns may break down when beaver are not living 
in a sedentary family unit or during seasonal movements (Wheatley 
1997c). In addition, intraspeciﬁc competition, or territoriality, is an im­
portant mechanism, which helps to regulate population density. Boyce 
(1981a) suggested that territoriality likely was responsible for a mini­
mum intercolony distance of 1 km. Beyond that distance, availability of 
suitable sites for foraging, dams, and lodges more strongly inﬂuenced 
the distribution of colonies. 
Population Density. Beaver population density varies spatially and 
temporally. Because the home ranges of adjacent beaver families are 
usually separated by unoccupied habitat, density estimates typically in­
clude some unoccupied habitat. Factors that contribute to variation in 
density of beaver populations include human exploitation (trapping), 
water quality, habitat suitability, area available for new colonization, 
length of habitation time relative to available resources, epizootic dis­
eases, local predation events, and territoriality. There is a wide range in 
the density of beaver colonies, from near zero to at least 4.6/km 2 (re­

water quality, habitat suitability, area available for new colonization, 
length of habitation time relative to available resources, epizootic dis­
eases, local predation events, and territoriality. There is a wide range in 
the density of beaver colonies, from near zero to at least 4.6/km 2 (re­
views by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). Observers in different regions have 
attempted to estimate the maximum density or saturation point in local 
populations. Saturation has been reported to vary from 0.4 colony/km 
of stream in northern Alberta to 1.2 colonies/km of stream in New Y ork 
and Utah (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). In the headwaters of four 
Alabama watersheds, saturation approached 1.9 colonies/km of stream 
(Hill 1976). 
Trapping can suppress beaver populations below habitat-based 
carrying capacity and is an important consideration in understanding 
population dynamics. Trapping often removes a larger percentage of 
adult beaver than it does other age classes; thus, it can increase adult

mortality and affect both the density and age structure of populations. 
Intense trapping over many years can entirely decimate populations, as 
it did during European settlement of North America. In previously un­
exploited populations, trapping can cause rapid population reductions. 
In a Wisconsin study, where trapping was resumed after 19 years of 
protection, beaver populations were reduced by 21% in the ﬁrst year 
and 53% in the second year (Zeckmeister and Payne 1998). Trapping

exploited populations, trapping can cause rapid population reductions. 
In a Wisconsin study, where trapping was resumed after 19 years of 
protection, beaver populations were reduced by 21% in the ﬁrst year 
and 53% in the second year (Zeckmeister and Payne 1998). Trapping 
can also alter the age structure of populations as removal of adults 
from established territories frees suitable habitat, allowing beaver to 
disperse earlier from their natal colony and increasing their survival 
(Boyce 1981b). Comparing harvested and unharvested beaver popu­
lations in New Y ork, Muller-Schwarze and Schulte (1999) found that 
in unharvested populations, beaver colonized steeper stream gradients, 
young remained longer in the natal colony, preferred forage species 
were depleted and less preferred species were used more often, and 
beaver foraged further from their pond, lodge, or den. 
Density of beaver populations that occupy particular sites may also 
vary as a function of the length of time sites have been occupied. For ex­
ample, after beaver returned to the Prescott Peninsula in Massachusetts 
following an absence of more than 200 years, the population showed 
slow growth the ﬁrst 15 years, then 15 years of very rapid growth, and 
then a rapid decline in numbers until it stabilized at 23% of its peak. 
Populations in Sagehen Creek, California, also followed a pattern char­
acterized ﬁrst by slow growth, then rapid growth, then rapid decline to 
a level of relative stability (Busher and Lyons 1999).

Populations in Sagehen Creek, California, also followed a pattern char­
acterized ﬁrst by slow growth, then rapid growth, then rapid decline to 
a level of relative stability (Busher and Lyons 1999). 
Observers monitoring short-term trends in beaver populations 
should consider these and other intrinsic population regulation mech­
anisms (such as territoriality) as factors that might explain population 
change. These intrinsic factors can be important confounding variables 
when attempting to understand extrinsic factors affecting beaver popu­
lations, such as trapping, anthropogenic habitat alteration, and compe­
tition with other species. 
Construction of Dams, Ponds, and Canals. Beaver are unique in 
their ability to create favorable aquatic habitat by building dams to 
restrict the ﬂow of moving water, a behavior richly described in early 
literature on beaver and in many popular texts (Hilﬁker 1991). The 
widely recognized beaver dam and beaver pond have made this seldom 
seen nocturnal rodent a familiar and well-studied mammal in North 
America. 
Dams may be initiated by pushing sediment, rocks, or sticks into 
a ridge formed perpendicular to the ﬂow of moving water or by locat­
ing sites to take advantage of existing substrate (Hodgdon and Lancia 
1983). Structure is added by anchoring leafy branches, peeled branches, 
or other material to the substrate (stream bottom, stream banks, large 
rocks, or coarse, woody debris). Branches in the bulk of the dam may 
be anchored and intertwined perpendicular or parallel to the ﬂow of 
water; however, material on the downstream side is usually placed with 
the

 anchoring leafy branches, peeled branches, 
or other material to the substrate (stream bottom, stream banks, large 
rocks, or coarse, woody debris). Branches in the bulk of the dam may 
be anchored and intertwined perpendicular or parallel to the ﬂow of 
water; however, material on the downstream side is usually placed with 
the cut end pushed into the stream bottom or bank and the branched 
end pointing upstream to support and stabilize the dam. 
Beaver use woody vegetation (bark may be peeled and eaten be­
fore placement in dams) and many other materials in dams. Dams can 
include conifers, sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), tamarisk (Tamarix 
pentandra), aquatic plants, corncobs, cornstalks, plastic, metal, or 
other debris. Interestingly, when preferred foods are limited and less-
preferred foods are more abundant, beaver will select stems that are 
less palatable for dams and save the more palatable stems for food, 
especially for use in their winter food cache (Barnes and Mallik 1996; 
B. W . Baker, unpublished data). For example, Barnes and Mallik (1996) 
found that beaver preferred stems that were 1.5–3.5 cm in diameter and 
grew close to shore for dam-building material (mostly alder, Alnus 
spp.). They searched for and selected larger stems (>4.5 cm) that were 
further from the shore as food items. Thus, beaver increased risk of pre­
dation to obtain food but not dam-building material. Barnes and Mallik 
(1996) speculated that smaller stems were also better for construction 
of dams, as they might be easier to work with and provide a tighter

 and selected larger stems (>4.5 cm) that were 
further from the shore as food items. Thus, beaver increased risk of pre­
dation to obtain food but not dam-building material. Barnes and Mallik 
(1996) speculated that smaller stems were also better for construction 
of dams, as they might be easier to work with and provide a tighter 
seal against leaks. However, conventional wisdom suggests that larger 
material might make stronger dams in regions that experience high 
spring ﬂows, although this hypothesis has not been tested experimen­
tally. When woody material is in place, beaver seal the upstream side 
of the dam with mud and herbaceous vegetation (grass, leaves). They 
typically use mud from the stream bottom immediately upstream of the 
dam, making this area of the pond the deepest. If the pond overﬂows 
the channel as it develops behind the dam, then beaver will often extend 
the dam laterally by adding shallow wings. Often several dams are built 
in succession, with water from each pond backed up to the base of the 
upstream dam, creating a stair-step pattern of dams and ponds, which 
ﬂattens the slope of the drainage. 
The sound of running water is the primary cue for beaver to main­
tain and sometimes initiate dams (e.g., a noisy road culvert). Although 
beaver typically work on dams individually, sudden or loud sounds of 
running water may elicit cooperative behavior, especially to repair a 
breach in the dam (Aeschbacher and Pilleri 1983). Beaver of all ages 
inspect and repair dams, but adults perform most of the work. The lit­
erature is inconsistent about the relative efforts of males and females

running water may elicit cooperative behavior, especially to repair a 
breach in the dam (Aeschbacher and Pilleri 1983). Beaver of all ages 
inspect and repair dams, but adults perform most of the work. The lit­
erature is inconsistent about the relative efforts of males and females 
(Hodgdon 1978; Busher 1983). Beaver may initiate and maintain dams 
at any ice-free time of year; however, in many areas there is a peak of 
activity in the fall before freeze-up and again in the spring after high 
ﬂows have subsided. 
The size and number of dams in a colony and the surface area 
and volume of water in ponds vary greatly depending on duration of 
occupancy, topography, substrate, ﬂow levels, available vegetation, and 
other factors. As water spreads from primary dams within main chan­
nels, beaver often build small dams on the surface of the ﬂoodplain to 
further spread and direct water. Thus, individual dams and ponds can 
be very large or very small, with area inundated generally increasing 
through the ﬁrst few years of beaver occupancy. 
Beaver often dig canals to facilitate movement of food and building 
material within and among their ponds or increase water depth for ice-
free access to a lodge or food cache. The longer that beaver occupy a 
site, the more likely it is that they will build or extend canals to access 
new foraging areas. Canals built within the pond may not be visible 
unless the pond is drained, but canals built in theﬂoodplain may become 
obvious features of the landscape. Some canals may contain burrows 
with an underwater entrance to provide a

site, the more likely it is that they will build or extend canals to access 
new foraging areas. Canals built within the pond may not be visible 
unless the pond is drained, but canals built in theﬂoodplain may become 
obvious features of the landscape. Some canals may contain burrows 
with an underwater entrance to provide a refuge from predators. 
Beaver also create surface trails or“slides” as they transport woody 
material from their foraging area back to ponds and canals. These trails 
make it easier for beaver to drag material across the ground, permitting 
them to move material across greater distances. This is especially obvi­
ous in steep terrain, where gravity aids movement of material and can 
increase the effective foraging distance by several hundred meters. 
Lodges and Bank Dens. Beaver construct bank dens and lodges, which 
are used for protection from predators and weather. Bank dens are often 
dug under a large tree or shrub on the stream bank to provide support 
for the roof of the den. They have a nest area above the water level, an 
underwater entrance, and small holes in the surface soil to permit air 
exchange. Where beaver live exclusively in rivers or deep lakes, bank 
dens are typically the only housing structures that are built. Even where 
beaver eventually build dams and lodges, they often live in a bank den 
until more permanent structures are completed. The only place that 
bank burrows are completely absent is where the substrate prohibits 
their construction, such as areas with very rocky soils or permafrost. In 
many areas, lodges and bank dens are used. 
Lodges can be built in ponds or shallow lakes, where they are 
surrounded by water

until more permanent structures are completed. The only place that 
bank burrows are completely absent is where the substrate prohibits 
their construction, such as areas with very rocky soils or permafrost. In 
many areas, lodges and bank dens are used. 
Lodges can be built in ponds or shallow lakes, where they are 
surrounded by water, or they can be built on the shore, often as an 
upward extension of a bank den. In this case, in which they often are 
called a bank lodge, beaver add sticks on top of the bank den and cut a 
hole to create a nest chamber. This process can be extended over several 
years if dam height and water level increase. Construction of a lodge in 
open water is similar, with sticks piled high enough to enable beaver to 
cut a nest chamber above the water surface. Mud is added to the surface 
of the lodge to provide a weather seal, but a portion of the top remains 
unsealed to allow air exchange. Beaver may have multiple active and 
inactive lodges within their territory. In addition to mud and freshly cut 
branches or dead sticks, beaver lodges may include some rocks or other

material, although not as much as in dams. The presence of fresh mud 
or green branches on lodges is often used as an indicator of an active 
colony. As with dams, lodge construction is often most active in the 
fall immediately before freeze-up. In ice-free regions, construction of 
dams and lodges occurs all year, but is less active in the summer.

colony. As with dams, lodge construction is often most active in the 
fall immediately before freeze-up. In ice-free regions, construction of 
dams and lodges occurs all year, but is less active in the summer. 
Food Caches. In regions where ponds or streams freeze during the 
winter, beaver build food caches, which they access from their lodge 
by swimming under the ice. The use of food caches is uncommon or 
absent where beaver inhabit ice-free regions. Beaver typically build a 
cache by ﬁrst ﬂoating cut branches in a deep part of the pond and then 
adding new material under this raft. The branches eventually become 
water-logged and sink to the bottom, holding the cache in place. The 
upper layer of the cache, called a cap or raft, becomes frozen in ice and 
unavailable to beaver. Interestingly, beaver often use inedible or less-
preferred species for the cap and place more-preferred food items deep 
enough in the cache to remain ice free and accessible throughout the 
winter (Slough 1978; B. W . Baker, unpublished data). Differential use 
of woody plants in food caches and dams can also occur. For example, 
beaver in Ontario preferentially used conifers and alder in dams and 
aspen (Populus tremuloides) and maple in food caches (Doucet et al. 
1994a). Quality of food items in caches is especially important in colder 
climates, where gestation, parturition, and feeding of newborn young 
occur under the ice. Construction of a winter food cache usually occurs 
in late fall and is often

aspen (Populus tremuloides) and maple in food caches (Doucet et al. 
1994a). Quality of food items in caches is especially important in colder 
climates, where gestation, parturition, and feeding of newborn young 
occur under the ice. Construction of a winter food cache usually occurs 
in late fall and is often initiated by the ﬁrst hard frost. Beaver may 
build multiple food caches in a single colony and often do not consume 
the entire cache during the winter. In the spring, barked stems from the 
cache may be used to maintain the dam. During ice-free months, beaver 
sometimes forage by cutting stems on land and returning to a favored 
location at the edge of a pond to consume them in safety, leaving a pile 
of peeled stems suggestive of a winter food cache. 
ECOLOGY 
Diet. Beaver are choosy generalist herbivores, consuming a diet of 
herbaceous and woody plants, which varies considerably by region and 
season. The number of plant species in the diet is highest in the southern 
part of the range and decreases toward the northern and alpine limits of 
the range (Novak 1987). Herbaceous plants make up much of the diet 
when they are available and succulent (actively growing). In the central 
and southern United States, beaver eat a variety of aquatic and riparian 
forbs and grasses as well as cultivated row crops and grains. Roberts 
and Arner (1984) found that beaver in Mississippi depended on the bark 
of woody plants in late fall and winter, but abruptly shifted their diet to 
herbaceous species after spring greenup in March. Using stomach anal­
ysis, they identiﬁed 16 genera of herbaceous

es as well as cultivated row crops and grains. Roberts 
and Arner (1984) found that beaver in Mississippi depended on the bark 
of woody plants in late fall and winter, but abruptly shifted their diet to 
herbaceous species after spring greenup in March. Using stomach anal­
ysis, they identiﬁed 16 genera of herbaceous plants, 15 species of trees 
and shrubs, and four woody vines in the yearlong diet. Woody material 
constituted 53% of the annual diet (86% in winter, 16% in summer); 
grasses occurred in 25% of stomach samples, including some collected 
in midwinter. In an Ohio study, herbaceous plants accounted for 90% 
of the feeding time during summer and 40–50% during spring and 
fall (Svendsen 1980b). In the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, 
leaves and the growing tips of willow (Salix spp.) were the main foods in 
July and August. Bark of willow (76%), poplar (Populus balsamifera) 
(14%), and alder (A. crispa) (10%) made up the diet the rest of the year 
(Aleksiuk 1970b). The protein:calorie ratio was 40 mg/cal in summer 
and 8 mg/cal for the rest of the year, indicating that beaver in northern 
areas shift their diet to high-protein willow leaves whenever they are 
available. In northern latitudes, water lily (Nymphaea, Nuphar) is often 
the most important herbaceous component of the diet (Novak 1987). Its 
edible rhizomes remain succulent after cutting and are often stored in a 
food cache for winter use (Jenkins 1981). A variety

-protein willow leaves whenever they are 
available. In northern latitudes, water lily (Nymphaea, Nuphar) is often 
the most important herbaceous component of the diet (Novak 1987). Its 
edible rhizomes remain succulent after cutting and are often stored in a 
food cache for winter use (Jenkins 1981). A variety of grasses, sedges 
(Carex), rushes (Scirpus), and cattails (Typha) is important in the West 
and Southwest. 
Deciduous woody plants are usually the most important compo­
nent of the diet of beaver and often are the primary limiting factor 
where ice forces subsistence on a winter food cache. Beaver eat the 
leaves, buds, twigs, noncorky bark, roots, and fruits of deciduous woody 
plants, as well as acorns when available (Grinnell et al. 1937; Novak 
1987). There is wide regional variation in the number and composi­
tion of woody plant species used. As few as 3 species may be used 
by colonies in the northern range (Aleksiuk 1970), but in the southern 
range, 22 species were reported in Louisiana and 38 species in South 
Carolina (review by Hill 1982). In a review of regional food habits, No­
vak (1987) suggested that local populations of beaver in southern areas 
included more woody plant species in their diets than did northern pop­
ulations, but at regional scales the number of woody species used was 
similar. 
Conifers also are cut or gnawed by beaver and used for food or 
building material, although their value varies greatly by region and 
availability of preferred deciduous species. In the eastern United States,

 more woody plant species in their diets than did northern pop­
ulations, but at regional scales the number of woody species used was 
similar. 
Conifers also are cut or gnawed by beaver and used for food or 
building material, although their value varies greatly by region and 
availability of preferred deciduous species. In the eastern United States, 
loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and Virginia pine (P . virginiana) may make 
up over half of the woody material cut by beaver (Novak 1987). They 
may repeatedly gnaw the bark of pine trees to obtain sap (Svendsen 
1980b) or sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciﬂua) trees to obtain storax, 
an aromatic balsam, which they lick from the injured site. In many areas, 
especially in their northern and western range, any substantial use of 
conifer is considered unusual and a sign that more-preferred species 
are lacking (Novak 1987). Dietary use of conifer also may be seasonal, 
as beaver in Massachusetts selected against pine during the fall, but not 
during the rest of the year (Jenkins 1979). 
Food Preference. Preference for a particular food item indicates “it 
constitutes a signiﬁcantly larger fraction of the diet than an unbiased 
sample of items of the various food types available” (Jenkins 1981:560). 
Thus, some foods may constitute a large percentage of the diet, but may 
not be preferred over less available, but more favored species. 
Willow is often the most available and the most used woody ri­
parian species in much of the beaver ’s range. In many areas of the

Thus, some foods may constitute a large percentage of the diet, but may 
not be preferred over less available, but more favored species. 
Willow is often the most available and the most used woody ri­
parian species in much of the beaver ’s range. In many areas of the 
far north, Rocky Mountains, and intermountain west, beaver may de­
pend entirely on willow to supply winter forage and building material 
(Aleksiuk 1970b). Where aspen or poplar is available, it is usually 
more preferred than willow (Jenkins 1981). Cafeteria-style feeding ex­
periments in Ontario showed the following preferences (in descending 
order): aspen, white water lily (Nymphaea odorata), raspberry (Rubus 
idaeus), speckled alder (A. rugosa), and red maple (A. rubrum). Similar 
experiments in Nevada showed that beaver preferred aspen and avoided 
Jeffery pine (P . jeffreyi) (Basey 1999). 
Selection of forage items by beaver may be related to a variety of 
physical and chemical factors. Evidence suggests that beaver may select 
aspen resprouts based on their age-related growth form (Basey et al. 
1988, 1990). Aspen reproduces asexually by resprouting within a clone. 
Aspen clones that have been repeatedly cut by beaver produce juvenile-
form root sprouts (large leaves with an absence of lateral branching), 
which are avoided by beaver when compared to available adult-form 
root sprouts (small leaves with lateral branching). Although juvenile-
form aspen sprouts have more protein and likely provide better nutrition, 
they contain secondary metabolites that apparently cause

 that have been repeatedly cut by beaver produce juvenile-
form root sprouts (large leaves with an absence of lateral branching), 
which are avoided by beaver when compared to available adult-form 
root sprouts (small leaves with lateral branching). Although juvenile-
form aspen sprouts have more protein and likely provide better nutrition, 
they contain secondary metabolites that apparently cause avoidance 
by beaver. The importance of secondary metabolites to selection was 
further demonstrated in experiments where leaf extracts from different 
deciduous and coniferous species were painted on aspen leaves and then 
presented to beaver. Selection favored aspen leaves painted with extracts 
from deciduous species more so than those painted with extracts from 
coniferous species (Basey 1999). 
Retention time of forage passed through the digestive tract varies 
with diet composition (likely due to lignin and ﬁber content) and may 
also inﬂuence food selection by beaver. Experiments have shown that 
food preference and retention time are correlated; species with a shorter 
retention time, such as aspen, are more preferred than those with a 
longer retention time. Beaver “select a diet that maximizes long-term 
energy intake, subject to digestive limitations” (Doucet and Fryxell 
1993:201). Thus, retention time may inﬂuence intake rates and energy 
gained from different forage species, indicating it may be an important 
factor in food selection by beaver (Fryxell et al. 1994). 
Physical features of the food item may also inﬂuence selection. In 
an experimental study of foraging behavior, Doucet et al. (1994b) found

that beaver could only distinguish differences in canopy biomass on a 
very coarse scale, which suggests they selected stems using diameter as 
an index of biomass. Beaver also select foods by taste, sometimes biting 
off small samples of bark before cutting down an entire tree. In feeding 
experiments, beaver avoided aspen that had been painted with an extract 
of red maple (Muller-Schwarze et al. 1994). In areas with a variety of 
trees available for food, red maple may be the only tree left standing 
at the edge of an older beaver pond. Odor may also affect selection. In 
a similar experiment using extracts of predator feces painted on aspen 
logs, there was a strong preference against the odors of coyote, lynx, 
and river otter. Thus, predator odors may be a useful management tool 
for preventing beaver damage (Engelhart and Muller-Schwarze 1995). 
Central-Place Foraging. Beaver typically cut woody vegetation from 
terrestrial locations for food or construction material and bring it back 
to a central place, such as a pond, cache, aquatic feeding station, lodge, 
burrow, or dam. Because this behavior creates exposure to predation 
and has high energetic costs, beaver have been used to test general pre­
dictions of central-place

 cut woody vegetation from 
terrestrial locations for food or construction material and bring it back 
to a central place, such as a pond, cache, aquatic feeding station, lodge, 
burrow, or dam. Because this behavior creates exposure to predation 
and has high energetic costs, beaver have been used to test general pre­
dictions of central-place foraging theory. These predictions suggest that 
beaver should modify their behavior to concentrate foraging near the 
central place and should increase their selectivity for size and species 
away from the central place (Fryxell 1992). Most studies have con­
ﬁrmed these general predictions, but exceptions to these patterns occur. 
For example, studies conﬁrmed that beaver typically cut increasingly 
smaller stems (less provisioning time) further from the central place, as 
predicted by optimal foraging models (Jenkins 1980; Belovsky 1984; 
Fryxell and Doucet 1990). In contrast, where relatively small (1.5– 
30 mm) stems are the only woody plants available, beaver may select 
larger stems even when located further from the central place (McGinley 
and Whitman 1985). Selection for larger stems is particularly evident 
where beaver occupy shrub habitats, such as those containing only 
smaller species of willow and alder. In some cases, repeated cutting by 
beaver can cause trees to develop and maintain a shrubby growth form 
(e.g., Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii; McGinley and Whitman 
1985). 
The size–distance relation in food selection by beaver also may 
be affected by species preferences. For example, Jenkins (1980) found 
that beaver cut larger stems of preferred species, such as
Text Len: 1656
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 develop and maintain a shrubby growth form 
(e.g., Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii; McGinley and Whitman 
1985). 
The size–distance relation in food selection by beaver also may 
be affected by species preferences. For example, Jenkins (1980) found 
that beaver cut larger stems of preferred species, such as oak and cherry 
(Prunus), further from the central place than less-preferred species. 
In contrast, although Belovsky (1984) did ﬁnd that beaver had strong 
food preferences, preferences did not change relative to distance from 
beaver ponds. In many cases, the interaction of species preferences 
with stem size and distance from the central place has been difﬁcult to 
document in the ﬁeld because depth to water and other plant-growing 
conditions preclude equal availability of stems to beaver. Modeling the 
diet of beaver is one way to overcome limitations of ﬁeld experiments. 
For example, Belovsky (1984:220) found that beaver at Isle Royale 
selected their diet “consistent with an energy-maximizing solution to 
a linear-programming model.” This energy maximization model was 
further conﬁrmed by Fryxell (1992) with a second line of evidence, 
which found both density and distance were important predictors of 
food selection by beaver. 
Chemical factors and stem size may also inﬂuence stem selection 
by beaver. If aspen responds to repeated beaver cutting by producing 
a juvenile growth form, then higher concentrations of phenolic com­
pounds (secondary metabolites) may inhibit further cutting by beaver 
and inﬂuence the

food selection by beaver. 
Chemical factors and stem size may also inﬂuence stem selection 
by beaver. If aspen responds to repeated beaver cutting by producing 
a juvenile growth form, then higher concentrations of phenolic com­
pounds (secondary metabolites) may inhibit further cutting by beaver 
and inﬂuence the predictive value of optimal foraging models for beaver. 
Basey et al. (1988) found beaver avoided aspen stems <4.5 cm in diam­
eter in favor of those >19.5 cm in diameter near a 20-year-old beaver 
pond where 51% of stems had been previously cut by beaver and the 
remaining 49% of stems were in juvenile form. In contrast, beaver at 
a newly occupied site selected smaller aspen stems and against larger 
ones. Taken together, these results suggest that phenolic compounds, 
or other factors in addition to size of stem, may inﬂuence selection by 
beaver. 
Food Consumption and Production. Estimates of daily forage con­
sumption rates (wet woody biomass) for beaver vary from 0.5 kg/day 
(Dyck and MacArthur 1993) to 2.0 kg/day (review by Stegeman 1954). 
ln an interesting account of a Colorado beaver colony fed by a Forest 
Service contractor in the 1920s, it was estimated that each beaver con­
sumed (although possible use in dams was not described) an average 
of about 900 kg of green aspen/year (Warren 1940). In a study of the 
energy content and digestibility of cached woody biomass, Dyck and 
MacArthur (1993) concluded that the total winter energy requirements 
could not be met from the submerged

sumed (although possible use in dams was not described) an average 
of about 900 kg of green aspen/year (Warren 1940). In a study of the 
energy content and digestibility of cached woody biomass, Dyck and 
MacArthur (1993) concluded that the total winter energy requirements 
could not be met from the submerged food cache in their study colony. 
Supporting research has shown that when food is limited, beaver may 
metabolize body tissue during winter. 
Estimates of beaver food (twigs and bark) produced by trees and 
shrubs may be useful for predicting the carrying capacity of beaver 
where woody biomass limits population density. Beaver food estimates 
are derived from graphs or equations that model annual production 
(current annual growth) and total biomass based on measures of basal 
stem diameter. Estimates have been derived for aspen (Aldous 1938; 
Stegeman 1954), willow (Baker and Cade 1995), and ﬁve species of ri­
parian shrubs in Minnesota (Buech and Rugg 1995). The maximum 
diameter of twigs that are entirely consumed by beaver is a criti­
cal consideration in deriving estimates of beaver food. The diameter 
used is often based on assumptions made from observing the size of 
peeled stems, but may vary greatly by species and region. For example, 
Aldous (1938) assumed beaver ate all stem portions <12.7 mm in di­
ameter for aspen, Buech and Rugg (1995) assumed <5 mm for Min­
nesota shrubs, and Baker and Cade (1995) assumed <3 mm for coyote

ameter for aspen, Buech and Rugg (1995) assumed <5 mm for Min­
nesota shrubs, and Baker and Cade (1995) assumed <3 mm for coyote 
willow (S. exigua). Application of results among studies and differ­
ent woody species requires caution. In addition, intense ungulate or 
livestock herbivory of the terminal leaders on shrubs may strongly re­
duce the biomass of beaver food relative to unbrowsed stems of equal 
diameter (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). 
Habitat Requirements. The ability of beaver to alter existing habi­
tat conditions to meet their needs has allowed populations to inhabit a 
variety of natural and human-made habitats in North America. They 
have successfully colonized tundra and taiga in the far North, bottom­
land hardwood forests and marshes in the deep South, riparian areas 
in both cold and hot deserts, and elevations that vary from sea level to 
above 3400 m (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). Although beaver 
can occupy a wide variety of habitats, some generalizations are evi­
dent. A comprehensive evaluation of beaver habitat requirements in the 
Rocky Mountains showed they generally preferred wide valleys with 
a low (<6%) stream gradient, which offered relatively more food and 
reduced risk of severe ﬂoods (Retzer et al. 1956). Beaver typically in­
habit streams with at least intermittent ﬂow and lakes or ponds with 
standing water, but they can also inhabit bogs that lack open water. In 
Minnesota, they occur in sedge-moss and other

, which offered relatively more food and 
reduced risk of severe ﬂoods (Retzer et al. 1956). Beaver typically in­
habit streams with at least intermittent ﬂow and lakes or ponds with 
standing water, but they can also inhabit bogs that lack open water. In 
Minnesota, they occur in sedge-moss and other bogs, where they can 
enlarge natural moats to create ponds of standing water and build ﬂoat­
ing lodges able to adjust to ﬂuctuating water levels, and thus maintain 
protection from predators (Rebertus 1986). 
Early studies of beaver formed the foundation for later math­
ematical models, which quanti ﬁed habitat requirements and created 
a framework for making and testing predictions. Slough and Sadleir 
(1977) sampled colony density and associated habitat conditions at 
136 lakes and 45 stream sites in Ontario and used regression analysis 
to develop a land classiﬁcation system for beaver. Howard and Larson 
(1985) used principal component analysis of habitat variables to predict 
beaver colony density in Massachusetts. Percentage hardwood vegeta­
tion, watershed size, stream width, and stream gradient were important 
predictors in their classiﬁcation system. Allen (1983) used existing lit­
erature and expert opinion to develop a general habitat suitability index 
(HSI) model for beaver, which used nine variables to rate habitat qual­
ity on a scale of 0.0–1.0. These variables included measures of canopy 
cover, height, stem diameter, species of trees and shrubs, stream gradi­
ent, water level ﬂuctuation, and shoreline development (ratio of length 
and area). The HSI model assumed a

 which used nine variables to rate habitat qual­
ity on a scale of 0.0–1.0. These variables included measures of canopy 
cover, height, stem diameter, species of trees and shrubs, stream gradi­
ent, water level ﬂuctuation, and shoreline development (ratio of length 
and area). The HSI model assumed a minimum habitat area of 0.8 km of 
stream or 1.3 km2 of lake or marsh as a prerequisite of suitable beaver 
habitat. This model has been widely used by environmental planners 
to quantify potential impacts from development projects and mitigate 
habitat loss.

Other researchers have developed alternative habitat models and 
modiﬁed existing models for different habitats and regions. For ex­
ample, researchers in prairie regions found beaver selected riverine 
lodge-site locations in areas that had thick, concealing vegetation cover 
(which was often left uncut) and steep shoreline banks (Dieter and 
McCabe 1989). In the Truckee River basin of California, physical fea­
tures of the stream, such as a lower gradient and a greater depth and 
width, were more important than vegetation in describing the location 
of lodge sites selected by beaver (Beier and Barrett 1987). In contrast, 
Barnes and Mallik (1997) found that concentration of woody plants 1.5– 
4.4 cm in diameter and size of the stream and its upstream watershed 
area were important predictors of dam-site location in northern Ontario. 
In Oregon streams, McComb et al. (1990) found that

 (Beier and Barrett 1987). In contrast, 
Barnes and Mallik (1997) found that concentration of woody plants 1.5– 
4.4 cm in diameter and size of the stream and its upstream watershed 
area were important predictors of dam-site location in northern Ontario. 
In Oregon streams, McComb et al. (1990) found that beaver selected 
dam sites where the substrate was less rocky, the water was shallower, 
the channel had a lower gradient, and woody vegetation (e.g., Alnus) 
had a greater canopy cover. They concluded that Allen ’s (1983) HSI 
model was useful in predicting habitat quality for beaver at their sites, 
but required some site-speciﬁc modiﬁcations. 
In contrast, others have found that Allen’s HSI model was a poor 
predictor of beaver habitat quality in their region. For example, a Kansas 
study suggested that water quality, river substrate type, and adjacent 
agricultural land-use practices are important predictors of riverine habi­
tat quality for beaver in the central United States (Robel et al. 1993). 
In an Oregon study, many potential beaver sites were highly rated by 
the HSI model even though they were unoccupied by beaver at the time 
of study, which suggested poor model performance to the investiga­
tors (Suzuki and McComb 1998). However, low density or absence of 
beaver in apparently suitable habitat is not unusual and may be caused 
by many non-habitat-based factors, such as trapping, disease, territori­
ality, or simply the inherent variation of natural systems. At occupied

beaver in apparently suitable habitat is not unusual and may be caused 
by many non-habitat-based factors, such as trapping, disease, territori­
ality, or simply the inherent variation of natural systems. At occupied 
sites, cutting of preferred species by beaver may alter the density and 
species composition of vegetation, and thus affect how the habitat might 
be rated by habitat models (Suzuki and McComb 1998). 
MORTALITY 
Predation. Predation by the timber wolf (Canis lupus) can be an im­
portant limiting factor of beaver populations where they occur together. 
Wolves prey on beaver during the ice-free period, when nearly half their 
diet may consist of beaver (Potvin et al. 1992). In Algonquin Park, 
Ontario, as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations de­
clined over a 9-year period, beaver gradually became the most important 
prey item: 55% of wolf scats had beaver remains (V oigt et al. 1976). In 
an experimental study in Quebec, density of beaver colonies increased 
20% after 3 years of wolf control and then declined again after wolf 
control ceased, indicating wolf predation may have suppressed popu­
lations below the carrying capacity of the habitat (Potvin et al. 1992). 
Habitat conditions that force beaver to forage farther from water may in­
crease predation rates by wolves. On Isle Royale, beaver foraged further 
(>100 m) from ponds when wolf populations were low and closer (<35 
m) to ponds when wolf populations were high (D. W .

 habitat (Potvin et al. 1992). 
Habitat conditions that force beaver to forage farther from water may in­
crease predation rates by wolves. On Isle Royale, beaver foraged further 
(>100 m) from ponds when wolf populations were low and closer (<35 
m) to ponds when wolf populations were high (D. W . Smith, unpub­
lished data). Thus, the impact of wolf predation on beaver populations 
can be locally signiﬁcant, but varies greatly depending on wolf density, 
alternative prey availability, and other factors. 
Coyotes (Canis latrans) and mountain lions (Puma concolor) also 
prey on beaver, as do some other mammalian predators of generally 
minor importance, such as bears (Ursus spp.), wolverines (Gulo gulo), 
river otters (Lontra canadensis), lynx (Lynx canadensis), bobcat (Lynx 
rufus), and mink (Mustela vison) (review by Hill 1982). However, un­
usual circumstances can alter typical predation patterns. Black bear (U. 
americanus) predation strongly suppressed beaver populations on an is­
land in Lake Superior (Smith et al. 1994). In this case, bears colonized 
one of two similar islands in the 1970s that beaver had colonized in the 
late 1940s or early 1950s. As the bear population grew, they focused 
predation on beaver, the only source of meat on the island, digging into 
18 of 26 beaver lodges and causing surviving beaver to concentrate 
foraging on trees <30 m from water.

predation on beaver, the only source of meat on the island, digging into 
18 of 26 beaver lodges and causing surviving beaver to concentrate 
foraging on trees <30 m from water. 
Disease. Water-borne tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the 
bacterium Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B), which 
commonly occurs in semiaquatic mammals such as beaver and muskrat 
(Ondatra zibethicus) and occasionally becomes epizootic. T ype B tu­
laremia is not fatal to humans and is responsible for only 5 –10% of 
human tularemia infections in North America. T ype A tularemia is re­
sponsible for the remaining human infections. It can be fatal to humans 
and has a terrestrial cycle in rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) and ticks (Morner 
1992). Tularemia infections in beaver are typically subclinical without 
noticeable effects on the individual or the population, but they can be fa­
tal to beaver and cause mass mortality from local or regional epizootics. 
Tularemia in beaver sometimes can be traced to infections in terrestrial 
rodents that deposit urine or feces in water, or die in water, which then 
harbors F . tularensis bacteria. For example, an outbreak of tularemia 
in Montana during 1939–1940 caused widespread mortality of beaver 
(several hundred carcasses were found) and coincident infection and 
mortality of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) that inhabited 
the grassy streambanks (Jellison et al. 1942

mortality of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) that inhabited

been documented in beaver, but little is known about its pathogene­
sis or epizootiology (J. Rupprecht, 47th Wildlife Disease Association 
Conference, oral commun., 1998). 
Other Mortality. Starvation can be an important cause of mortality, 
especially at northern latitudes, when beaver are unable to construct a 
food cache large enough to sustain them through the winter (Gunson 
1970; Bergerud and Miller 1977). Sudden snowmelts in midwinter or 
violent spring breakups can raise water levels in streams and may de­
stroy lodges and occupants or drown large numbers of beaver under the 
ice (Hakala 1952). 
BEA VER AS A KEYSTONE SPECIES AND 
AN ECOSYSTEM ENGINEER 
A keystone species is one that greatly in ﬂuences the species compo­
sition and physical appearance of ecosystems (Paine 1969) and whose 
effects on ecosystem structure and function are both large overall and 
disproportionately large relative to its abundance (Power et al. 1996). 
An ecosystem engineer is a species that directly or indirectly controls 
resource availability by causing “physical state changes in biotic or 
abiotic materials” (Jones et al. 1997:1946). The beaver is a de ﬁnitive 
example of both a keystone species and an ecosystem engineer.

 to its abundance (Power et al. 1996). 
An ecosystem engineer is a species that directly or indirectly controls 
resource availability by causing “physical state changes in biotic or 
abiotic materials” (Jones et al. 1997:1946). The beaver is a de ﬁnitive 
example of both a keystone species and an ecosystem engineer. 
The dam-building, canal-building, and foraging activities of 
beaver have profound effects on ecosystem structure and function. 
Beaver dams slow current velocity, increase deposition and retention of 
sediment and organic matter in the pond, reduce turbidity downstream 
of the dam, increase the area of soil–water interface, elevate the water 
table, change the annual stream discharge rate by retaining precipita­
tion runoff during high ﬂows and slowly releasing it during low ﬂows, 
alter stream gradients by creating a stair-step pro ﬁle, and increase re­
sistance to disturbance (reviews by Naiman et al. 1988; Gurnell 1998). 
Canals dug by beaver spread impounded water across a larger surface 
area, and thus magnify the effects of single dams. The foraging ac­
tivity of beaver alters the species composition, density, growth form, 
and distribution of woody vegetation. These effects on vegetation and 
the physical characteristics of streams strongly alter the composition 
of the animal community. Because research did not begin until after 
beaver populations recovered following near extinction by presettle­
ment trapping and extensive habitat loss, researchers have observed a 
human-impacted and likely conservative picture of how beaver have 
altered ecosystem structure and function (Naiman et al. 1988).

Effects of Beaver on Geological Processes. In 1938, researchers eval­
uating the formation of broad, ﬂat alluvial valleys in the Catskill region 
of New Y ork discovered that geological processes alone could not ex­
plain observed sediment deposition rates (Ruedemann and Schoon­
maker 1938). They suggested that during the 25,000 years since the 
last glaciation, layer on layer of sediment-ﬁlled beaver ponds caused 
the “complete aggrading of valleyﬂoors, originally in small descending 
steps, which disappear in time and leave a gently graded, even valley

plain horizontal from bank to bank” (Ruedemann and Schoonmaker 
1938:525). Unfortunately, the theory of beaver-assisted alluvial val­
ley formation remains largely unproven by rigorous research across 
varied landscapes. One exception is a study in Glacier National Park, 
Montana, where comparisons of sediment depth and pond age con­
ﬁrmed that beaver ponds gradually accumulated sediment as they aged 
(Meentemeyer and Butler 1999). Thus, unless dams fail, beaver ponds 
will eventually ﬁll with sediment and become beaver meadows. This 
process of accelerated meadow development by beaver dams is likely 
more important in meandering, low-gradient, valley-bottom streams,

aver ponds gradually accumulated sediment as they aged 
(Meentemeyer and Butler 1999). Thus, unless dams fail, beaver ponds 
will eventually ﬁll with sediment and become beaver meadows. This 
process of accelerated meadow development by beaver dams is likely 
more important in meandering, low-gradient, valley-bottom streams, 
where conditions favor stable dams that spread sediment-laden water 
over a large surface area, rather than in steep, V-shaped, high-energy 
streams, where beaver dams tend to fail at a greater rate. 
Beaver dams also affect erosional processes within stream chan­
nels, typically increasing channel aggradation. As sediment-loaded 
water enters a beaver pond, it slows in velocity and drops sediment, 
increasing aggradation. However, water downstream of dams can be 
underloaded with sediment and increase erosional forces as the stream 
regains lost sediment (Meentemeyer and Butler 1999). This can lead 
to a localized increase in bank sloughing below beaver dams in areas 
with erosive soils. In most cases, the net effect of beaver dams is to 
decrease channel and streambank erosion and increase channel aggra­
dation (Parker et al. 1985). Catastrophic beaver dam failures are rare 
events, but can occur following unusually large rainfalls or high spring 
runoffs. In 1994, a beaver dam in central Alberta failed and released 
7500 m3 of water, causing a ﬂood wave that was 3.5 times the maxi­
mum recorded discharge for the stream (Hillman 1998). In this case, the 
ﬂood wave was largely attenuated by downstream wetlands, including 
several beaver ponds.

mum recorded discharge for the stream (Hillman 1998). In this case, the 
ﬂood wave was largely attenuated by downstream wetlands, including 
several beaver ponds. 
Beaver dams may also act as a ﬁlter to decrease nonpoint-source 
water pollution. In a study of Currant Creek, Wyoming, a highly erosive 
second-order stream, concentrations of suspended solids, total phos­
phorus, sodium hydroxide-extractable phosphorus (biologically avail­
able P), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were reduced in water ﬂowing 
through beaver ponds during high spring runoff (Maret et al. 1987). 
The effect of beaver ponds on these parameters continued during sum­
mer lowﬂows, but was of lower magnitude. Effects disappeared at about 
1.6 km below the beaver dams, likely due to inputs from bank erosion 
(Parker et al. 1985; Maret et al. 1987). Beaver ponds may also inﬂuence 
water quality by affecting the number and composition of bacteria in 
the stream. In Wyoming, some species of bacteria apparently increased 
and others decreased as water ﬂowed through beaver ponds; however, 
results were confounded by the effects of different livestock grazing 
systems (Skinner et al. 1984).

 by the effects of different livestock grazing 
systems (Skinner et al. 1984). 
Effects of Beaver on Ecological Processes. In addition to geologi­
cal affects, beaver alter the landscape by creating layers of spatially 
distinct volumetric units, or patch bodies, which include the bedrock, 
the water-saturated anerobic soil under the pond, the moist aerobic soil 
at the water’s edge, the pond, the browse zone concentric to the pond 
or central place, and the overlying atmosphere (Johnston and Naiman 
1987). These patch bodies create a shifting mosaic of conditions in the 
landscape, which varies spatially and temporally as beaver populations 
colonize new territory or abandon old sites (Naiman et al. 1988). The 
inherent habitat matrix strongly inﬂuences how these patch bodies af­
fect ecosystem process. Effects are greatest where contrast is greatest. 
Beaver that create dams in existing wetlands have less effect than those 
that dam streams in upland forest or desert shrubland. Basin geomor­
phology and length of occupancy also affect the magnitude of inﬂuence. 
Beaver typically select the best pond sites ﬁrst and move to less desir­
able sites as populations grow or as resources are depleted. Ponds built 
in better sites have greater longevity and affect the disturbance dynam­
ics in the system. In a Minnesota study, a series of aerial photographs 
between 1940 and 1986 showed the rate of patch formation was much 
greater during the ﬁrst two decades following colonization than during 
the second two decades, which suggests that geomorphology eventually 
limited the availability of pond sites after the initial better sites were 
occupied (Johnston and Naiman 1990

the second two decades, which suggests that geomorphology eventually 
limited the availability of pond sites after the initial better sites were 
occupied (Johnston and Naiman 1990a). 
Beaver activity strongly alters the biogeochemical characteristics 
of watersheds through the accumulation, availability (standing stocks), 
and translocation of nutrients and ions (Naiman et al. 1994). In a com­
parison of stream rifﬂe areas to beaver ponds, Naiman et al. (1988) 
showed rifﬂes had only 48% of the carbon inputs, 5% of the carbon 
standing stock, and 6% of the carbon outputs as did beaver ponds. In 
addition, the turnover time of carbon in beaver ponds averaged 161 
years, much slower than the 24 years found in rif ﬂes. Beaver ponds 
affect the amount and distribution of nitrogen in the system, as ponds 
create anerobic conditions, slow ﬂows, and increase oxygen demand by 
retaining organic matter. In Quebec, a beaver-modiﬁed section of stream 
“accumulated 103 times more nitrogen than before alteration” (Naiman 
and Melillo 1984:150). Anerobic conditions caused by water-saturated 
soils in beaver ponds fundamentally alter biogeochemical pathways 
(Naiman et al. 1994). When beaver create ponds in forested uplands,

 Anerobic conditions caused by water-saturated 
soils in beaver ponds fundamentally alter biogeochemical pathways 
(Naiman et al. 1994). When beaver create ponds in forested uplands, 
most upland vegetation dies from inundation and woody material cut 
by beaver is moved to the stream for dams and lodges. The organic 
horizons of pond sediments accumulate chemical elements from for­
merly upland plants that become available for vegetative growth when 
the ponds ﬁll with sediments or dams fail and abandoned sites be­
come beaver meadows. Even small dams can accumulate a tremendous 
amount of sediment. For example, dams containing 4 –18 m3 of wood 
retained 2000–6500 m3 of pond sediment in a boreal forest system in 
Quebec (Naiman et al. 1986). In a long-term Minnesota study, beaver 
activities increased the standing stock of chemical elements in the or­
ganic horizon of ponds by 20–295% (Naiman et al. 1994). Transport 
of water through beaver ponds can also neutralize acids, increase pH, 
and increase dissolved oxygen concentrations in acidic stream sys­
tems (M. E. Smith, et al. 1991). Thus, the activities of beaver can 
strongly modify the biogeochemical characteristics of stream systems 
and fundamentally inﬂuence forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape 
scales. 
Effects of Beaver on Invertebrates. Beaver ponds affect the species 
composition and abundance of stream invertebrates as the commu­

Effects of Beaver on Invertebrates. Beaver ponds affect the species 
composition and abundance of stream invertebrates as the commu­
nity responds to increased sediment deposition and still water behind 
dams. Invertebrate taxa that prefer running water are replaced by pond 
taxa. Community function is changed as collectors and predators in­
crease in importance and shredders and scrapers decrease in importance 
(McDowell and Naiman 1986; Naiman et al. 1988). In Quebec, density 
and biomass of invertebrates in pond sites were two toﬁve times greater 
than in rifﬂe sites in the spring and summer, but were similar in the fall 
(McDowell and Naiman 1986). The number of species in ponds was 
similar to that in the natural stream channel, but resembled that in slow-
water habitats of larger order streams, indicating that invertebrates in the 
beaver ponds may not be unique in the watershed (Naiman et al. 1988). 
In a study that compared stream rifﬂe sites above and below beaver 
dams in the Adirondack Mountains, sites immediately below dams had 
lower invertebrate richness and diversity, but higher total invertebrate, 
predator, and collector–gatherer densities (M. E. Smith et al. 1991). 
Beaver may also affect the invertebrate community by changing 
the structure and chemistry of plant hosts. In a study of leaf beetles 
(Chrysomela conﬂuens) and their cottonwood (P . fremontii × P . angus­
tifolia) hosts, beetles were attracted to beaver-cut cottonwood regrowth 
even though it contained twice the level of defensive chemicals (to pro­

the structure and chemistry of plant hosts. In a study of leaf beetles 
(Chrysomela conﬂuens) and their cottonwood (P . fremontii × P . angus­
tifolia) hosts, beetles were attracted to beaver-cut cottonwood regrowth 
even though it contained twice the level of defensive chemicals (to pro­
tect the plant from herbivory) as normal juvenile regrowth (Martinsen 
et al. 1998). In this case, beetles may have sequestered these chemicals 
for their own defense against mammalian predators. Beetles also may 
have obtained a nutritional beneﬁt from beaver-cut regrowth because it 
contained more total nitrogen than nonresprout growth. Thus, beetles 
grew faster and were heavier at maturity. 
Beaver impoundments also may affect local mosquito populations, 
but not necessarily as conventional wisdom might suggest. At a New 
Y ork site, observers noted marked reductions in mosquito populations 
after beaver impounded an area of poorly drained forest (Butts 1992). 
Before impoundment, the area supported large larval populations of 
the Aedes mosquito, which is unable to breed in the permanent water 
developed by beaver.

may alter the density, distribution, species composition, and population 
characteristics of ﬁsh populations. Trout habitat in streams is usually 
improved by beaver where low ﬂows or cold water temperatures limit 
trout distribution or production. However, trout may be harmed if water 
is warmed beyond their tolerance. Beaver beneﬁt trout by creating deep 
pools, which resist freezing in winter (often capped with ice and snow, 
which prevents formation of anchor ice) and maintain cooler tempera­
tures in summer. Beaver provide additional beneﬁts by increasing the 
size of the wetland area, improving physical cover, and increasing the 
invertebrate forage base because of changes in the substrate and higher 
water temperatures in ponds (reviews by Hill 1982; Olson and Hubert 
1994). In Wyoming, standing stock (kg/ha) and density of brook trout 
(Salvelinus fontinalis) in beaver ponds were correlated with surface 
area, mean water depth, water volume, discharge into pond, elevation, 
and a morphoedaphic index (Winkle et al. 1990). However, where trout 
populations are limited by high water temperature in the eastern United 
States, beaver ponds may increase temperatures beyond tolerable limits, 
and beaver dams are often removed to improve trout habitat. However, a 
study of the thermal effects of beaver dams in Wisconsin found no con­
sistent relationship between size or number of beaver ponds and degree 
of downstream warming (McRae and Edwards 1994). They found that 
large ponds may act as thermal buffers, which dampen dailyﬂuctuations 
in water temperature and only slightly raise downstream temperatures.

large ponds may act as thermal buffers, which dampen dailyﬂuctuations

Thus, large-scale beaver dam removal in headwater streams may have 
net negative consequences on trout populations as their positive effects 
on invertebrates and ecosystem processes are lost. 
Beaver dams may be detrimental to populations of trout and salmon 
if they restrict or prevent ﬁsh passage. However, some studies have 
shown that trout can pass over dams during high water and may pass 
through newly constructed dams at any season (review by Olson and 
Hubert 1994). In the Paciﬁc Northwest, many beaver dams are par­
tially washed out each year by winter high water. However, dams can 
still beneﬁt ﬁsh that use the remaining ends for cover, thus providing 
value as coarse, woody debris. During summer low ﬂows in this area, 
beaver dams improved rearing habitat for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus 
kisutch), as beaver ponds were larger and contained more coho fry than 
pools without beaver (Leidholt-Bruner et al. 1992).

Beaver activities can have profound effects on ﬁsh community 
structure. In an experimental study of a headwater stream in north­
ern Minnesota, beaver ponds appeared to act as reproductive “source” 
populations for ﬁsh, which dispersed to adjacent streams, which func­
tioned as reproductive “sinks” in the landscape. Thus, the boundary 
inﬂuences of beaver ponds were “critical in controlling ﬁsh dispersal 
between ponds and streams and the subsequent abundance and compo­
sition of ﬁsh in lotic ecosystems” (I. J. Schlosser 1995:908). The age 
and size of beaver ponds also affect stream dynamics. In Georgia, ﬁsh 
species richness per pond increased until ponds were 9 –17 years old 
and then decreased as ponds aged in headwater streams, but showed lit­
tle change relative to pond age in downstream sections (Snodgrass and 
Meffe 1998). In larger ponds, ﬁsh species shifted from lotic to lentic 
species, and larger predators replaced small-bodied minnows in older 
ponds. The size of beaver ponds is also important. As expected from 
general species–area relationships, ﬁsh species richness increases with 
size of pond, but very small beaver ponds can have higher than expected 
richness compared to ponds of a similar size not impounded by beaver 
(Keast and Fox 1990). Thus, beaver have a strong effect on ﬁsh species 
richness, but the effect is dependent on the size and age of beaver ponds 
and how ponds are distributed within the landscape.

(Keast and Fox 1990). Thus, beaver have a strong effect on ﬁsh species 
richness, but the effect is dependent on the size and age of beaver ponds 
and how ponds are distributed within the landscape. 
Effects of Beaver on V egetation. Beaver affect vegetation by building 
dams and removing woody plants as food and building material. Beaver 
dams raise the water table by creating a pond area that may be inundated 
by several meters of water and an umbrella-shaped zone of inﬂuence 
that radiates out from the pond, creating a new water table gradient 
controlled by soil texture and other factors. The soil behind dams can 
act like a sponge, retaining water during wetter months and slowly re­
leasing it during drier months. In areas of low or irregular precipitation, 
beaver dams may convert streams from intermittent ﬂow to perennial 
ﬂow. Changes in the amount, timing, or duration of available water can 
create a competitive advantage for many species of riparian–wetland 
plants, thus increasing their survival and dominance in the landscape. 
For example, in some western shrub–steppe ecosystems, beaver may 
help control invasive tamarisk by creating a competitive advantage for 
willow as dams alter hydrological and ecological conditions within in­
cised stream channels (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). Higher water tables 
caused by beaver ponds generally kill upland vegetation and promote 
establishment and growth of wetland vegetation.

caused by beaver ponds generally kill upland vegetation and promote 
establishment and growth of wetland vegetation. 
Beaver can improve conditions for seedling establishment of wil­
low, cottonwood, and other riparian species. Sediment deposited behind 
beaver dams creates an ideal moist soil substrate, which can become 
exposed as water levels in the pond decrease due to a dam washout or 
other cause. Beaver cuttings may be an important mechanism of plant 
establishment for some woody species such as willow (Cottrell 1995). 
Stems that are cut by beaver but not eaten can become imbedded in 
dams, lodges, or moist soil in or near ponds and sprout adventitious 
roots and new stem growth. Because a high percentage of stem seg­
ments is not consumed by beaver, they may substantially contribute to 
plant establishment, although the relative importance of this method is 
not well understood at the community level. 
Cutting by beaver can stimulate vigorous resprouting, which may 
increase biomass production in many woody riparian species. Plants 
can sprout new shoots by activating dormant meristems located below 
the cut on the same stem or on below ground plant tissue, or from pre­
viously developed root suckers. In a study of red willow (S. lasiandra) 
in Oregon, trees that had a higher percentage of stems cut by beaver 
responded by producing a higher percentage of regrowth the follow­
ing season (Kindschy 1985). Where stem cutting is concentrated in 
late fall to build dams or prepare a food cache, plants are dormant 
when cut and respond with new shoots in the next spring in an attempt 
to recover former root:shoot ratios,

 higher percentage of stems cut by beaver 
responded by producing a higher percentage of regrowth the follow­
ing season (Kindschy 1985). Where stem cutting is concentrated in 
late fall to build dams or prepare a food cache, plants are dormant 
when cut and respond with new shoots in the next spring in an attempt 
to recover former root:shoot ratios, maximizing plant production and 
minimizing plant damage. Cutting by beaver can also stimulate plants to 
initiate growth earlier in the spring, further increasing stem production 
(Kindschy 1989). However, biomass of new shoots can be decreased if 
regrowth is browsed by native ungulates or livestock. 
The interaction of stem cutting by beaver and intense browsing by 
livestock or native ungulates can strongly suppress regrowth and may 
result in declining riparian plant communities. Summer browsing by 
livestock that congregate along riparian areas can be particularly detri­
mental to recovery of beaver-cut willow, when new green shoots become 
highly preferred as grasses cure and become less palatable (Kindschy 
1989). Intense browsing by native herbivores can also severely suppress 
regrowth of beaver-cut stems. When beaver cut tall stems, regrowth oc­
curs at or near ground level, placing the apical portions of stems within 
easy reach of herbivores. Browsing the tips of stems (leaders) releases 
apical dominance and may cause plants to develop a short stature. In 
an experimental study at Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, in­
tense elk (Cervus elaphus) browsing of willow (S. monticola) regrowth

an experimental study at Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, in­
tense elk (Cervus elaphus) browsing of willow (S. monticola) regrowth 
during 3 years following simulated beaver cutting produced plants of 
low vigor, which were small, short, and hedged with a high percentage 
of dead stems (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). In contrast, regrowth of 
unbrowsed plants was vigorous, large, tall, highly branched, and leafy 
with a low percentage of dead stems. Browsed and unbrowsed plants re­
covered more stems per plant (about 70 after 3 years) than were present 
before simulated beaver cutting, but elk browsing strongly suppressed 
recovery of plant biomass. After 2 years of regrowth, browsed plants 
had recovered only 6% of their precut biomass, whereas unbrowsed 
plants had recovered 84%. Thus, beaver cutting and elk browsing may 
interact to decrease woody plant height and biomass, eventually re­
ducing beaver habitat suitability and the positive effects of beaver on 
community structure and function. 
Foraging by beaver can signiﬁcantly alter forest composition and 
plant succession. Besides humans, beaver are the only species in 
North America that can affect overstory vegetation by felling mature 
trees (Johnston and Naiman 1990b). In contrast to many other herbi­
vores, beaver foraging is restricted to a central place within riparian

communities where their habit of felling much more woody material 
than they actually consume dramatically increases the magnitude of 
their effects relative to other woody-plant foragers. In a Minnesota 
study, intense foraging by beaver decreased tree density and basal area 
by up to 43% near ponds, where individual beaver harvested an average 
of 1400 kg/ha/year of woody biomass over a 6-year period (Johnston 
and Naiman 1990b). Selective foraging decreased aspen and increased 
alder and conifer, with long-term effects on forest succession. In Wis­
consin, beaver substantially reduced the density of preferred understory 
tree species (W . J. Barnes and Dibble 1988). Because understory species 
normally replace overstory species in areas without beaver, it was pre­
dicted that selective foraging by beaver strongly altered riparian forest 
succession. Donkor and Fryxell (1999) also found that the foraging ac­
tivity of beaver altered forest succession by replacing deciduous species 
with conifers. They suggested this detracted from the keystone role of 
the beaver because the already dominant conifer community was in­
creased.

creased. 
Woody plant communities along major river systems can also be 
affected by the foraging behavior of beaver. In rivers too large for beaver 
to dam, bank-dwelling beaver can have signiﬁcant effects on the struc­
ture of woody riparian vegetation. Regulation of rivers by major dams 
can modify the effects of beaver as peak ﬂows are decreased and base 
ﬂows are increased, which affects growth of woody vegetation and its 
use by beaver. In a comparative study of the unregulated Y ampa River 
and the regulated Green River in northwestern Colorado, Breck (2001) 
found that beaver harvested a higher percentage of willow and cotton­
wood on the regulated river, where the constant ﬂow regime caused 
vegetation patches to be more uniformly available to beaver. In the un­
regulated river, shifting channels constantly changed access to shoreline 
vegetation. 
Abandonment of beaver ponds creates new habitat for plant es­
tablishment. Beaver meadows dominated by grasses and sedges often 
develop on the rich sediment that settles in beaver ponds. Meadows 
may eventually be replaced by forests, but in some cases succession is 
slower than expected. In northern forests, beaver meadows may resist 
invasion by conifers and persist for many decades as graminoid mead­
ows (Terwilliger and Pastor 1999). Successful conifer (Abies, Picea) 
invasion requires the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form 
an obligate association with tree roots. Because past ﬂ

aver meadows may resist 
invasion by conifers and persist for many decades as graminoid mead­
ows (Terwilliger and Pastor 1999). Successful conifer (Abies, Picea) 
invasion requires the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form 
an obligate association with tree roots. Because past ﬂooding would 
have killed these necessary fungi, beaver meadows require dispersal of 
fungi from nearby forest soils before conifers can invade. One possible 
mechanism of ectomycorrhizal fungi dispersal is via small-mammal 
feces. However, an evaluation of the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys 
gapperi) as a vector showed only about one third of plants grown in 
beaver meadow soils inoculated with vole feces had ectomycorrhizae 
present, compared to 100% of plants grown in forest soil. In addition, 
the potential of red-backed voles to facilitate dispersal of fungi is limited 
by their general avoidance of beaver meadows (Terwilliger and Pastor 
1999). Thus, persistence of beaver meadows in forest communities may 
be controlled by complex ecological mechanisms. 
Effects of Beaver on Mammals. A variety of mammals use the lush 
vegetation around beaver ponds as food and cover or rely on beaver 
to provide aquatic habitat (review by Olson and Hubert 1994). Beaver 
ponds are often important habitat for moose (Alces alces) because they 
increase production of woody plants and aquatic vegetation, which can 
contribute substantially to their total diet. In some cases, moose may 
compete with beaver for limited food supplies; however, the extent of

review by Olson and Hubert 1994). Beaver 
ponds are often important habitat for moose (Alces alces) because they 
increase production of woody plants and aquatic vegetation, which can 
contribute substantially to their total diet. In some cases, moose may 
compete with beaver for limited food supplies; however, the extent of 
their interaction and its effect on riparian vegetation are not well under­
stood. Elk and deer can also be attracted to the increased abundance, 
palatability, or availability of woody and herbaceous forage at beaver 
ponds. Beaver ponds also create habitat for other semiaquatic mammals, 
such as river otter, mink, and muskrat, some of which may occur in a 
large percentage of active or abandoned ponds. In Idaho, the density and 
standing crop biomass of small-mammal populations was two to three 
times higher in willow-dominated beaver pond habitat than in adjacent 
riparian habitat (Medin and Clary 1991). Montane voles (M. montanus) 
and shrews (Sorex spp.) were the most abundant small mammals in the 
beaver pond habitat, and their populations accounted for most of the 
differences. However, neither species richness nor species diversity of 
small mammals was inﬂuenced by beaver in this study. 
Effects of Beaver on Reptiles and Amphibians. Beaver ponds and 
associated riparian habitat likely alter the species composition and abun­
dance of regional herpetofauna throughout the range of beaver. How­
ever, few studies have quantiﬁed these effects and some conclusions 
have been equivocal. For example, Russell et al. (1999) compared new

 Beaver ponds and

dance of regional herpetofauna throughout the range of beaver. How­
ever, few studies have quantiﬁed these effects and some conclusions 
have been equivocal. For example, Russell et al. (1999) compared new 
(<5 years) and old (>10 years) beaver ponds to unimpounded streams 
in South Carolina. They found that richness and abundance did not dif­
fer among sites for amphibians, but both were higher for reptiles at the 
older beaver ponds than at new ponds or unimpounded streams. Reptile 
species diversity was highest at old ponds, intermediate at new ponds, 
and lowest at unimpounded sites. They suggested that beaver have gen­
erally beneﬁted herpetofauna in the Piedmont of South Carolina, as the 
range of several species, such as common musk turtle (Sternotherus 
odoratus) and eastern mud turtle ( Kinosternon subrubrum), has in­
creased concurrent with the range expansion of beaver. 
Effects of Beaver on Birds. Waterfowl use beaver ponds for nesting 
and brood-rearing habitat and as stopover sites during migration. Beaver 
ponds enhance vegetation growth, which improves dense nesting cover 
and enhances interspersion of cover and water, improving nest isola­
tion for territorial waterfowl pairs and increasing nest density (review 
by McCall et al. 1996). When beaver pondsﬂood timber, dead trees pro­
vide nesting sites for waterfowl (cavity nesters) that are relatively safe 
from predators. Beaver ponds increase the production of invertebrates 
and aquatic vegetation, which improves brood-rearing

 waterfowl pairs and increasing nest density (review 
by McCall et al. 1996). When beaver pondsﬂood timber, dead trees pro­
vide nesting sites for waterfowl (cavity nesters) that are relatively safe 
from predators. Beaver ponds increase the production of invertebrates 
and aquatic vegetation, which improves brood-rearing habitat. The ben­
eﬁts of beaver ponds to waterfowl may be expressed by increased 
production of waterfowl as regional beaver populations increase. For 
example, when beaver populations in south-central Maine increased in 
the 3–4 years following a trapping closure, density of Canada geese 
(Branta canadensis), hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus), and 
mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) also increased, as did the number of 
wetlands used by these species (McCall et al. 1996). Waterfowl in Fin­
land also responded positively to increasing beaver populations, but 
response varied by species. Teal (Anas crecca, the European race of the 
green-winged teal) increased to become the dominant species during 
the ﬁrst 2 years following ﬂooding by beaver, but populations of mal­
lards and wigeon (Anas penelope) did not respond (Nummi and Poysa 
1997). 
Beaver ponds can be preferred to similar open-water wetlands by 
breeding waterfowl. In Ontario, open-water lakes made up 47% of the 
study area, but were avoided by blue-winged teal (Anas discors), mal­
lards, and wood duck (Aix sponsa). However, beaver ponds constituted

Beaver ponds can be preferred to similar open-water wetlands by 
breeding waterfowl. In Ontario, open-water lakes made up 47% of the 
study area, but were avoided by blue-winged teal (Anas discors), mal­
lards, and wood duck (Aix sponsa). However, beaver ponds constituted 
only 25% of the area and were preferred by wood ducks (Merendino 
et al. 1995). Preference for beaver ponds may be due to their increased 
production of invertebrates important to waterfowl broods. For exam­
ple, populations of water ﬂeas (Cladocera spp.), a small invertebrate 
preferred by young ducklings, were abundant inﬁrst-year beaver ponds, 
with populations of larger invertebrates more important in 2- and 3-year-
old ponds (Nummi 1992). Beaver ponds substantially enhance water­
fowl habitat in the western United States, where riparian areas constitute 
<2% of the landscape. Breeding waterfowl surveys in Wyoming found 
that streams with beaver ponds had 7.5 ducks/km, but similar streams 
without beaver ponds had only 0.1 duck/km (McKinstry et al. 2001). A 
survey of 125 land managers found that beaver had been removed from 
23% of 28,297 km of Wyoming streams and that >3500 km of streams 
without beaver had potential for beaver reintroduction to improve water­
fowl nesting habitat (McKinstry et al. 2001). Finally, beaver ponds can 
be highly important for migrating waterfowl throughout North America 
and for wintering waterfowl in ice-free southern regions (Ringelman 
1991).

In addition to waterfowl, a variety of other bird species bene ﬁt 
from beaver activity. Beaver ponds can increase the area of open wa­
ter, length of the shoreline, density of dead standing trees, and biomass, 
height, and canopy cover of shrubs. The abundance and diversity of ter­
restrial insects important to foraging birds are enhanced by changes in

riparian and aquatic vegetation and availability of standing water for lar­
val development. These habitat changes may dramatically increase bird 
species richness, diversity, and abundance (Krueger 1985; Medin and 
Clary 1990). Active beaver sites contained 92% of 106 bird species ob­
served in 70 New Y ork wetlands (Grover and Baldassarre 1995). Beaver 
sites also were important habitat for red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius 
phoeniceus), Brewer’s blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus), common 
snipe (Gallinago gallinago), and spotted sandpipers ( Actitis hypoleu­

were an important avian habitat in all seasons, but reached maximum 
bird diversity in spring and summer and maximum number of indi­
viduals (all bird species combined) during fall migration (Reese and 
Hair 1976). Beaver ponds are especially important in arid environments, 
where riparian–wetland habitat provides an oasis for birds. Any increase 
in area or structural complexity of riparian vegetation usually beneﬁts 
the avian community. 
ECONOMIC STATUS, MANAGEMENT, 
AND CONSERV ATION 
Economic V alue. The ecological role of beaver discussed in the previ­
ous section has tremendous indirect economic beneﬁt through wetland 
creation, water storage, improved water quality, erosion control, sedi­
ment deposition, and recreation. These indirect beneﬁts may far out­
weigh the direct monetary value obtained from their fur, and may offset 
any direct or indirect costs due to beaver damage. However, because 
the monetary value of these indirect ecological beneﬁts has not been 
quantiﬁed, fur trapping and damage control are typically considered of 
primary economic importance. 
Native Americans valued beaver for food and clothing and early 
Europeans valued the underfur of beaver pelts for the manufacture of felt 
hats. In 1610, France granted Samuel de Champlain the ﬁrst fur-trading

Native Americans valued beaver for food and clothing and early 
Europeans valued the underfur of beaver pelts for the manufacture of felt 
hats. In 1610, France granted Samuel de Champlain the ﬁrst fur-trading 
monopoly in North America, initiating 200 years of intensive beaver 
trapping, which continued until the early 1900s, when beaver popula­
tions had been nearly extirpated and demand for felt hats had declined 
(reviews by Hill 1982; Hill and Novakowski 1984; Novak 1987). Since 
then, strict harvest regulations, reintroduction programs, and cutting 
and burning of climax boreal forests (setting back succession) have 
greatly beneﬁted beaver populations. Annual harvests during the 1980s 
sometimes exceeded 1 million beaver pelts, more than recorded at any 
other time (Novak 1987). Although beaver trapping is still an impor­
tant part of the fur industry in Canada and the United States, erratic 
and relatively low pelt prices have caused the economic importance of 
trapping beaver (numbers marketed and value of pelts) to decline rel­
ative to furbearers such as red fox (Vulpes vulpes), mink, and several 
other species (Hill and Novakowski 1984; Novak 1987). In addition, the 
value of beaver pelts varies by region, with those from warmer south­
ern climates valued lower and those of colder northern climates valued 
higher. Pelt prices are a primary incentive for most trappers. Prices in­

ﬂuence annual harvest levels and the ability of resource managers to use 
recreational trapping as a tool to reduce beaver populations or remove 
unwanted individuals. 
Strict trapping regulations or trapping bans can limit beaver trap­
ping as a management tool. In recent years, recreational trapping has 
been the target of animal rights groups, which have successfully used the 
public initiative/ballot referendum process in some states (e.g., Amend­
ment 14 in Colorado, November 1996) to eliminate or severely curtail 
trapping of furbearers. The long-term implications of trapping bans on 
beaver populations in these areas remain to be determined. One possi­
ble outcome may be that in some areas where private landowners once 
considered beaver a valuable fur resource they may instead be viewed 
as a pest species, with negative consequences to populations (Hill 
1982). Regulations that control or ban recreational trapping in many 
jurisdictions do not apply to landowners who are protecting private 
property. 
Beaver Damage. Expanding populations of humans and beaver in­
evitably lead to property damage. From the point of view of a landowner 
or other person experiencing damage, the cause is “nuisance beaver”; 
however, from the point of view of a beaver or some concerned citizens, 
the cause is “nuisance people.” From either view, beaver damage can 
be prevalent, severe, and costly.

 view of a beaver or some concerned citizens, 
the cause is “nuisance people.” From either view, beaver damage can 
be prevalent, severe, and costly. 
Beaver damage varies by type, magnitude, and region. Common 
complaints regarding beaver damage include ﬂooding of roads (often 
by plugging culverts) and pastures, eating orﬂooding agricultural crops 
(e.g., corn), damage to timber by ﬂooding and cutting (mainly in the 
relativelyﬂat Southeast), burrowing damage to dikes, ditches, and dams 
(mainly the arid West), cutting or ﬂooding ornamental plants around 
homes or businesses, ﬂooding habitat of rare plants or animals, dam­
aging wild trout habitat, damaging ﬁsh ponds by plugging the over­
ﬂow pipe, and potentially increasing the risk of human infection via 
Giardia lamblia, although some data suggest this is unlikely (Hill 1982; 
Woodward et al. 1985; Hammerson 1994; Olson and Hubert 1994). An­
nual cost of damage can be very high. In the early 1980s, annual beaver 
damage in the United States was estimated at $75–100 million; in the 
Southeast, the 40-year cumulative damage was estimated at $4 billion 
(review by Novak 1987). 
The importance of timber damage in the southeastern states was 
recognized soon after beaver were reintroduced; timber damage there 
far exceeds all other types of complaints (review by Hill 1982). Timber 
damage was reported by 67% of respondents to landowner question­
naires in Alabama (Hill 1976). In South Carolina, a 1984 survey showed

The importance of timber damage in the southeastern states was 
recognized soon after beaver were reintroduced; timber damage there 
far exceeds all other types of complaints (review by Hill 1982). Timber 
damage was reported by 67% of respondents to landowner question­
naires in Alabama (Hill 1976). In South Carolina, a 1984 survey showed 
beaver ﬂooded >35,000 ha of timber, often ﬂooding trees during the 
entire growing season with low dams <0.5 m high (Woodward et al. 
1985). If the root systems remain inundated for one to two growing 
seasons, many species of tree usually will die. Beaver kill timber of all 
size classes, with loss of larger trees causing greater ﬁnancial impact 
on producers. Beaver frequently gnaw bark from hardwoods, which 
increases the risk of disease and subsequent rotting. 
Damage Control. Killing unwanted individual beavers and controlled 
harvests of beaver populations are the most common, and often the 
most effective, methods of reducing beaver damage, even though lethal 
control is becoming increasingly less acceptable to the public. In Mis­
sissippi, about 20,000 beaver are harvested annually, with 80% of the 
carcasses discarded without use of meat or fur (Schulte and Muller-
Schwarze 1999). Nonetheless, annual harvest may be the most prudent 
approach to animal damage problems, particularly where such harvest 
can involve citizen participants with no resultant public expense (Hill 
1974, 1976). Trapping techniques for taking beaver vary with trapper 
preference and climatic conditions, the greatest differences occurring 
between areas that have extremely thick ice and those that are ice free.

can involve citizen participants with no resultant public expense (Hill 
1974, 1976). Trapping techniques for taking beaver vary with trapper 
preference and climatic conditions, the greatest differences occurring 
between areas that have extremely thick ice and those that are ice free. 
Successful harvest techniques involve shooting, snaring, and trapping 
with either No. 3 or No. 4 leghold traps or No. 330 Conibear traps (Hill 
1982; Miller and Y arrow 1994). Shooting beaver from boats or from 
land may or may not be an effective control method (Hill 1982; Olson 
and Hubert 1994) and raises signiﬁcant safety concerns. Alligators (Al­
ligator mississippiensis) have been evaluated as a control method in 
the Southeast, but are generally not effective (Hill 1982). Poison bait 
substances, such as strychnine alkaloid baits and compound 1080, have 
been evaluated as a lethal control method, but are not approved for this 
purpose. They also pose political and practical problems, which will 
likely preclude their development (Hill 1982; Hammerson 1994). Thus, 
if the decision is to kill problem beaver, then trapping likely remains 
the most effective method. 
However, trapping beaver can be an ineffective control measure if 
landowners create a sink population by trapping beaver from their own 
land but fail to reach consensus for control among adjacent landown­
ers containing a source population of beaver. Even when consensus 
for control is reached, migration of beaver from less-controlled sites to 
more-controlled sites imposes an external cost (negative diffusion ex­
ternality) when landowners must incur the future cost of repeated trap­
ping (Bhat et al

for control is reached, migration of beaver from less-controlled sites to 
more-controlled sites imposes an external cost (negative diffusion ex­
ternality) when landowners must incur the future cost of repeated trap­
ping (Bhat et al. 1993). When attempting to minimize beaver damage to 
timber resources, the cost of trapping must be weighed against the ben­
eﬁt of increased timber production. Integrating a trapping plan with a 
timber plan via a cost-minimizing, area-wide bioeconomic model may

help strike the optimal balance between timber damage and trapping 
costs and maintain a more even density and distribution of beaver in 
the management area (Bhat et al. 1993). 
Timing of trapping is also important where inundation of timber is 
the primary problem. In this case, it may be most effective to eradicate 
problem beaver colonies by the end of May and continue to remove im­
migrants from June to September, or until dispersal rates are relatively 
low (Houston et al. 1995). In some cases, trees may tolerate relatively 
high levels of beaver damage without any major effect on the forest. In 
a study of beaver damage to bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) trees 
in Texas, 85% of the trees near lodges had their bark peeled by beaver 
with only minimal effects on tree survival (King et al. 1998). Thus,

with only minimal effects on tree survival (King et al. 1998). Thus, 
managing timber damage requires understanding the response of the 
particular tree species to foraging and ﬂooding by beaver, gaining co­
operation of all landowners within the affected area, and evaluating 
costs and beneﬁts of beaver control relative to timber production. 
Livetrapping and relocation of problem beaver is more acceptable 
to the general public and has become fairly popular in urban areas. 
However, this can be cost prohibitive without volunteer labor and is 
not an option if suitable relocation sites are not available (Hammerson 
1994). Moreover, released beaver may suffer high mortality from pre­
dation or from their inability to successfully assimilate into established 
populations. Hancock traps are usually preferred to Bailey traps for 
removing problem beaver, although properly used snares may be more 
effective and less costly than either trap type (Hill 1982; Novak 1987; 
Hammerson 1994; McKinstry and Anderson 1998). In some situations, 
hand-held nets can help capture beaver on land or in shallow water from 
boats (Rosell and Hovde 2001). Chemosterilents and surgical steriliza­
tion also have been evaluated for beaver control, but remain impractical 
for treating wild populations (reviews by Hill 1982; Hammerson 1994).

for treating wild populations (reviews by Hill 1982; Hammerson 1994). 
Beaver repellents or wire fencing may be an effective means of 
protecting plants from cutting or discouraging beaver occupancy of se­
lected sites. Tree trunks can be protected by hardware cloth, chain link, 
or similar wire mesh connected at the ends (leaving room to allow tree 
growth) and extending about 1 m above the ground (Hammerson 1994). 
A solution of 10% creosote and 90% diesel fuel sprayed or painted on 
tree trunks reduces gnawing damage by beaver, as does a mixture of 
acrylic paint and sand, which acts as an unpalatable abrasive. Com­
mercial deer repellents (Thiram, Magic Circle) may also be effective 
chemical repellents (Hammerson 1994). Chemical extracts from native 
tree species that beaver avoid (Jeffery pine) also may be effective as a 
beaver repellent (Basey 1999). Marking areas with beaver scent (artiﬁ­
cial scent mounds) may discourage occupancy in the short term, but this 
method is likely an ineffective long-term solution. Scent marking by 
beaver more likely acts as a form of territoriality rather than as a scent 
fence (Welsh and Muller-Schwarze 1989; Sun and Muller-Schwarze 
1998; Schulte and Muller-Schwarze 1999).

1998; Schulte and Muller-Schwarze 1999). 
Flooding by beaver can often be prevented or managed by instal­
lation of beaver-proof road culverts and other water control structures 
or by installation of ﬂow control devices in existing beaver dams (Fig. 
15.3). Damage occurs when beavers plug culverts or impound water 
against the beds of roads or railroads, causing ﬂooding or washouts. 
Techniques for minimizing or preventing beaver from plugging road 
culverts include using oversized pipe-arch culverts (Fig. 15.3A), low-
proﬁle box culverts (Fig. 15.3B), and various designs of beaver exclo­
sure fencing (Fig. 15.3C) which prevent beaver from building a dam 
at the upstream end of a road culvert (Buech 1985; Hammerson 1994; 
Olson and Hubert 1994; Jensen et al. 1999; S. Lisle, oral communica­
tion, Beaver and Common-Sense Conﬂict Solutions Conference, 1999). 
In most cases, preventing damage with proper culvert design is far more 
cost-effective than the repeated, labor-intensive unplugging of dammed 
culverts or removing unwanted beaver (Jensen et al. 1999). Flow con­
trol devices installed in existing beaver dams have been very effective 
at mitigating damage to roads or other developments while maintaining 
the ecological and esthetic values of beaver presence. For example, the 
Clemson beaver pond leveler (Fig. 15.3D) can control the water level in 
beaver ponds by using tubes or similar structures laid perpendicular to 
the dam with the upstream end porous and protected from plugging

the ecological and esthetic values of beaver presence. For example, the 
Clemson beaver pond leveler (Fig. 15.3D) can control the water level in 
beaver ponds by using tubes or similar structures laid perpendicular to 
the dam with the upstream end porous and protected from plugging by 
beaver (Buech 1985; Hammerson 1994; Olson and Hubert 1994). The 
most widely used method to control ﬂooding is to dynamite or other­
wise remove problem beaver dams. However, this method is usually the 
least effective because beaver will often rebuild dams within a few days 
if building materials are still available. Altering habitat to make sites 
unsuitable to beaver may be possible in some cases, but may require 
habitat changes that are unacceptable to landowners. 
Methods for controlling beaver or their damage often require spe­
cial training, materials, and permits. State and local regulations should 
be consulted before attempting to control populations or to mitigate 
damage, such as by installing water control structures that affect in-
stream ﬂow. 
Public Opinion. Public opinion is an important consideration when 
choosing methods to control beaver damage. Many people have an 
emotional attachment to beaver and are vehemently opposed to any 
control methods that may cause their pain, suffering, or death. However, 
attitudes toward beaver control methods vary greatly among individ­
uals, communities, regions, and type of land tenure. Rural residents, 
especially in agricultural areas, may have less opposition to lethal con­
trol than urban residents. People who experience beaver problems may 
accept harsher control than those without problems. Cultural values

especially in agricultural areas, may have less opposition to lethal con­
trol than urban residents. People who experience beaver problems may 
accept harsher control than those without problems. Cultural values 
attributed to the presence of beaver also vary by region. Beaver may 
be more socially and economically valued in regions of Canada and 
the northern United States than in the Southeast, where fur values are 
lower, damage to timber and development is more severe, and beaver 
have less historical and cultural value. 
Social acceptability of beaver control depends on many factors. 
Residents in suburban areas of New Y ork were willing to accept increas­
ingly invasive control when they had increasingly severe concerns about 
problems (Loker et al. 1999). Contrary to predictions, residents were 
willing to use more severe control measures for nuisance and economic 
damage problems than for concerns about public health and safety (re­
sults combined for white-tailed deer, Canada geese, and beaver). In 
another New Y ork survey, nearly 50% of stakeholders took lethal ac­
tions to solve beaver problems; highway superintendents were more 
likely than the general public to attempt to solve beaver problems and 
to use actions that were nonlethal but invasive (Enck et al. 1997). In 
Wyoming, managers of private and public lands were concerned that 
beaver caused problems when they blocked irrigation ditches, girdled 
timber, blocked culverts, andﬂooded pastures, roads, crops, and timber.

However, 45% of private landowners with beaver on their land and all

Population and Harvest Management. Do beaver populations“need” 
to be harvested so they do not“eat themselves out of house and home ?” 
This management philosophy is pervasive in the culture of laypeople 
and professional wildlife managers. But is it true ? Why would beaver 
need the help of humans to control their populations, whereas nongame 
mammals seem to manage just ﬁne without it (aside from pervasive 
anthropogenic stressors) ? How does the absence of wolves or other 
predators affect beaver carrying capacity ? Clearly, answers to these 
questions are beyond the scope of this chapter, but recent evidence 
provides some interesting discussion points. For example, densities of 
beaver colonies did not differ in a comparison of unexploited, saturated 
populations and exploited, thinned-out populations. Beaver in the sat­
urated populations, however, colonized steeper gradients, had families 
with a larger percentage of 3-year-olds, depleted preferred trees and 
fed on less palatable species, and extended trails to more distant forag­
ing sites (Muller-Schwarze and Schulte 1999). Because the maximum 
density of colonies (usually a minimum distance of about 0.9 km be­
tween colonies) may be controlled by territorial behavior rather than

 3-year-olds, depleted preferred trees and 
fed on less palatable species, and extended trails to more distant forag­
ing sites (Muller-Schwarze and Schulte 1999). Because the maximum 
density of colonies (usually a minimum distance of about 0.9 km be­
tween colonies) may be controlled by territorial behavior rather than 
by habitat conditions, beaver populations in optimum habitat may be­
come saturated or self-limiting below habitat-based carrying capacity. 
Beaver typically maintain intercolony distances and body weight re­
gardless of population density. In some areas, forage near the central 
place may become temporarily depleted or ponds may become silted-in, 
causing colonies to periodically move to former beaver habitat that has

nitely within the same stream reach. In the Rocky Mountains, beaver 
may temporarily abandon mixed aspen–conifer sites after removing 
available aspen from nearby uplands, but may indeﬁnitely occupy 
riparian–willow sites, where dams create moist, bare soil and a high 
water table, which helps establish and perpetuate the willow commu­
nity. Despite lack of any inherent control needs, beaver harvest pro­
vides valuable recreational and income opportunities for trappers and 
is the primary means of reducing beaver damage to timber and other 
resources. Thus, justiﬁcation for beaver harvest should be based on 
the economic value of fur trapping or “managerial decisions [that] ad­
dress conﬂicts between beaver and humans, and not necessarily any 
requirements of the beaver themselves” (Muller-Schwarze and Schulte 
1999:176). 
Beaver populations are managed by state, provincial, and territo­
rial wildlife agencies in the United States and Canada. Agencies are 
responsible for setting seasons, setting bag limits or area-speciﬁc quo­
tas, licensing trappers, stamping or tagging pelts, licensing fur dealers 
and auction houses, and enforcing laws and regulations (Novak 1987). 
Trapper education is an important part of beaver management. Trap­

Trapper education is an important part of beaver management. Trap­
pers in the ﬁeld inﬂuence the age, sex, and distribution of animals 
removed as they make decisions about how, when, and where to set and 
check traps. Harvest rates, or quotas, are based on allowable harvest 
to maintain sustained yield. Rates suggested by different studies have 
varied from 10% to 70%, depending on habitat type, elevation, and 
region. The most typical recommended annual harvest rate is 20–30% 
of the population, which is about 1.0 –1.5 beaver/colony/year. Beaver 
are highly vulnerable to overharvest, so managers must closely mon­
itor populations. Their slow rate of reproduction and delayed sexual 
maturity preclude reproduction as a means to offset intensive annual 
harvest. 
Regional differences among habitat types and land management 
prescriptions warrant regional beaver management plans (Snodgrass 
1997). Managing beaver by managing their food supply may be possible 
in some regions. For example, prescribed burning may encourage aspen 
production in mixed conifer habitat, but may be of limited value where 
multiple forage species are available. 
Using Beaver for Habitat Restoration and Improvement. The abil­
ity of beaver to store water, trap sediment, reduce channel erosion, 
and enhance establishment and production of riparian vegetation can 
be used as a proactive management tool to restore degraded riparian 
habitat. Beaver were abundant in forested, shrub–steppe, and some hot 
desert habitats in the western United States until fur trapping deci­
mated populations. Ranchers followed trappers in settlement of the 
West, and immense numbers of sheep and cattle subjected newly beaver-

habitat. Beaver were abundant in forested, shrub–steppe, and some hot 
desert habitats in the western United States until fur trapping deci­
mated populations. Ranchers followed trappers in settlement of the 
West, and immense numbers of sheep and cattle subjected newly beaver-
free riparian areas to intense overgrazing. Overgrazing stripped stream-
banks of soil-binding vegetation, and channels responded with accel­
erated erosion and severe downcutting (see Elliott et al. [1999] for a 
discussion of possible mechanisms to explain observed channel inci­
sion). Mechanical restoration and revegetation (willow, cottonwood) 
of incised channels can be expensive, labor-intensive, and often

unsuccessful. Thus, natural restoration of riparian systems can be an 
attractive alternative. 
Reintroduction of beaver into degraded riparian systems has shown 
promise as a restoration tool, even where willow or other suitable winter 
food may be lacking (Fig. 15.4). Livestock grazing must be managed be­
fore beaver reintroduction to allow development of an adequate biomass 
of herbaceous aquatic and riparian vegetation for summer beaver food 
and to permit establishment and growth of willow or other woody ri­
parian vegetation for winter beaver food. Aspen, cottonwood, or willow 
can be provided at reintroduction sites, or where beaver have initiated 
dam building on their own, to encourage beaver to remain at the site 
and to provide them with stronger dam-building material, which might

 and growth of willow or other woody ri­
parian vegetation for winter beaver food. Aspen, cottonwood, or willow 
can be provided at reintroduction sites, or where beaver have initiated 
dam building on their own, to encourage beaver to remain at the site 
and to provide them with stronger dam-building material, which might 
otherwise be lacking (Apple et al. 1985). In some cases where over­
winter food is lacking, beaver may subsist on herbaceous vegetation 
long enough to build dams and ponds. These features may initiate a 
positive riparian response, which stimulates growth of willow or other 
woody vegetation suitable as winter food. A winter food cache provides 
beaver with more permanent habitat and the ability to successfully raise 
young. Thus, beaver can create a positive feedback mechanism by tem­
porarily expanding into marginal habitat (naturally or by introduction), 
improving conditions for the establishment and survival of woody ri­
parian vegetation, and persisting long enough to raise young, which can 
disperse to new marginal habitat. 
Beaver restoration in western riparian areas may also help control 
tamarisk, an invasive woody species (Fig. 15.4). In northwestern Col­
orado, beaver used tamarisk, sagebrush, and greasewood ( Sarcobatus 
vermiculatus) as building material for a series of dams, which coincided 
with increase in the distribution and abundance of coyote willow (S. ex­
igua) relative to tamarisk (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). A similar 
response was observed on the Zuni Indian Reservation in New Mexico 
following the relocation of 23 beaver to seven restoration sites (Albert 
and Trimble 2000).

igua) relative to tamarisk (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). A similar 
response was observed on the Zuni Indian Reservation in New Mexico 
following the relocation of 23 beaver to seven restoration sites (Albert 
and Trimble 2000). As beaver selectively cut vegetation and impound 
water and sediment behind dams, they alter conditions driving estab­
lishment and survival in riparian plant communities. Thus, beaver may 
create a competitive advantage for willow relative to tamarisk in some 
riparian systems, although speciﬁc mechanisms need further study at 
various spatial and temporal scales (B. W . Baker, unpublished data). 
Beaver have also been useful as a timber management tool in the 
southeastern United States. Flooding by beaver ponds kills existing 
noncommercial vegetation, thus preparing sites for reforestation with 
commercially valuable timber. By draining ponds and removing beaver, 
landowners can reduce the cost of clearing land, often a major compo­
nent of timber production (Houston et al. 1992). 
Population Estimation. Population density of beaver is usually ex­
pressed as number of colonies or individuals in areal or linear units. 
Areal estimates are more appropriate where wetlands are diffuse and 
linear estimates are better where beaver habitat is limited to well-
deﬁned watercourses. Estimates of number of individuals are often 
derived from colony counts, but are not meaningful unless the mean 
number of beaver per colony is based on local data and not the gen­
eral literature. Multiplying number of colonies by the general average 
of 5 or 6 beaver per colony only adds false precision to population

deﬁned watercourses. Estimates of number of individuals are often 
derived from colony counts, but are not meaningful unless the mean 
number of beaver per colony is based on local data and not the gen­
eral literature. Multiplying number of colonies by the general average 
of 5 or 6 beaver per colony only adds false precision to population 
estimates. 
Estimates of mean colony size are very dif ﬁcult to obtain and 
vary temporally and spatially, but are important in setting harvest quo­
tas (Novak 1987). Colony size can be estimated by using night-vision 
scopes to count beaver as they move about their territory, driving beaver 
from their lodges using smoke or dogs, draining the pond and disman­
tling the lodge (not recommended), attempting to trap all the beaver in a 
colony (difﬁcult to accomplish, thus a conservative estimate), and em­
ploying models that use age and reproductive data from populations of 
trapped beaver (Novak 1987) or data on the interactions among natality, 
mortality, and dispersal (Bishir et al. 1983). 
Size of the food cache may be a useful predictor of colony size, but 
more research is needed to better understand relationships, as studies in 
different regions have been equivocal. In Montana, aerial cache surveys 
of prairie rivers located about 90% of caches, but colony size varied 
among years and areas. Thus, cache counts alone are not good predictors 
of population size or trend (Swenson et al. 1983). Estimates of cache size 
were a signiﬁcant predictor of colony size in a Montana study (Easter-
Pilcher 1990). This was not the case in

were a signiﬁcant predictor of colony size in a Montana study (Easter-
Pilcher 1990). This was not the case in a Wyoming study, however, 
perhaps due to variation in cache-building behavior among different 
age cohorts (Osmundson and Buskirk 1993).

Aerial surveys have been widely used to estimate the size and 
distribution of beaver populations, but evaluations of their ef ﬁciency, 
accuracy, and precision in terms of costs and beneﬁts suggest their value 
is highly variable (Novak 1987). Surveys are usually conducted in the 
fall after leaf drop but before freeze-up. Results depend on search meth­
ods, topography, overstory vegetation, type of aircraft, and behavior of 
beaver (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). For example, aerial sur­
veys only located 41 of 146 ground-located beaver colonies in Kansas 
riverine habitat, where beaver lived in bank dens and did not build food 
caches (Robel and Fox 1993).

veys only located 41 of 146 ground-located beaver colonies in Kansas 
riverine habitat, where beaver lived in bank dens and did not build food 
caches (Robel and Fox 1993). 
Various combinations of aerial photography, aerial videography, 
and geographic information systems (GIS) can also be used to survey 
beaver populations and evaluate habitat conditions. Aerial photographs 
can be used as a reconnaissance aid to locate beaver habitat in remote 
locations for later ground or aerial survey; to map locations of dams, 
ponds, and lodges via photointerpretation methods; to ﬁnd and/or plot 
colony locations during ground surveys (<1:3000-scale best); and to 
create overlays of beaver colony locations and habitat features that can 
be digitized into a GIS (Parsons and Brown 1978; Novak 1987; Baker 
et al. 1992; Werth and Boyd 1997). A GIS is essential for some types of 
landscape-level analysis of beaver habitat and may be better than man­
ual methods for others, depending on costs and technical requirements 
(Johnston and Naiman 1990c). Global positioning systems (GPS) al­
low users to plot exact locations of active or inactive lodges and dens, 
which can be integrated with GIS systems to develop highly accurate 
beaver habitat models or monitoring programs. Aerial videography via 
a helicopter-mounted video camera may be useful for locating and mon­
itoring beaver populations, especially in meandering riparian systems

beaver habitat models or monitoring programs. Aerial videography via 
a helicopter-mounted video camera may be useful for locating and mon­
itoring beaver populations, especially in meandering riparian systems 
that are difﬁcult to observe from low-level, ﬁxed-winged aircraft (B. W . 
Baker, pers. obs.). Video has the advantage of instant availability on 
return from the ﬂight and can be integrated with on-board GPS systems 
to create georeferenced data for computer analysis; however, videogra­
phy is less useful than aerial photography for creating images for use 
in the ﬁeld. 
Sex Determination. Sex of beaver carcasses can be determined by the 
presence of the baculum and testes in males and the uterus in females, 
but the lack of any obvious external sex characteristics makes sex de­
termination in live animals difﬁcult (Novak 1987). The sex of live adult 
beaver can be determined by probing the cloaca or palpating the ab­
dominal region for the baculum and testes, by noting the presence of 
four enlarged pectoral mammae in pregnant females (after 2 months), 
by giving beaver the anesthetic combelen (which causes the penis to 
lapse into the cloaca), by detecting Barr bodies in blood smears, and 
by using radiographs that reveal the presence of the baculum (review 
by Novak 1987). Each of these methods has some level of uncertainty 
or practical constraints for adult beaver and is especially difﬁcult for 
young (reviews by Novak 1987; Schulte et al. 1995). A recently devel­
oped technique uses the color and

 using radiographs that reveal the presence of the baculum (review 
by Novak 1987). Each of these methods has some level of uncertainty 
or practical constraints for adult beaver and is especially difﬁcult for 
young (reviews by Novak 1987; Schulte et al. 1995). A recently devel­
oped technique uses the color and viscosity of anal gland secretion to 
determine the sex of adult and juvenile beaver. This method produced 
relatively accurate and consistent results from three different regions in 
New Y ork, which suggests it may have general ﬁeld application for sex 
identiﬁcation in beaver (Schulte et al. 1995). 
Age Estimation. Characteristics of tooth eruption and annual cemen­
tum layers have been in standard use for age determination since the 
1960s (reviews by Hill 1982; Novak 1987). A reﬁnement in the cemen­
tum layer method used the independent variables cementum length and 
noncementum length to fairly accurately predict ages for a sample of 28 
beaver (≥4 years old) with an exponential model, suggesting practical 
application in cases where more exact data are not necessary (Houston 
and Pelton 1995). Techniques for estimating age of live beaver are gen­
erally less accurate than the cementum method used for carcasses. The 
most common methods have used weight and skull measures, despite 
large error rates (Novak 1987; Hartman 1992). A reﬁnement using re­
gression models to estimate the age of live beaver based on live weight, 
tail width, and tail length was useful in identifying three age classes: 
kits, yearlings, and ≥ 2-year olds (Van Deelen
Text Len: 1580

 and skull measures, despite 
large error rates (Novak 1987; Hartman 1992). A reﬁnement using re­
gression models to estimate the age of live beaver based on live weight, 
tail width, and tail length was useful in identifying three age classes: 
kits, yearlings, and ≥ 2-year olds (Van Deelen 1994). A technique using 
dental radiographs to observe tooth root closure and annual deposition 
of cementum and dentine layers appears useful for estimating age of 
either live or dead beaver (Hartman 1992). 
Livetrapping. Beaver can be captured alive using Hancock traps, Bai­
ley traps, box traps, snares, or nets. Hancock traps are set on the sides of 
steep banks and Bailey traps are set in shallow water. Both are suitcase-
type traps, which hold the beaver in a wire cage above water until 
released. Hancock traps are usually more effective than Bailey traps 
and are preferred in most situations (Novak 1987). Snares are cheap, 
light, and easy to set. They permit trappers to increase capture rates 
by saturating an area with traps, but have a greater mortality rate than 
Hancock traps due to increased risk of predation, entanglement lead­
ing to suffocation, and drowning (Hill 1982; McKinstry and Anderson 
1998). Box traps baited with aspen and scent lure were effective for 
all age classes in spring and early summer when set along shoreline 
travel lanes in Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers. commun., 2001). In all 
cases, multiple traps per trapnight percolony will increase the likeli­
hood of trapping all colony members or speciﬁc targeted individuals 
before colony members become trap shy. In some cases,

all age classes in spring and early summer when set along shoreline 
travel lanes in Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers. commun., 2001). In all 
cases, multiple traps per trapnight percolony will increase the likeli­
hood of trapping all colony members or speciﬁc targeted individuals 
before colony members become trap shy. In some cases, beaver can be 
captured by nets or by hand after being ﬂushed from lodges or dens 
by dogs or other means (Hill 1982; Rosell and Hovde 2001). In large 
river systems or lakes, surface-swimming beaver can be captured using 
a dip net. A dive net can be pushed down over the top of swimming 
beaver in shallow water, after locating them with the aid of spotlights 
and headlights from a motorboat (Rosell and Hovde 2001). 
Tagging. Beaver can be individually marked with ear tags, neck col­
lars, tail tags, and other methods (Novak 1987). Beaver may retain ear 
tags for several years, but retention rates have varied greatly among 
studies (review by Novak 1987). The tail can be marked with holes, 
notches, rivets, waterproof paint, branding, cryobranding with liquid 
nitrogen, and cattle ear tags (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.), and the fur can 
be bleached or dyed. Hind feet webs also can be tattooed or punched 
to individually mark beaver. Subcutaneously placed passive integrated 
transponder tags can positively identify recaptured beaver as well as 
free-ranging beaver, which can be scanned with a tag reader as they 
enter or exit burrows or lodges (although this method has not been ﬁeld 
tested). These techniques

transponder tags can positively identify recaptured beaver as well as 
free-ranging beaver, which can be scanned with a tag reader as they 
enter or exit burrows or lodges (although this method has not been ﬁeld 
tested). These techniques all vary in their effectiveness and in trauma 
caused to beaver during and after marking, important considerations 
when selecting an appropriate marking technique. 
Telemetry. Beaver are nocturnal and difﬁcult to observe, so telemetry 
is often valuable in studies of their behavior and movements. However, 
transmitter attachment has been problematic. Neck collars often slip 
off because beaver have a thick neck relative to head size, and tail col­
lars slip off if tail size decreases following release (B. W . Baker, pers. 
obs.). Free-ﬂoating intraperitoneal transmitter implants have proven 
successful in several studies, although their range can be relatively 
short (ground-to-ground signal of 0.1 km for beaver inside burrows 
and 2 km for active beaver; Davis et al. 1984). Implanted transmit­
ters become tightly encapsulated with necrotic ﬁbrous tissue and may 
be well tolerated by beaver (Guynn et al. 1987). Implants have been 
performed via dorsal (Davis et al. 1984) and ventrolateral (Wheatley 
1997d) incisions. Although both techniques have been successful, the 
ventrolateral method appears to involve less risk to the animal. 
Tail-mounted transmitters have shown variable success in 
Wyoming (Bothmeyer et al. 2002), Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers

 (Davis et al. 1984) and ventrolateral (Wheatley 
1997d) incisions. Although both techniques have been successful, the 
ventrolateral method appears to involve less risk to the animal. 
Tail-mounted transmitters have shown variable success in 
Wyoming (Bothmeyer et al. 2002), Massachusetts (C. Henner, pers. 
commun., 2001), and Colorado (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). This method 
uses a livestock ear tag transmitter attached to the dorsal surface of a 
beaver’s tail. Dimensions and weight of tail-mounted transmitters can 
be designed to ﬁt beaver tails of various sizes (kits, adults) and allow 
for variation in tail thickness. Durability and attachment effects (e.g., 
tearing the tail) of tail-mounted transmitters have yet to be determined, 
although preliminary evidence suggests short retention time for a rela­
tively high percentage of individuals (B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). 
Reintroduction. The ﬁrst step in any reintroduction program should be

absent from the site, why they are important to the site, justiﬁcation for 
relocation rather than natural dispersal, likelihood of movement beyond 
the intended relocation site, and potential conﬂicts or interaction with 
other resources or landowners. Relocation decisions and expectations

relocation rather than natural dispersal, likelihood of movement beyond 
the intended relocation site, and potential conﬂicts or interaction with 
other resources or landowners. Relocation decisions and expectations 
are usually based on professional judgment after considering all avail­
able data, but also may be based on mathematical simulation models. 
South et al. (2000) developed a spatially explicit model to evaluate the 
proposed reintroduction of Eurasian beaver to Scotland. Their model 
simulated births and deaths of individuals and dispersal between habitat 
patches based on a land cover map and predicted that a reintroduction 
of 20 beaver would be sufﬁcient to establish an initial population that 
would eventually expand and ﬁll suitable habitat. 
Most beaver do not stay at release sites and may move great dis­
tances following release. Average dispersal distances were 14.6 km in 
a North Dakota study, 16.7 km in a Colorado study, 11.7 km in a Maine 
study, 18 km in a Quebec study, and 7.4 km for beaver transplanted 
to streams and 3.2 km for beaver transplanted to lakes in a Wisconsin 
study (review by Novak 1987). Beaver can sometimes be encouraged 
to stay at speci ﬁc release sites by providing aspen or other preferred 
species as food and building material or creating a base for a beaver 
dam by placing posts, wire fencing, silt-retaining fabric, rock, or other 
material (Apple et al. 1985; B. W . Baker, pers. obs.).

 base for a beaver

material (Apple et al. 1985; B. W . Baker, pers. obs.). 
Survival of relocated beaver can depend on suitability of available 
habitat, timing of release (late summer in areas that freeze allows time 
to establish ponds and food cache), sex, age, composition, and num­
ber released (entire family units may improve establishment success), 
predation, and disease. In a study of 57 released Eurasian beaver in the 
Netherlands, 19 animals were found dead within the ﬁrst year and 50% 
of these had died of infectious diseases (Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, 
Y. enterocolitica, Leptospirosis, and others) (Nolet et al. 1997). Stress 
during handling may increase risk of disease following release. Vac­
cination against likely disease agents and attention to animal hygiene 
before release may reduce mortality. Holding beaver in a cool, damp en­
vironment, providing adequate food and water, and minimizing length 
of captivity should improve survival following release (Novak 1987). 
RESEARCH NEEDS 
Beaver research has evolved from descriptions of beaver and their habi­
tat to attempts to better understand mechanisms that explain behavior, 
population structure, and their keystone role in ecosystem structure and 
function. New knowledge about beaver will likely come from cross-
discipline studies that stretch the boundaries of our already rich litera­
ture base on beaver. For example, a better understanding of the role of 
beaver as geological agents in the formation of alluvial ﬂoodplain val­
leys begs for the integration of the ecological sciences with new methods

function. New knowledge about beaver will likely come from cross-
discipline studies that stretch the boundaries of our already rich litera­
ture base on beaver. For example, a better understanding of the role of 
beaver as geological agents in the formation of alluvial ﬂoodplain val­
leys begs for the integration of the ecological sciences with new methods 
in geology and geomorphology, such as dating of buried organic layers 
that represent beaver dams and pond sediments. An important research 
need is to develop independent lines of evidence about how beaver 
affect ecosystem structure and function over the full range of ecolog­
ical conditions inhabited by beaver, especially in the less well-known 
communities such as southeastern forests, western shrub–steppe, and 
desert grasslands. These studies should include the sequential events 
of development and abandonment that make up the life history of a 
beaver pond ecosystem. In South America and Europe, beaver are an 
invasive species with an ecological role that likely will require a differ­
ent level of understanding than in their native North American habitat. 
The economic values of beaver wetlands in storing water, improving 
water quality, restoring wetland function, and mitigating development 
will be of critical importance as human populations expand and strain 
the land’s ability to absorb their impact. The human dimensions of 
beaver management and control methods need improved understand­
ing to better educate a public that is becoming more removed from 
the land and more inclined to use legislative or judicial means rather

beaver populations, determine sex and age of live beaver in theﬁeld, and
