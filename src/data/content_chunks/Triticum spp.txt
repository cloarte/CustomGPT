Breadcrumb Home Plants Plant Health Plant Pests and Diseases Karnal Bunt Karnal Bunt Last Modified:  March 20, 2025 Ruben Durán, Washington State University, Bugwood.org Karnal bunt, also called partial bunt, is a plant disease affecting wheat, durum wheat, and triticale (a hybrid of wheat and rye). The Karnal bunt fungus ( Tilletia indica Mitra) and the plant disease it causes are harmless to people and animals and has little impact on crop yield or quality. Karnal bunt was first detected in 1996 in the United States in Arizona and then later in Texas and California. APHIS regulates this disease because many trading partners require that U.S. wheat be certified as grown in areas free of Karnal bunt. Karnal bunt is quarantined to portions of two counties in Arizona, and the disease incidence in these regulated fields is minimal (usually less than 0.1 percent in the United States). APHIS also oversees an annual voluntary survey of grain delivered to elevators to check for Karnal bunt across the country. What To Look For Karnal bunt is usually identified after harvest, once the grains are separated and infected kernels are exposed. Here's what you'll see and smell: Appearance Bunted kernels are fragile, blackened, and sooty. The kernels' outer layer will have cracks, and if you press them, you'll see a black powder. In advanced infections, wheat kernels look like a boat or dugout canoe. Fishy Odor If the disease is severe, kernels will produce trimethylamine, which gives off a strong, fishy smell.

Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Bugwood.org How To Prevent This Disease You can reduce the risk of spreading Karnal bunt by using clean seed, ongoing sanitation, sound agricultural practices, and following quarantine regulations for both imported regulated articles and impacted domestic areas. How It Is Treated You can manage the disease by cooperating with State and Federal officials and following regulations. It is equally important to use clean seed, proper sanitation, and sound agricultural practices. Report Plant Pests and Diseases Have you seen this pest or signs of pest damage? Immediately report your findings. Find your State plant regulatory official Find your State plant health director Controlling Karnal Blunt Expand All Collapse All Current Status A successful quarantine and national survey program have confined Karnal bunt to portions of one State: Arizona. Because the fungus-causing disease poses no harm to people or animal health, there are no Federal food regulations concerning Karnal bunt. Every year since 1996, APHIS has coordinated a Karnal bunt national survey in wheat-producing counties, outside of regulated areas in Arizona. To date, Karnal bunt hasn't been found in these surveys.
