 Invasion: Abutilon theophrastiis an annual herb, reproducing only by seed. After germination, a slender taproot elongates into soil with many smaller branches. The stem is erect, 1-4 m, much branched in the upper part. The crop type tends to produce many more branches than the wild type. The surface of the stem is smooth with short velvety hairs. 16 to 63 leaves per plant are alternately produced with long petioles, and a broadly heart-shaped blade. The width of the leaf blade is 7-20 cm and the leaf area ranges from 300 to 470 cm².

 Reproduccion: The chromosome numbers reported for A. theophrasti are 2 n = 42, 84. Hybridization between A. theophrasti and other species has not been reported. In a study of allozyme variations among 39 populations of this species collected between southern Ohio and Central Ontario, only two of 16 enzymes were variable and only four multilocus genotypes were evident among populations, although high levels of enzyme multiplicity were evident within an individual as a result of polyploidy ( Warwick and Black, 1986 ). The optimal temperature for germination of A. theophrasti seeds is 24-30°C. Seedlings emerge throughout the season ( Warwick and Black, 1988 ), mainly from March to May in the United States ( Stoller and Wax, 1973 ; Egley and Williams, 1991 ; Hartzler et al., 1999 ). Emerging seedlings immediately produce a taproot, followed by development of lateral roots 1 or 2 days after emergence ( Warwick and Black, 1988 ). Under non-competitive natural conditions in Mississippi, maximum height and ground cover occurred 10 weeks after emergence with a peak at 13 weeks ( Chandler and Dale, 1974 ). In eastern Canada, A. theophrasti starts to flower in late August to September-October, setting seed from September to October ( Warwick and Black, 1988 ; Scott and Robbins, 2006

In eastern Canada, A. theophrasti starts to flower in late August to September-October, setting seed from September to October ( Warwick and Black, 1988 ; Scott and Robbins, 2006 ). Abutilon theophrasti is a self-compatible, autogamous species. As the pollen is often released before or just at anthesis, self-pollination may occur ( Andersen, 1988 ). Approximately 3% of seeds set under natural conditions could originate from outcrossing ( Andersen, 1988 ). Although A. theophrasti prefers to grow in warm temperate areas, it also thrives in a wide range of climates including tropical, subtropical and temperate climates. It grows best in areas with mean annual temperatures of 14° to 25°C (tolerates 10° to 30°C) and mean annual rainfall of 650-2000 mm (tolerates 500-3000 mm). A. theophrasti prefers areas with full sunlight or part day shade. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types, from sandy to clay loams with pH in the range 5.5-6.5, tolerating 4.9-8.2 ( Warwick and Black, 1988 ; Useful Tropical Plants, 2020 ). In the midwestern United States and southwestern Ontario, Canada, A. theophrasti commonly occurs together with Datura stramonium in the early successional annual community that develops on cultivated fields and field margins ( Benner and Bazzaz, 1987 ; Garbutt and Bazzaz, 1987 ). Abutilon theophrasti is host to a maize pest, Helicoverpa zea, a tobacco pest, Heliothis virescens ( Hendricks, 1992 ) and three soyabean diseases caused by

Abutilon theophrasti is host to a maize pest, Helicoverpa zea, a tobacco pest, Heliothis virescens ( Hendricks, 1992 ) and three soyabean diseases caused by Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae [ Phomopsis phaseoli ], Colletotrichum dematium f.sp. truncatum [ Colletotrichum truncatum ] and Glomerella cingulata ( Hepperly et al., 1980 ). A fungal association consisting of Alternaria alternata , Cladosporium cladosporioides , Epicoccum purpurascens [ Epicoccum nigrum ] and Fusarium spp. may extend A. theophrasti seed longevity by acting as a barrier to potential seed decomposers originating from the soil ( Kremer, 1986 ). Mycorrhizal infestation of A. theophrasti is reported to promote capsule production and increase the competitive ability of the offspring ( Shumway and Koide, 1995 ; Heppell et al., 1998 ).
