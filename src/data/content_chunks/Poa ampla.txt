Big bluegrass
Gramineae
Poa ampla
Merr.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a strong-growing perennial bunchgrass native in Western United States.Plants are up to 4 feet tall, with numerous basal leaves 8 to 16 inches long by0.375 inch wide and a deep, fibrous root system. Standsare generally not dense, but the high production of palatable forage make thisa very valuable range grass. It starts growth early in the spring and continuesinto fall. It is very useful for regrassing farm and depleted range lands.Mixed plantings of big bluegrass and legumes as alfalfa have produced highyields of excellent forage. It is easily injured by overgrazing. Seed is largein size and produced readily. Propagation is by seeding.
