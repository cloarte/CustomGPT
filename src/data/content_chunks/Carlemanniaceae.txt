4.Carlemanniaceae香茜科 xiang qian keAuthors:Tao Chen&Anthony R. BrachPerennial herbs, shrubs, or subshrubs, often somewhat fleshy; stems with interpetiolar line. Leaves opposite, petiolate, simple, estipulate, ± asymmetric, dentate or crenate-serrate. Flowers bisexual, slightly zygomorphic, in terminal or axillary cymes or corymbs, sometimes heterostylous. Calyx tube adnate to ovary, 4- or 5-lobed; lobes ± unequal. Corolla 4- or 5-lobed; lobes imbricate or induplicate-valvate. Stamens 2, inserted at middle of corolla tube; filaments short; anthers linear-oblong, opening laterally by slits, connivent around style. Disk well developed, conical or cylindrical. Ovary inferior, 2-loculed, each locule with ovules many (30-100) in axile to basal placentation. Fruit a 2-loculed, dry or fleshy capsule, 2- or 5-valvate; calyx lobes persistent. Seeds many (30-100), ovoid, smooth, with endosperm ± fleshy.Two genera and five species: tropical Asia; two genera and three species in China.Although previously treated in FRPS within the Rubiaceae, the Carlemanniaceae is treated separately here (see APG, Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 85: 531-553. 1998; M. Thiv in Kubitzki, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 7: 57-59. 2004). It has also been included by various authors in the Caprifoliaceae.Herein, the term "c
