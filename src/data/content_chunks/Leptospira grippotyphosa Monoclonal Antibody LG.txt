1. Reagent Name: Leptospira grippotyphosa Monoclonal Antibody (LG MAb) 
2. Strain or Source: Hybridoma LGF02-002 
3. Lot Number: IRP 04-505 
4. Fill Date: April 28, 2004 
5. Expiration Date: March 31, 2027 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: For use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described 
in Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) 626 for serial release potency testing of leptospiral 
bacterins containing serovar grippotyphosa. 
7. Instructions for Use: Dilute LG MAb 1:9,000 in phosphate-buffered saline 
supplemented with 1% polyvinyl alcohol and 0.1% normal rabbit serum, and use immediately, 
according to SAM 626. 
8. Test of Reagent: LG MAb passively protected hamsters against a challenge with L. 
grippotyphosa. LG MAb reacts against L. grippotyphosa-specific lipopolysaccharide-like antigen 
on Western blot; it does not react with antigens from other serovars. The isotype of LG MAb is 
IgM. The optimal use dilution was determined by titration, using the assay described in SAM 
626. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 250 µL aliquots in plastic microcentrifuge 
tubes.
