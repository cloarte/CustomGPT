Guinea Pig  
Eye Health 
Abnormal Guinea Pig Eye Conditions 
Talk with your 
veterinarian if you 
notice any of these 
signs or symptoms of 
eye disease in your 
guinea pigs.
PRACTICAL TIP
Good management 
and husbandry 
can prevent many 
illnesses and injuries 
in your guinea pigs:
• Avoid overcrowding
• Sanitize pens and 
equipment regularly
• Ventilate buildings 
to ensure good air 
quality
Guinea pigs normally have clear eyes that are of 
equal size and shape to each other. While most 
guinea pigs have dark brown or black eyes, some 
lighter colored pigs have eyes that are blue or red. 
The eyelids are smooth and glide over the entire 
surface of the eye when they blink. 
Infections affecting the eye 
or other areas of the body, 
such as upper respiratory or 
skin infections, can result in 
conjunctivitis or “pinkeye. ” 
You may see: 
	●  Redness or “bloodshot” 
appearance
	●  Swollen eyelids
	●  Thick discharge or crusty appearance around 
the eyes and nose
Trauma can damage the 
eye or lead to an infection. 
Trauma can be caused 
by scratching, fighting, 
or material getting stuck 
inside the eyelid or injuring 
the eye. You may see: 
	●  Squ

  Swollen eyelids
	●  Thick discharge or crusty appearance around 
the eyes and nose
Trauma can damage the 
eye or lead to an infection. 
Trauma can be caused 
by scratching, fighting, 
or material getting stuck 
inside the eyelid or injuring 
the eye. You may see: 
	●  Squinting in pain
	●  Watery eyes
	●  Small white dot on the eye surface 
	●  General bluish-white cloudiness
Birth Defects can result in an abnormal shape 
or position of the eye or surrounding parts. 
Examples include:
	● One or both eyes smaller 
than normal or missing
	● Eyelid rolling inward
	● Misplaced eyelashes 
or other hairs that rub 
against the eye
You may see:
	● White or blue cloudiness
	● Redness
	● Excessive tears or mucus
	● Squinting or rubbing the 
eye
Exophthalmos is a 
condition that causes the 
eye to bulge outward. It 
can cause the eye surface 
to dry out because the eyelid can’t cover the 
whole eye. Exophthalmos may be caused by:
	● Infection, like a tooth root 
abscess
	● Swelling from trauma
	● Glaucoma
	● Cancer
You may see:
	● Thick discharge
	● Blood vessels and/or fleshy 
tissue on the eye surface
Metabolic changes 
occur with age or growth 
and may signal disease 
elsewhere in the body. 
While these conditions 
can accompany disease, 
the following  eye 
conditions don’t typically require immediate 
veterinary treatment

While these conditions 
can accompany disease, 
the following  eye 
conditions don’t typically require immediate 
veterinary treatment: 
	●  Cataract: The lens (center of eye) becomes 
opaque gray/white/blue and shiny. This is 
common with diabetes. 
	● “Fatty” or “pea” eye: Fat deposits accumulate 
under the eye (usually no treatment needed).
DID YOU KNOW? 
Many eye conditions, 
whether they begin in 
the eye or elsewhere 
in the body, can be 
passed from animal to 
animal. It’s important 
to separate sick guinea 
pigs from healthy ones, 
even if they are still 
“acting” normal.

eye health

trauma 
Squinting or abnormally 
small eye with mild
