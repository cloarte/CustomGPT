Questions and Answers: 
Biological Control for 
Emerald Ash Borer 
 
 
For several years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has 
used the emerald ash borer’s (EAB) natural enemies—
tiny stingless wasps known as parasitoids—as biological 
control agents to help manage infestations. The goal of 
APHIS’ EAB program is to help maintain ash trees as 
part of the North American landscape and biological 
control significantly contributes to this goal. 
 
What is biological control? 
Biological control, or biocontrol, uses natural enemies 
such as parasitoids, predators, pathogens, or 
antagonists to reduce plant pests or diseases. Biological 
control can be a practical and an environmentally sound 
method for pest control. The biological control agents 
used against EAB include four tiny stingless wasp 
species—the largest is about the size of a typical 
mosquito.  
 
  
 
 
Why is biological control used against EAB? 
Soon after the EAB was first detected in the United 
States, APHIS, the Agricultural Research Service, and 
the U.S. Forest Service began looking for natural 
enemies to fight the infestation. We conducted research 
in EAB’s native range in China and found three 
biological control agents—Spathius agrili, Tetrastichus 
planipennisi, and Oobius agrili. Several years later we 
also found Spathius galinae in Russia. These four was

enemies to fight the infestation. We conducted research 
in EAB’s native range in China and found three 
biological control agents—Spathius agrili, Tetrastichus 
planipennisi, and Oobius agrili. Several years later we 
also found Spathius galinae in Russia. These four wasp 
species specifically hunt and kill EAB, which helps reduce 
the number of EAB infesting and killing ash trees. Three 
species attack EAB larvae and one targets EAB eggs.

• Spathius agrili has a long egg-laying organ or 
ovipositor that helps it attack EAB larvae in many 
different sized ash trees. This wasp penetrates 
through tree bark and lays up to 20 eggs on an EAB 
larva. The hatching wasp larvae feed and develop on 
the EAB larva, resulting in its death. 
 
• Spathius galinae also attacks EAB larvae like Spathius 
agrili does, but what makes this wasp different is that it 
can tolerate colder climates, which makes it an optimal 
biological control agent for releasing in the northern 
states. 
 
• Tetrastichus planipennisi also attacks EAB larvae, but 
the female lays eggs inside EAB larvae where the wasp 
larvae grow and eventually kill their host. Because of its 
shorter ovipositor, Tetrastichus targets larvae in ash

biological control agent for releasing in the northern 
states. 
 
• Tetrastichus planipennisi also attacks EAB larvae, but 
the female lays eggs inside EAB larvae where the wasp 
larvae grow and eventually kill their host. Because of its 
shorter ovipositor, Tetrastichus targets larvae in ash 
trees with a diameter of five inches or less. 
 
• Oobius agrili is the smallest of the wasps and targets 
EAB eggs. When this wasp locates an EAB egg in tree 
bark, it injects an egg inside the host egg, where it will 
hatch, grow, and kill the EAB egg. 
 
Do the wasps bother people, pets, or other creatures? 
The wasps are attracted to EAB, not people or pets. The 
wasps may incidentally attack other Agrilus species that 
are similar to EAB, but such incidental attacks are very 
rare and will not disrupt their populations.

When and where have wasps been released in the 
United States? 
 
APHIS first released wasps in Michigan in 2007. Since 
then, we have worked with biological control partners to 
release more than eight million wasps in 30 states and 
the District of Columbia—and recovered their offspring in 
22 states. This means the wasps are establishing, 
reproducing, and more importantly, attacking and killing 
EAB. You can see where wasps have been released by 
visiting www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-health/eab. 
 
How effective are the wasps at killing EAB? 
The most recent study that was conducted in Michigan 
and several northeastern states showed that the wasps 
are killing 20-80% of EAB in ash trees up to eight inches 
in diameter. The study documented that more EAB are 
being attacked by the wasps which is resulting in less 
EAB attacking ash trees, and that ash trees are 
regenerating in these areas because wasps are being 
released. You can read the study online by visiting

Will biological control eventually eradicate EAB? 
The wasps alone will not eradicate EAB. They can be 
used in an integrated pest management plan to help 
control the pest and benefit our landscapes. 
 
How does APHIS determine where to release wasps? 
Each year, APHIS estimates wasp production to 
determine the number of release sites it can support.

How does APHIS determine where to release wasps? 
Each year, APHIS estimates wasp production to 
determine the number of release sites it can support. 
Then release sites are selected based on biological 
control criteria and EAB program priorities outlined in the 
EAB Biocontrol Release Guidelines. You can read the 
guidelines online by visiting 
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info
/emerald_ash_b/downloads/EAB-FieldRelease-
Guidelines.pdf  
 
How are wasps released? 
Once the release areas are identified, APHIS ships the 
wasps to our biological control partners who release 
them in the preapproved and selected area(s). Wasps 
are released according to the Biological Control Release 
and Recovery Guidelines, see link included above. 
APHIS begins shipping wasps in the spring and 
continues until early fall.  
 
 
 
 
Is it safe to release wasps since they are non-native 
insects? 
 
Before the wasps were released, research in China and 
in the United States revealed that the wasps prefer EAB 
over other insects. No adverse effects were found or 
raised through the environmental assessment process.

Can native insects be used to fight EAB instead? 
While there are EAB parasitoids and predators in the 
United States, such as the native stingless wasps 
Atanycolus and Cerceris fumipennis, and woodpeckers, 
these native enemies do not attack EAB at levels high 
enough to make a difference on infestations. 
 
How can I become a biological control partner? 
If you are a public landowner or land manager in an area 
where EAB is infesting ash trees, you can send email 
containing information about the property where you 
would like to release wasps. If the property is selected, 
we will contact you by email. Please send the email to 
EAB.Biocontrol.Program@USDA.gov and include the 
following information in the body of the email: 
1. Property owner/manager name; 
2. Property owner/manager email address; 
3. MapBio number issued through 
www.mapbiocontrol.org; 
4. Name of the county where the property is located; 
5. And the latitude and longitude of the property. 
 
Can the stingless wasps be purchased? 
No. The EAB program is providing stingless wasps to 
states and selected partners to release in EAB-infested 
public areas. Additionally, the stingless wasps are 
difficult to produce which limits their availability.
