EPPO Alert List – Monema flavescens (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae) Why Monema flavescens (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae), formerly placed in the genus Cnidocampa , is native to Asia. In Asia, M. flavescens is a highly polyphagous pest of broadleaf trees including economically important fruit and nut trees. It is believed M. flavescens is increasing in abundance in its native range. M. flavescens has been recently intercepted on imports of bonsai trees into the EPPO Region (EPPO RS 2024/212 ). Considering these recent findings, the NPPO of the Netherlands suggested that M. flavescens could be usefully added to the EPPO Alert List.

This includes trees such as Acer spp., Castanea sativa , Quercus spp., Rhamnus spp., Salix spp., Ulmus spp., Zelkova serrata. As well as fruit trees including Citrus x junos, Diospyros kaki, Juglans regia ., Malus domestica , Prunus spp., Pyrus spp., and Vaccinium spp. M. flavescens is mainly reported on trees in orchards or urban environments. Damage Damage is caused by larvae that defoliate broadleaf tree species. Larvae also have urticating spines which are known human irritants. The level of host damage is unclear and may depend on whether feeding begins before or after fruit maturity, with the lifecycle of M. flavescens dependent on the climate. There is limited literature on M. flavescens but some reports suggest it is increasingly causing major damage affecting tree vigour and fruit quality in China and South Korea. Adults are brownish moths, around 30 mm long. In Asia, they emerge in spring. Eggs are deposited on the underside of leaves. Females normally

, with the lifecycle of M. flavescens dependent on the climate. There is limited literature on M. flavescens but some reports suggest it is increasingly causing major damage affecting tree vigour and fruit quality in China and South Korea. Adults are brownish moths, around 30 mm long. In Asia, they emerge in spring. Eggs are deposited on the underside of leaves. Females normally produce 500-1000 eggs. M. flavescens has six to eight instars and fully grown larvae are 18-24 mm long, their body colour is green and yellow with blue, green and purple markings. Larvae create cocoons on branches or sometimes on the trunk. Dependent on the climate, there can be from one to two generations per year with a overwintering period starting in late summer to early autumn (August to October). Dissemination Adult moths can fly, but no data is available on their flight potential. Over long distances, movements of plants for planting, or host material can transport the pest. Pathways Plants for planting, cut branches? cut foliage? wood? of host plants of M. flavescens from countries where it occurs Possible risks M. flavescens occurs in regions with similar climates to the EPPO region, has a wide host range and many host plants are widespread in the EPPO region. If it was introduced, it could cause economic damage similar to that reported in its native region. In its native range, and where it has been introduced outside of its native range, M. flavescens is suppressed by the presence of natural enemies, however no known natural enemies are established in the EPPO region. EFSA (2023) notes that current phytosanitary measures in the EU prevent import of many of the hosts of M. flavescens . However several hosts are not regulated. It is believed that M. flavescens could establish in much of the EPPO region, although the potential economic
