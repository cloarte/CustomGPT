Used for fuelwood plantations as an ornamental and shade tree, quite tolerant
of heat, the Australian species is widely planted in Oceana and southeast Asia.
The wood is also employed for making farm tools and furniture (NAS, 1983a).
Recent Australian tests suggest that 10-year old trees can be pulped readily by
the sulfate process, giving high pulp yields, with good strength properties.
Also produces high quality pulp by the neutral sulfite semichemical process.
The tannin produces a good quality leather, inclined to redden upon exposure to
sunlight (NAS, 1980a).  The plant is amazing in its ability to recolonize
wastes, papermill sludge, pH ca 9.5; even uranium spoils, pH ca 3.0; the only
tree found on 20-year old uranium spoil.  Used for the cultivation of the lac
insect in India.

Description
Resilient, vigorously growing, crooked or gnarled deciduous or evergreen tree,
possibly attaining 30 m height, 60 cm DBH.  Leaves alternate, simple flattened
phyllodes, lanceolate or oblong, arcuate, long-attenuate at both ends, 10–16 cm
long, ca 1.5–2.5 cm broad, thick coriaceous, glabrous with several long
parallel veins from the base.  Spikes 5–8 cm long, paired at the leaf bases.
Flowers sessile, ca 3 mm long, the calyx glabrous, 5-toothed, the 5 petals ca 2
mm long.  Stamens numerous, filiform, ca 3 mm long.  Ovary pubescent, the style
filiform.  Pods 6–8 cm long, 1–1.5 cm broad, flattened but coiled.  Seeds
several, flattened-ellipsoid, ca 5 mm long, with a reddish or orangish aril
(Little, 1983).  Seeds 53,000–62,000/kg.

Germplasm
Reported from the Australian Center of Diversity,
Acacia auriculiformis
,
or cvs thereof, is reported to tolerate alkalinity, desiccation, drought, fire,
high pH, laterite, poor soil, sand dunes, and savanna.  It is intolerant of
hurricane, shade, and weeds, at least in early stages.  Once established, the
tree is quite competitive with weeds.  Though somewhat tolerant of fire, it is
not so resistant as Eucalyptus.  (2
n
= 26)
Distribution
Native to the savannas of New Guinea, islands of the Torres Strait, and
northern Australia, it has been widely introduced, e.g. in Fiji, India,
Indonesia, Java, Malaysia, Niger, Nigeria, Philippines, Tanzania, Thailand, the
Soloman Islands, Uganda, and Zanzibar.
Ecology
Estimated to range from Subtropical Moist to Wet through Tropical Dry to Wet
Forest Life Zones,
Acacia auriculiformis
is reported to tolerate annual
precipitation of 7.5 to 27 dm, annual temperature of 26 to 30°C, and pH of
3.0 to 9.5.  With practically no maintenance it will grow on a wide range of
deep and shallow soils, compacted clays, coral soils, laterites, limestone,
mica schist, mine spoil, podzols, even sand dunes and unstable slopes.

 practically no maintenance it will grow on a wide range of

mica schist, mine spoil, podzols, even sand dunes and unstable slopes.
Cultivation
It has been suggested as an interplant with long-term timber Dalbergias, itself
serving as a short-term but renewable firewood source.  Seeds, storable for 18
months in airtight containers, should be soaked in hot water for 24 hours.  Sow
in full light, allowing 6 days for germination (ca 80% germination after 2–4
weeks).  To reforest grassland, burn and plant in holes ca 36 x 30 x 30 cm,
spaced at 1–2.5 or 1–3 m if intercropped with
Cassia siamea
. Recent
spacings have been 2.5 x 2.5 m.
Harvesting
In Indomalaysia, stands are operated on 10–12 year rotations.  Trees coppice
poorly.  Indonesians have gotten some coppice when trees are cut at least 50 cm
above the ground.  When trees are felled, there is usually a swarm of
seedlings, so cutover stands regenerate readily.
Yields and Economics
With rainfall at 2700 mm, at 3 years, average height of a stand with 1010
trees/ha was 12.4 m, average diameter 12.2 cm, standing wood volume 73.2 m

shading out weeds.  Average amount of dead litter is 4800 kg/ha.  In Java,
there may be 3 MT/ha leaves and 2 MT/ha twigs and branches beneath the trees
(NAS, 1982a).  On infertile abandoned sites in Papua, trees grew 6 m in 2
years, 17 m in 8 years.  On shallow arid soils in West Bengal, yields were only

its capacity to produce good fuelwood on poor soils, even where there are
extended dry seasons, the species "merits large scale testing as a fuelwood
species" (NAS, 1980).  Wood has specific gravity of 0.6–0.75 and calorific
value of 4,800–4,900 kcal/kg.  Wood yields excellent charcoal that glows well
and burns without smoke or sparks.  Litter beneath the trees, both branches and
dried leaves, annually adds up to 4.5–6 MT/ha, all used for fuel in China.
Hawaiian grown material possesses N-fixing nodules.
Biotic Factors
While no pest or disease problems are reported in Indonesia, insects and
nematodes have been reported to attack seedlings in Zanzibar.  The rust
Uromyces digitatus
has been a problem in Java, where it is also
occasionally infested with a rather inocuous black mildew,
Meliola
adenanphererae

Ganoderma lucidum
and
Ganoderma applanatum

Hypothenemus dimorphus
has caused shoot
fatality in Malaysia.  The weevil
Hypomeces squamosus

India and Malaysia.  Used to cultivate
