Cerastium diffusumPers. - Dark-green Mouse-ear  -Caryophyllaceae© Roy Anderson© Graham Day© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)© Roy AndersonAn obsolete name for this small annual species isC. tetrandrumwhich reflects the fact that normally the flower-parts are in fours (four sepals, four petals, four stamens and four styles), although occasionally plants with flower-parts in fives are found. The bracts are entirely green and leaf-like. Contrast these features with the somewhat similar little mouse-ear,C. semidecandrum. Locally common in sand dunes or other dry sandy and stony places.All names:Cerastium diffusumPers.;Cerastium atrovirensBab.;Cerastium tetrandrumCurt.;Cerastium subtetrandrumauct.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
