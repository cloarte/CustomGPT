Potato Cyst 
Nematode National 
Survey Plan:
“Looking” To Keep Potato 
Markets Open
Agricultural Pest Survey, pale cyst nematode 
was only detected by testing residual soil that 
accompanied potatoes into the storage facility.   
Pest survey specialists follow established survey 
guidelines to collect soil samples for PCN testing. 
During these surveys, each field must be sampled 
at a rate of one 5-pound sample per surveyed acre. 
All samples are collected and sent to an approved 
laboratory for diagnostic testing. Each soil sample is 
then processed in its entirety to get accurate  
test results.
The Benefits of Participation
Participation in the survey is voluntary. As a grower, 
your support is key to a successful survey and 
brings benefits to the entire potato industry. The 
more growers who participate in the survey, the 
more information we will have to show that—other 
than the isolated PCN detections in Idaho and New 
York—these pests are not present in the United 
States. This information will help improve the U.S. 
potato crop’s marketability at home and abroad. 
Even if we find more isolated cases of PCN through 
the survey, APHIS and the States are ready to 
contain any potential problems and minimize the 
negative effects that may result. In this way, survey 
and early detection will better protect the U.S. potato 
industry from the serious costs of allowing PCN to 
spread unchecked or become established here.

Introduction
In the last few decades, trade with foreign countries 
has increased dramatically, opening new markets for 
U.S. commodities and filling American grocery stores 
with tastes from other nations. Similarly, international 
travel has exposed Americans to new cultures and 
brought visitors from all over the world to the United 
States. With these opportunities, however, come 
increased risks that invasive plant pests and diseases 
will enter our country.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) uses 
agricultural safeguarding tools and techniques, such 
as early detection through surveillance, to keep

and protect American agriculture. Infestations

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) uses 
agricultural safeguarding tools and techniques, such 
as early detection through surveillance, to keep 
foreign pests and diseases out of the United States 
and protect American agriculture. Infestations of exotic 
pests such as the pale cyst nematode (Globodera 
pallida) and the golden nematode (G. rostochiensis) 
can permanently damage agriculture and natural 
resources. Collectively, these pests are known as 
potato cyst nematodes (PCN). If PCN became 
established in the United States, their presence could 
eventually shut down potato exports to other countries. 
Some plant pests, such as the Japanese beetle and 
Asian gypsy moth, leave almost immediate evidence 
of their presence. Others, like PCN, can go undetected 
for months or years—even decades—without vigilant 
surveillance. When plant pests are detected early, we 
have more opportunities to effectively control them; 
minimize pesticide use; enhance product quality 
and marketability; and ensure an abundant, readily 
available, and affordable supply of food, fiber, plants, 
and plant products for domestic and export markets.  
Background
PCN are major pests of potato crops in cool weather 
areas. Pale cyst nematode was detected for the first 
time in the United States in 2006 at a grader facility 
in eastern Idaho. After conducting rigorous surveys, 
agriculture officials isolated the pest to potato 
fields within a small 7.5-mile radius spanning two 
counties in southeastern Idaho. Golden nematode

areas. Pale cyst nematode was detected for the first 
time in the United States in 2006 at a grader facility 
in eastern Idaho. After conducting rigorous surveys, 
agriculture officials isolated the pest to potato 
fields within a small 7.5-mile radius spanning two 
counties in southeastern Idaho. Golden nematode 
was first detected in 1941 in Long Island, NY 
(Nassau County). Since then, it has been confined 
to small areas within eight counties in that State. 
Both nematodes originated in South America and 
are now widely distributed in many potato-growing 
regions throughout the world. In North America, the 
pale cyst nematode and golden nematode are also 
present in Quebec, Alberta, and on the islands of 
Newfoundland and Vancouver Island in Canada.
The main host plant for PCN is potatoes. Other 
plants within the potato family, including tomatoes, 
eggplants, and some weeds, can also serve as 
hosts. PCN are soil-borne, microscopic nematodes 
that infest feeder roots, where the females attach, 
feed, and become sedentary. Nematodes reproduce 
sexually. Males are attracted to females by a 
pheromone (sex attractant) and may mate several 
times. Females form cysts containing 200 to 600 
eggs. Cysts can stay dormant for up to 30 years 
while the eggs inside remain viable. When there are 
large numbers of nematodes, they can cause wilting, 
stunted growth, poor root development, and early 
plant death. If left uncontrolled, PCN can reduce 
yields up to 80 percent in potato fields.

large numbers of nematodes, they can cause wilting, 
stunted growth, poor root development, and early 
plant death. If left uncontrolled, PCN can reduce 
yields up to 80 percent in potato fields. 
Preventing the Spread 
To keep PCN from spreading, APHIS restricts 
the interstate movement of certain products from 
regulated areas in Idaho and New York. These 
products include the following: 
 n potatoes and other PCN host crops
 n root crops
 n nursery stock
 n soil, compost, humus, muck, peat, and   
  decomposed manure 
 n grass sod
 n hay, straw, fodder, and plant litter
 n used farm and construction equipment
 n garden and dry beans (Idaho)
	n  small grains and soybeans (New York)
	n  ear corn, except shucked (New York)
These products can be moved outside of a 
quarantined area only when accompanied by a 
certificate or limited permit signed by a State or 
Federal inspector.
National Survey Plan
Working closely with the potato industry, APHIS’ 
Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) program 
developed a multiyear, science-based National 
Survey Plan to detect PCN in potato-producing 
States. The survey’s intent is to find any potential 
problems early and gather information to show 
trading partners that U.S. potatoes are PCN-free.
If a new detection of PCN occurs, APHIS and 
State officials will take regulatory actions, such 
as quarantines and eradication efforts, to protect 
other potato fields and minimize the impact on the

If a new detection of PCN occurs, APHIS and 
State officials will take regulatory actions, such 
as quarantines and eradication efforts, to protect 
other potato fields and minimize the impact on the 
potato industry as a whole. In such an event, APHIS 
is committed to working with potato growers and 
State counterparts to develop a reasonable and 
appropriate response.
Survey Methods
PCN infestations may show up as patches of poor 
growth. Affected potato plants may have yellowing, 
wilting, or dead leaves, but these symptoms are 
not always present. For example, in Idaho in 2006,
