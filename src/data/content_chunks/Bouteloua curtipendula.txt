Side-oats grama
Gramineae, Poaceae
Bouteloua curtipendula
(Michx.) Torr.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a long-lived native grass, widely distributed, but mostabundant in the Central and Southern Great Plains. It produces short rhizomesand tends to a bunch-type growth. The leaves are about 6 inches long and under 0.25 inch wide. Flower stems may reach to 3 feet. It produces an abundance of leafy forage well liked by all classes of livestock. Hay of good quality is produced if mowed sufficiently early. It is adapted to wide ranges of soil and climate. Seedling vigor is good, and stands are readilyestablished by seeding. Generally, side-oats grama is seeded in mixtures withother grasses. Several varieties of superior local adaptation are in thetrade.
