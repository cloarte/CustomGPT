 Invasion: T. arvenseis an annual or winter annual. The entire plant is glabrous and bright green, with an unpleasant odour when bruised. Stems are erect, 18 to 80 cm tall, simple or branched above. The leaves are alternate, with basal leaves narrowly obovate, petioled and soon withering, the middle and upper leaves are oblong, entire or irregularly toothed and clasp the stem by two ear-lobes, 1 to 1.5 mm long. The flowers are initially in a small, flat cluster at the top of the leafy stem with racemes becoming elongated when in fruit, perfect, regular with four sepals, four white petals, 3 to 4 mm long; six stamens, two shorter than others. The silicule is pod-like, borne on slender, upward curving stalks, bright green to yellowish to greenish-

 small, flat cluster at the top of the leafy stem with racemes becoming elongated when in fruit, perfect, regular with four sepals, four white petals, 3 to 4 mm long; six stamens, two shorter than others. The silicule is pod-like, borne on slender, upward curving stalks, bright green to yellowish to greenish-orange. As the seeds ripen they are easily seen in crop fields, almost circular, 1.25 cm across, strongly flattened and winged. The very short style persists in a deep, narrow notch at the top of the wings, dehiscent, the two-winged locules each with 4 to 16 seeds. The seeds are ovoid, 1.2 to 2.3 mm long and 1 to 1.5 mm wide, reddish or purplish-brown to black, unsymmetrically oval in outline, somewhat flattened with several concentric ridges resembling a finger print, each face with a narrow groove extending from the hilum to the centre of the seed.

 Reproduccion: T. arvense is an annual or winter annual species which reproduces solely by seed. The species exhibits a high degree of ecotypic variation and the many biotypes recorded mean that differences in the species phenology have been reported from various parts of its geographic range. In Nebraska, USA (41°N), McCarty (1986) reported the average date for seedling emergence as March 10, and for the production of the first mature seeds as between May 7 and 23. In Canada (50°N), the average date for emergence of 50% of seedlings was April 30 and July 7 for the shedding of the first mature seeds. In both cases mature seeds were shed long before crop harvest.

In Canada (50°N), the average date for emergence of 50% of seedlings was April 30 and July 7 for the shedding of the first mature seeds. In both cases mature seeds were shed long before crop harvest. The phenotypic plasticity of T. arvense is demonstrated by the morphological responses of individual plants to soil and environmental conditions. In shallow, dry and infertile soils, plants may be unbranched and as small as 1 cm tall, whereas in favourable sites, many flowering lateral branches are formed and individuals may reach 80 cm ( Best and McIntyre, 1975 ). T. arvense is a prolific seed producer, with yields as high as 20,000 seeds/plant ( Holm et al., 1997 ). In Finland, Paatela and Ervio (1971) reported 20 to 450 seeds/m² in the upper layers of soil, whilst in Canada, Batho (1939) found 1300 seeds/m². The large soil seed bank of T. arvense and hence the potential for serious weed infestations have led to a large volume of research into the species germination biology. No doubt due in part to the genetic variability of this species many of the findings have been contradictory. Chepil (1946a) and McIntyre and Best (1975) reported that fresh seed was non-dormant, giving almost 100% germination in light and an alternating temperature regime of 10/25°C. Salisbury (1964) reported good germination of fresh seed, but also that a proportion were firmly dormant. Baskin and Baskin (1988, 1989) found that in May most freshly-matured seeds were dormant.

Holm et al. (1997) suggest that seeds produced by winter annual populations are initially non-dormant in autumn, becoming dormant in winter, and that those produced by summer annual populations are dormant in autumn, becoming non-dormant during winter. Physical and chemical stimulants have been widely reported to break the dormancy of T. arvense seeds. Koch (1967) showed that seeds responded well at pHs of between 4 and 7. Germination decreases as atmospheric oxygen falls from 20 to 12% and no germination was observed at carbon dioxide levels above 9% ( Chepil, 1946a ; Bibbey, 1948 ). Germination is also stimulated by giberellic acid ( Corns, 1960a , b), sodium hypochlorite ( Hsiao, 1980 ) and seed coat removal or scarification ( Pelton, 1956 ; Salisbury, 1964 ). The success of T. arvense as a weed, due in part to the large volume of seed it produces, is increased by its ability to survive in the soil seed bank for periods of between 20 and 30 years ( Duvel, 1905 ; Smith, 1917 ). Seed longevity increases with depth of burial; after 3 years burial at 6 and 15 cm, Chepil (1946b) recorded 5 and 15% survival of T. arvense seeds, respectively. The species is not able to emerge from great depths and Kolk (1947) found that greatest germination occurred in the top 2 cm of the soil. Seed is dispersed by a number of agents.

The seeds are winged and wind dispersal may carry the seed for distances of up to 1 km or more ( Ridley, 1930 ). The seed may also travel as a contaminant of crop seed.
