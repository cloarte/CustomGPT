When outbreaks occur, we take immediate action to eradicate them. Our eradication programs use an integrated pest management strategy that includes a range of control methods, both chemical and nonchemical. These methods have effectively eradicated spot infestations of fruit flies in the United States since 1984. Eradication work may also include enforcing quarantines, placing and checking additional fruit fly traps, removing fruit at infested and neighboring properties, and other related efforts.
