 Reproduccion: Doane and McManus (1981) extensively reviewed most aspects of the biology, ecology and population dynamics of L . dispar dispar . Other reviews include Leonard (1974) , Wellenstein and Schwenke (1978) , Montgomery and Wallner (1988) , Elkinton and Liebhold (1990) , Liebhold and Tobin (2006) and Tobin et al. (2009) . The life-cycle of L. dispar dispar is as follows. It has one generation per year. Overwintering eggs hatch as host trees are producing new leaves, from late March to late May, depending on the climatic situation. Newly hatched larvae can remain on the egg masses for several days before climbing the trees to the branch tips and starting to feed on buds and new leaves. First instars are the main natural dispersal stage. As larvae move upwards, they spin a thread of silk and suspend themselves from the threads that eventually fracture. The young larva is then carried by the wind. While most larvae will not move more than 200 m, some are reported to travel several kilometres. During the first three instars, feeding occurs by daylight. From the fourth instar onwards, larvae mainly feed at night and leave the foliage during daylight to seek resting sites in the litter or on the trunk. However, at outbreak density, feeding continues during the day. Males

 then carried by the wind. While most larvae will not move more than 200 m, some are reported to travel several kilometres. During the first three instars, feeding occurs by daylight. From the fourth instar onwards, larvae mainly feed at night and leave the foliage during daylight to seek resting sites in the litter or on the trunk. However, at outbreak density, feeding continues during the day. Males usually have five instars and females six. The final instars are by far the most voracious feeders. On average, during its entire life, a single larva consumes a total of about 1 m² of foliage ( Doane and McManus, 1981 ). The larval stage lasts around 8 weeks. At the end of this period, larvae find a resting site, usually on a trunk, on a rock or in the litter, and surround themselves with a silken nest in which they will pupate. Pupal development is usually complete within 2 weeks. Males emerge 1 or 2 days before females and at emergence both sexes are sexually mature. Males are good flyers, but females are flightless, although their wings are fully formed. After emergence, females crawl to an elevated place, usually the tree trunk, and begin releasing a sex pheromone to attract males. Mating lasts up to 1 h, and although males are capable of mating several times, females usually only mate once, though adult age can affect rates of egg fertilization ( Tobin et al., 2014b ). Immediately after mating, oviposition of a single egg mass begins. All adults are short-lived, surviving for less than 1 week during which no feeding occurs. Embryogenesis commences soon after oviposition and fully formed larvae are complete in the eggs about 2 months after their oviposition. Eggs undergo obligatory diapause. It is not uncommon to find a small number of larvae hatching in late summer but these never complete development.

Embryogenesis commences soon after oviposition and fully formed larvae are complete in the eggs about 2 months after their oviposition. Eggs undergo obligatory diapause. It is not uncommon to find a small number of larvae hatching in late summer but these never complete development.
 Sintomas: Hatching larvae usually start feeding on flushing buds and, later on, newly expanded leaves. High populations often result in total tree defoliation, often across a large spatial area.

The Spongy Moth Program Manual is a source of information on spongy moth and a reference 
for the methods and procedures for survey, regulatory, outreach, and control activities. 
Damage Caused by the Spongy Moth 
Spongy moth is one of the most destructive pests of shade, fruit, and ornamental trees as well as 
hardwood forests. In the period of 1980 to 1989, spongy moth defoliated close to one million or more 
forested acres each year. 
Besides being a pest of trees, spongy moth larvae are a nuisance to people. 
· Spongy moth larvae excrete digested leaf material while feeding in the tree canopy. For 
this reason, people will avoid using wooded parks and yards during the larval season 
· Dead larvae produce foul odors 
· Spongy moth nuisances hinder people’s ability to enjoy the outdoors

 are a nuisance to people. 
· Spongy moth larvae excrete digested leaf material while feeding in the tree canopy. For 
this reason, people will avoid using wooded parks and yards during the larval season 
· Dead larvae produce foul odors 
· Spongy moth nuisances hinder people’s ability to enjoy the outdoors 
· When spongy moth populations are dense, larvae become hyperactive during the day. 
Heavily infested areas teem with larvae on trees, telephone poles, vehicles, fences, houses, 
clotheslines, and above-ground swimming pools. People avoid going outdoors for fear of 
stepping on caterpillars crawling on sidewalks and in play areas. 
Background on Spongy Moth 
Accidentally introduced into the United States in 1869 in Medford, Massachusetts, the pest spread rapidly 
throughout New England. Between 1869 and 1890, spongy moth quickly developed into a serious 
problem in Massachusetts. Spongy moth damage was one of the key reasons Congress passed the Plant 
Quarantine Act of 1912. 
Despite early eradication efforts, spongy moth is now widely established. Maps of the generally infested 
area and a list of areas under quarantine are available on the APHIS Spongy Moth website. 
Research development and implementing survey, regulatory, and control programs have made spongy 
moth one of the most studied insects in the pest management field. 
Cooperation in the Spongy Moth Program 
Since the end of the last century, Federal, State, Tribal, and local government agencies have worked 
cooperatively to control spongy moth populations (by containment, suppression, or eradication, alone or 
in combination). Cooperative programs will continue to be the focus of the U.S. Department of

Spongy Moth Dispersal 
With the current mobility of the U.S. population, the sprawling suburbanization of once-forested areas, 
and the insidious nature of the pest, the job of preventing establishment of isolated infestations by 
artificial spread is a difficult one. Household moves, especially the movement of outdoor articles such as 
lawnmowers and grills, are an important pathway for the long-distance movement of spongy moth. To 
contain spongy moth, an effective program will require: 1) public education on the problem; 2) public 
support in preventing spongy moth movement; and 3) early detection and eradication of isolated 
infestations. 
Potential Damage from the Spongy Moth 
All temperate hardwood growing areas in North America are potentially at risk from attack by spongy 
moth. Despite all attempts to prevent its movement, spongy moth continues to increase its range along the 
leading edge of the quarantine area. 
Preventive Safety Measures 
Safety measures involving personnel, the public, and equipment are the responsibility of all persons

· Detect outlying introductions of the pest to new areas 
· Delimit outlying detections to determine control treatment needs; and 
· Support regulatory decision making and actions 
The Spongy Moth Program relies on effective survey tools, strategies, and methods to provide 
critical information that guides all other aspects of program delivery. The annual national 
detection survey is necessary to find outlying introductions of the pest in uninfested areas in a 
timely manner to ensure the introductions do not result in large, established breeding populations 
that would be difficult and costly to eradicate. Delimiting surveys are used to define the outer 
boundaries of an infestation or to ensure small, outlying populations go extinct on their own due 
to natural factors (e.g., predation and inability to find mating partners). Egg mass and other types 
of surveys are useful in determining population levels and infestation densities. 
Because the information gathered through survey work underpins the rest of the Spongy Moth 
Program’s efforts, it is important to conduct surveys properly. Properly run surveys provide 
quality information to the program, and conversely, poorly run surveys yield lower quality, less 
useful information compromising overall program effectiveness. This chapter provides guidance 
on how to properly plan and conduct a spongy moth survey.

Planning the Survey 
The National Spongy Moth Survey is a resource-efficient survey designed to detect infestations 
before expansive land areas must be treated. 
Step 1: Determine the type of survey to be conducted (e.g., detection or delimiting) 
If you are planning a detection survey, refer to Detection Survey for categorizing sites. If you are 
planning a delimiting survey, determine the trapping density following the guidelines on

 detect infestations 
before expansive land areas must be treated. 
Step 1: Determine the type of survey to be conducted (e.g., detection or delimiting) 
If you are planning a detection survey, refer to Detection Survey for categorizing sites. If you are 
planning a delimiting survey, determine the trapping density following the guidelines on 
Delimiting Survey. 
Step 2: Determine Trapping Requirements 
When determining trapping requirements, consider the frequency for trapping an area and the 
last time the area was trapped. If an area must be trapped every 2 years and the area was trapped 
last year, do not trap the area in the current year. Consider available funding and other resources 
when planning and conducting surveys. 
Step 3: Determine Survey Needs (Personnel and Supplies) 
Step 3a: Formula for Determining Trap Needs 
The number of square miles in a category multiplied by the number of traps per square mile (trap 
density). Divide the total by the trapping frequency (in years) to get the number of traps required 
per year. 
(no. of sq. mi. x trap density)/trapping frequency in years = total number of traps required 
EXAMPLE Determine trap needs for Category 1, which is 250 sq. mi. in total area and trapped 
every 2 years. 
(250 square miles x 1)/2 years = 250/2 = 125 traps 
For a Category 1 area, which is 250 sq. mi. and trapped every two years, 125 traps 
are needed. 
Step 3b: Formula for Determining Personnel Needs 
Divide the trap total by the number of traps a trap tender can service under the conditions 
experienced in a specific State. For detection surveys, a national average is 400 traps per trap 
tender.

Step 3b: Formula for Determining Personnel Needs 
Divide the trap total by the number of traps a trap tender can service under the conditions 
experienced in a specific State. For detection surveys, a national average is 400 traps per trap 
tender. In areas with difficult terrain, the average falls to 250 traps per trap tender. For delimiting 
surveys, the average is 750 traps per trap tender; for transition zone surveys, the average is 600 
traps per trap tender.

total traps/no. of traps tender can service = total trap tenders required 
EXAMPLE Determine how many trap tenders to hire for the season when conducting a detection 
survey that requires 1,200 traps. 
1,200 traps/400 = 3 trap tenders 
Step 4: Prepare a Trapping Budget 
After determining the needed traps and trap tenders, prepare a trapping budget. 
Budget for the following expenses (adjust for inflation): 
· Travel costs for trap tenders 
· Trap tenders’ hours 
· Trap and lure costs 
· Other materials (staples, staplers, maps) 
Conduct the Survey 
Step 1: Establish Trapping Grid for Survey 
Establish the trapping grid well in advance of the survey season (late winter/ early spring) to 
allow adequate time for review and consultation prior to trap placement. 
Using geographic information systems (GIS) to establish the base grid density is very useful, 
though not required. In addition, GIS systems can adjust the scale of the map to allow

 Grid for Survey 
Establish the trapping grid well in advance of the survey season (late winter/ early spring) to 
allow adequate time for review and consultation prior to trap placement. 
Using geographic information systems (GIS) to establish the base grid density is very useful, 
though not required. In addition, GIS systems can adjust the scale of the map to allow for greater 
resolution when placing traps in higher densities. Using an established grid ensures appropriate 
trap distribution throughout the established survey area. 
Capture GPS coordinates as traps are set; some find it useful to physically plot the trap locations 
on a map as a backup measure. To aid in monitoring and retrieving, number traps consecutively 
within a county as they are set. 
Alternatively, you may use preprinted bar codes to identify a specific or individual trap. 
NOTICE 
Never prenumber traps and set them randomly from a box or bag!

Step 3: Set Traps and Mark Location 
Step 3a: Setting Traps 
The timing for setting traps is critical. Phenology models may be available to assist with 
determining the proper timing for trap placement. 
NOTICE 
Directions for assembling traps are available in How to Assemble Traps. The spongy moth lures will 
remain active for at most 3 years from the date of manufacture (typically identified on each package) 
and if stored in the freezer. 
The grid locations are already marked on a map. Use discretion in selecting the exact location of 
the traps. Once traps are placed, record the location GPS coordinates within the grid. If a suitable 
trap location cannot be found within the grid, document the reason why.

trap location cannot be found within the grid, document the reason why. 
General Rules for Setting Traps 
1. Obtain property owners’ permission before placing a trap. If not possible, leave a door 
hanger or other program information with the trap. 
2. Male moths usually frequent woodlands rather than open areas with no trees or shrubs. 
3. If available, woodland edges are good sites for trap placement. If there is a choice, place 
the trap on the windward side so the wind currents will carry the scent pheromone) into the 
woods. 
4. If there are no woodlands or residential areas within a reasonable distance (500 to 1,000 
feet) from the plotted map location, the best location for a trap is at the end of a hedge row 
or tree leading to a wooded area. 
5. Place traps four to five feet high (or eye level if less than five feet) on tree trunks. In areas 
frequented by small children and animals such as cattle and bears, place the trap out of 
their sight and reach. Because of vandalism, trap placement is especially important when 
trapping Category S areas (such as recreational parks, campgrounds, and tourist 
attractions). 
6. If possible, place traps in shady areas. Do not set the trap where foliage or branches will 
block the trap openings. 
7. Complete trap record including a sketch showing specific trap location. 
8. Avoid setting traps on or in the following situations. 
A. Close

7. Complete trap record including a sketch showing specific trap location. 
8. Avoid setting traps on or in the following situations. 
A. Close to gravel roads (place trap at least 50 feet away from well-traveled roads) 
B. Properties for sale 
C. Parks or open areas where people can easily see the traps 
D. Properties with aggressive dogs 
Survey 
Conduct the Survey 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 2-7 
E. Private property without the owner’s permission 
F. School properties or along passageways where students walk 
G. Sites where GPS coordinates cannot be obtained 
H. Sites where farm animals may damage or destroy traps 
I. Sites where road construction is scheduled or in progress 
J. Sites within locked gates 
K. Sites obscured by tree branches 
L. Trees with poison ivy vines 
M. Trees marked for cutting or removal 
The distance between traps depends on the selected trap density and the availability of favored 
host trees. When possible, place the traps in a uniform array on choice hosts or in a preferred 
habitat. 
Delta traps (Figure 2-2) are most effective when attached directly to the trunk of a host tree. The 
preferred way to attach a trap to the tree is to tie a string around the tree and hang the clip on the 
string or staple the trap to the tree. Hang the traps at chest height unless vandalism or animal 
damage is a problem, in which case they should be hung higher.

damage is a problem, in which case they should be hung higher. 
Milk carton traps (Figure 2-3) are used in Slow the Spread (STS) and other surveys to monitor 
spongy moth population levels when the pest is known to be present in the area.

Figure 2-3 Milk Carton Trap 
Step 3b: Marking Trap Locations 
Mark trap locations to expedite trap tending as well as supervisory and quality control activities. 
Use plastic flagging ribbon or marking crayon. To mark a trap location, tie a piece of flagging 
ribbon to a telephone pole, tree trunk, or other suitable object at the roadside. The ribbon should 
be visible from the road when approached from either side. Mark trap location only when 
necessary. 
Brightly colored plastic tape (fluorescent orange) has proven to be the best flagging ribbon. The 
marking crayon must be sufficiently soft to mark wet trees. Place a small piece of flagging 
ribbon near the trap. 
In urban areas where streets are named and houses are numbered, use the house address and GPS 
coordinates for locating traps. Do not mark trap locations with ribbons or marking crayons in

In urban areas where streets are named and houses are numbered, use the house address and GPS 
coordinates for locating traps. Do not mark trap locations with ribbons or marking crayons in 
urban areas. Also, use restraint in marking roadside rest areas, picnic areas, tourist attractions, 
and other high-use areas where the ribbon will detract from the site’s appearance. 
Step 4: Check the Traps 
For detection surveys, check each trap at least once during the middle of the trapping season. 
For delimiting surveys, check traps more frequently, preferably every 10 to 14 days. Under ideal 
conditions, trap checking will start when the male moths start flying. Where vandalism is likely, 

Survey

9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 2-9 
check the traps more often. Phenology models can be useful for determining the proper timing 
for initial trap checks. 
Plan your trap-checking route before leaving the office. Select a route that will eliminate 
overlapping travel. 
When checking traps, bring a supply of replacement traps and lures to replace all vandalized and 
missing traps. When replacing a trap, number the replacement trap with the same number as the 
original trap with an additional indicator (such as the letter “R,” e.g., 416-R) highlighting that it 
is a replacement trap. 
When checking traps: 
1. Check overall trap condition and replace badly damaged traps. 
2. When trap contains a suspect moth, remove the trap without disturbing the specimen. Note 
on the trap record sheet the date and exact location of recovery and inform your supervisor. 
3. Record the trap inspection by noting the date on the trap and PPQ Form 343 (Trapping 
Record)

1. Check overall trap condition and replace badly damaged traps. 
2. When trap contains a suspect moth, remove the trap without disturbing the specimen. Note 
on the trap record sheet the date and exact location of recovery and inform your supervisor. 
3. Record the trap inspection by noting the date on the trap and PPQ Form 343 (Trapping 
Record) or local trap record sheet. 
4. Write the following information on the trap: trap number, county, trapper’s initials, date 
trap set, and each date the trap is checked. 
Check the trap by looking in both ends. There is no need to remove it from the tree. Look into 
the trap to see if there are any male moths. If a suspect male is present, remove and replace the 
trap. 
Step 5: Submit Spongy Moth Suspects 
Submit the trap with the suspect moth to your supervisor to submit to the PPQ Forest Pest 
Methods Laboratory (FPML) (formerly known as the Otis Laboratory) for confirmation and 
further identification. Alternatively, your supervisor may direct you to submit the specimen 
directly to the FPML. Refer to A ppendix C for specimen submission guidelines. 
Record on the bottom of the trap the date, time, results, GPS coordinates, and any pertinent 
observation or action taken. 
Record the date and all circumstances about the catch of suspect moths on the trap record sheet 
or in the USDA-approved database. Accurate information is essential to the trapping program. 
Complete the form each time you check the trap and find spongy moth. The data you report is as 
important as the trap placement. 
Step 6: Remove Traps

or in the USDA-approved database. Accurate information is essential to the trapping program. 
Complete the form each time you check the trap and find spongy moth. The data you report is as 
important as the trap placement. 
Step 6: Remove Traps 
At the end of the trapping season remove all traps and examine each for spongy moth. Carefully 
look for missing traps. If a trap number cannot be read, rewrite the number on the bottom of the 
trap. 
When removing the trap, remove all other materials (string, lures, staples, wire). Also, remove all 
flagging tape. Give all removed traps to the person in charge of the survey. For each trap 
containing a suspect moth, provide the following information: location (State, county, town, and 
GPS coordinates); trap number; trap tender’s name or identification number; date; and host tree

name. Open traps on final check because moths can be missed when just looking through the trap 
ends. Flatten empty, used traps and dispose by incinerating or burying at a sanitary landfill. 
Destroy the lures with the traps. 
Step 7: Report Survey Results 
Refer to Spongy Moth Data Collection for instructions on reporting survey data into the USDA-
approved database as soon as possible and on a regular basis as detailed in your cooperative 
agreement or no later than December 31st, whichever is earlier.

Step 8: Interpret Survey Results 
If you found spongy moth during your survey, use the guidance on interpreting survey results in 
the specific sections below. 
Survey Records and Maps 
To document the survey, accurate and complete survey records and maps must be maintained. 
Records 
Maintain a record of all trap locations including any descriptive information needed to help 
locate traps (trap site map or PPQ Form 353). Include information such as date set, date 
inspected, and date removed, as well as trap catches. Record this information on a trap record 
sheet or mobile device and promptly enter the information into the USDA-approved database. 
Keep a separate record of any egg mass surveys. 
Use local guidelines for proper record maintenance. In developing local guidelines for survey 
records, determine what information is needed and the most efficient manner for recording each 
item. 
Record all trap locations and positive trap findings; verify trap locations on the map. Traps for 
which no moth catches are reported are assumed to be negative for the season. 
Record trapping data throughout the season, as frequently as possible, into the 
USDA-approved database. Refer to Spongy Moth Data Collection for instructions on reporting 
into the database. 
Maps 
For surveys, digital GIS maps or county or city maps are satisfactory. 
Consecutively number every trap location within each county. The type, number, and trap 
distribution will vary according to local needs. 
Prepare trap maps before the trapping season (the preferred method) using a grid system to 
assure proper trap distribution. Use GIS software, a grid, calipers, a ruler, or an overlay to plot

9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 2-11 
Please ensure the map contains a legend detailing the program starting date, completion date, 
name of trapper, and any other pertinent information. 
When using maps for postseason decision making, indicate both negative and positive trap 
catches on the map. The negative traps are important when determining the pattern of trap 
catches and establishing treatment boundaries. 
Revising Quarantine Maps 
Determine quarantine revisions in consultation with national program management. National 
program management will follow established protocols for quarantine expansion activities by 
issuing Federal Orders, changing web listing(s), revising maps, and/or publishing interim or 
proposed rules in the Federal Register. 
Detection Survey 
Purpose 
The purpose of a detection survey is to determine by trapping: 
· Where isolated infestations of spongy moth occur 
· Where further delimiting surveys are required 
Detection surveys are designed to find isolated infestations of spongy moth as soon as possible 
after introduction; small spongy moth infestations are less expensive and easier to eradicate than 
large infestations.

 Where isolated infestations of spongy moth occur 
· Where further delimiting surveys are required 
Detection surveys are designed to find isolated infestations of spongy moth as soon as possible 
after introduction; small spongy moth infestations are less expensive and easier to eradicate than 
large infestations. 
Due to differences in habitat, host availability, and patterns of movement of regulated articles 
(refer to Regulated Articles) from infested areas, not all areas within a State have the same 
potential for becoming infested. The risk of potential introduction and establishment will 
determine the areas in which a detection survey is needed. High-risk areas should include areas 
receiving regulated articles and containing preferred host trees. Before conducting the detection 
survey, categorize areas within the State by infestation risk. The Spongy Moth Risk Model can 
help with identification of high-risk areas. Refer to Detection Survey Protocol. 
The time at which a detection survey starts and ends will depend upon the climatic conditions in 
the area. At the least, the trapping period should cover the entire projected spongy moth flight 
period in the area. Phenology models may be available to assist in determining flight periods. 
Please contact your State Plant Health Director (SPHD) for model availability. In practice, 
because spongy moth string lures last several months in the field, detection trapping can be 
scheduled by the calendar in any given area, if appropriate buffers are included to account for 
variations in weather from year to year. However, whenever captured moths will be analyzed 
genetically, traps should be checked as quickly as possible after the end of the local flight season. 
This minimizes in-trap moth degradation and helps ensure successful analyses.

Detection Survey Protocol 
Step 1: Categorize areas within a State (per the national survey plan) 
Determine the total number of square miles in each category per county. The categories will 
determine the density and frequency of trapping in a particular area. Alternatively, each State 
may use the Spongy Moth Risk Model, an improved option for accomplishing this task. Not only 
does it provide detailed demographic and host information, but it also allows GIS specialists to 
add local risk data layers for a customized survey plan. Examples of such data include locations 
of railroads, campground data, postal address forwarding data, etc. Contact your GIS specialist 
for more guidance on using this model. 
Using the Spongy Moth Risk Model can aid in establishing the appropriate grid density (1/mi2; 
1/2mi2; etc.) based on the category of the survey area. Plan to trap for spongy moth in all 
categories except Category 4. 
Category S (Special Site)—sites where infestations are most likely to be artificially introduced.  These are 
sites with a history of receiving regulated articles from quarantine areas or transition counties 
(those not yet quarantined, but along the population front) and are also exposed to movement of 
infested vehicles (e.g., travel trailers, semi

Category S (Special Site)—sites where infestations are most likely to be artificially introduced.  These are 
sites with a history of receiving regulated articles from quarantine areas or transition counties 
(those not yet quarantined, but along the population front) and are also exposed to movement of 
infested vehicles (e.g., travel trailers, semi-trucks) from quarantine areas. These sites should be 
the highest priority for States to survey. 
1. Category S regulatory sites—sites knowingly receiving regulated articles from spongy 
moth quarantine areas either under Certificate, Accurate Statement, or Limited Permit. 
Category S regulatory sites include: 
A. Firewood dealers and distributors 
B. Nurseries 
C. Sawmills, pulp mills, and veneer mills 
Category S regulatory sites need a minimum of two random set traps placed on the site. 
Additional traps may be necessary depending on the size of the facility, but no more than 
12 traps. When possible, place traps in all four cardinal directions on the property (N, S, W, 
E). 
Mills under compliance agreements (CAs) to receive regulated materials from quarantine 
areas must have two to four random set traps placed on the perimeter of the facility within 
property ownership (if possible) each year. These traps are necessary to monitor 
compliance and potential new introductions to the surrounding area. 
For mills under a CA in areas where spongy moth populations are not known to exist and 
where a standard detection grid is not present, place an additional four to ten traps in the 
area surrounding the mill. These additional traps should not be closer than two kilometers 
(1.25 miles) to the mill, or further than ten kilometers (6.25 miles) from the mill.

B. Trapping frequency: annually if for regulatory purposes, or every two years as part 
of the National Spongy Moth Survey. 
Category 1— areas with high potential for introducing spongy moth (people and/or regulated articles 
moving from infested areas into noninfested areas); the area must have a suitable habitat (host trees) to

When a single trap (or several loosely associated traps) catches an isolated1 or multiple moths, 
conduct a delimiting survey. The delimiting survey is usually performed in the following year, 
but if caught early enough in the current trapping season, some delimiting traps may be placed 
that same season to try to define the size of the infestation. 
Important Features 
· The standard delimiting survey trap array is 16 traps per square mile. Special 
circumstances, such as the presence of sensitive areas or habitats containing endangered 
species, may require a trap array of 26 to 36 traps per square mile. The delimiting array 
should cover at least 4 square miles around the positive site or extend out to the next 
negative trap. 
· The positive trap(s) will be at the center of the trap array. The survey results from the 
detection survey supplies information for positioning the trap array. 
· When conducted after an eradication effort, a delimiting survey is called a post-treatment 
survey. 
Delimiting Survey Protocol 
Step 1: Conduct the Survey 
Refer to guidelines in Conduct the Survey. 
Examine the map from the previous year’s detection survey showing all positive traps. When 
plotting trap locations on a new map, consider the scale of the map and the required trapping 
density (i.e., 16 to 36 traps per square mile). Center the grid on the suspect infestation.

 Conduct the Survey 
Refer to guidelines in Conduct the Survey. 
Examine the map from the previous year’s detection survey showing all positive traps. When 
plotting trap locations on a new map, consider the scale of the map and the required trapping 
density (i.e., 16 to 36 traps per square mile). Center the grid on the suspect infestation. Generally, 
four square miles of delimitation will be sufficient or a ½- to 1-mile boundary (dependent on the 
trapping category in the area of detection). If the suspect area is spread out, it is necessary to trap 
a larger area. 
Plot trap locations well in advance of the survey season (late winter/early spring). Plotting the 
traps on planned grids allows for results’ comparison from location to location. Do not arbitrarily 
place traps. 
When moths are captured during a detection survey, a delimiting survey may be conducted the 
following year in the vicinity of the trap catches. In delimiting surveys, traps are typically 
deployed at densities of 16 to 36 traps per square mile over areas of one to four square miles. 
Larger areas may be delimited as indicated by results of the detection survey. The pattern of trap 
catches can be used to estimate the approximate area of infestation. 
Uniform grid spacing provides consistent information, which will help pinpoint infestations. If 
feasible, use appropriate mapping software to create delimitation grids at the desired density with 
trap numbers plotted on the map at the grid points. If it is necessary to plot a map by hand, use a 
large-scale map such as topographic map or a county or city map with even spacing. Some

catch well removed from the leading edge may trigger an egg mass survey followed by a delimiting survey and/or treatment the 
following year, while a single moth find nearer to the leading edge may not trigger a delimiting survey.

counties have roads laid out on a square grid with road intersections reliably at regular grid 
spacing. Even spacing is important to prevent data gaps and maintain information consistency for 
evaluation. 
The scale on a topographic or similar large-scale map is appropriate for the delimiting survey. 
Figure 2-4 shows traps plotted for a delimiting survey. 
 
Figure 2-4 Example of Traps Plotted for Delimiting Survey 
Step 2: Select Sites for Placing Traps 
Using the map with the trapping sites plotted, select individual trap sites as close to the plot 
locations as possible. If you cannot hang a trap on a host tree, use another vertical surface, such 
as a telephone pole, to hang the trap, preferably within 100 meters of a host. Never hang a trap 
on branch tips. 
Step 3: Interpret Survey Results 
If the traps do not capture spongy moth during the delimiting survey, assume there is no 
detectable infestation in the delimited area. If the traps have

Introduction 
The following survey methods do not use pheromone traps. 
· Egg mass surveys 
· Larval detection surveys 
Egg mass surveys and larval detection surveys are often done to supplement an adult trapping 
survey and confirm reproducing populations are present. 
Egg Mass (and Other Life Stage) Surveys 
Purpose 
· To confirm an infestation by providing convincing evidence (egg masses) that reproduction 
has occurred 
· To determine the population level in a specific area so the status may be changed (e.g., 
noninfested to transition area; transition area to generally infested regulated area) 
· To determine the population level near a high-risk site so the correct control and/or 
regulatory actions can be applied 
When to Conduct an Egg Mass Survey 
The best time is after leaf drop; however, egg mass surveys can be done any time after the 
females have finished depositing eggs. Phenology models may be available to assist with survey 
timing. A preliminary survey may help to determine if the females are present and laying eggs;

 best time is after leaf drop; however, egg mass surveys can be done any time after the 
females have finished depositing eggs. Phenology models may be available to assist with survey 
timing. A preliminary survey may help to determine if the females are present and laying eggs; 
the buff egg masses and the white female moths are easy to see on tree trunks and branches. 
Where to Conduct an Egg Mass Survey 
Egg mass surveys, which involve counting egg masses, are useful in areas with moderate or high 
infestation levels. 
Egg mass surveys are particularly desirable when: 
· Egg masses are the only life stage present 
· Survey results are needed immediately, as for treatment decisions 
· Populations are high enough to make the effort worthwhile. 
Usually, egg mass surveys will not detect low-level populations with reliability; therefore, egg 
mass surveys are of limited value in areas with low level populations (larval trapping is a better 
survey method in areas with light infestation levels). 
Egg mass surveys in the following areas are most likely to detect infestations: 
· Areas adjacent to and downwind from known infested areas 
· Areas close to known infested areas, particularly those areas where traps catch numerous 
moths 
· Areas such as Federal and State parks, used by RVs

· Areas where establishments receive regulated articles 
· Areas where numerous household moves originating in the quarantine area occur 
· Areas with preferred hosts 
Characteristics of Egg Masses and Preferred Egg-Laying Sites 
A well-established infestation may exist even though few, if any, egg masses are easily seen. 
Therefore, surveyors must know the characteristics of the egg masses and the preferred egg-
laying sites. 
Preferred egg-laying sites are in the following locations: 
· In bark cavities, under loose bark, and in bark crevices 
· On branches on the ground or on the underside of any type of ground litter, such as tin cans 
· On logs—including firewood 
· On outdoor household articles (OHAs), such as birdhouses and picnic tables 
· On signs 
· On stone walls and in the crevices of stone walls 
· On the underside of rocks not tight to the ground 
· On tree trunks in sheltered spots, such as under limbs 
· Under the siding and eaves of buildings 
In fact, egg masses may be found anywhere near trees in areas with preferred hosts. 
Larval skins and pupal cases may be found even when egg masses are not.

Egg Mass Surveys Using Targeted Visual Surveys (Transects) 
Egg mass surveys for regulatory purposes are usually targeted visual surveys. 
Targeted visual surveys (transects) examine an area of 50 feet by 20 feet, 10 feet on either side of 
a 50-foot centerline. The total area examined is 1,000 ft2, roughly equivalent to the 1,089 ft2 in 
the 1/40 of an acre plots in the next technique. 
Before the egg mass survey: 
1. Know how to identify and locate the egg masses.

Before the egg mass survey: 
1. Know how to identify and locate the egg masses. 
2. Select the sites where spongy moth egg masses are most likely to be (refer to the criteria 
from Where to Conduct an Egg Mass Survey). Plots must be at least 300 feet apart. If 
circular, the plots will have a radius of 18.6 feet; therefore, they will be 1/40 of an acre 
(1,089 ft2). 
3. P repare a stake that will be driven into the center of the circular plot; this  stake will have a 
radius-marking line of 18.6 feet attached. With its attached line stretched, this stake will 
help locate points within, on, and outside the circumference of each plot. (If four additional 
stakes are placed, equidistant, on the circumference, these stakes along with the center 
stake, will form quadrants.)

Egg Mass Surveys Using General Observation Technique 
Before the egg mass survey: 
1. Know how to identify and locate the egg masses. 
2. Select a positive trap (or select an area suspected of being infested) as a starting point. 
3. Inform others of your intended survey area. 
Procedure for the general observation technique—at each survey site:  
1. Start at the positive trap (or within the area suspected of being infested). 
2. Examine transit lines placed on the main compass points (north, northeast, east, southeast, 
south, southwest, west, and northwest). Examine all preferred egg laying sites out to 0.5 
miles.

Egg Mass Surveys for Regulatory Purposes 
Typically, egg mass surveys for regulatory purposes are done in areas surrounding establishments 
handling regulated articles. These surveys allow the environs of the establishments to be 
examined. 
· Areas in and around campgrounds 
· Forest edges near Christmas tree plantations 
· Forest edges near mills 
· Forest edges near nurseries 
Each egg mass survey for regulatory purposes will provide information to guide quarantine 
decisions for the establishment handling the regulated articles. Typical quarantine decisions 
involve: 
· Whether spongy moth is present in the environs of the establishment 
· If so, whether the environs of the establishment need to be treated 
Before the survey, know what egg masses look like and where to find them. 
To assess population levels at each survey site, refer to Egg Mass Surveys Using Targeted Visual 
Surveys (Transects) to survey for egg masses. If possible, walk in areas with preferred host trees. 
Procedure for the Survey for Regulatory Purposes 
1. Begin the survey in areas of importance (forest edges, campgrounds, campground edges). 
2. Select an object transecting an area with preferred hosts. 
3. Walk slowly toward the selected object, scanning in front, to the sides, and overhead. 
Examine all preferred egg-laying sites. 
4. Count all observed new egg masses. 
5. Record all critical information (e.g., number of egg masses, site, method, and date of

How to Trap Larvae 
Place traps at chest height by stapling (or tying) the upper corners of pieces of tar paper or burlap 
to host trees to form a skirt. The burlap or tar paper should be at least nine inches wide and long 
enough to go around the trunk of the tree. Ensure the burlap or tar paper completely encircles the 
tree trunk but remains loose fitting. If white oak is present, use this tree for larval trapping. 
Place the larval traps on the trunk of a tree shortly before egg hatch is predicted. 
After larvae emerge, check under the burlap or tar paper for larvae and pupae. Check larval traps 
two or three times

For best results, check during daylight hours (preferably between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.) on hot, 
sunny days. 
Also check the larval traps after the larval period. Larvae often pupate under the covering of the 
larval trap. 
Slow the Spread (STS)/Transition Area Survey 
Introduction 
The STS/transition area is an area between the quarantine area and the uninfested area; because 
of natural dispersal, the area is in transition from uninfested to generally infested. In States in 
which the U.S. Forest Service STS Program is operational, spongy moth surveys are conducted 
as part of that program. However, in States in which the STS Program is not implemented, it is 
critically important to detect infestations as early as possible. Early infestation detections will 
prevent the movement of infested articles from the transition area and will provide data to 
support regulatory decisions. Visit the Slow the Spread of the Spongy Moth website

 part of that program. However, in States in which the STS Program is not implemented, it is 
critically important to detect infestations as early as possible. Early infestation detections will 
prevent the movement of infested articles from the transition area and will provide data to 
support regulatory decisions. Visit the Slow the Spread of the Spongy Moth website for more 
information about the STS Program. 
STS Survey Types: 
· Trap Surveys 
· Transition Area Egg Mass Surveys 
· Larval Detection Survey 
Trap Surveys 
Trap surveys are performed to locate established populations in the transition area. If resources 
permit, the trap surveys are performed throughout the transition area; if resources are limited, 
trap surveys are performed in areas near the generally infested quarantine area. 
In addition to locating infestations, the trap survey helps to determine when a county in the 
transition area should be shifted to the quarantine area. 
1. The recommended trapping density is either of the following: 
A. 2 to 3 km grid (STS action area)—equal to one trap per 1.5-3.5 km 2 
B. 3 to 5 km grid (STS monitoring area)—equal to one  trap per 3.5-5.1 km2 
2. The timing for setting traps is critical. Set traps before male moths emerge. Phenology 
models may be available to assist with determining the proper timing for placing traps. 
3. Use delta traps or milk carton traps. Milk carton traps are available but are currently not 
used in APHIS-funded survey work. 
4. If at all possible, check each trap at least once during the middle of the trapping season. 
Under ideal conditions, trap checking will start when the male moths start

 proper timing for placing traps. 
3. Use delta traps or milk carton traps. Milk carton traps are available but are currently not 
used in APHIS-funded survey work. 
4. If at all possible, check each trap at least once during the middle of the trapping season. 
Under ideal conditions, trap checking will start when the male moths start flying. Where 
vandalism is likely, check the traps more often. Phenology models can be useful for 
determining the proper timing for initial trap checks. 
5. If the suspect moths were trapped where spongy moth are not likely to be introduced, send 
the suspect moths to a designated trained identifier.

Transition Area Egg Mass Surveys 
Egg mass surveys are desirable when: 
· Egg masses are the only life stage present 
· Populations are high enough to make the effort worthwhile. 
A basic problem with egg mass surveys is they usually will not detect low-level populations. 
Several egg mass survey methods are available; these methods are described in Other Survey 
Tools.

Purpose of Regulatory Activities 
The purpose of regulatory activities is to prevent the artificial spread (spread caused by human 
activity) of spongy moth from quarantine areas to noninfested areas. Refer to Areas Quarantined 
in the United States for Spongy Moth for county-by-c ounty listings. 
Regulatory Methods 
Preventing the artificial spread of spongy moth is accomplished by inspecting and treating, if 
necessary, regulated articles (defined below). Regulated articles may be infested by any spongy 
moth life stage—egg masses, larvae, pupae, and/or adults. 
  
Regulatory 
Regulatory Methods 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 3-3 
Regulated Articles 
The following regulated articles require inspection and certification: 
· Christmas trees (including holiday greenery) 
· Logs (including firewood), pulpwood, bark, and bark products 
· Mobile homes and associated items 
· Nursery stock (trees with roots, shrubs with roots and persistent woody stems, unless they 
are greenhouse grown throughout the year) 
· Outdoor household articles (OHAs) 
· Any other products, articles, or means of conveyance posing a high risk of spongy moth

are greenhouse grown throughout the year) 
· Outdoor household articles (OHAs) 
· Any other products, articles, or means of conveyance posing a high risk of spongy moth 
artificial spread as determined by an APHIS employee or a State official 
Moving regulated articles to noninfested areas is restricted unless an inspection and/or treatment 
of the regulated articles is conducted to minimize the risk of transporting spongy moth life stages 
to noninfested areas. 
Regulated articles may move unrestricted, without treatment or inspection, throughout 
contiguous quarantine areas. 
Regulatory Considerations 
When planning a regulatory program to prevent the artificial spread of spongy moth from 
quarantine areas to noninfested areas, factors such as the type of regulated articles, quantity in 
the shipment, frequency of shipments, availability of personnel, available treatments, and the 
impact of the regulatory activities on regulated industries must be considered. 
Mitigation procedures must be conducted, and appropriate documentation must accompany all 
loads of regulated articles leaving quarantine boundaries. 
Quantity, Type, and Frequency of Shipments 
If establishments regularly ship large quantities of regulated articles outside the quarantine area, 
the establishments may operate under a compliance agreement (CA). If establishments 
infrequently ship regulated articles outside the quarantine area, USDA–Plant Protection and 
Quarantine (PPQ) and/or State personnel will inspect and certify individual shipments. 
Personnel Available 
The personnel available affects regulatory activities. The following individuals, if authorized, 
may conduct visual examinations, treat, and certify regulated articles:

Operation Under Compliance Agreements 
Any person engaged in the business of growing, handling, or moving regulated articles may enter 
into a compliance agreement (CA) to facilitate the movement of such articles. CAs are 
particularly helpful when establishments regularly ship large quantities of regulated articles 
outside of quarantine areas. 
The purpose of a CA is to bring a person or firm into full compliance with the applicable 
requirements for handling regulated material. A CA provides a written and signed agreement 
confirming their understanding of the methods, conditions, and procedures necessary for 
compliance with the spongy moth quarantine (7 CFR 301.45). 
A CA specifies necessary safeguards to prevent the spread of spongy moth, such as disinfestation 
practices or applying chemical materials in accordance with the Treatment Manual. 
A CA template has been developed for commonly encountered businesses and activities. 
Operating procedures designed to meet regulatory requirements at individual facilities may be 
captured in an appendix that details those procedures. On occasion, unique situations may arise 
in which a standard CA template is not suitable, and a unique CA must be developed. These 
unique CAs must be developed in consultation with program management. 
An example of the CA template is available in Compliance Agreements. 
PPQ officers and/or State personnel train employees of the business operating under a CA. 
Additionally, the CA signer may provide training to employees as needed.

· Treating, if necessary, in a safe and effective manner to destroy spongy moth life stages 
On an as-needed basis, PPQ officers and/or State personnel monitor the employees of the 
cooperating establishments to ensure compliance. 
High-Risk Sites 
A high-risk site is a site where spongy moth is present on the premises, Regulated Articles, 
and/or in the surrounding area. High-risk sites are likely to provide a pathway for human-assisted 
spongy moth spread to noninfested areas. 
There are three categories of high-r isk sites and establishments based on the type of regulated 
articles and documentation required for movement. Sites and establishments listed below provide 
examples of potential high-risk sites and establishments in each category. These lists are not 
exhaustive. 
Category One High-Risk Sites and Establishments 
Category One high-risk sites and establishments commonly operate under a State or Federal CA. 
At Category One high-risk sites and establishments both the premises and the regulated articles 
must be inspected by a State or Federal official. Category One high-risk sites and

· Moving companies 
Moving Regulated Articles from High-Risk Sites and Establishments 
PPQ officers or State personnel inspect high-risk sites and establishments before entering into 
CAs and periodically thereafter. When a CA is established, PPQ officers or State personnel train 
company employees on provisions of the CA, treatment options for regulated articles, and 
documentation requirements. 
If the company is operating under an active CA, regulated articles can be moved from Category 
One or Category Two high-risk sites or establishments because they have been appropriately 
treated/visually examined and the appropriate documentation is completed. 
Regulated articles can be moved from Category Three high-risk sites and establishments after a 
visual examination. Regulated articles moved from a Category Three high-risk site or 
establishment must be accompanied by appropriate documentation (e.g., APHIS program aid 
2417). 
Nursery Stock and Christmas Trees 
The procedures outlined below are used to certify these items:

without piece-by-piece inspection. Refer to 7 CFR 301.45-5(a)1-4. 
Inspecting Nurseries and Christmas Tree Plantations 
The purpose of inspecting nurseries and Christmas tree plantations is to determine what 
mitigation procedures may be required prior to shipping from the quarantine area. 
Inspection Timing 
For regulatory purposes, inspections can occur whenever movement of regulated articles is 
planned. The presence of any spongy moth life stage (egg mass, larva, pupa, or adult) found on 
Regulatory 
Nursery Stock and Christmas Trees 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 3-7 
or near a regulated article constitutes a high risk of artificial spread. Inspectors rely on their 
knowledge of current population densities in the immediate area and previous history of the 
high-risk site to determine inspection timing. 
In general, annual inspections for egg masses involving the premises and surrounding areas tend 
to occur after leaf fall in the autumn, when egg masses are no longer hidden by leaves, and may 
continue until leaves expand to provide cover in the spring or when larvae have dispersed. Larval 
inspections occur during and after dispersal from the egg mass. Phenology models are available 
to assist in determining timing of the larval development stages. 
Inspection Methods 
Inspections may include the premises, the regulated articles, and all preferred hosts in the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 expand to provide cover in the spring or when larvae have dispersed. Larval 
inspections occur during and after dispersal from the egg mass. Phenology models are available 
to assist in determining timing of the larval development stages. 
Inspection Methods 
Inspections may include the premises, the regulated articles, and all preferred hosts in the 
surrounding area. What is included and how the inspection is performed is determined by the 
type of establishment to be inspected and the regulated articles to be moved. Whether the 
inspection is all encompassing or only of the regulated articles, it should be noted that egg 
masses can be found on all surfaces and may be hidden in cracks or crevices. For a description of 
preferred spongy moth egg-laying sites, refer to Where to Conduct an Egg Mass Survey. 
Inspection Results 
Inspectors use their judgment, and the inspection criteria listed below to determine if conditions 
favor spongy moth artificial spread. 
· One egg mass (or more) found on the regulated articles or within three meters (10 feet) of 
the articles 
· Twelve or more egg masses per hectare (five or more per acre) are found within 
approximately 30 meters (100 feet) of the articles 
· Heavy larval infestations found within 1,600 meters (one mile), which could result in 
infestation through blow-in or larval migration 
When any of the above conditions (or similar threatening conditions) exist: 
The PPQ officer can issue an Emergency Action Notification, PPQ Form 523. The EAN will 
state the required action(s) that must be performed to allow shipment. Refer to the Treatment 
Manual for more information on available treatments; or

If no spongy moth life stages are found during the inspection, certificates may be issued for the 
regulated articles. 
Treating Category One High-Risk Sites 
When required, the premises of category one high-risk sites are treated with insecticide 
applications. Treatment is the responsibility of the regulated establishment. Insecticide 
applications may be either aerial applications or ground applications by hydraulic sprayers or 
mist blowers. 
· Aerial applications are usually preferred to ground applications. Aerial applications give 
better insecticidal coverage to the forest canopy and surrounding areas and are usually used 
Regulatory 
Nursery Stock and Christmas Trees 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 3-8 
to treat in or near the following high-risk sites: recreational areas; mills; nurseries; and 
Christmas tree plantations. 
· Ground application using a hydraulic sprayer is the preferred method for treating mobile 
home parks or isolated areas in nurseries. 
When to Treat 
Apply the insecticide when general egg hatch in the area is completed. Perform applications 
when first, second, and third instar larvae are present. Phenology modeling could also be used to 
help determine the proper timing of insecticide applications. Proper treatment timing is essential 
as pesticide effectiveness is reduced when the larvae are beyond the third instar. Best results are 
obtained if the application can be delayed until general foliage of preferred hosts is 1/3 to 1/

obtained if the application can be delayed until general foliage of preferred hosts is 1/3 to 1/2 
grown. If possible, treat immediately before moving regulated articles. 
Treating the High-Risk Site 
Treat the infested portion of the high-risk site and the surrounding area to a depth equal to the 
effective range of the spray equipment. A minimum depth of 70 feet will usually suffice to keep 
migrating late instar larvae from reinfesting the site. If reinfestation does occur, additional 
treatments are necessary. In heavily infested sites, two or three applications seven to ten days 
apart may be necessary. Ensure all necessary permits and permissions are obtained prior to 
treatment. 
Treatment Documentation 
Records of all treatments must be retained for two years or according to State documentation 
retention requirements, whichever is greater, and made available to the inspector upon request. 
After a high-risk site treatment and following any appropriate postentry requirement for the 
treatment, a PPQ officer or State official reinspects the site following the inspection protocols 
described above. If the treatment was (and is) effective, the PPQ officer or State official notes the 
action taken on the EAN and rescinds the EAN.

For example, piece-by-piece inspection is used for assembly yard inspection of articles such as 
collected native plant material. 
During a piece-by-piece inspection, inspect all surfaces including bark crevices where egg 
masses may be attached. When egg masses or larvae are found, treat either by physically 
removing after spraying with Golden Pest Spray Oil or by applying insecticide.

operate under a compliance agreement (CA). A CA provides a written and signed agreement 
confirming their understanding of the methods, conditions, and procedures necessary for 
compliance with the spongy moth quarantine (7 CFR 301.45). 
Mitigation Procedures 
If they have been examined according to a standardized procedure, sawlogs originating from a 
quarantine area may be moved outside of the quarantine area. Sawlogs must be accompanied by 
a signed Accurate Statement stating 100% of the exterior surfaces were visually examined no 
more than five days prior to the date of movement. 
Inspectors (PPQ officers or State personnel) or employees of establishments operating under a 
CA examine the entire exterior surface area (100% visual examination) of each sawlog in the 
shipment. 
Regulatory

The “laid out” method is the recommended method for 100% visual examination of the entire 
surface area of all sawlogs. During the piece-by-piece examination, all exposed surfaces and 
crevices on the sawlog are examined for egg masses, larvae, and pupae. Alternative inspection 
methods must be approved by APHIS or State personnel. If any spongy moth life stages are 
present, qualified personnel apply a suitable treatment before shipment. 
Suitable treatments are listed under Treatments.

 and pupae. Alternative inspection 
methods must be approved by APHIS or State personnel. If any spongy moth life stages are 
present, qualified personnel apply a suitable treatment before shipment. 
Suitable treatments are listed under Treatments. 
⚠ WARNING 
Log inspection involves work in a log-handling yard, obey the following safety precautions: 
· Always wear a hardhat and steel-toe work boots 
· Always listen and watch for yard equipment 
· Because log stacks are often unstable, never go on or near log stacks 
· Comply with any other safety precautions required by the facility 
Laid-Out Visual Screening Procedure 
Using the “laid-out” method, PPQ officers, State officials, or individuals operating under a CA 
ensure no spongy moth life stages are present by conducting a 100% visual examination. The 
100% visual examination must occur no more than five days prior to moving sawlogs out of 
quarantine areas. If the sawlogs are not moved within five days, they must be reexamined and 
moved within five days of the reexamination. 
Procedure for a “laid-out” 100% visual examination: 
1. Plan in advance for the sawlogs to be “laid out” with personnel and equipment on hand to 
clean and turn the logs. 
2. Walk between the rows, examining the upper surface of sawlogs in the near row and the 
side surface of logs in the next row. If eggs masses are found, saturate with Golden Pest 
Spray Oil (EPA Reg. No. 57538-11) and remove using a wire brush or paint scraper. 
Vigorously brush or scrape the entire egg mass from the surface. If

Vigorously brush or scrape the entire egg mass from the surface. If larvae or pupae are 
found, remove and destroy. 
3. Have the sawlogs turned so the upper surface becomes the bottom. 
4. Repeat Step 2. Examine (and treat if necessary) the surfaces not previously examined, 
completing a 100% visual examination of all exterior surfaces. 
5. Arrange for shipment within five days by shippers under CA. 
6. Document the inspection by completing a signed Accurate Statement. 
Sawlogs originating within the spongy moth quarantine area can be moved outside quarantine 
boundaries when: 
· 100% visual examination of the external surface area is completed; and 
· Sawlogs are either free of spongy moth life stages or treated to eliminate life stages; and

Mitigation Procedures 
Wood chips, bark chips, and bark products, including biofuel, may be moved if: 
· composted 
· produced by a hammermilling process 
· moved to receiving mills under CA by shippers under CA. 
Mitigations procedures vary depending on the end use of the regulated products. 
Composting 
Wood chips, bark chips, and bark products can be composted to mitigate the risk of spreading 
spongy moth. For complete details about approved composting procedures, refer to Procedures 
for Composting Bark. 
Composting treatments require a starting compost pile of at least 200 cubic yards. The compost 
pile remains undisturbed until the internal temperature reaches 120 °F (49 °C) for at least four 
continuous days or 100 °F (37.8 °C) for at least six continuous days. The compost pile is then 
turned so the outer layer, to a depth of three feet, becomes the core material. The turned compost 
pile then remains undisturbed until temperature requirements are achieved.

turned so the outer layer, to a depth of three feet, becomes the core material. The turned compost 
pile then remains undisturbed until temperature requirements are achieved. 
Hammermilling process 
Bark chips, bark mulch, and other bark products may be produced by log debarking, followed by 
chip size reduction using a hammermill. A hammermill consists of a large steel drum with a 
rapidly rotating shaft on which hammers are mounted. The rotor and hammers are spun at a high 
speed inside the drum while the bark is being fed into the drum via a feed hopper. The impact of 
the hammers on the bark pulverizes the bark into smaller pieces, which then exit the drum 
through a sizing screen. A common form of the hammermill is a tub grinder. Bark chips or bark 
mulch of common commercial dimensions produced by this process are considered fully 
mitigated and can be shipped without further restriction.

NOTICE 
Firewood is an at-risk pathway for the movement of a number of pests in addition to spongy moth. 
For this reason, some States have State-level requirements for moving firewood. 
Self-Inspection Checklist (PPQ Form 377) 
This checklist is contained in: It’s the Law: Before Moving, Check for the S pongy Moth, 
Program Aid No. 2147 (for OHAs). PPQ Form 377 contains a l ist of OHAs on which spongy 
moth life stages are often found and therefore must be inspected. However, any list is likely to 
be incomplete, because spongy moth females can lay their eggs on any surface and the spongy 
moth larvae can rest or pupate on any article.

Containerized moving services are an emerging pathway for the human-as sisted spongy moth 
movement. OHAs should be inspected and a self-inspection checklist (in It’s the Law: Before 
Moving, Check for the Spongy Moth, Program Aid No. 2147) must b e completed. The self -
inspection checklist must accompany the moving container throughout the move to the final 
destination. In addition, the interior and exterior of the container must be inspected and all 
spongy moth life stages must be removed prior to exiting the quarantine area. 
Outreach to Establishments Shipping OHAs 
When OHAs are to be shipped from a quarantine area into or through a noninfested area, the 
OHAs must be treated as regulated articles. Prior to the move, OHAs must be inspected (and 
treated, if necessary).

Inspections are done no more than 5 days prior to the move during the high-risk period between 
April and August and no more than 14 days prior to the move between September and March. 
Preinspection Procedure 
Step 1: Ask the homeowner or renter who must be regulated to: 
Identify and assemble all OHAs (including firewood) to be inspected in one location or make the 
OHAs accessible for inspection. 
Step 2: Assemble all tools necessary for the inspection 
· Certifying documents to record the inspection 
· Drop cloth to lie on when examining the undersides of OHAs 
· Flashlight, preferably a small, high-intensity flashlight, to illuminate nooks and crannies 
· Hand mirror, preferably small and plastic-covered, to examine the undersides of OHAs 
· Paint scraper or wire brush to scrape off egg masses 
· Probe, preferably thin and flexible, possibly a screwdriver, to probe nooks and crannies 
· Tools, such as Phillips and standard screwdrivers, to disassemble OHAs, if necessary 
· Tools, such as a lug wrench, a jack, and blocks, to remove wheels to check wheel wells and 
brakes, if necessary 
· Work clothes, such as coveralls 
Inspection Procedure 
Infested OHAs are more likely when there are indications of a large spongy moth population in 
the surrounding area. However, even when there is no indication of a spongy moth population, 
OHA infestation is still possible.

Inspection Procedure 
Infested OHAs are more likely when there are indications of a large spongy moth population in 
the surrounding area. However, even when there is no indication of a spongy moth population, 
OHA infestation is still possible. Always perform a thorough examination of each article. 
Step 1: Thoroughly examine each OHA and any household article that has been outdoors 
The examination must include the entire surface area, including nooks and crannies. Use probes 
and flashlights to examine the nooks and crannies. Turn articles over to examine the lower 
surfaces. Remember that spongy moth females favor sheltered surfaces for egg laying. If an 
article cannot be turned over, examine by crawling underneath on a drop cloth, using a hand 
mirror, and/or probing with a screwdriver. 
If necessary, disassemble articles likely to harbor spongy moth. Pay special attention to articles 
near egg masses, larvae, or pupae.

Although they may not be typical OHAs, examine the following articles as if they were OHAs: 
· Articles left outside 
· Articles stored in areas open to the outside 
· Articles stored in areas with an opening to the outside 
· Articles stored indoors, but used outdoors 
As articles are examined, separate the infested items from noninfested items. 
Step 2: Treat the infested articles; as an alternative, infested articles can be treated 
during their examination 
The spongy moth life stage most likely to be encountered while inspecting OHAs is egg masses.

As articles are examined, separate the infested items from noninfested items. 
Step 2: Treat the infested articles; as an alternative, infested articles can be treated 
during their examination 
The spongy moth life stage most likely to be encountered while inspecting OHAs is egg masses. 
Treat egg masses by saturating them with Golden Pest Spray Oil and removing any egg masses 
with a paint scraper or wire brush. Refer to Treatments f or more details.  
Step 3: Safeguard the inspected articles 
If any inspection is not done on moving day, safeguard the articles from reinfestation. Safeguard 
the inspected articles by: 
· Covering with plastic sheeting or plastic bags 
· Packing immediately in moving van or truck and enclosing or covering 
· Storing articles indoors 
Disposable plastic bags or plastic sheeting safeguards articles for several days before a move. On 
moving day, remove plastic bags and/or sheeting from regulated articles and discard. 
Step 4: Document the inspection 
Refer to OHA Inspection Documentation. 
Treatments 
· Physically removing egg masses (preferred for OHAs) 
o Using a wire brush or paint scraper, remove an egg mass from an OHA. Brush or 
scrape vigorously to remove all the egg mass; however, do not brush or scrape so 
vigorously the OHA is damaged. 
· Physically Removing egg masses after spraying 
o Apply Golden Pest Spray Oil to an egg mass, using: 
▪ Sprayer with an adjustable nozzle 
▪ Paint brush 
▪ Similar brush 
o Thoroughly saturate the egg masses to the point of runoff so the egg mass is

Mobile Homes, Mobile Offices, and Associated Items 
Mobile homes and associated items are only regulated when they are moved from a quarantine 
area into or through a noninfested area. To move a mobile home or mobile office from a 
quarantine area into or through a noninfested area, an inspection is necessary before the move. 
Additionally, certifying documents are necessary during and after the move. 
Preparing for Regulating Mobile Homes and Mobile Offices 
To regulate mobile home or mobile office movement from quarantine areas, PPQ and State 
personnel cooperate in the following activities: 
Contacting Mobile Home or Mobile Office Haulers 
All mobile home or mobile office haulers who move mobile homes from quarantine areas to 
noninfested areas are contacted and placed under CA. Entities moving mobile homes, mobile 
offices, or other mobile structures, if not under CA, must contact State or Federal officials prior 
to the move to make arrangements for inspection and disinfestation (if needed) prior to the move. 
Establishments routinely involved in such movement may be placed under CA. 
Under the terms of the CAs, the CA holder only moves mobile homes or mobile offices from a 
quarantine area to noninfested areas after spongy moth inspections have been performed and 
documented. Under the CAs, the CA holder knows how to complete the inspections and how to 
handle the certifying documents.

Contacting the State Department of Transportation 
In some States, permits are required to move a mobile home or mobile office or mobile office. 
Contact with the State transportation office allows access to copies of the permits facilitating 
making arrangements for inspections. 
Contacting Operators of Mobile Home Parks or Mobile Office Dealers 
Contacting the operators of mobile home parks and dealers can allow access to mobile 
homeowners. Park operators or dealers can inform departing customers of the need for 
inspections and the inspection options available. 
Contacting Pesticide Applicators 
Contacting individual pesticide applicators and organizations for pesticide applicators allows 
access to pesticide applicators who are interested in becoming qualified certified applicators 
(QCAs). QCAs are pesticide applicators who are allowed to inspect mobile homes or mobile 
offices under CAs. 
Preinspection Procedure 
Step 1: Before the move, contact the departing mobile home or mobile office owner 
· Explain the threat posed by spongy moth and the need to inspect departing mobile homes 
or mobile offices. Arrange the inspection. Before the inspection, ask the owner of the 
mobile home or mobile office or mobile office to:

stinging insects, etc.) 
· Always put blocks under the wheels of the mobile home or mobile office 
· Always wear coveralls 
· Always wear a hardhat, gloves, and safety glasses 
· Beware of sharp edges, particularly flashing and siding edges. Never run your hand over 
edges that could be sharp 
· Never crawl under a mobile home or mobile office on jacks 
· Use a flashlight to illuminate a dark area before entering 
· Use mirrors, instead of entering tight corners 
Inspection Procedure 
Step 1: Examine the vegetation around the mobile home or mobile office for spongy 
moth life stages 
If the vegetation in the surrounding area is infested, the mobile home or mobile office is likely 
also infested. However, even when there is no indication of a spongy moth population in the 
surrounding area, mobile home or mobile office infestation is still possible, therefore, all 
inspections must be exacting and complete.

Step 2: Examine the mobile home or mobile office and associated items for spongy moth 
life stages 
Look in, on, and under everything. The examination must cover all exterior surfaces, including 
surfaces deep within crevices and other concealed areas. Use probes and flashlights to examine 
all concealed areas. 
Examine lower surfaces very carefully. Egg-laying spongy moth females favor shelter under 
surfaces. Examine the underside of a mobile home or mobile office by crawling on a drop cloth, 
using a hand mirror, and/or probing with a screwdriver. Inspect with particular care:

Introduction 
The Slow the Spread (STS) A ction/Transition Area occupies a band starting at approximately the 
outer edge of the quarantine area and extends outward 100 kilometers to the noninfested area. 
The quarantine area is characterized by a virtually continuous spongy moth population that can 
periodically reach outbreak levels. The noninfested area lacks an established spongy moth 
population. Spongy moth populations in the STS Action/Transition Area are usually low level, 
discontinuous populations that do not typically reach outbreak levels. 
Significance and History of the Slow the Spread Foundation and 
Action Area 
The STS Foundation is a nonprofit organization whose membership consists of those States 
along the leading edge of the spongy moth quarantine area. The purpose of the STS Foundation 
is to conduct activities designed to slow the natural spread of spongy moth out of the quarantine

60% reduction of natural spread rates from an average of 13 miles a year to an average of less 
than 5 miles a year.

The U.S. Forest Service (FS) provides 75% of the funding for the STS Foundation and its 
activities. The remaining funds are provided by member states, along with an APHIS grant for 
regulatory activities within the STS Action/Transition Area. 
Slow the Spread Action/Transition Area Regulatory Activities 
To prevent the long-distance spread of spongy moth, APHIS policy is to prevent the 
establishment of isolated, outlying infestations. Usually, isolated infestations result from human-
assisted dispersal of the pest through the moving infested articles. Articles likely to be infested 
are considered Regulated Articles. To prevent human-assisted spongy moth spread, APHIS and 
State program partners enforce quarantines on regulated articles when they are moved from the 
quarantine area to noninfested areas. Because logs and many other regulated articles tend to 
move fairly short distances from the quarantine area into the STS Action/Transition Area, 
regulatory activities within the STS Action/Transition Area are a vital component of the STS 
effort. These regulatory activities may include: 
· E ntering into compliance agreements (CAs) with regulated establishments  
· Issuing Federal Certificates for moving regulated articles that have been fully mitigated 
· Monitoring spongy moth population levels at and near facilities receiving logs from the 
quarantine area 
· Inspecting nursery stock and other products to ensure pest freedom prior to movement 
· Conducting special operations, like weigh station blitzes

· Inspecting nursery stock and other products to ensure pest freedom prior to movement 
· Conducting special operations, like weigh station blitzes 
Nurseries and Christmas Tree Plantations 
Nursery stock and plant products are a high-risk pathway for moving spongy moth. Because 
spongy moth populations may exist at low levels in the STS Action/Transition Area, nurseries in 
the STS Action/Transition Area, particularly those dealing in preferred hosts, must be inspected 
often enough to ensure infested material is not being shipped. 
In addition to a visual examination of plant products and the growing plants, trapping should be 
done in the vicinity of the nursery to detect spongy moth. For a more detailed description of how 
to inspect nurseries and Christmas tree plantations in the STS Action/Transition Area, refer to 
Inspecting Nurseries and Christmas Tree Plantations. Conducted trapping activities in 
coordination with the STS program and other relevant program partners to assure proper trapping

mill in accordance with APHIS policy for regulating receiving mills (refer to Protocols for 
Regulated Logs Originating in the Spongy Moth Quarantine Area. For additional information 
about regulatory activities at mills, please refer to the appropriate section(s) of the Regulatory 
chapter. 
Criteria for Adding Areas to the Quarantine 
The decision to add an area to the quarantine is based on the detection of a sufficient number of 
male moths and/or other life stages supporting a State and Federal consensus the area is 
generally infested. 
Trap Survey Results (Male Moths Alone) 
When more than 10 male moths are caught in the majority of traps placed throughout the area 
for 2 consecutive years, consider adding the infested area to the quarantine area. Milk carton 
traps are frequently used for STS/transition area survey work due to its much larger capacity 
compared to a delta trap. 
Trap Survey and Other Survey Results 
When adult trapping captures multiple male moths and other survey methods detect alternate life 
stages, consider adding the infested area to the quarantine area. 
Egg Mass Survey Results 
When multiple egg masses are detected as the result of an egg mass survey, consider adding the 
area to the quarantine area.

Background 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 5-2 
The original spongy moth regulations were first published in 1912 during the tenure of 
Agriculture Secretary James Wilson. Over a century later, the regulations continue to help 
safeguard trees and forests from this devastating pest. 
Outreach is fundamental to the core activities of the Spongy Moth Program, providing an 
essential and unifying thread across the survey, regulatory, and control actions. Wide sweeping 
and broad spongy moth outreach can be big and bold or small and subtle, but all communication 
facilitates: 
· Increased awareness of the pest and the spongy moth program 
· Enhanced understanding of the pest and spongy moth program 
· Public and stakeholder support for the spongy moth program 
· Compliance with spongy moth regulations and quarantine requirements 
While survey, regulatory, and control may be designated as the responsibility of a select few, 
outreach is a universal job function. We all play a role in the spongy moth outreach mission. 
Spongy moth key messages align program partners and support delivering accurate and 
consistent messages to stakeholders, regulated industries, and the public.

Background 
The spongy moth is native to Europe and first arrived in the United States in Massachusetts in 
1869. 
· Spongy moth is one of the most destructive pests of trees and shrubs to ever be introduced 
into the United States. Spongy moth caterpillars have voracious appetites for more than 
300 species of trees and shrubs, posing a danger to North America’s forests. 
· The first Federal spongy moth quarantines were enacted in 1912 in New England and 
today, nearly half of the lower 48 States in the east are partially or entirely quarantined for 
the pest. 
· S pongy moth can spread on its own and when people unknowingly move an adult moth, 
larva, or egg mass. Due to our mobile society, the majority of new spongy moth 
infestations are associated with moving outdoor household articles (OHAs) by the public. 
· Spongy moth caterpillars defoliate trees, leaving trees vulnerable to diseases and other 
pests that can eventually kill the tree. Early detection is critical to limiting spongy moth 
spread. 
· Spongy moth prefers approximately 150 primary hosts but will feed on more than 300 
species of tree and shrubs.

9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 5-3 
· Newly hatched spongy moth caterpillars are black and hairy. As they mature, caterpillars 
develop a mottled yellow to gray pattern with tufts of bristle-like hairs and a pattern of five 
pairs of blue dots and six pairs of red dots along their back. 
· Male and female adult moths look very different; a male moth is about ¾” long, brown in 
color with a darker brown pattern on their wings. Females are larger and nearly white with 
dark saw-toothed patterns on their wings. Female spongy moth cannot fly. 
· When spongy moth population density reaches high levels, the caterpillars consume large 
quantities of foliage resulting in partial or complete forest defoliation. 
· Spongy moth prefers approximately 150 primary hosts including aspen, birch, cedar, 
cottonwood, larch, oak, poplar, willow, and fruit trees. 
Survey 
· Two USDA agencies, APHIS and the U.S. Forest Service (FS), partner with various State 
agencies to conduct spongy moth surveys.

Survey 
· Two USDA agencies, APHIS and the U.S. Forest Service (FS), partner with various State 
agencies to conduct spongy moth surveys. 
· APHIS is responsible for surveying in areas not known to be infested to detect new spongy 
moth infestations. To monitor the pest population and initiate control efforts, the FS 
concentrates its spongy moth efforts along the front line of the known infested areas. 
· The goal of surveying is to find new spongy moth infestations early, before populations 
can establish, grow, and spread. Public cooperation in surveys is vitally important to ensure 
a full and complete survey. 
· Spongy moth traps are green, orange, or brown and are made of plastic-coated cardboard. 
The “delta” trap looks like a miniature pup tent with openings on each end (Figure 2-2). 
The other version of the trap is taller and larger, looks like a milk carton, and is named the 
“milk carton” trap. Milk carton traps are not used in APHIS-funded survey work. 
· T raps are baited with a lure to attract the male moth. Once the male moth enters a trap, it is 
either caught in the sticky lining (delta trap) or killed by a small, insecticidal strip (milk 
carton). 
· The spongy moth traps pose no risk to people, pets, or wildlife. 
Regulatory 
· USDA regulates the movement of potentially infested material or articles from spongy 
moth quarantine areas to  other areas of the United States (refer to the spongy moth 
quarantine map).

· To help prevent the further spread of spongy moth, USDA requires homeowners to inspect 
OHAs and remove any adult spongy moth, pupae, larvae, or egg masses they find prior to 
moving from a quarantine area to a noninfested area. 
· P ublic and industry compliance with the spongy moth regulations is based on: 
o Awareness of the existence of the regulations 
o Knowledge about the contents of the regulations 
o Cooperation with the regulations.

· The USDA continues to fight spongy moth spread. Today, through the Slow the Spread 
(STS) Program, USDA is slowing the spread along the i nfestation’s leading edge and 
eradicating outbreaks outside currently infested areas.

eradicating outbreaks outside currently infested areas. 
· T he Spongy Moth Program uses several strategies and tools to control the pest.  
o Mass trapping strategically places pheromone spongy moth traps (to attract male 
moths) in a dense grid pattern across the treatment area. The objective of mass 
trapping is to capture male spongy moths before they have a chance to locate and 
mate with the flightless female moths. The objective of mating disruption is to 
saturate the treatment area with enough pheromone sources to confuse the male 
moths and thereby prevent them from finding and mating with female moths. This 
can be accomplished by either ground or aerial application of the pheromone 
Disparlure. 
o Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) is a biopesticide (natural product) used to 
target spongy moth larvae. The word biopesticide is a combination of the words 
“biological and pesticide.” In most cases, Btk is aerially applied, however in small 
spongy moth infestations (less than 5 acres), Btk may be applied using ground 
equipment. When spongy moth larvae eat vegetation treated with Btk, a toxin is 
released in their stomachs. This toxin eventually starves or poisons the larvae. 
o Gypchek, a spongy moth nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) product, is also used to 
target larvae. NPV is applied with aerial or ground application equipment. Spongy 
moth larvae eat the virus-coated leaves and become infected. These larvae die and

occasionally used for control.

Purpose 
The purpose of APHIS’s eradication activities is to prevent spongy moth establishment in a pest-
free area. Eradicating isolated, outlying spongy moth populations is critical in containing and 
mitigating human-assisted spread of and damage caused by the pest. Eradication is the complete 
extermination of a pest population. USDA policy is to detect and eradicate spongy moth 
populations found outside the generally infested area and the Slow the Spread (STS) action area. 
Other types of pest population control activities occur as part of the overall State/Federal strategy 
to address spongy moth in the United States. Within the generally infested area and the STS 
action area, treatments are applied with the objective of suppressing or reducing, but not 
eliminating, spongy moth population levels. 
In keeping with the 1990 USDA Departmental Policy 5600-01 and the 2009 Interagency Gypsy 
Moth Memorandum of Understanding between APHIS and the USDA Forest Service (Forest 
Service Agreement No. 09-SU-11132546-079, APHIS will cooperatively fund eradicating 
isolated infestations if the isolated infestations are: 
· 640 acres or smaller 
· On non-Federal land, and 
· Not adjacent to Federal lands. 
Suppression efforts in the infested areas where eradication is no longer feasible are the 
responsibility of the USDA–FS and individual States. APHIS does not fund efforts to control 
spongy moth by suppression.

responsibility of the USDA–FS and individual States. APHIS does not fund efforts to control 
spongy moth by suppression. 
Evaluating the Need for Eradication Treatment 
Review Season’s Trapping Data 
At the end of each spongy moth survey season, review trap data to identify sites where spongy 
moth was detected. Sites with multiple catches in a single trap or traps with spongy moth catches 
near one another are sites requiring particular attention. Such sites may indicate reproducing 
populations, and the site should be revisited to search for further evidence of a reproducing 
population. Additional evidence of a reproducing population may include the presence of 
nonadult life stages, or the results of delimiting surveys as referenced in the survey chapter. 
Nonadult life stages are typically confirmed through the discovery of one or more egg masses or 
a pupal exuvia (aka “pupal cases”). If evidence of a reproducing population is found, propose to 
label the site as an eradication site. A proposal based on repeated trap catches will usually be 
predicated on how many moths are caught over multiple seasons and how close together 
(geographically) the catches are.

Internal Staff Discussions 
In addition to the review of trap data, formulating an eradication proposal should include internal 
discussions by the lead agency. The lead agency is the agency responsible for carrying out the 
eradication treatment. Initial internal discussions should include all relevant factors including, 
but not limited to, topography of the proposed treatment site, land use patterns in the area, 
population density (rural, urban, etc.), and relevant social, political, and demographic factors. 
This initial assessment should be based on the best information available. 
The initial internal discussions should also consider factors determining whether proposed 
eradication treatments would be applied aerially or from the ground. Important factors to 
consider include, but may not be limited to: 
· Availability of equipment and personnel properly trained in its use (whether in-house or 
through contractors) 
· Number and types of potential safety hazards (e.g., radio transmission towers or low-
hanging power lines) 
· Public perceptions and acceptance of different treatment methods 
· Relative costs involved 
· Size of the proposed treatment block 
· Type of terrain within the block 
Outreach needs should also be discussed. During preliminary outreach discussions, consider all 
the factors mentioned above and any additional concerns that would need to be addressed, such 
as any non-English-speaking demographic groups in the area. 
Cooperator Involvement 
Cooperators are the entities necessary for planning and executing an eradication treatment. 
Cooperators are not always State, Federal, or Tribal government agencies. Cooperator roles may 
include developing budgets and securing funding, conducting environmental reviews, assisting 
with outreach, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and performing treatment

Cooperator Involvement 
Cooperators are the entities necessary for planning and executing an eradication treatment. 
Cooperators are not always State, Federal, or Tribal government agencies. Cooperator roles may 
include developing budgets and securing funding, conducting environmental reviews, assisting 
with outreach, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and performing treatment 
operations. Relationships with some cooperators may already exist, however, it is likely that new 
cooperators will need to be identified and engaged as well. Some examples of other cooperator 
partnerships are Tribes that may be affected by the treatment, public agencies owning land within 
the treatment area, and organizations positioned to conduct outreach to unique demographic 
groups (e.g., homeless and foreign-language populations). If pesticide use is anticipated, 
engaging State and/or local health agencies is vital. 
Mapping 
Accurate maps are required to properly plan and conduct an eradication treatment. Needed maps 
will include:

· Locations of adult moths and other life stages detected 
· Locations of concern such as schools, health care facilities, and environmentally sensitive 
areas 
· Locations of safety hazards for treatment applicators 
· Proposed and, when decided, actual treatment boundaries 
Geographic information system (GIS) technologies can also be used to provide other types of 
information such as interactive maps allowing an individual to enter their address to determine if 
their property is within a treatment area.

information such as interactive maps allowing an individual to enter their address to determine if 
their property is within a treatment area. 
External Plan Review 
Once the workplan for an eradication treatment has been drafted, having that plan reviewed by 
an external group of people familiar with spongy moth eradication activities may be beneficial. 
This external review may not be formal or a matter of record, however, this review process can 
provide suggestions for plan improvements, be used to bolster public support and acceptance of 
the plan and assist in defending any possible legal challenges. 
Preliminary Proposal 
A preliminary eradication proposal should be ready for announcement by mid-autumn or early 
winter. This announcement should include a statement of findings (e.g., trapping results), the 
need for action, a preferred alternative under the spongy moth 1996 Final Environmental Impact 
Statement FEIS and 2012 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS), a map of the 
proposed eradication site(s), and likely timing. One should bear in mind that all proposals are 
preliminary or draft until a decision document such as a Finding of No Significant Impact 
(FONSI) has been signed. 
Outreach and Stakeholder Interaction 
Public support for any eradication project is vital. Use outreach as an opportunity to educate, 
inform, and build trust and cooperation with affected stakeholders. 
A well thought out outreach and communication plan is an important component of any 
eradication project. An inadequate outreach and communication plan may lead to confusion and 
speculation among stakeholders resulting in a lack of public support and cooperation for the 
project. Program partners involved in planning and implementing the eradication project should 
develop and adhere to a set of core messages in

A well thought out outreach and communication plan is an important component of any 
eradication project. An inadequate outreach and communication plan may lead to confusion and 
speculation among stakeholders resulting in a lack of public support and cooperation for the 
project. Program partners involved in planning and implementing the eradication project should 
develop and adhere to a set of core messages in order to avoid cross-messaging or confusion. 
Outreach efforts (refer to Public Outreach) should be an integral part of the spongy moth 
eradication project and be initiated during the early stages of the planning process. 
Federal Financial Assistance 
Once a preliminary proposal has been developed, adequate funding for the proposed treatment 
must be secured. The preliminary proposal can serve as the basis for the development of a 
workplan and financial plan for the proposed treatment. The workplan and financial plan must

detail the need for the project, including how it aligns with USDA strategic goals and priorities. 
The workplan should also describe the work to be done, the project partners involved, and the 
expected results and benefits. The financial plan must detail the expenses that will be incurred 
and any State cost-share contributions. Once the workplan and accompanying financial plan have 
been drafted they should be submitted to the State Plant Health Director (SPHD) for the State in 
question or, if the treatment block is larger than 640 acres, to the appropriate FS official for 
review and obligation of the corresponding Federal funds. This process often takes several weeks 
to several months and is contingent on the availability of Federal funds.

review and obligation of the corresponding Federal funds. This process often takes several weeks 
to several months and is contingent on the availability of Federal funds. 
Environmental Review 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
All Federally proposed spongy moth eradication activities or those proposed in cooperation with 
a Federal agency must comply with NEPA. NEPA, enacted in 1970, requires Federal agencies to 
assess the environmental impacts of their proposed actions prior to making a final decision on 
their implementation. APHIS’s Spongy Moth Program uses Final and Supplemental 
Environmental Impact Statements (FEIS and FSEIS) and Environmental Assessments (EA) to 
meet NEPA requirements. 
Final and Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement 
In 1995, the USDA issued the FEIS, “Gypsy Moth Management in the United States: a 
cooperative approach,” which describes and evaluates methods of spongy moth control available 
for use in USDA cooperative eradication programs. In 2012, the USDA issued a FSEIS 
supplement to the 1995 edition, “Gypsy moth management in the United States: a cooperative 
approach: final supplemental environmental impact statement.” The 2012 FSEIS included the 
evaluation of additional spongy moth treatments not included in the 1995 FEIS. 
Environmental Assessment 
The EA provides the basic background information necessary for site-specific analysis of the 
potential environmental effects resulting from the proposed spongy moth eradication project. The 
EA, sometimes prepared by the State cooperator and other times prepared by APHIS, should 
include: 
· Environmental impacts of the proposed action 
· Listing of the agencies and persons consulted 
· Need

EA, sometimes prepared by the State cooperator and other times prepared by APHIS, should 
include: 
· Environmental impacts of the proposed action 
· Listing of the agencies and persons consulted 
· Need for the proposed eradication 
· Treatment alternatives 
Preparing the EA must be tiered (linked) to the FEIS and the FSEIS in accordance with the 
Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (40 CFR 1502.20 and 40 CFR 1508). Upon completion, the EA 
copies are made available for public comment by posting notices in local news outlets and copies 
at libraries and agency websites. A 30-day comment period is typical. For more detailed 
guidelines on preparing the EA, refer to Environmental Assessment.

9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 6-6 
Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) 
After reviewing the completed EA and the public comments, if APHIS determines the proposed 
actions will not have a significant environmental impact, the agency will issue a FONSI (refer to 
Finding of No Significant Impact). 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Section 7 
ESA requires all actions proposed by Federal agencies and their cooperators to protect and 
conserve listed endangered and threatened species. Section 7 of the ESA titled “Interagency 
Cooperation” directs Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) 
and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for any actions that may affect listed species.

conserve listed endangered and threatened species. Section 7 of the ESA titled “Interagency 
Cooperation” directs Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) 
and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for any actions that may affect listed species. 
The results of the consultation should be included in a section of the EA. 
Informal Consultation 
During early stages of the eradication treatment planning process, the lead Federal agency or 
cooperator requests an informal consultation with USFWS and NMFS to determine if any listed 
species may occur within the proposed treatment area and what effects the proposed actions may 
have on those species. The request for interagency consultation should begin sometime in 
November or early December of the year prior to the proposed treatments. If, during the 
consultation, it is determined that the proposed actions are “not likely to affect” listed species, 
the consultation is concluded, and the proposal is allowed to move forward. A letter of 
concurrence from USFWS and NMFS is not required. However, if it is determined that the 
proposed treatments “may affect” a listed species, a written biological assessment (BA) or 
biological evaluation (BE) will be required to help make a final determination on the effects of 
the proposed actions. 
Biological Assessment or Biological Evaluation 
A BA or BE is a written analysis documenting the agencies’ conclusions on the effects of the 
proposed treatments. For the purposes of the discussion on spongy moth eradication, the BA and 
BE will be treated as one. Section 7 requires the BA to make one of three determinations: 
· no effect 
· may affect, but not likely to adversely affect

· may affect, but not likely to adversely affect 
· may affect and is likely to adversely affect listed species 
If the findings of the BA conclude the proposed actions “may effect, but not likely to adversely 
affect,” a letter of concurrence from USWFS and NMFS to document compliance with Section 7 
is required before moving forward with the proposed treatment. 
Section 7 Formal Consultation 
If the BA concludes the proposed eradication treatment “may affect and is likely to adversely 
affect” listed species, the proposing agency must request a formal consultation with USFW 
and/or NMFS to determine if the proposed action will jeopardize the continued existence of a 
listed species. Upon completion of the formal consultation, USFW/NMFS will issue a written 
opinion.

Clean Water Act 
If an eradication site includes “Waters of the United States” (refer to Definition of “Waters of the

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System 
NPDES states: the NPDES permitting program regulates discharges from pesticide applications 
consistent with section 402 of the CWA. Point source discharges of biological pesticides and 
chemical pesticides that leave a residue into waters of the United States are required to comply 
with NPDES requirements. EPA and the States issue Pesticide General Permits to offer coverage 
for pesticide operators. Activities not eligible for coverage under the Pesticide General Permit 
may be eligible for coverage under an individual permit. 
State-Level Equivalent Laws and Regulations 
Eradication treatment project coordinators are responsible for compliance with State-level 
environmental laws and regulations. For a list of environmental regulatory agencies for U.S. 
States and territories, refer to Health and Environmental Agencies of U.S. States and Territories. 
NOTICE 
Failure to comply with the FEIS, FSEIS, NEPA, ESA, CWA, or any other State and Federal 
regulations may result in an injunction or lawsuit. 
Operation Implementation 
Safety 
At the onset of the proposed eradication project, the project leader must designate a safety officer 
or take on the role themselves. A safety plan is necessary and can be modeled via online 
resources if one is already available. Fundamentals of a safety plan include: 
· Accident reporting structure 
· Locating emergency medical resources 
· Preparedness measures linked to preventing accidents 
Operational Checklists 
With a safety plan as the first checklist item, divide the checklist into before treatment, during 
treatment, and after treatment sections. The checklist should consider all possible elements of the

Legal 
Every aspect of a treatment operation may be challenged in court. The project leader should 
involve their organization’s legal representative from the beginning of the process. Bear in mind, 
public disclosure laws vary across States and all communications may be subject to public 
disclosure. 
Bids for Contracted Treatments 
Treatments are usually performed by a third-party contractor. The lead agency must create the 
contact specifications for the treatment contract and work with their contracting officer to solicit 
bids. Contract elements should include, but are not limited to: 
· Application equipment 
· Application rates 
· Product to be applied 
· Size and boundaries of the area to be treated 
· Specialized navigational capabilities 
The bid solicitation and contracting process can take considerable time and much of it may be

Security 
Ensuring the safety and security of the public and program personnel is critical at every step of 
the process—from open house/public meeting events to staging areas (airports, helipads), to 
treatment areas (neighborhood streets) themselves. Private security or deputized law enforcement 
officers may be used at key areas to protect both program personnel and the public. Local law 
enforcement should be notified operations are planned before every treatment, whether ground or 
aerial. The Federal Aviation Association (FAA) should be notified when aerial treatments are 
planned. Drone aircraft are a potential threat to flight operations and appropriate precautions 
should be taken. 
Other Considerations

 both program personnel and the public. Local law 
enforcement should be notified operations are planned before every treatment, whether ground or 
aerial. The Federal Aviation Association (FAA) should be notified when aerial treatments are 
planned. Drone aircraft are a potential threat to flight operations and appropriate precautions 
should be taken. 
Other Considerations 
Every eradication treatment project is unique and there may be other project elements that also 
require planning and execution, such as State-level emergency declarations to conduct aerial 
spraying to Federal permits for flying near bald eagle nests. This may also include budgeting for 
legal costs for possible legal challenges. 
Operations 
Some of the planning and preparation steps described above will move into the implementation 
or operational phase while other steps are still in process. For example, public engagement 
activities often begin shortly after the determining the need for an eradication treatment and prior 
to completing the needed environmental documentation. Ultimately, these planning and 
preparation steps lead to the actual application of the chosen treatment product. Timing of the 
treatment application(s) is dependent on several factors, primarily the phenology of the insect 
and the life stage a given treatment product target. 
After Action Reviews 
To assess what went well and what can be improved upon in the future, operations should be 
reviewed following each eradication treatment and at the end of the treatment period. After 
Action Reviews (AAR) typically begin with a brief description of the actions taken or responses 
being reviewed. It should include the intent of the review and what benefits it can provide in 
improving future processes and outcomes. AARs can be conducted electronically or in the 
traditional paper format. An example of an AAR can be found in Appendix K.

Post-Treatment Delimiting 
After treatments have been applied it is critical to monitor the success (or failure) of an 
eradication treatment by setting a delimiting array of traps at and around the treatment site during 
the year the treatment was applied and for no fewer than 2 additional years. Delimiting surveys 
should continue until three consecutive years with no trap catches or other signs of a lingering

Submitting Suspected Spongy Moth for Molecular Diagnostics 
Submit specimens suspected of being spongy moth, Lymantria dispar, to the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine (PPQ), Science and Technology (S&T), Forest Pest Methods Laboratory (FPML, 
formerly known as the Otis Pest Survey, Detection, and Exclusion Laboratory) for molecular 
diagnostics. 
All specimens collected o utside the Federal quarantine or at a port of entry and a subsample of 
specimens collected inside the quarantine are analyzed. Send each trap submitted to the 
laboratory, regardless of quarantine status, with PPQ Form 391 (refer to Figure C-1).

Alternatively, if sending a large quantity (>10) of specimens, send an Excel file reflecting the 
fields listed in Figure C-2 to submitting an individual form. Submit forms and tracking 
information via email. 
Submission Deadline 
Traps should be submitted as soon as collected. Samples collected from inside the quarantine are 
accepted for analysis until November 30th of each survey year. 
DNA degrades quickly when exposed to ambient conditions, therefore, it is critical for samples 
to be collected regularly, stored in a freezer, and submitted for diagnostics as soon as possible. 
Otherwise, specimen condition can be negatively impacted leading to diagnostic assay failure 
and the inability to identify specimens. 
Prompt submission is also essential to ensure participating States receive survey results promptly 
and to ensure no delays in generating the Lymantria dispar Risk Model.

Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay 
Real-time PCR is an advanced technique monitoring the amplification of a target DNA molecule 
during the DNA replication process. A probe binds to the target CNA and emits a fluorescence 
captured by a sensor on the real-time PCR machine. In other words, if the target DNA sequence 
is present, the sensor will detect more light as more DNA copies are replicated. The high 
sensitivity of real-time PCR may enable detection of a target organism in the presence of only a 
few DNA copies. The terms “real-time PCR” and “qPCR” are interchangeable. 
Lymantria dispar asiatica, Lymantria dispar japonica, and Lymantria umbrosa are members of 
the flighted spongy moth complex (FSMC) and are of regulatory concern and cannot reliably be 
distinguished morphologically from Lymantria dispar dispar. Two real-time PCR assays are used 
to distinguish these four targets on a genetic level: 
· Standard Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay 
· Its simplified version, Dual-Probe Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay.

are referred to as: 
· AGM 
· Ldaj 
· Lda 
· Ldd 
The combined results from the four subassays allow identification of the four target moths 
because each target is characterized by a different amplification plot (refer to Table C-2 and 
Figure C-3), which summarizes positive (S-sh aped curve) and negative (flat line) subassay 
results. A specimen that does not generate a positive amplification or generates an amplification

simplified assay, the Dual-Probe Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay, which only 
includes two subassays (refer to Figure C-4): 
· AGM 
· Ldd  
Unlike the standard version, the dual-probe assay detects Lymantria dispar asiatica, Lymantria 
dispar japonica, and Lymantria umbrosa from the background of Lymantria dispar. It does not 
distinguish between the former three targets. The dual-probe assay is specifically designed for 
analyzing samples trapped during the domestic survey. Given the rare domestic occurrences of

analyzing samples trapped during the domestic survey. Given the rare domestic occurrences of 
FSMC, the dual-probe assay can screen samples more efficiently than the standard assay. 
Samples with positive results for the AGM subassay are subsequently analyzed by the Standard 
Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay for subspecies identification. Samples of 
regulatory significance (e.g., port interceptions) are directly processed with the standard assay.

Secondary Analysis of Significant Regulatory Samples 
Specimens of regulatory significance that fail the real-time PCR assays can be analyzed using 
DNA barcoding. Specimens received from inside the quarantine that fail the assay will not be 
DNA barcoded, except upon direct request. The processing timeline for DNA barcoding is 
dependent on the turnaround time of the sequencing company but can typically be expected in 
one to three weeks. If DNA barcoding fails, the specimen may be reextracted and reprocessed, 
which will take an additional one

which will take an additional one to three weeks. 
DNA Barcoding 
DNA barcoding uses the mitochondrial COI gene to distinguish different species. The technique 
relies on obtaining the unknown specimen’s COI sequence and comparing it to sequences of 
voucher species deposited in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD). 
Because the Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assays detect spongy moth (provided the 
DNA quality is sufficient), there are three potential DNA barcoding outcomes: 
· Species- or genus-level identification of a non-spongy moth specimen. 
· Inconclusive identification resulting from the specimen failing to match any known 
reference DNA barcode. 
· Unknown identity due to DNA sequencing failure.

Environmental Assessment 
The Environmental Assessment (EA) on the spongy moth should be linked to the detailed Final 
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). This allows the reader to refer to the FEIS as needed 
and allows USDA–APHIS–PPQ to cite the FEIS instead of repeating information and data 
contained within the FEIS. 
The EA must describe the potential effects of the eradication program on human health and the 
environment on a site-specific basis. In general, the document includes why the proposed action 
is needed, the alternatives to the proposed action, and the environmental effects of the proposed 
action and its alternative. The site-specific EA should be as concise as possible, but still contain 
all the information necessary for the responsible official to make an informed decision. 
For recent EAs and Findings of No Significant Impact (FONSIs), which may be used as 
examples in developing these documents, refer to Spongy Moth Programs Environmental 
Assessments. 
The following section provides an outline of information and analyses that may be included in an 
EA. This format is a suggestion based on the structure of recent EAs and may be modified if a 
different structure is preferred or better suits the proposed treatment program.

sensitive plants and animals. Include a description of any threatened or endangered plants and 
animals. Mention any organisms likely to be nontarget species of the treatment— i.e., any plants 
or animals that might potentially be affected by the proposed treatment. For spongy moth, that 
might include any lepidopteran larvae undergoing larval development at the time of the proposed 
treatment, particularly if they are threatened or endangered. 
Human Health and Safety 
Briefly discuss the demographics of the area in and near the treatment block: 
· Are there any Federal, State, or tribal lands located inside the treatment block? 
· Are there any schools, hospitals, parks, or other places where people might gather? 
· At the time of treatment, is there potential for people to be physically exposed? 
· How many people reside there? 
· Is the area residential or is there some industrial development? 
Environmental Consequences 
· Mention that both alternatives may have potential environmental consequences 
· Potential environmental consequences will determine whether the proposed alternative will 
be selected; prepare this section with careful analysis 
No Action 
Discuss the potential environmental consequences if the No Action Alternative is selected (i.e., if 
the proposed treatment does not take place). Depending on the situation, this might include an 
increase in spongy moth population in the treatment block, an increase in tree defoliation in the 
treatment block, and the loss of recreational resources

 careful analysis 
No Action 
Discuss the potential environmental consequences if the No Action Alternative is selected (i.e., if 
the proposed treatment does not take place). Depending on the situation, this might include an 
increase in spongy moth population in the treatment block, an increase in tree defoliation in the 
treatment block, and the loss of recreational resources, such as camping and hiking sites. 
Proposed Action 
Discuss the potential environmental consequences if the proposed treatment does take place. 
Depending on the situation, this might include protecting recreational wooded areas, pesticide 
drift, pesticide residues in bodies of water, and potentially exposed immunologically sensitive 
individuals. 
Other Issues 
Cumulative Impacts 
Cumulative impacts refers to an aggregate of impacts to human health and the environment over 
time, and include reasonably foreseeable future actions. These may include impacts from 
previous spongy moth management actions, pesticide impacts from other non-spongy moth 
programs, and impacts to the local environment from other actions that incrementally increase 
the impact of any program actions.

Executive Summary 
The Spongy Moth Program has adopted a standard-based approach to processing requirements 
for regulated logs moving to receiving mills or other facilities outside the quarantine area. The 
standard requires the number of moths caught in traps at each receiving mill or facility be 
statistically similar to trap catch numbers in the surrounding area. Spongy moth population levels 
at and around each regulated facility are monitored on an annual basis through a statistical 
analysis of each year’s trapping data. Should this analysis indicate elevated trap catch numbers

have occurred at a particular mill, a series of recommended remedial actions designed to bring 
the facility back into conformance with the standard has been developed. 
Background 
APHIS’s Spongy Moth Program has adopted a standard-based approach for how logs moving 
interstate from quarantine areas to processing facilities outside the quarantine area are regulated. 
Historically, moving logs was subject to a series of Federal requirements, including moving 
under an Accurate Statement or Limited Permit and certain processing conditions at the 
processing facility. Movement requirements are found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
(7 CFR

 for how logs moving 
interstate from quarantine areas to processing facilities outside the quarantine area are regulated. 
Historically, moving logs was subject to a series of Federal requirements, including moving 
under an Accurate Statement or Limited Permit and certain processing conditions at the 
processing facility. Movement requirements are found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
(7 CFR 301.45-4), while processing requirements were housed in the APHIS Spongy Moth 
Program Manual. However, over time, State to State variances in processing conditions arose 
and industry practices changed. An analysis of numbers of spongy moths caught in traps near 
regulated mills outside the quarantine area indicates moving logs from the quarantine area to 
primary processing facilities does not typically result in elevated spongy moth population levels 
in the vicinity of those facilities. Adopting this standard-based approach accommodates these 
changes and is in keeping with Executive Orders to minimize regulatory burdens on the public 
while still maintaining high levels of protection to America’s agricultural and natural resources. 
Under this standard-based approach, spongy moth population levels are m onitored at receiving 
mills and other facilities and compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. 
Each year, population levels in the immediate vicinity of the facilities receiving regulated logs 
are compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. The standard APHIS has 
adopted requires population levels in the immediate vicinity of each mill not be statistically 
elevated when compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. APHIS continues 
to require that log movement occur under a properly issued Limited Permit or Accurate 
Statement. Receiving mills and other facilities and their suppliers must enter into Federal 
compliance agreements (CA) for log movement. Each State determines appropriate requirements 
for processing regulated logs once they are at

elevated when compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. APHIS continues 
to require that log movement occur under a properly issued Limited Permit or Accurate 
Statement. Receiving mills and other facilities and their suppliers must enter into Federal 
compliance agreements (CA) for log movement. Each State determines appropriate requirements 
for processing regulated logs once they are at the processing facility and enters into State CAs 
with receiving facilities detailing those requirements and any other applicable conditions deemed 
necessary. 
Beginning in June 2014 an interagency working group convened to develop specific 
recommendations on the steps and actions necessary to implement the standard-based approach 
to regulating logs moving from the quarantine area to mills and other receiving facilities for 
processing. 
This document details the working group’s findings. Working group members included 
representatives from the major stakeholder groups that would be affected, including the National 
Plant Board (NPB), the U.S. Forest Service ( FS), the Spongy Moth Slow the Spread (STS) 
Foundation, and AP HIS .

Specific Policies and Protocols 
Federal Regulatory Actions 
APHIS’s spongy moth regulations serve as the foundational policy guidance for program 
activities. These regulations can be found in 7 CFR 301.45. Of particular relevance to this 
document are the regulations governing “Conditions of Movement of Regulated Articles” (7 
CFR 301.45-4). This section of the Federal spongy moth regulations contains only one 
requirement for moving logs out of the quarantine area—they must move

activities. These regulations can be found in 7 CFR 301.45. Of particular relevance to this 
document are the regulations governing “Conditions of Movement of Regulated Articles” (7 
CFR 301.45-4). This section of the Federal spongy moth regulations contains only one 
requirement for moving logs out of the quarantine area—they must move under a properly 
issued certificate or Limited Permit. Alternatively, the logs can move under an Accurate 
Statement after being inspected by trained personnel operating under a CA and found to be free 
of spongy moth life stages. This requirement is retained in the standard-based approach. 
Survey Protocols 
The standard-based approach to regulating logs is rooted in spongy moth traps being calibrated 
to pest population levels in the vicinity of a trap. For the standard-based approach to work, traps 
must be placed at and in the area surrounding primary processing facilities receiving regulated 
logs. In areas where significant levels of trapping already occur, set two traps at the facility 
itself—standard trapping densities are sufficient to monitor moth population  levels in the 
surrounding area. In areas where trapping densities are low, set two traps at the regulated facility, 
along with a small number of additional traps in the surrounding area to serve as a basis for 
comparison of population levels at the mill and in the surrounding environment. 
· For mills in areas covered by STS or State survey (areas with a ba ckground spongy moth 
population) follow current trapping protocols and densities 
· I dentify all  mills receiving regulated logs 
· Place two (or more) traps in host material at the perimeter of each regulated mill 
· Place four to ten traps around mills in areas with no known background spongy moth 
population

o Trap array should extend out ten kilometers from each mill 
Data Capture and Management 
Properly capturing the outcomes from the survey effort is instrumental to performing an analysis 
of trap catch numbers at regulated primary processing facilities. 
· All trap catch data is entered into either Integrated Plant Health Information System 
(IPHIS) or the STS database 
· All trap placement data is entered into either IPHIS or the STS database 
· Appropriate existing notations within national spongy moth survey and STS survey data 
capture protocols should be used to designate traps placed at regulated mill sites

Data Analysis 
To determine a receiving primary processor is in conformance with standard of not exhibiting 
elevated population levels at the mill site, an annual, transparent, and robust analysis of trap 
catch numbers is necessary. A space-time cluster technique developed by PPQ’s Science and 
Technology (S&T) makes maximum use of existing trapping protocols while allowing each 
mill’s performance to be individually examined. 
· Description of the analytic technique is provided in each year’s report and in Description

o If two or more mills are in very close proximity to one another, they are combined 
into a single “mill feature” for the analysis 
· APHIS analyzes trap catch data annually (each winter) 
Compliance Agreements 
As noted in the Background section of this document, State-to-S tate variation exists in 
processing requirements for regulated logs. This variety of requirements is reflected in the 
current inventory of compliance agreements (CAs) held by the Spongy Moth Program. Under the 
standard-based approach, Federal CAs contain standard language relating to moving logs out of 
the quarantine area. Individual States remain free to establish or maintain processing 
requirements for those logs once they arrive at the mill site. State requirements for processing are 
detailed in a State-issued CA or in a clearly delineated section of a joint State-Federal CA. 
· F ederal CAs are limited to the continued need for a Limited Permit or Accurate Statement 
for interstate movement out of the quarantine area along with associated site and 
paperwork access requirements 
· Joint CAs may be issued, but activities governed under Federal authority (first bullet in this 
list) should be clearly delineated from those regulated under State authority (third bullet in 
this list) 
· State CAs stipulate what processing requirements are necessary at receiving mills (e.g

· Joint CAs may be issued, but activities governed under Federal authority (first bullet in this 
list) should be clearly delineated from those regulated under State authority (third bullet in 
this list) 
· State CAs stipulate what processing requirements are necessary at receiving mills (e.g., 
processing times, duration of high-risk period, distance from surrounding host vegetation) 
along with associated site and paperwork access requirements 
Costs 
Mills found to be out of conformance with the standard bears the costs associated with any 
necessary remedial actions. 
Recommended Remedial Actions 
In anticipation of the occasional instance in which a given primary processor is found to be 
exhibiting statistically significant higher trap catch numbers at the mill when compared to trap 
catch numbers from the surrounding area, and thus, out of conformance with the standard, 
provide a list of remedial actions to bring the mill back into conformance. There may be 
instances in which nonconformant trap catch numbers are not the result of the mill’s activities;

For this reason, it is strongly recommended that any follow-up actions begin with a visit to the 
nonconformant mill and identify any contributing factors. Additional remedial actions are 
predicated on the findings from that initial mill visit. Specific remedial actions are determined by

Description of Space-Time Cluster Analysis 
Basis for Statistical Analysis 
Anselin’s Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA), a measure of spatial autocorrelation, is 
used to identify “hot spot” clusters of trap counts compared to the background population, or 
average trap count. It also detects spatial outliers, which is useful in identifying a single trap with 
catch surrounded by traps with zero catches (which may be indicative of a new introduction).

catch surrounded by traps with zero catches (which may be indicative of a new introduction). 
Procedure 
Sawmills are buffered by two kilometers, which represents their immediate environs affected by 
a pathways introduction of spongy moth via regulated lumber transport and processing. The 
background population is evaluated over a 24-kilometer buffer around the mill, which also 
defines the extent of the LISA analysis. Trap counts that intersect treatment areas are removed 
from the analysis. A moving window analysis of ten years of trap catch data within the environs 
area for each mill utilizes a four-kilometer, two-year space-time window. Multiple testing over x 
trap locations inflates significance testing, therefore, a false discovery rate is applied. Clusters 
are further analyzed to ensure they are “spatially distinct” and separated by a sufficient distance 
from other clusters of matching years outside the mill’s immediate environs. This ensures the

environs. 
Automation 
The tool is written in Python code and is built into an ArcGIS toolbox for workflow automation. 
The tool is easy to use and can be applied to other programs looking for evaluation of pest 
population levels near potential introduction sites. 
Deliverable 
A formatted output table that records individual mill sites with significant cluster results. For 
records that return a significant result in the most recent year, the cluster results are graphically 
displayed within a geographic information system (GIS) environment to better visualize and 
interpret the results.

Other reviews include Leonard (1974) , Wellenstein and Schwenke (1978) , Montgomery and Wallner (1988) , Elkinton and Liebhold (1990) , Liebhold and Tobin (2006) and Tobin et al. (2009) . The life-cycle of L. dispar dispar is as follows. It has one generation per year. Overwintering eggs hatch as host trees are producing new leaves, from late March to late May, depending on the climatic situation. Newly hatched larvae can remain on the egg masses for several days before climbing the trees to the branch tips and starting to feed on buds and new leaves. First instars are the main natural dispersal stage. As larvae move upwards, they spin a thread of silk and suspend themselves from the threads that eventually fracture. The young larva is then carried by the wind. While most larvae will not move more than 200 m, some are reported to travel several kilometres. During the first three instars, feeding occurs by daylight. From the fourth instar onwards, larvae mainly feed at night and leave the foliage during daylight to seek resting sites in the litter or on the trunk.

From the fourth instar onwards, larvae mainly feed at night and leave the foliage during daylight to seek resting sites in the litter or on the trunk. However, at outbreak density, feeding continues during the day. Males usually have five instars and females six. The final instars are by far the most voracious feeders. On average, during its entire life, a single larva consumes a total of about 1 m² of foliage ( Doane and McManus, 1981 ). The larval stage lasts around 8 weeks. At the end of this period, larvae find a resting site, usually on a trunk, on a rock or in the litter, and surround themselves with a silken nest in which they will pupate. Pupal development is usually complete within 2 weeks. Males emerge 1 or 2 days before females and at emergence both sexes are sexually mature. Males are good flyers, but females are flightless, although their wings are fully formed. After emergence, females crawl to an elevated place, usually the tree trunk, and begin releasing a sex pheromone to attract males. Mating lasts up to 1 h, and although males are capable of mating several times, females usually only mate once, though adult age can affect rates of egg fertilization ( Tobin et al., 2014b ). Immediately after mating, oviposition of a single egg mass begins. All adults are short-lived, surviving for less than 1 week during which no feeding occurs. Embryogenesis commences soon after oviposition and fully formed larvae are complete in the eggs about 2 months after their oviposition. Eggs undergo obligatory diapause. It is not uncommon to find a small number of larvae hatching in late summer but these never complete development.

 Sintomas: Hatching larvae usually start feeding on flushing buds and, later on, newly expanded leaves. High populations often result in total tree defoliation, often across a large spatial area.

Refer to Glossary f or definitions of terms such as artificial spread, and for abbreviations such as 
APHIS or PPQ. 
The Spongy Moth Program Manual is a source of information on spongy moth and a reference 
for the methods and procedures for survey, regulatory, outreach, and control activities. 
Damage Caused by the Spongy Moth 
Spongy moth is one of the most destructive pests of shade, fruit, and ornamental trees as well as 
hardwood forests. In the period of 1980 to 1989, spongy moth defoliated close to one million or more 
forested acres each year. 
Besides being a pest of trees, spongy moth larvae are a nuisance to people. 
· Spongy moth larvae excrete digested leaf material while feeding in the tree canopy. For 
this reason, people will avoid using wooded parks and yards during the larval season 
· Dead larvae produce foul odors 
· Spongy moth nuisances hinder people’s ability to enjoy the outdoors

 are a nuisance to people. 
· Spongy moth larvae excrete digested leaf material while feeding in the tree canopy. For 
this reason, people will avoid using wooded parks and yards during the larval season 
· Dead larvae produce foul odors 
· Spongy moth nuisances hinder people’s ability to enjoy the outdoors 
· When spongy moth populations are dense, larvae become hyperactive during the day. 
Heavily infested areas teem with larvae on trees, telephone poles, vehicles, fences, houses, 
clotheslines, and above-ground swimming pools. People avoid going outdoors for fear of 
stepping on caterpillars crawling on sidewalks and in play areas. 
Background on Spongy Moth 
Accidentally introduced into the United States in 1869 in Medford, Massachusetts, the pest spread rapidly 
throughout New England. Between 1869 and 1890, spongy moth quickly developed into a serious 
problem in Massachusetts. Spongy moth damage was one of the key reasons Congress passed the Plant 
Quarantine Act of 1912. 
Despite early eradication efforts, spongy moth is now widely established. Maps of the generally infested 
area and a list of areas under quarantine are available on the APHIS Spongy Moth website. 
Research development and implementing survey, regulatory, and control programs have made spongy 
moth one of the most studied insects in the pest management field. 
Cooperation in the Spongy Moth Program 
Since the end of the last century, Federal, State, Tribal, and local government agencies have worked 
cooperatively to control spongy moth populations (by containment, suppression, or eradication, alone or 
in combination). Cooperative programs will continue to be the focus of the U.S. Department of

Cooperation in the Spongy Moth Program 
Since the end of the last century, Federal, State, Tribal, and local government agencies have worked 
cooperatively to control spongy moth populations (by containment, suppression, or eradication, alone or 
in combination). Cooperative programs will continue to be the focus of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA). 
Introduction 
Spongy Moth Dispersal 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 1-3 
Spongy Moth Dispersal 
With the current mobility of the U.S. population, the sprawling suburbanization of once-forested areas, 
and the insidious nature of the pest, the job of preventing establishment of isolated infestations by 
artificial spread is a difficult one. Household moves, especially the movement of outdoor articles such as 
lawnmowers and grills, are an important pathway for the long-distance movement of spongy moth. To 
contain spongy moth, an effective program will require: 1) public education on the problem; 2) public 
support in preventing spongy moth movement; and 3) early detection and eradication of isolated 
infestations. 
Potential Damage from the Spongy Moth 
All temperate hardwood growing areas in North America are potentially at risk from attack by spongy 
moth. Despite all attempts to prevent its movement, spongy moth continues to increase its range along the 
leading edge of the quarantine area. 
Preventive Safety Measures 
Safety measures involving personnel, the public, and equipment are the responsibility of all persons 
working on the Spongy Moth Program. Supervisors must advise employees of safety and health 
regulations and notify employees of known hazardous conditions. Employees

, spongy moth continues to increase its range along the 
leading edge of the quarantine area. 
Preventive Safety Measures 
Safety measures involving personnel, the public, and equipment are the responsibility of all persons 
working on the Spongy Moth Program. Supervisors must advise employees of safety and health 
regulations and notify employees of known hazardous conditions. Employees must comply with all 
safety and health regulations. When necessary, wear protective equipment and report hazardous situations 
to your supervisor. Contact your supervisor immediately when an accident or personal injury has 
occurred. 
Safety Reminders When Trapping 
· Avoid contact with poisonous plants 
· Beware of aggressive animals (e.g., dogs, bulls, etc.) near the trap site 
· Carry plenty of drinking water 
· Do not place traps in locations where you feel there is a dangerous or threatening situation 
· In areas with poisonous snakes, wear snake leggings and carry a snake bite kit 
· Prevent slips, trips, and falls by being aware of your surroundings and footing 
· Respect all property 
· Use preventive measures to avoid tick- and insect-borne diseases 
· Wear a high-visibility vest 
· Wear safety glasses when working or walking in wooded areas 
· Wear nitrile gloves when handling lures 
Vehicle Safety Reminders 
· Always use seat belts 
· Carry sufficient repair tools (jack and lug wrench) and safety equipment (flares and first 
aid kit)

· Detect outlying introductions of the pest to new areas 
· Delimit outlying detections to determine control treatment needs; and 
· Support regulatory decision making and actions 
The Spongy Moth Program relies on effective survey tools, strategies, and methods to provide 
critical information that guides all other aspects of program delivery. The annual national 
detection survey is necessary to find outlying introductions of the pest in uninfested areas in a 
timely manner to ensure the introductions do not result in large, established breeding populations 
that would be difficult and costly to eradicate. Delimiting surveys are used to define the outer 
boundaries of an infestation or to ensure small, outlying populations go extinct on their own due 
to natural factors (e.g., predation and inability to find mating partners). Egg mass and other types 
of surveys are useful in determining population levels and infestation densities. 
Because the information gathered through survey work underpins the rest of the Spongy Moth 
Program’s efforts, it is important to conduct surveys properly. Properly run surveys provide 
quality information to the program, and conversely, poorly run surveys yield lower quality, less 
useful information compromising overall program effectiveness. This chapter provides guidance 
on how to properly plan and conduct a spongy moth survey.

Planning the Survey 
The National Spongy Moth Survey is a resource-efficient survey designed to detect infestations 
before expansive land areas must be treated. 
Step 1: Determine the type of survey to be conducted (e.g., detection or delimiting) 
If you are planning a detection survey, refer to Detection Survey for categorizing sites. If you are 
planning a delimiting survey, determine the trapping density following the guidelines on

 detect infestations 
before expansive land areas must be treated. 
Step 1: Determine the type of survey to be conducted (e.g., detection or delimiting) 
If you are planning a detection survey, refer to Detection Survey for categorizing sites. If you are 
planning a delimiting survey, determine the trapping density following the guidelines on 
Delimiting Survey. 
Step 2: Determine Trapping Requirements 
When determining trapping requirements, consider the frequency for trapping an area and the 
last time the area was trapped. If an area must be trapped every 2 years and the area was trapped 
last year, do not trap the area in the current year. Consider available funding and other resources 
when planning and conducting surveys. 
Step 3: Determine Survey Needs (Personnel and Supplies) 
Step 3a: Formula for Determining Trap Needs 
The number of square miles in a category multiplied by the number of traps per square mile (trap 
density). Divide the total by the trapping frequency (in years) to get the number of traps required 
per year. 
(no. of sq. mi. x trap density)/trapping frequency in years = total number of traps required 
EXAMPLE Determine trap needs for Category 1, which is 250 sq. mi. in total area and trapped 
every 2 years. 
(250 square miles x 1)/2 years = 250/2 = 125 traps 
For a Category 1 area, which is 250 sq. mi. and trapped every two years, 125 traps 
are needed. 
Step 3b: Formula for Determining Personnel Needs 
Divide the trap total by the number of traps a trap tender can service under the conditions 
experienced in a specific State. For detection surveys, a national average is 400 traps per trap 
tender.

, which is 250 sq. mi. and trapped every two years, 125 traps 
are needed. 
Step 3b: Formula for Determining Personnel Needs 
Divide the trap total by the number of traps a trap tender can service under the conditions 
experienced in a specific State. For detection surveys, a national average is 400 traps per trap 
tender. In areas with difficult terrain, the average falls to 250 traps per trap tender. For delimiting 
surveys, the average is 750 traps per trap tender; for transition zone surveys, the average is 600 
traps per trap tender.

total traps/no. of traps tender can service = total trap tenders required 
EXAMPLE Determine how many trap tenders to hire for the season when conducting a detection 
survey that requires 1,200 traps. 
1,200 traps/400 = 3 trap tenders 
Step 4: Prepare a Trapping Budget 
After determining the needed traps and trap tenders, prepare a trapping budget. 
Budget for the following expenses (adjust for inflation): 
· Travel costs for trap tenders 
· Trap tenders’ hours 
· Trap and lure costs 
· Other materials (staples, staplers, maps) 
Conduct the Survey 
Step 1: Establish Trapping Grid for Survey 
Establish the trapping grid well in advance of the survey season (late winter/ early spring) to 
allow adequate time for review and consultation prior to trap placement. 
Using geographic information systems (GIS) to establish the base grid density is very useful, 
though not required. In addition, GIS systems can adjust the scale of the map to allow

 Grid for Survey 
Establish the trapping grid well in advance of the survey season (late winter/ early spring) to 
allow adequate time for review and consultation prior to trap placement. 
Using geographic information systems (GIS) to establish the base grid density is very useful, 
though not required. In addition, GIS systems can adjust the scale of the map to allow for greater 
resolution when placing traps in higher densities. Using an established grid ensures appropriate 
trap distribution throughout the established survey area. 
Capture GPS coordinates as traps are set; some find it useful to physically plot the trap locations 
on a map as a backup measure. To aid in monitoring and retrieving, number traps consecutively 
within a county as they are set. 
Alternatively, you may use preprinted bar codes to identify a specific or individual trap. 
NOTICE 
Never prenumber traps and set them randomly from a box or bag!

Step 3: Set Traps and Mark Location 
Step 3a: Setting Traps 
The timing for setting traps is critical. Phenology models may be available to assist with 
determining the proper timing for trap placement. 
NOTICE 
Directions for assembling traps are available in How to Assemble Traps. The spongy moth lures will 
remain active for at most 3 years from the date of manufacture (typically identified on each package) 
and if stored in the freezer. 
The grid locations are already marked on a map. Use discretion in selecting the exact location of 
the traps. Once traps are placed, record the location GPS coordinates within the grid. If a suitable 
trap location cannot be found within the grid, document the reason why.

The grid locations are already marked on a map. Use discretion in selecting the exact location of 
the traps. Once traps are placed, record the location GPS coordinates within the grid. If a suitable 
trap location cannot be found within the grid, document the reason why. 
General Rules for Setting Traps 
1. Obtain property owners’ permission before placing a trap. If not possible, leave a door 
hanger or other program information with the trap. 
2. Male moths usually frequent woodlands rather than open areas with no trees or shrubs. 
3. If available, woodland edges are good sites for trap placement. If there is a choice, place 
the trap on the windward side so the wind currents will carry the scent pheromone) into the 
woods. 
4. If there are no woodlands or residential areas within a reasonable distance (500 to 1,000 
feet) from the plotted map location, the best location for a trap is at the end of a hedge row 
or tree leading to a wooded area. 
5. Place traps four to five feet high (or eye level if less than five feet) on tree trunks. In areas 
frequented by small children and animals such as cattle and bears, place the trap out of 
their sight and reach. Because of vandalism, trap placement is especially important when 
trapping Category S areas (such as recreational parks, campgrounds, and tourist 
attractions). 
6. If possible, place traps in shady areas. Do not set the trap where foliage or branches will 
block the trap openings. 
7. Complete trap record including a sketch showing specific trap location. 
8. Avoid setting traps on or in the following situations. 
A. Close

attractions). 
6. If possible, place traps in shady areas. Do not set the trap where foliage or branches will 
block the trap openings. 
7. Complete trap record including a sketch showing specific trap location. 
8. Avoid setting traps on or in the following situations. 
A. Close to gravel roads (place trap at least 50 feet away from well-traveled roads) 
B. Properties for sale 
C. Parks or open areas where people can easily see the traps 
D. Properties with aggressive dogs 
Survey 
Conduct the Survey 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 2-7 
E. Private property without the owner’s permission 
F. School properties or along passageways where students walk 
G. Sites where GPS coordinates cannot be obtained 
H. Sites where farm animals may damage or destroy traps 
I. Sites where road construction is scheduled or in progress 
J. Sites within locked gates 
K. Sites obscured by tree branches 
L. Trees with poison ivy vines 
M. Trees marked for cutting or removal 
The distance between traps depends on the selected trap density and the availability of favored 
host trees. When possible, place the traps in a uniform array on choice hosts or in a preferred 
habitat. 
Delta traps (Figure 2-2) are most effective when attached directly to the trunk of a host tree. The 
preferred way to attach a trap to the tree is to tie a string around the tree and hang the clip on the 
string or staple the trap to the tree. Hang the traps at chest height unless vandalism or animal 
damage is a problem, in which case they should be hung higher.

preferred way to attach a trap to the tree is to tie a string around the tree and hang the clip on the 
string or staple the trap to the tree. Hang the traps at chest height unless vandalism or animal 
damage is a problem, in which case they should be hung higher. 
Milk carton traps (Figure 2-3) are used in Slow the Spread (STS) and other surveys to monitor 
spongy moth population levels when the pest is known to be present in the area.

Step 3b: Marking Trap Locations 
Mark trap locations to expedite trap tending as well as supervisory and quality control activities. 
Use plastic flagging ribbon or marking crayon. To mark a trap location, tie a piece of flagging 
ribbon to a telephone pole, tree trunk, or other suitable object at the roadside. The ribbon should 
be visible from the road when approached from either side. Mark trap location only when 
necessary. 
Brightly colored plastic tape (fluorescent orange) has proven to be the best flagging ribbon. The 
marking crayon must be sufficiently soft to mark wet trees. Place a small piece of flagging 
ribbon near the trap. 
In urban areas where streets are named and houses are numbered, use the house address and GPS 
coordinates for locating traps. Do not mark trap locations with ribbons or marking crayons in 
urban areas. Also, use restraint in marking roadside rest areas, picnic areas, tourist attractions, 
and other high-use areas where the ribbon will detract from the site

coordinates for locating traps. Do not mark trap locations with ribbons or marking crayons in 
urban areas. Also, use restraint in marking roadside rest areas, picnic areas, tourist attractions, 
and other high-use areas where the ribbon will detract from the site’s appearance. 
Step 4: Check the Traps 
For detection surveys, check each trap at least once during the middle of the trapping season. 
For delimiting surveys, check traps more frequently, preferably every 10 to 14 days. Under ideal 
conditions, trap checking will start when the male moths start flying. Where vandalism is likely, 

Survey 
Conduct the Survey 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 2-9 
check the traps more often. Phenology models can be useful for determining the proper timing 
for initial trap checks. 
Plan your trap-checking route before leaving the office. Select a route that will eliminate 
overlapping travel. 
When checking traps, bring a supply of replacement traps and lures to replace all vandalized and 
missing traps. When replacing a trap, number the replacement trap with the same number as the 
original trap with an additional indicator (such as the letter “R,” e.g., 416-R) highlighting that it 
is a replacement trap. 
When checking traps: 
1. Check overall trap condition and replace badly damaged traps. 
2. When trap contains a suspect moth, remove the trap without disturbing the specimen. Note 
on the trap record sheet the date and exact location of recovery and inform your supervisor. 
3. Record the trap inspection by noting the date on the trap and PPQ Form 343 (Trapping 
Record)

1. Check overall trap condition and replace badly damaged traps. 
2. When trap contains a suspect moth, remove the trap without disturbing the specimen. Note 
on the trap record sheet the date and exact location of recovery and inform your supervisor. 
3. Record the trap inspection by noting the date on the trap and PPQ Form 343 (Trapping 
Record) or local trap record sheet. 
4. Write the following information on the trap: trap number, county, trapper’s initials, date 
trap set, and each date the trap is checked. 
Check the trap by looking in both ends. There is no need to remove it from the tree. Look into 
the trap to see if there are any male moths. If a suspect male is present, remove and replace the 
trap. 
Step 5: Submit Spongy Moth Suspects 
Submit the trap with the suspect moth to your supervisor to submit to the PPQ Forest Pest 
Methods Laboratory (FPML) (formerly known as the Otis Laboratory) for confirmation and 
further identification. Alternatively, your supervisor may direct you to submit the specimen 
directly to the FPML. Refer to A ppendix C for specimen submission guidelines. 
Record on the bottom of the trap the date, time, results, GPS coordinates, and any pertinent 
observation or action taken. 
Record the date and all circumstances about the catch of suspect moths on the trap record sheet 
or in the USDA-approved database. Accurate information is essential to the trapping program. 
Complete the form each time you check the trap and find spongy moth. The data you report is as 
important as the trap placement. 
Step 6: Remove Traps 
At the end of the trapping season remove all traps and examine each for spongy moth. Care

or in the USDA-approved database. Accurate information is essential to the trapping program. 
Complete the form each time you check the trap and find spongy moth. The data you report is as 
important as the trap placement. 
Step 6: Remove Traps 
At the end of the trapping season remove all traps and examine each for spongy moth. Carefully 
look for missing traps. If a trap number cannot be read, rewrite the number on the bottom of the 
trap. 
When removing the trap, remove all other materials (string, lures, staples, wire). Also, remove all 
flagging tape. Give all removed traps to the person in charge of the survey. For each trap 
containing a suspect moth, provide the following information: location (State, county, town, and 
GPS coordinates); trap number; trap tender’s name or identification number; date; and host tree 
Survey 
Survey Records and Maps

name. Open traps on final check because moths can be missed when just looking through the trap 
ends. Flatten empty, used traps and dispose by incinerating or burying at a sanitary landfill. 
Destroy the lures with the traps. 
Step 7: Report Survey Results 
Refer to Spongy Moth Data Collection for instructions on reporting survey data into the USDA-
approved database as soon as possible and on a regular basis as detailed in your cooperative 
agreement or no later than December 31st, whichever is earlier.

Step 8: Interpret Survey Results 
If you found spongy moth during your survey, use the guidance on interpreting survey results in 
the specific sections below. 
Survey Records and Maps 
To document the survey, accurate and complete survey records and maps must be maintained. 
Records 
Maintain a record of all trap locations including any descriptive information needed to help 
locate traps (trap site map or PPQ Form 353). Include information such as date set, date 
inspected, and date removed, as well as trap catches. Record this information on a trap record 
sheet or mobile device and promptly enter the information into the USDA-approved database. 
Keep a separate record of any egg mass surveys. 
Use local guidelines for proper record maintenance. In developing local guidelines for survey 
records, determine what information is needed and the most efficient manner for recording each 
item. 
Record all trap locations and positive trap findings; verify trap locations on the map. Traps for 
which no moth catches are reported are assumed to be negative for the season. 
Record trapping data throughout the season, as frequently as possible, into the 
USDA-approved database. Refer to Spongy Moth Data Collection for instructions on reporting 
into the database. 
Maps 
For surveys, digital GIS maps or county or city maps are satisfactory. 
Consecutively number every trap location within each county. The type, number, and trap 
distribution will vary according to local needs. 
Prepare trap maps before the trapping season (the preferred method) using a grid system to 
assure proper trap distribution. Use GIS software, a grid, calipers, a ruler, or an overlay to plot

Please ensure the map contains a legend detailing the program starting date, completion date, 
name of trapper, and any other pertinent information. 
When using maps for postseason decision making, indicate both negative and positive trap 
catches on the map. The negative traps are important when determining the pattern of trap 
catches and establishing treatment boundaries. 
Revising Quarantine Maps 
Determine quarantine revisions in consultation with national program management. National 
program management will follow established protocols for quarantine expansion activities by 
issuing Federal Orders, changing web listing(s), revising maps, and/or publishing interim or 
proposed rules in the Federal Register. 
Detection Survey 
Purpose 
The purpose of a detection survey is to determine by trapping: 
· Where isolated infestations of spongy moth occur 
· Where further delimiting surveys are required 
Detection surveys are designed to find isolated infestations of spongy moth as soon as possible 
after introduction; small spongy moth infestations are less expensive and easier to eradicate than 
large infestations.

 Where isolated infestations of spongy moth occur 
· Where further delimiting surveys are required 
Detection surveys are designed to find isolated infestations of spongy moth as soon as possible 
after introduction; small spongy moth infestations are less expensive and easier to eradicate than 
large infestations. 
Due to differences in habitat, host availability, and patterns of movement of regulated articles 
(refer to Regulated Articles) from infested areas, not all areas within a State have the same 
potential for becoming infested. The risk of potential introduction and establishment will 
determine the areas in which a detection survey is needed. High-risk areas should include areas 
receiving regulated articles and containing preferred host trees. Before conducting the detection 
survey, categorize areas within the State by infestation risk. The Spongy Moth Risk Model can 
help with identification of high-risk areas. Refer to Detection Survey Protocol. 
The time at which a detection survey starts and ends will depend upon the climatic conditions in 
the area. At the least, the trapping period should cover the entire projected spongy moth flight 
period in the area. Phenology models may be available to assist in determining flight periods. 
Please contact your State Plant Health Director (SPHD) for model availability. In practice, 
because spongy moth string lures last several months in the field, detection trapping can be 
scheduled by the calendar in any given area, if appropriate buffers are included to account for 
variations in weather from year to year. However, whenever captured moths will be analyzed 
genetically, traps should be checked as quickly as possible after the end of the local flight season. 
This minimizes in-trap moth degradation and helps ensure successful analyses.

Detection Survey Protocol 
Step 1: Categorize areas within a State (per the national survey plan) 
Determine the total number of square miles in each category per county. The categories will 
determine the density and frequency of trapping in a particular area. Alternatively, each State 
may use the Spongy Moth Risk Model, an improved option for accomplishing this task. Not only 
does it provide detailed demographic and host information, but it also allows GIS specialists to 
add local risk data layers for a customized survey plan. Examples of such data include locations 
of railroads, campground data, postal address forwarding data, etc. Contact your GIS specialist 
for more guidance on using this model. 
Using the Spongy Moth Risk Model can aid in establishing the appropriate grid density (1/mi2; 
1/2mi2; etc.) based on the category of the survey area. Plan to trap for spongy moth in all 
categories except Category 4. 
Category S (Special Site)—sites where infestations are most likely to be artificially introduced.  These are 
sites with a history of receiving regulated articles from quarantine areas or transition counties 
(those not yet quarantined, but along the population front) and are also exposed to movement of 
infested vehicles (e.g., travel trailers, semi

B. Nurseries 
C. Sawmills, pulp mills, and veneer mills 
Category S regulatory sites need a minimum of two random set traps placed on the site. 
Additional traps may be necessary depending on the size of the facility, but no more than 
12 traps. When possible, place traps in all four cardinal directions on the property (N, S, W, 
E). 
Mills under compliance agreements (CAs) to receive regulated materials from quarantine 
areas must have two to four random set traps placed on the perimeter of the facility within 
property ownership (if possible) each year. These traps are necessary to monitor 
compliance and potential new introductions to the surrounding area. 
For mills under a CA in areas where spongy moth populations are not known to exist and 
where a standard detection grid is not present, place an additional four to ten traps in the 
area surrounding the mill. These additional traps should not be closer than two kilometers 
(1.25 miles) to the mill, or further than ten kilometers (6.25 miles) from the mill.

be made in consultation with national program management based on the following factors: 
· Available resources 
· Host vegetation 
· Number trapped in current year 
· Number trapped in previous year 
· Potential for artificial dispersal

When a single trap (or several loosely associated traps) catches an isolated1 or multiple moths, 
conduct a delimiting survey. The delimiting survey is usually performed in the following year, 
but if caught early enough in the current trapping season, some delimiting traps may be placed 
that same season to try to define the size of the infestation. 
Important Features 
· The standard delimiting survey trap array is 16 traps per square mile. Special 
circumstances, such as the presence of sensitive areas or habitats containing endangered 
species, may require a trap array of 26 to 36 traps per square mile. The delimiting array 
should cover at least 4 square miles around the positive site or extend out to the next 
negative trap. 
· The positive trap(s) will be at the center of the trap array. The survey results from the 
detection survey supplies information for positioning the trap array. 
· When conducted after an eradication effort, a delimiting survey is called a post-treatment 
survey. 
Delimiting Survey Protocol 
Step 1: Conduct the Survey 
Refer to guidelines in Conduct the Survey. 
Examine the map from the previous year’s detection survey showing all positive traps. When 
plotting trap locations on a new map, consider the scale of the map and the required trapping 
density (i.e., 16 to 36 traps per square mile). Center the grid on the suspect infestation.

 Conduct the Survey 
Refer to guidelines in Conduct the Survey. 
Examine the map from the previous year’s detection survey showing all positive traps. When 
plotting trap locations on a new map, consider the scale of the map and the required trapping 
density (i.e., 16 to 36 traps per square mile). Center the grid on the suspect infestation. Generally, 
four square miles of delimitation will be sufficient or a ½- to 1-mile boundary (dependent on the 
trapping category in the area of detection). If the suspect area is spread out, it is necessary to trap 
a larger area. 
Plot trap locations well in advance of the survey season (late winter/early spring). Plotting the 
traps on planned grids allows for results’ comparison from location to location. Do not arbitrarily 
place traps. 
When moths are captured during a detection survey, a delimiting survey may be conducted the 
following year in the vicinity of the trap catches. In delimiting surveys, traps are typically 
deployed at densities of 16 to 36 traps per square mile over areas of one to four square miles. 
Larger areas may be delimited as indicated by results of the detection survey. The pattern of trap 
catches can be used to estimate the approximate area of infestation. 
Uniform grid spacing provides consistent information, which will help pinpoint infestations. If 
feasible, use appropriate mapping software to create delimitation grids at the desired density with 
trap numbers plotted on the map at the grid points. If it is necessary to plot a map by hand, use a 
large-scale map such as topographic map or a county or city map with even spacing. Some

large-scale map such as topographic map or a county or city map with even spacing. Some 
 
1 Triggers for a delimiting survey may depend on proximity to the leading edge of the spongy moth-infested area, i.e., a single moth 
catch well removed from the leading edge may trigger an egg mass survey followed by a delimiting survey and/or treatment the 
following year, while a single moth find nearer to the leading edge may not trigger a delimiting survey.

counties have roads laid out on a square grid with road intersections reliably at regular grid 
spacing. Even spacing is important to prevent data gaps and maintain information consistency for 
evaluation. 
The scale on a topographic or similar large-scale map is appropriate for the delimiting survey. 
Figure 2-4 shows traps plotted for a delimiting survey. 
 
Figure 2-4 Example of Traps Plotted for Delimiting Survey 
Step 2: Select Sites for Placing Traps 
Using the map with the trapping sites plotted, select individual trap sites as close to the plot 
locations as possible. If you cannot hang a trap on a host tree, use another vertical surface, such 
as a telephone pole, to hang the trap, preferably within 100 meters of a host. Never hang a trap 
on branch tips. 
Step 3: Interpret Survey Results 
If the traps do not capture spongy moth during the delimiting survey, assume there is no 
detectable infestation in the delimited area. If the traps have

Introduction 
The following survey methods do not use pheromone traps. 
· Egg mass surveys 
· Larval detection surveys 
Egg mass surveys and larval detection surveys are often done to supplement an adult trapping 
survey and confirm reproducing populations are present. 
Egg Mass (and Other Life Stage) Surveys 
Purpose 
· To confirm an infestation by providing convincing evidence (egg masses) that reproduction 
has occurred 
· To determine the population level in a specific area so the status may be changed (e.g., 
noninfested to transition area; transition area to generally infested regulated area) 
· To determine the population level near a high-risk site so the correct control and/or 
regulatory actions can be applied 
When to Conduct an Egg Mass Survey 
The best time is after leaf drop; however, egg mass surveys can be done any time after the 
females have finished depositing eggs. Phenology models may be available to assist with survey 
timing. A preliminary survey may help to determine if the females are present and laying eggs; 
the buff egg masses and the white female moths are easy to see on tree tr

 best time is after leaf drop; however, egg mass surveys can be done any time after the 
females have finished depositing eggs. Phenology models may be available to assist with survey 
timing. A preliminary survey may help to determine if the females are present and laying eggs; 
the buff egg masses and the white female moths are easy to see on tree trunks and branches. 
Where to Conduct an Egg Mass Survey 
Egg mass surveys, which involve counting egg masses, are useful in areas with moderate or high 
infestation levels. 
Egg mass surveys are particularly desirable when: 
· Egg masses are the only life stage present 
· Survey results are needed immediately, as for treatment decisions 
· Populations are high enough to make the effort worthwhile. 
Usually, egg mass surveys will not detect low-level populations with reliability; therefore, egg 
mass surveys are of limited value in areas with low level populations (larval trapping is a better 
survey method in areas with light infestation levels). 
Egg mass surveys in the following areas are most likely to detect infestations: 
· Areas adjacent to and downwind from known infested areas 
· Areas close to known infested areas, particularly those areas where traps catch numerous 
moths 
· Areas such as Federal and State parks, used by RVs

defoliation, sightings of females, or some other indicator 
· Areas where establishments receive regulated articles 
· Areas where numerous household moves originating in the quarantine area occur 
· Areas with preferred hosts 
Characteristics of Egg Masses and Preferred Egg-Laying Sites 
A well-established infestation may exist even though few, if any, egg masses are easily seen. 
Therefore, surveyors must know the characteristics of the egg masses and the preferred egg-
laying sites. 
Preferred egg-laying sites are in the following locations: 
· In bark cavities, under loose bark, and in bark crevices 
· On branches on the ground or on the underside of any type of ground litter, such as tin cans 
· On logs—including firewood 
· On outdoor household articles (OHAs), such as birdhouses and picnic tables 
· On signs 
· On stone walls and in the crevices of stone walls 
· On the underside of rocks not tight to the ground 
· On tree trunks in sheltered spots, such as under limbs 
· Under the siding and eaves of buildings 
In fact, egg masses may be found anywhere near trees in areas with preferred hosts. 
Larval skins and pupal cases may be found even when egg masses are not.

Egg Mass Surveys Using Targeted Visual Surveys (Transects) 
Egg mass surveys for regulatory purposes are usually targeted visual surveys. 
Targeted visual surveys (transects) examine an area of 50 feet by 20 feet, 10 feet on either side of 
a 50-foot centerline. The total area examined is 1,000 ft2, roughly equivalent to the 1,089 ft2 in 
the 1/40 of an acre plots in the next technique. 
Before the egg mass survey: 
1. Know how to identify and locate the egg masses. 
2. Select the sites where spongy moth egg masses are most likely to be (use the criteria on the 
previous page). 
3. Inform others of your intended survey area.

circular, the plots will have a radius of 18.6 feet; therefore, they will be 1/40 of an acre 
(1,089 ft2). 
3. P repare a stake that will be driven into the center of the circular plot; this  stake will have a 
radius-marking line of 18.6 feet attached. With its attached line stretched, this stake will 
help locate points within, on, and outside the circumference of each plot. (If four additional 
stakes are placed, equidistant, on the circumference, these stakes along with the center 
stake, will form quadrants.) 
4. Inform others of your intended survey area.

3. Inform others of your intended survey area. 
Procedure for the general observation technique—at each survey site:  
1. Start at the positive trap (or within the area suspected of being infested). 
2. Examine transit lines placed on the main compass points (north, northeast, east, southeast, 
south, southwest, west, and northwest). Examine all preferred egg laying sites out to 0.5 
miles.

handling regulated articles. These surveys allow the environs of the establishments to be 
examined. 
· Areas in and around campgrounds 
· Forest edges near Christmas tree plantations 
· Forest edges near mills 
· Forest edges near nurseries 
Each egg mass survey for regulatory purposes will provide information to guide quarantine 
decisions for the establishment handling the regulated articles. Typical quarantine decisions 
involve: 
· Whether spongy moth is present in the environs of the establishment 
· If so, whether the environs of the establishment need to be treated 
Before the survey, know what egg masses look like and where to find them. 
To assess population levels at each survey site, refer to Egg Mass Surveys Using Targeted Visual 
Surveys (Transects) to survey for egg masses. If possible, walk in areas with preferred host trees. 
Procedure for the Survey for Regulatory Purposes 
1. Begin the survey in areas of importance (forest edges, campgrounds, campground edges). 
2. Select an object transecting an area with preferred hosts. 
3. Walk slowly toward the selected object, scanning in front, to the sides, and overhead. 
Examine all preferred egg-laying sites.

Place traps at chest height by stapling (or tying) the upper corners of pieces of tar paper or burlap 
to host trees to form a skirt. The burlap or tar paper should be at least nine inches wide and long 
enough to go around the trunk of the tree. Ensure the burlap or tar paper completely encircles the 
tree trunk but remains loose fitting. If white oak is present, use this tree for larval trapping. 
Place the larval traps on the trunk of a tree shortly before egg hatch is predicted. 
After larvae emerge, check under the burlap or tar paper for larvae and pupae. Check larval traps

For best results, check during daylight hours (preferably between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.) on hot, 
sunny days. 
Also check the larval traps after the larval period. Larvae often pupate under the covering of the 
larval trap. 
Slow the Spread (STS)/Transition Area Survey 
Introduction 
The STS/transition area is an area between the quarantine area and the uninfested area; because 
of natural dispersal, the area is in transition from uninfested to generally infested. In States in 
which the U.S. Forest Service STS Program is operational, spongy moth surveys are conducted 
as part of that program. However, in States in which the STS Program is not implemented, it is 
critically important to detect infestations as early as possible. Early infestation detections will 
prevent the movement of infested articles from the transition area and will provide data to 
support regulatory decisions. Visit the Slow the Spread of the Spongy Moth website

 part of that program. However, in States in which the STS Program is not implemented, it is 
critically important to detect infestations as early as possible. Early infestation detections will 
prevent the movement of infested articles from the transition area and will provide data to 
support regulatory decisions. Visit the Slow the Spread of the Spongy Moth website for more 
information about the STS Program. 
STS Survey Types: 
· Trap Surveys 
· Transition Area Egg Mass Surveys 
· Larval Detection Survey 
Trap Surveys 
Trap surveys are performed to locate established populations in the transition area. If resources 
permit, the trap surveys are performed throughout the transition area; if resources are limited, 
trap surveys are performed in areas near the generally infested quarantine area. 
In addition to locating infestations, the trap survey helps to determine when a county in the 
transition area should be shifted to the quarantine area. 
1. The recommended trapping density is either of the following: 
A. 2 to 3 km grid (STS action area)—equal to one trap per 1.5-3.5 km 2 
B. 3 to 5 km grid (STS monitoring area)—equal to one  trap per 3.5-5.1 km2 
2. The timing for setting traps is critical. Set traps before male moths emerge. Phenology 
models may be available to assist with determining the proper timing for placing traps. 
3. Use delta traps or milk carton traps. Milk carton traps are available but are currently not 
used in APHIS-funded survey work. 
4. If at all possible, check each trap at least once during the middle of the trapping season. 
Under ideal conditions, trap checking will start when the male moths start

4. If at all possible, check each trap at least once during the middle of the trapping season. 
Under ideal conditions, trap checking will start when the male moths start flying. Where 
vandalism is likely, check the traps more often. Phenology models can be useful for 
determining the proper timing for initial trap checks. 
5. If the suspect moths were trapped where spongy moth are not likely to be introduced, send 
the suspect moths to a designated trained identifier.

Transition Area Egg Mass Surveys 
Egg mass surveys are desirable when: 
· Egg masses are the only life stage present 
· Populations are high enough to make the effort worthwhile. 
A basic problem with egg mass surveys is they usually will not detect low-level populations. 
Several egg mass survey methods are available; these methods are described in Other Survey 
Tools.

Purpose of Regulatory Activities 
The purpose of regulatory activities is to prevent the artificial spread (spread caused by human 
activity) of spongy moth from quarantine areas to noninfested areas. Refer to Areas Quarantined 
in the United States for Spongy Moth for county-by-c ounty listings. 
Regulatory Methods 
Preventing the artificial spread of spongy moth is accomplished by inspecting and treating, if 
necessary, regulated articles (defined below). Regulated articles may be infested by any spongy 
moth life stage—egg masses, larvae, pupae, and/or adults. 
  
Regulatory 
Regulatory Methods 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 3-3 
Regulated Articles 
The following regulated articles require inspection and certification: 
· Christmas trees (including holiday greenery) 
· Logs (including firewood), pulpwood, bark, and bark products 
· Mobile homes and associated items 
· Nursery stock (trees with roots, shrubs with roots and persistent woody stems, unless they 
are greenhouse grown throughout the year) 
· Outdoor household articles (OHAs) 
· Any other products, articles, or means of conveyance posing a high risk of spongy moth

are greenhouse grown throughout the year) 
· Outdoor household articles (OHAs) 
· Any other products, articles, or means of conveyance posing a high risk of spongy moth 
artificial spread as determined by an APHIS employee or a State official 
Moving regulated articles to noninfested areas is restricted unless an inspection and/or treatment 
of the regulated articles is conducted to minimize the risk of transporting spongy moth life stages 
to noninfested areas. 
Regulated articles may move unrestricted, without treatment or inspection, throughout 
contiguous quarantine areas. 
Regulatory Considerations 
When planning a regulatory program to prevent the artificial spread of spongy moth from 
quarantine areas to noninfested areas, factors such as the type of regulated articles, quantity in 
the shipment, frequency of shipments, availability of personnel, available treatments, and the 
impact of the regulatory activities on regulated industries must be considered. 
Mitigation procedures must be conducted, and appropriate documentation must accompany all 
loads of regulated articles leaving quarantine boundaries. 
Quantity, Type, and Frequency of Shipments 
If establishments regularly ship large quantities of regulated articles outside the quarantine area, 
the establishments may operate under a compliance agreement (CA). If establishments 
infrequently ship regulated articles outside the quarantine area, USDA–Plant Protection and 
Quarantine (PPQ) and/or State personnel will inspect and certify individual shipments. 
Personnel Available 
The personnel available affects regulatory activities. The following individuals, if authorized, 
may conduct visual examinations, treat, and certify regulated articles: 
· PPQ officers

Operation Under Compliance Agreements 
Any person engaged in the business of growing, handling, or moving regulated articles may enter 
into a compliance agreement (CA) to facilitate the movement of such articles. CAs are 
particularly helpful when establishments regularly ship large quantities of regulated articles 
outside of quarantine areas. 
The purpose of a CA is to bring a person or firm into full compliance with the applicable 
requirements for handling regulated material. A CA provides a written and signed agreement 
confirming their understanding of the methods, conditions, and procedures necessary for 
compliance with the spongy moth quarantine (7 CFR 301.45). 
A CA specifies necessary safeguards to prevent the spread of spongy moth, such as disinfestation 
practices or applying chemical materials in accordance with the Treatment Manual. 
A CA template has been developed for commonly encountered businesses and activities. 
Operating procedures designed to meet regulatory requirements at individual facilities may be 
captured in an appendix that details those procedures. On occasion, unique situations may arise 
in which a standard CA template is not suitable, and a unique CA must be developed. These 
unique CAs must be developed in consultation with program management. 
An example of the CA template is available in Compliance Agreements. 
PPQ officers and/or State personnel train employees of the business operating under a CA. 
Additionally, the CA signer may provide training to employees as needed.

standardized procedure 
· Treating, if necessary, in a safe and effective manner to destroy spongy moth life stages 
On an as-needed basis, PPQ officers and/or State personnel monitor the employees of the 
cooperating establishments to ensure compliance. 
High-Risk Sites 
A high-risk site is a site where spongy moth is present on the premises, Regulated Articles, 
and/or in the surrounding area. High-risk sites are likely to provide a pathway for human-assisted 
spongy moth spread to noninfested areas. 
There are three categories of high-r isk sites and establishments based on the type of regulated 
articles and documentation required for movement. Sites and establishments listed below provide 
examples of potential high-risk sites and establishments in each category. These lists are not 
exhaustive. 
Category One High-Risk Sites and Establishments 
Category One high-risk sites and establishments commonly operate under a State or Federal CA. 
At Category One high-risk sites and establishments both the premises and the regulated articles 
must be inspected by a State or Federal official. Category One high-risk sites and

· Military bases (due to potentially infested vehicles and cargo) 
· Moving companies 
Moving Regulated Articles from High-Risk Sites and Establishments 
PPQ officers or State personnel inspect high-risk sites and establishments before entering into 
CAs and periodically thereafter. When a CA is established, PPQ officers or State personnel train 
company employees on provisions of the CA, treatment options for regulated articles, and 
documentation requirements. 
If the company is operating under an active CA, regulated articles can be moved from Category 
One or Category Two high-risk sites or establishments because they have been appropriately 
treated/visually examined and the appropriate documentation is completed. 
Regulated articles can be moved from Category Three high-risk sites and establishments after a 
visual examination. Regulated articles moved from a Category Three high-risk site or 
establishment must be accompanied by appropriate documentation (e.g., APHIS program aid 
2417). 
Nursery Stock and Christmas Trees 
The procedures outlined below are used to certify these items: 
· Trees and shrubs grown or stored outdoors in a nursery 
· Christmas trees grown as “balled and burlapped” nursery stock 
· Christmas trees grown for the cut Christmas tree market, which are not classified as 
nursery stock

NOTICE 
Trees and shrubs that have been continuously grown in a greenhouse under conditions in which no 
spongy moth infestation would be possible as determined by an inspector may be issued a certificate 
without piece-by-piece inspection. Refer to 7 CFR 301.45-5(a)1-4. 
Inspecting Nurseries and Christmas Tree Plantations 
The purpose of inspecting nurseries and Christmas tree plantations is to determine what 
mitigation procedures may be required prior to shipping from the quarantine area. 
Inspection Timing 
For regulatory purposes, inspections can occur whenever movement of regulated articles is 
planned. The presence of any spongy moth life stage (egg mass, larva, pupa, or adult) found on 
Regulatory 
Nursery Stock and Christmas Trees 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 3-7 
or near a regulated article constitutes a high risk of artificial spread. Inspectors rely on their 
knowledge of current population densities in the immediate area and previous history of the 
high-risk site to determine inspection timing. 
In general, annual inspections for egg masses involving the premises and surrounding areas tend 
to occur after leaf fall in the autumn, when egg masses are no longer hidden by leaves, and may 
continue until leaves expand to provide cover in the spring or when larvae have dispersed. Larval 
inspections occur during and after dispersal from the egg mass. Phenology models are available 
to assist in determining timing of the larval development stages. 
Inspection Methods 
Inspections may include the premises, the regulated articles, and all preferred hosts in the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 expand to provide cover in the spring or when larvae have dispersed. Larval 
inspections occur during and after dispersal from the egg mass. Phenology models are available 
to assist in determining timing of the larval development stages. 
Inspection Methods 
Inspections may include the premises, the regulated articles, and all preferred hosts in the 
surrounding area. What is included and how the inspection is performed is determined by the 
type of establishment to be inspected and the regulated articles to be moved. Whether the 
inspection is all encompassing or only of the regulated articles, it should be noted that egg 
masses can be found on all surfaces and may be hidden in cracks or crevices. For a description of 
preferred spongy moth egg-laying sites, refer to Where to Conduct an Egg Mass Survey. 
Inspection Results 
Inspectors use their judgment, and the inspection criteria listed below to determine if conditions 
favor spongy moth artificial spread. 
· One egg mass (or more) found on the regulated articles or within three meters (10 feet) of 
the articles 
· Twelve or more egg masses per hectare (five or more per acre) are found within 
approximately 30 meters (100 feet) of the articles 
· Heavy larval infestations found within 1,600 meters (one mile), which could result in 
infestation through blow-in or larval migration 
When any of the above conditions (or similar threatening conditions) exist: 
The PPQ officer can issue an Emergency Action Notification, PPQ Form 523. The EAN will

If no spongy moth life stages are found during the inspection, certificates may be issued for the 
regulated articles. 
Treating Category One High-Risk Sites 
When required, the premises of category one high-risk sites are treated with insecticide 
applications. Treatment is the responsibility of the regulated establishment. Insecticide 
applications may be either aerial applications or ground applications by hydraulic sprayers or 
mist blowers. 
· Aerial applications are usually preferred to ground applications. Aerial applications give 
better insecticidal coverage to the forest canopy and surrounding areas and are usually used 
Regulatory 
Nursery Stock and Christmas Trees 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 3-8 
to treat in or near the following high-risk sites: recreational areas; mills; nurseries; and 
Christmas tree plantations. 
· Ground application using a hydraulic sprayer is the preferred method for treating mobile 
home parks or isolated areas in nurseries. 
When to Treat 
Apply the insecticide when general egg hatch in the area is completed. Perform applications 
when first, second, and third instar larvae are present. Phenology modeling could also be used to 
help determine the proper timing of insecticide applications. Proper treatment timing is essential 
as pesticide effectiveness is reduced when the larvae are beyond the third instar. Best results are 
obtained if the application can be delayed until general foliage of preferred hosts is 1/3 to 1/

 first, second, and third instar larvae are present. Phenology modeling could also be used to 
help determine the proper timing of insecticide applications. Proper treatment timing is essential 
as pesticide effectiveness is reduced when the larvae are beyond the third instar. Best results are 
obtained if the application can be delayed until general foliage of preferred hosts is 1/3 to 1/2 
grown. If possible, treat immediately before moving regulated articles. 
Treating the High-Risk Site 
Treat the infested portion of the high-risk site and the surrounding area to a depth equal to the 
effective range of the spray equipment. A minimum depth of 70 feet will usually suffice to keep 
migrating late instar larvae from reinfesting the site. If reinfestation does occur, additional 
treatments are necessary. In heavily infested sites, two or three applications seven to ten days 
apart may be necessary. Ensure all necessary permits and permissions are obtained prior to 
treatment. 
Treatment Documentation 
Records of all treatments must be retained for two years or according to State documentation 
retention requirements, whichever is greater, and made available to the inspector upon request. 
After a high-risk site treatment and following any appropriate postentry requirement for the 
treatment, a PPQ officer or State official reinspects the site following the inspection protocols 
described above. If the treatment was (and is) effective, the PPQ officer or State official notes the 
action taken on the EAN and rescinds the EAN. 
Mitigation Procedures for Small Quantities of Regulated Articles

Small quantities of regulated articles from a quarantine area must be inspected on a piece-by-
piece basis by: 
· Workers at the establishments under PPQ direction 
· PPQ officers 
· State personnel 
For example, piece-by-piece inspection is used for assembly yard inspection of articles such as 
collected native plant material. 
During a piece-by-piece inspection, inspect all surfaces including bark crevices where egg 
masses may be attached. When egg masses or larvae are found, treat either by physically 
removing after spraying with Golden Pest Spray Oil or by applying insecticide.

confirming their understanding of the methods, conditions, and procedures necessary for 
compliance with the spongy moth quarantine (7 CFR 301.45). 
Mitigation Procedures 
If they have been examined according to a standardized procedure, sawlogs originating from a 
quarantine area may be moved outside of the quarantine area. Sawlogs must be accompanied by 
a signed Accurate Statement stating 100% of the exterior surfaces were visually examined no 
more than five days prior to the date of movement. 
Inspectors (PPQ officers or State personnel) or employees of establishments operating under a 
CA examine the entire exterior surface area (100% visual examination) of each sawlog in the 
shipment. 
Regulatory 
Logs, Pulpwood, Holiday Greenery, Bark and Bark Products 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 3-12 
The “laid out” method is the recommended method for 100% visual examination of the entire 
surface area of all sawlogs. During the piece-by-piece examination, all exposed surfaces and 
crevices on the sawlog are examined for egg masses, larvae, and pupae. Alternative inspection 
methods must be approved by APHIS or State personnel. If any spongy moth life stages are 
present, qualified personnel apply a suitable treatment before shipment. 
Suitable treatments are listed under Treatments.

Using the “laid-out” method, PPQ officers, State officials, or individuals operating under a CA 
ensure no spongy moth life stages are present by conducting a 100% visual examination. The 
100% visual examination must occur no more than five days prior to moving sawlogs out of 
quarantine areas. If the sawlogs are not moved within five days, they must be reexamined and 
moved within five days of the reexamination. 
Procedure for a “laid-out” 100% visual examination: 
1. Plan in advance for the sawlogs to be “laid out” with personnel and equipment on hand to 
clean and turn the logs. 
2. Walk between the rows, examining the upper surface of sawlogs in the near row and the 
side surface of logs in the next row. If eggs masses are found, saturate with Golden Pest 
Spray Oil (EPA Reg. No. 57538-11) and remove using a wire brush or paint scraper. 
Vigorously brush or scrape the entire egg mass from the surface. If

side surface of logs in the next row. If eggs masses are found, saturate with Golden Pest 
Spray Oil (EPA Reg. No. 57538-11) and remove using a wire brush or paint scraper. 
Vigorously brush or scrape the entire egg mass from the surface. If larvae or pupae are 
found, remove and destroy. 
3. Have the sawlogs turned so the upper surface becomes the bottom. 
4. Repeat Step 2. Examine (and treat if necessary) the surfaces not previously examined, 
completing a 100% visual examination of all exterior surfaces. 
5. Arrange for shipment within five days by shippers under CA. 
6. Document the inspection by completing a signed Accurate Statement. 
Sawlogs originating within the spongy moth quarantine area can be moved outside quarantine 
boundaries when: 
· 100% visual examination of the external surface area is completed; and 
· Sawlogs are either free of spongy moth life stages or treated to eliminate life stages; and 
· Required documentation is securely attached to the waybill or other shipping documents 
accompanying the article

Shipping Facilities 
Firms that regularly move wood chips with bark attached, bark chips, and bark products to 
destinations outside the quarantine area must operate under a CA. A CA provides a written and 
signed agreement confirming their understanding of the methods, conditions, and procedures 
necessary for compliance with the spongy moth quarantine (7 CFR 301.45). 
Mitigation Procedures 
Wood chips, bark chips, and bark products, including biofuel, may be moved if: 
· composted 
· produced by a hammermilling process 
· moved to receiving mills under CA by shippers under CA. 
Mitigations procedures vary depending on the end use of the regulated products. 
Composting 
Wood chips, bark chips, and bark products can be composted to mitigate the risk of spreading 
spongy moth. For complete details about approved composting procedures, refer to Procedures 
for Composting Bark. 
Composting treatments require a starting compost pile of at least 200 cubic yards. The compost 
pile remains undisturbed until the internal temperature reaches 120 °F (49 °C) for at least four 
continuous days or 100 °F (37.8 °C) for at least six continuous days. The compost pile is then 
turned so the outer layer, to a depth of three feet, becomes the core material. The turned compost 
pile then remains undisturbed until temperature requirements are achieved.

turned so the outer layer, to a depth of three feet, becomes the core material. The turned compost 
pile then remains undisturbed until temperature requirements are achieved. 
Hammermilling process 
Bark chips, bark mulch, and other bark products may be produced by log debarking, followed by 
chip size reduction using a hammermill. A hammermill consists of a large steel drum with a 
rapidly rotating shaft on which hammers are mounted. The rotor and hammers are spun at a high 
speed inside the drum while the bark is being fed into the drum via a feed hopper. The impact of 
the hammers on the bark pulverizes the bark into smaller pieces, which then exit the drum 
through a sizing screen. A common form of the hammermill is a tub grinder. Bark chips or bark 
mulch of common commercial dimensions produced by this process are considered fully 
mitigated and can be shipped without further restriction.

OHA infestation is still possible. Always perform a thorough examination of each article. 
Step 1: Thoroughly examine each OHA and any household article that has been outdoors 
The examination must include the entire surface area, including nooks and crannies. Use probes 
and flashlights to examine the nooks and crannies. Turn articles over to examine the lower 
surfaces. Remember that spongy moth females favor sheltered surfaces for egg laying. If an 
article cannot be turned over, examine by crawling underneath on a drop cloth, using a hand 
mirror, and/or probing with a screwdriver. 
If necessary, disassemble articles likely to harbor spongy moth. Pay special attention to articles 
near egg masses, larvae, or pupae. 
  
Regulatory 
Outdoor Household Articles

Although they may not be typical OHAs, examine the following articles as if they were OHAs: 
· Articles left outside 
· Articles stored in areas open to the outside 
· Articles stored in areas with an opening to the outside 
· Articles stored indoors, but used outdoors 
As articles are examined, separate the infested items from noninfested items. 
Step 2: Treat the infested articles; as an alternative, infested articles can be treated 
during their examination 
The spongy moth life stage most likely to be encountered while inspecting OHAs is egg masses.

As articles are examined, separate the infested items from noninfested items. 
Step 2: Treat the infested articles; as an alternative, infested articles can be treated 
during their examination 
The spongy moth life stage most likely to be encountered while inspecting OHAs is egg masses. 
Treat egg masses by saturating them with Golden Pest Spray Oil and removing any egg masses 
with a paint scraper or wire brush. Refer to Treatments f or more details.  
Step 3: Safeguard the inspected articles 
If any inspection is not done on moving day, safeguard the articles from reinfestation. Safeguard 
the inspected articles by: 
· Covering with plastic sheeting or plastic bags 
· Packing immediately in moving van or truck and enclosing or covering 
· Storing articles indoors 
Disposable plastic bags or plastic sheeting safeguards articles for several days before a move. On 
moving day, remove plastic bags and/or sheeting from regulated articles and discard. 
Step 4: Document the inspection 
Refer to OHA Inspection Documentation. 
Treatments 
· Physically removing egg masses (preferred for OHAs) 
o Using a wire brush or paint scraper, remove an egg mass from an OHA. Brush or 
scrape vigorously to remove all the egg mass; however, do not brush or scrape so 
vigorously the OHA is damaged. 
· Physically Removing egg masses after spraying 
o Apply Golden Pest Spray Oil to an egg mass, using: 
▪ Sprayer with an adjustable nozzle 
▪ Paint brush 
▪ Similar brush 
o Thoroughly saturate the egg masses to the point of runoff so the egg mass is

▪ Paint brush 
▪ Similar brush 
o Thoroughly saturate the egg masses to the point of runoff so the egg mass is 
“soaked.” The Golden Pest Spray Oil rapidly penetrates destroying even the 
innermost eggs. Then, physically remove the egg mass using a wire brush or paint 
scraper. Vigorously brush or scrape all the egg mass from the surface.

Mobile Homes, Mobile Offices, and Associated Items 
Mobile homes and associated items are only regulated when they are moved from a quarantine 
area into or through a noninfested area. To move a mobile home or mobile office from a 
quarantine area into or through a noninfested area, an inspection is necessary before the move. 
Additionally, certifying documents are necessary during and after the move. 
Preparing for Regulating Mobile Homes and Mobile Offices 
To regulate mobile home or mobile office movement from quarantine areas, PPQ and State 
personnel cooperate in the following activities: 
Contacting Mobile Home or Mobile Office Haulers 
All mobile home or mobile office haulers who move mobile homes from quarantine areas to 
noninfested areas are contacted and placed under CA. Entities moving mobile homes, mobile 
offices, or other mobile structures, if not under CA, must contact State or Federal officials prior 
to the move to make arrangements for inspection and disinfestation (if needed) prior to the move. 
Establishments routinely involved in such movement may be placed under CA. 
Under the terms of the CAs, the CA holder only moves mobile homes or mobile offices from a 
quarantine area to noninfested areas after spongy moth inspections have been performed and 
documented. Under the CAs, the CA holder knows how to complete the inspections and how to 
handle the certifying documents.

Contacting the State Department of Transportation 
In some States, permits are required to move a mobile home or mobile office or mobile office. 
Contact with the State transportation office allows access to copies of the permits facilitating 
making arrangements for inspections. 
Contacting Operators of Mobile Home Parks or Mobile Office Dealers 
Contacting the operators of mobile home parks and dealers can allow access to mobile 
homeowners. Park operators or dealers can inform departing customers of the need for 
inspections and the inspection options available. 
Contacting Pesticide Applicators 
Contacting individual pesticide applicators and organizations for pesticide applicators allows 
access to pesticide applicators who are interested in becoming qualified certified applicators 
(QCAs). QCAs are pesticide applicators who are allowed to inspect mobile homes or mobile 
offices under CAs. 
Preinspection Procedure 
Step 1: Before the move, contact the departing mobile home or mobile office owner 
· Explain the threat posed by spongy moth and the need to inspect departing mobile homes 
or mobile offices. Arrange the inspection. Before the inspection, ask the owner of the 
mobile home or mobile office or mobile office to: 
· Ensure the exteriors of the mobile home or mobile office and all associated items are 
accessible for inspection 
· Ensure the interior of the mobile home or mobile office is available for inspection, if

edges that could be sharp 
· Never crawl under a mobile home or mobile office on jacks 
· Use a flashlight to illuminate a dark area before entering 
· Use mirrors, instead of entering tight corners 
Inspection Procedure 
Step 1: Examine the vegetation around the mobile home or mobile office for spongy 
moth life stages 
If the vegetation in the surrounding area is infested, the mobile home or mobile office is likely 
also infested. However, even when there is no indication of a spongy moth population in the 
surrounding area, mobile home or mobile office infestation is still possible, therefore, all 
inspections must be exacting and complete.

inspections must be exacting and complete. 
Step 2: Examine the mobile home or mobile office and associated items for spongy moth 
life stages 
Look in, on, and under everything. The examination must cover all exterior surfaces, including 
surfaces deep within crevices and other concealed areas. Use probes and flashlights to examine 
all concealed areas. 
Examine lower surfaces very carefully. Egg-laying spongy moth females favor shelter under 
surfaces. Examine the underside of a mobile home or mobile office by crawling on a drop cloth, 
using a hand mirror, and/or probing with a screwdriver. Inspect with particular care:

Introduction 
The Slow the Spread (STS) A ction/Transition Area occupies a band starting at approximately the 
outer edge of the quarantine area and extends outward 100 kilometers to the noninfested area. 
The quarantine area is characterized by a virtually continuous spongy moth population that can 
periodically reach outbreak levels. The noninfested area lacks an established spongy moth 
population. Spongy moth populations in the STS Action/Transition Area are usually low level, 
discontinuous populations that do not typically reach outbreak levels. 
Significance and History of the Slow the Spread Foundation and 
Action Area 
The STS Foundation is a nonprofit organization whose membership consists of those States 
along the leading edge of the spongy moth quarantine area. The purpose of the STS Foundation 
is to conduct activities designed to slow the natural spread of spongy moth out of the quarantine

area in order to protect outlying areas from damage caused by the pest. This mission is 
accomplished through intensive survey activities, along with regulatory activities, eradication 
treatments, and population suppression treatments. These activities have resulted in more than a 
60% reduction of natural spread rates from an average of 13 miles a year to an average of less 
than 5 miles a year.

The U.S. Forest Service (FS) provides 75% of the funding for the STS Foundation and its 
activities. The remaining funds are provided by member states, along with an APHIS grant for 
regulatory activities within the STS Action/Transition Area. 
Slow the Spread Action/Transition Area Regulatory Activities 
To prevent the long-distance spread of spongy moth, APHIS policy is to prevent the 
establishment of isolated, outlying infestations. Usually, isolated infestations result from human-
assisted dispersal of the pest through the moving infested articles. Articles likely to be infested 
are considered Regulated Articles. To prevent human-assisted spongy moth spread, APHIS and 
State program partners enforce quarantines on regulated articles when they are moved from the 
quarantine area to noninfested areas. Because logs and many other regulated articles tend to 
move fairly short distances from the quarantine area into the STS Action/Transition Area, 
regulatory activities within the STS Action/Transition Area are a vital component of the STS 
effort. These regulatory activities may include: 
· E ntering into compliance agreements (CAs) with regulated establishments  
· Issuing Federal Certificates for moving regulated articles that have been fully mitigated 
· Monitoring spongy moth population levels at and near facilities receiving logs from the 
quarantine area 
· Inspecting nursery stock and other products to ensure pest freedom prior to movement 
· Conducting special operations, like weigh station blitzes

· Inspecting nursery stock and other products to ensure pest freedom prior to movement 
· Conducting special operations, like weigh station blitzes 
Nurseries and Christmas Tree Plantations 
Nursery stock and plant products are a high-risk pathway for moving spongy moth. Because 
spongy moth populations may exist at low levels in the STS Action/Transition Area, nurseries in 
the STS Action/Transition Area, particularly those dealing in preferred hosts, must be inspected 
often enough to ensure infested material is not being shipped. 
In addition to a visual examination of plant products and the growing plants, trapping should be 
done in the vicinity of the nursery to detect spongy moth. For a more detailed description of how 
to inspect nurseries and Christmas tree plantations in the STS Action/Transition Area, refer to 
Inspecting Nurseries and Christmas Tree Plantations. Conducted trapping activities in 
coordination with the STS program and other relevant program partners to assure proper trapping

Regulated Logs Originating in the Spongy Moth Quarantine Area. For additional information 
about regulatory activities at mills, please refer to the appropriate section(s) of the Regulatory 
chapter. 
Criteria for Adding Areas to the Quarantine 
The decision to add an area to the quarantine is based on the detection of a sufficient number of 
male moths and/or other life stages supporting a State and Federal consensus the area is 
generally infested. 
Trap Survey Results (Male Moths Alone) 
When more than 10 male moths are caught in the majority of traps placed throughout the area 
for 2 consecutive years, consider adding the infested area to the quarantine area. Milk carton 
traps are frequently used for STS/transition area survey work due to its much larger capacity 
compared to a delta trap. 
Trap Survey and Other Survey Results 
When adult trapping captures multiple male moths and other survey methods detect alternate life 
stages, consider adding the infested area to the quarantine area. 
Egg Mass Survey Results 
When multiple egg masses are detected as the result of an egg mass survey, consider adding the 
area to the quarantine area.

The original spongy moth regulations were first published in 1912 during the tenure of 
Agriculture Secretary James Wilson. Over a century later, the regulations continue to help 
safeguard trees and forests from this devastating pest. 
Outreach is fundamental to the core activities of the Spongy Moth Program, providing an 
essential and unifying thread across the survey, regulatory, and control actions. Wide sweeping 
and broad spongy moth outreach can be big and bold or small and subtle, but all communication 
facilitates: 
· Increased awareness of the pest and the spongy moth program 
· Enhanced understanding of the pest and spongy moth program 
· Public and stakeholder support for the spongy moth program 
· Compliance with spongy moth regulations and quarantine requirements 
While survey, regulatory, and control may be designated as the responsibility of a select few, 
outreach is a universal job function. We all play a role in the spongy moth outreach mission. 
Spongy moth key messages align program partners and support delivering accurate and

Background 
The spongy moth is native to Europe and first arrived in the United States in Massachusetts in 
1869. 
· Spongy moth is one of the most destructive pests of trees and shrubs to ever be introduced 
into the United States. Spongy moth caterpillars have voracious appetites for more than 
300 species of trees and shrubs, posing a danger to North America’s forests. 
· The first Federal spongy moth quarantines were enacted in 1912 in New England and 
today, nearly half of the lower 48 States in the east are partially or entirely quarantined for 
the pest. 
· S pongy moth can spread on its own and when people unknowingly move an adult moth, 
larva, or egg mass. Due to our mobile society, the majority of new spongy moth 
infestations are associated with moving outdoor household articles (OHAs) by the public. 
· Spongy moth caterpillars defoliate trees, leaving trees vulnerable to diseases and other 
pests that can eventually kill the tree. Early detection is critical to limiting spongy moth 
spread. 
· Spongy moth prefers approximately 150 primary hosts but will feed on more than 300 
species of tree and shrubs.

· Newly hatched spongy moth caterpillars are black and hairy. As they mature, caterpillars 
develop a mottled yellow to gray pattern with tufts of bristle-like hairs and a pattern of five 
pairs of blue dots and six pairs of red dots along their back. 
· Male and female adult moths look very different; a male moth is about ¾” long, brown in 
color with a darker brown pattern on their wings. Females are larger and nearly white with 
dark saw-toothed patterns on their wings. Female spongy moth cannot fly. 
· When spongy moth population density reaches high levels, the caterpillars consume large 
quantities of foliage resulting in partial or complete forest defoliation. 
· Spongy moth prefers approximately 150 primary hosts including aspen, birch, cedar, 
cottonwood, larch, oak, poplar, willow, and fruit trees. 
Survey 
· Two USDA agencies, APHIS and the U.S. Forest Service (FS), partner with various State 
agencies to conduct spongy moth surveys.

· The goal of surveying is to find new spongy moth infestations early, before populations 
can establish, grow, and spread. Public cooperation in surveys is vitally important to ensure 
a full and complete survey. 
· Spongy moth traps are green, orange, or brown and are made of plastic-coated cardboard. 
The “delta” trap looks like a miniature pup tent with openings on each end (Figure 2-2). 
The other version of the trap is taller and larger, looks like a milk carton, and is named the 
“milk carton” trap. Milk carton traps are not used in APHIS-funded survey work. 
· T raps are baited with a lure to attract the male moth. Once the male moth enters a trap, it is 
either caught in the sticky lining (delta trap) or killed by a small, insecticidal strip (milk 
carton). 
· The spongy moth traps pose no risk to people, pets, or wildlife.

eradicating outbreaks outside currently infested areas. 
· T he Spongy Moth Program uses several strategies and tools to control the pest.  
o Mass trapping strategically places pheromone spongy moth traps (to attract male 
moths) in a dense grid pattern across the treatment area. The objective of mass 
trapping is to capture male spongy moths before they have a chance to locate and 
mate with the flightless female moths. The objective of mating disruption is to 
saturate the treatment area with enough pheromone sources to confuse the male 
moths and thereby prevent them from finding and mating with female moths. This 
can be accomplished by either ground or aerial application of the pheromone 
Disparlure. 
o Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) is a biopesticide (natural product) used to 
target spongy moth larvae. The word biopesticide is a combination of the words 
“biological and pesticide.” In most cases, Btk is aerially applied, however in small 
spongy moth infestations (less than 5 acres), Btk may be applied using ground 
equipment. When spongy moth larvae eat vegetation treated with Btk, a toxin is 
released in their stomachs. This toxin eventually starves or poisons the larvae. 
o Gypchek, a spongy moth nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) product, is also used to 
target larvae. NPV is applied with aerial or ground application equipment. Spongy 
moth larvae eat the virus-coated leaves and become infected. These larvae die and

Purpose 
The purpose of APHIS’s eradication activities is to prevent spongy moth establishment in a pest-
free area. Eradicating isolated, outlying spongy moth populations is critical in containing and 
mitigating human-assisted spread of and damage caused by the pest. Eradication is the complete 
extermination of a pest population. USDA policy is to detect and eradicate spongy moth 
populations found outside the generally infested area and the Slow the Spread (STS) action area. 
Other types of pest population control activities occur as part of the overall State/Federal strategy 
to address spongy moth in the United States. Within the generally infested area and the STS 
action area, treatments are applied with the objective of suppressing or reducing, but not 
eliminating, spongy moth population levels. 
In keeping with the 1990 USDA Departmental Policy 5600-01 and the 2009 Interagency Gypsy 
Moth Memorandum of Understanding between APHIS and the USDA Forest Service (Forest 
Service Agreement No. 09-SU-11132546-079, APHIS will cooperatively fund eradicating 
isolated infestations if the isolated infestations are: 
· 640 acres or smaller 
· On non-Federal land, and 
· Not adjacent to Federal lands. 
Suppression efforts in the infested areas where eradication is no longer feasible are the 
responsibility of the USDA–FS and individual States. APHIS does not fund efforts to control 
spongy moth by suppression.

responsibility of the USDA–FS and individual States. APHIS does not fund efforts to control 
spongy moth by suppression. 
Evaluating the Need for Eradication Treatment 
Review Season’s Trapping Data 
At the end of each spongy moth survey season, review trap data to identify sites where spongy 
moth was detected. Sites with multiple catches in a single trap or traps with spongy moth catches 
near one another are sites requiring particular attention. Such sites may indicate reproducing 
populations, and the site should be revisited to search for further evidence of a reproducing 
population. Additional evidence of a reproducing population may include the presence of 
nonadult life stages, or the results of delimiting surveys as referenced in the survey chapter. 
Nonadult life stages are typically confirmed through the discovery of one or more egg masses or 
a pupal exuvia (aka “pupal cases”). If evidence of a reproducing population is found, propose to 
label the site as an eradication site. A proposal based on repeated trap catches will usually be 
predicated on how many moths are caught over multiple seasons and how close together 
(geographically) the catches are.

Evaluating the Need for Eradication Treatment 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual 6-3 
When the initial internal discussions result in a decision to pursue conducting an eradication 
treatment, national Spongy Moth Program management must be informed and consulted. 
Internal Staff Discussions 
In addition to the review of trap data, formulating an eradication proposal should include internal 
discussions by the lead agency. The lead agency is the agency responsible for carrying out the 
eradication treatment. Initial internal discussions should

treatment, national Spongy Moth Program management must be informed and consulted. 
Internal Staff Discussions 
In addition to the review of trap data, formulating an eradication proposal should include internal 
discussions by the lead agency. The lead agency is the agency responsible for carrying out the 
eradication treatment. Initial internal discussions should include all relevant factors including, 
but not limited to, topography of the proposed treatment site, land use patterns in the area, 
population density (rural, urban, etc.), and relevant social, political, and demographic factors. 
This initial assessment should be based on the best information available. 
The initial internal discussions should also consider factors determining whether proposed 
eradication treatments would be applied aerially or from the ground. Important factors to 
consider include, but may not be limited to: 
· Availability of equipment and personnel properly trained in its use (whether in-house or 
through contractors) 
· Number and types of potential safety hazards (e.g., radio transmission towers or low-
hanging power lines) 
· Public perceptions and acceptance of different treatment methods 
· Relative costs involved 
· Size of the proposed treatment block 
· Type of terrain within the block 
Outreach needs should also be discussed. During preliminary outreach discussions, consider all 
the factors mentioned above and any additional concerns that would need to be addressed, such 
as any non-English-speaking demographic groups in the area. 
Cooperator Involvement 
Cooperators are the entities necessary for planning and executing an eradication treatment. 
Cooperators are not always State, Federal, or Tribal government agencies. Cooperator roles may 
include developing budgets and securing funding, conducting environmental reviews, assisting 
with outreach, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and performing treatment

 in the area. 
Cooperator Involvement 
Cooperators are the entities necessary for planning and executing an eradication treatment. 
Cooperators are not always State, Federal, or Tribal government agencies. Cooperator roles may 
include developing budgets and securing funding, conducting environmental reviews, assisting 
with outreach, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and performing treatment 
operations. Relationships with some cooperators may already exist, however, it is likely that new 
cooperators will need to be identified and engaged as well. Some examples of other cooperator 
partnerships are Tribes that may be affected by the treatment, public agencies owning land within 
the treatment area, and organizations positioned to conduct outreach to unique demographic 
groups (e.g., homeless and foreign-language populations). If pesticide use is anticipated, 
engaging State and/or local health agencies is vital. 
Mapping 
Accurate maps are required to properly plan and conduct an eradication treatment. Needed maps 
will include:

External Plan Review 
Once the workplan for an eradication treatment has been drafted, having that plan reviewed by 
an external group of people familiar with spongy moth eradication activities may be beneficial. 
This external review may not be formal or a matter of record, however, this review process can 
provide suggestions for plan improvements, be used to bolster public support and acceptance of 
the plan and assist in defending any possible legal challenges. 
Preliminary Proposal 
A preliminary eradication proposal should be ready for announcement by mid-autumn or early 
winter. This announcement should include a statement of findings (e.g., trapping results), the 
need for action, a preferred alternative under the spongy moth 1996 Final Environmental Impact 
Statement FEIS and 2012 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS), a map of the 
proposed eradication site(s), and likely timing. One should bear in mind that all proposals are 
preliminary or draft until a decision document such as a Finding of No Significant Impact 
(FONSI) has been signed. 
Outreach and Stakeholder Interaction 
Public support for any eradication project is vital. Use outreach as an opportunity to educate, 
inform, and build trust and cooperation with affected stakeholders. 
A well thought out outreach and communication plan is an important component of any 
eradication project. An inadequate outreach and communication plan may lead to confusion and 
speculation among stakeholders resulting in a lack of public support and cooperation for the 
project. Program partners involved in planning and implementing the eradication project should

Outreach efforts (refer to Public Outreach) should be an integral part of the spongy moth 
eradication project and be initiated during the early stages of the planning process. 
Federal Financial Assistance 
Once a preliminary proposal has been developed, adequate funding for the proposed treatment 
must be secured. The preliminary proposal can serve as the basis for the development of a 
workplan and financial plan for the proposed treatment. The workplan and financial plan must

The workplan should also describe the work to be done, the project partners involved, and the 
expected results and benefits. The financial plan must detail the expenses that will be incurred 
and any State cost-share contributions. Once the workplan and accompanying financial plan have 
been drafted they should be submitted to the State Plant Health Director (SPHD) for the State in 
question or, if the treatment block is larger than 640 acres, to the appropriate FS official for 
review and obligation of the corresponding Federal funds. This process often takes several weeks 
to several months and is contingent on the availability of Federal funds.

review and obligation of the corresponding Federal funds. This process often takes several weeks 
to several months and is contingent on the availability of Federal funds. 
Environmental Review 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
All Federally proposed spongy moth eradication activities or those proposed in cooperation with 
a Federal agency must comply with NEPA. NEPA, enacted in 1970, requires Federal agencies to 
assess the environmental impacts of their proposed actions prior to making a final decision on 
their implementation. APHIS’s Spongy Moth Program uses Final and Supplemental 
Environmental Impact Statements (FEIS and FSEIS) and Environmental Assessments (EA) to 
meet NEPA requirements. 
Final and Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement 
In 1995, the USDA issued the FEIS, “Gypsy Moth Management in the United States: a 
cooperative approach,” which describes and evaluates methods of spongy moth control available 
for use in USDA cooperative eradication programs. In 2012, the USDA issued a FSEIS 
supplement to the 1995 edition, “Gypsy moth management in the United States: a cooperative 
approach: final supplemental environmental impact statement.” The 2012 FSEIS included the 
evaluation of additional spongy moth treatments not included in the 1995 FEIS. 
Environmental Assessment 
The EA provides the basic background information necessary for site-specific analysis of the 
potential environmental effects resulting from the proposed spongy moth eradication project. The 
EA, sometimes prepared by the State cooperator and other times prepared by APHIS, should 
include: 
· Environmental impacts of the proposed action

include: 
· Environmental impacts of the proposed action 
· Listing of the agencies and persons consulted 
· Need for the proposed eradication 
· Treatment alternatives 
Preparing the EA must be tiered (linked) to the FEIS and the FSEIS in accordance with the 
Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (40 CFR 1502.20 and 40 CFR 1508). Upon completion, the EA 
copies are made available for public comment by posting notices in local news outlets and copies 
at libraries and agency websites. A 30-day comment period is typical. For more detailed 
guidelines on preparing the EA, refer to Environmental Assessment.

Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) 
After reviewing the completed EA and the public comments, if APHIS determines the proposed 
actions will not have a significant environmental impact, the agency will issue a FONSI (refer to 
Finding of No Significant Impact). 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Section 7 
ESA requires all actions proposed by Federal agencies and their cooperators to protect and 
conserve listed endangered and threatened species. Section 7 of the ESA titled “Interagency 
Cooperation” directs Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) 
and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for any actions that may affect listed species.

Cooperation” directs Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) 
and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for any actions that may affect listed species. 
The results of the consultation should be included in a section of the EA. 
Informal Consultation 
During early stages of the eradication treatment planning process, the lead Federal agency or 
cooperator requests an informal consultation with USFWS and NMFS to determine if any listed 
species may occur within the proposed treatment area and what effects the proposed actions may 
have on those species. The request for interagency consultation should begin sometime in 
November or early December of the year prior to the proposed treatments. If, during the 
consultation, it is determined that the proposed actions are “not likely to affect” listed species, 
the consultation is concluded, and the proposal is allowed to move forward. A letter of 
concurrence from USFWS and NMFS is not required. However, if it is determined that the 
proposed treatments “may affect” a listed species, a written biological assessment (BA) or 
biological evaluation (BE) will be required to help make a final determination on the effects of 
the proposed actions. 
Biological Assessment or Biological Evaluation 
A BA or BE is a written analysis documenting the agencies’ conclusions on the effects of the 
proposed treatments. For the purposes of the discussion on spongy moth eradication, the BA and 
BE will be treated as one. Section 7 requires the BA to make one of three determinations:

If the findings of the BA conclude the proposed actions “may effect, but not likely to adversely 
affect,” a letter of concurrence from USWFS and NMFS to document compliance with Section 7 
is required before moving forward with the proposed treatment. 
Section 7 Formal Consultation 
If the BA concludes the proposed eradication treatment “may affect and is likely to adversely 
affect” listed species, the proposing agency must request a formal consultation with USFW 
and/or NMFS to determine if the proposed action will jeopardize the continued existence of a 
listed species. Upon completion of the formal consultation, USFW/NMFS will issue a written 
opinion.

NPDES states: the NPDES permitting program regulates discharges from pesticide applications 
consistent with section 402 of the CWA. Point source discharges of biological pesticides and 
chemical pesticides that leave a residue into waters of the United States are required to comply 
with NPDES requirements. EPA and the States issue Pesticide General Permits to offer coverage 
for pesticide operators. Activities not eligible for coverage under the Pesticide General Permit 
may be eligible for coverage under an individual permit. 
State-Level Equivalent Laws and Regulations 
Eradication treatment project coordinators are responsible for compliance with State-level 
environmental laws and regulations. For a list of environmental regulatory agencies for U.S. 
States and territories, refer to Health and Environmental Agencies of U.S. States and Territories. 
NOTICE 
Failure to comply with the FEIS, FSEIS, NEPA, ESA, CWA, or any other State and Federal 
regulations may result in an injunction or lawsuit. 
Operation Implementation 
Safety 
At the onset of the proposed eradication project, the project leader must designate a safety officer 
or take on the role themselves. A safety plan is necessary and can be modeled via online 
resources if one is already available. Fundamentals of a safety plan include: 
· Accident reporting structure 
· Locating emergency medical resources 
· Preparedness measures linked to preventing accidents 
Operational Checklists 
With a safety plan as the first checklist item, divide the checklist into before treatment, during 
treatment, and after treatment sections. The checklist should consider all possible elements of the

Legal 
Every aspect of a treatment operation may be challenged in court. The project leader should 
involve their organization’s legal representative from the beginning of the process. Bear in mind, 
public disclosure laws vary across States and all communications may be subject to public 
disclosure. 
Bids for Contracted Treatments 
Treatments are usually performed by a third-party contractor. The lead agency must create the 
contact specifications for the treatment contract and work with their contracting officer to solicit 
bids. Contract elements should include, but are not limited to: 
· Application equipment 
· Application rates 
· Product to be applied 
· Size and boundaries of the area to be treated 
· Specialized navigational capabilities 
The bid solicitation and contracting process can take considerable time and much of it may be 
outside of the contracting agency’s control.

Security 
Ensuring the safety and security of the public and program personnel is critical at every step of 
the process—from open house/public meeting events to staging areas (airports, helipads), to 
treatment areas (neighborhood streets) themselves. Private security or deputized law enforcement 
officers may be used at key areas to protect both program personnel and the public. Local law 
enforcement should be notified operations are planned before every treatment, whether ground or 
aerial. The Federal Aviation Association (FAA) should be notified when aerial treatments are 
planned. Drone aircraft are a potential threat to flight operations and appropriate precautions 
should be taken.

 both program personnel and the public. Local law 
enforcement should be notified operations are planned before every treatment, whether ground or 
aerial. The Federal Aviation Association (FAA) should be notified when aerial treatments are 
planned. Drone aircraft are a potential threat to flight operations and appropriate precautions 
should be taken. 
Other Considerations 
Every eradication treatment project is unique and there may be other project elements that also 
require planning and execution, such as State-level emergency declarations to conduct aerial 
spraying to Federal permits for flying near bald eagle nests. This may also include budgeting for 
legal costs for possible legal challenges. 
Operations 
Some of the planning and preparation steps described above will move into the implementation 
or operational phase while other steps are still in process. For example, public engagement 
activities often begin shortly after the determining the need for an eradication treatment and prior 
to completing the needed environmental documentation. Ultimately, these planning and 
preparation steps lead to the actual application of the chosen treatment product. Timing of the 
treatment application(s) is dependent on several factors, primarily the phenology of the insect 
and the life stage a given treatment product target. 
After Action Reviews 
To assess what went well and what can be improved upon in the future, operations should be 
reviewed following each eradication treatment and at the end of the treatment period. After 
Action Reviews (AAR) typically begin with a brief description of the actions taken or responses 
being reviewed. It should include the intent of the review and what benefits it can provide in 
improving future processes and outcomes. AARs can be conducted electronically or in the 
traditional paper format. An example of an AAR can be found in Appendix K.

traditional paper format. An example of an AAR can be found in Appendix K. 
Post-Treatment Delimiting 
After treatments have been applied it is critical to monitor the success (or failure) of an 
eradication treatment by setting a delimiting array of traps at and around the treatment site during 
the year the treatment was applied and for no fewer than 2 additional years. Delimiting surveys 
should continue until three consecutive years with no trap catches or other signs of a lingering

Submitting Suspected Spongy Moth for Molecular Diagnostics 
Submit specimens suspected of being spongy moth, Lymantria dispar, to the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine (PPQ), Science and Technology (S&T), Forest Pest Methods Laboratory (FPML, 
formerly known as the Otis Pest Survey, Detection, and Exclusion Laboratory) for molecular 
diagnostics. 
All specimens collected o utside the Federal quarantine or at a port of entry and a subsample of 
specimens collected inside the quarantine are analyzed. Send each trap submitted to the 
laboratory, regardless of quarantine status, with PPQ Form 391 (refer to Figure C-1).

Alternatively, if sending a large quantity (>10) of specimens, send an Excel file reflecting the 
fields listed in Figure C-2 to submitting an individual form. Submit forms and tracking 
information via email. 
Submission Deadline 
Traps should be submitted as soon as collected. Samples collected from inside the quarantine are 
accepted for analysis until November 30th of each survey year. 
DNA degrades quickly when exposed to ambient conditions, therefore, it is critical for samples 
to be collected regularly, stored in a freezer, and submitted for diagnostics as soon as possible. 
Otherwise, specimen condition can be negatively impacted leading to diagnostic assay failure 
and the inability to identify specimens. 
Prompt submission is also essential to ensure participating States receive survey results promptly 
and to ensure no delays in generating the Lymantria dispar Risk Model.

Spongy Moth Molecular Diagnostics 
Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay 
Real-time PCR is an advanced technique monitoring the amplification of a target DNA molecule 
during the DNA replication process. A probe binds to the target CNA and emits a fluorescence 
captured by a sensor on the real-time PCR machine. In other words, if the target DNA sequence 
is present, the sensor will detect more light as more DNA copies are replicated. The high 
sensitivity of real-time PCR may enable detection of a target organism in the presence of only a 
few DNA copies. The terms “real-time PCR” and “qPCR” are interchangeable. 
Lymantria dispar asiatica, Lymantria dispar japonica, and Lymantria umbrosa are members of 
the flighted spongy moth complex (FSMC) and are of regulatory concern and cannot reliably be 
distinguished morphologically from Lymantria dispar dispar. Two real-time PCR assays are used 
to distinguish these four targets on a genetic level: 
· Standard Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay 
· Its simplified version, Dual-Probe Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay.

are referred to as: 
· AGM 
· Ldaj 
· Lda 
· Ldd 
The combined results from the four subassays allow identification of the four target moths 
because each target is characterized by a different amplification plot (refer to Table C-2 and 
Figure C-3), which summarizes positive (S-sh aped curve) and negative (flat line) subassay 
results. A specimen that does not generate a positive amplification or generates an amplification

Unlike the standard version, the dual-probe assay detects Lymantria dispar asiatica, Lymantria 
dispar japonica, and Lymantria umbrosa from the background of Lymantria dispar. It does not 
distinguish between the former three targets. The dual-probe assay is specifically designed for

FSMC, the dual-probe assay can screen samples more efficiently than the standard assay. 
Samples with positive results for the AGM subassay are subsequently analyzed by the Standard 
Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assay for subspecies identification. Samples of 
regulatory significance (e.g., port interceptions) are directly processed with the standard assay.

Secondary Analysis of Significant Regulatory Samples 
Specimens of regulatory significance that fail the real-time PCR assays can be analyzed using 
DNA barcoding. Specimens received from inside the quarantine that fail the assay will not be 
DNA barcoded, except upon direct request. The processing timeline for DNA barcoding is 
dependent on the turnaround time of the sequencing company but can typically be expected in 
one to three weeks. If DNA barcoding fails, the specimen may be reextracted and reprocessed, 
which will take an additional one

one to three weeks. If DNA barcoding fails, the specimen may be reextracted and reprocessed, 
which will take an additional one to three weeks. 
DNA Barcoding 
DNA barcoding uses the mitochondrial COI gene to distinguish different species. The technique 
relies on obtaining the unknown specimen’s COI sequence and comparing it to sequences of 
voucher species deposited in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD). 
Because the Real-Time PCR Spongy Moth Diagnostic Assays detect spongy moth (provided the 
DNA quality is sufficient), there are three potential DNA barcoding outcomes: 
· Species- or genus-level identification of a non-spongy moth specimen. 
· Inconclusive identification resulting from the specimen failing to match any known 
reference DNA barcode. 
· Unknown identity due to DNA sequencing failure.

Results are reported in accordance with the established timelines based on specimen origin and

Environmental Assessment 
The Environmental Assessment (EA) on the spongy moth should be linked to the detailed Final 
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). This allows the reader to refer to the FEIS as needed 
and allows USDA–APHIS–PPQ to cite the FEIS instead of repeating information and data 
contained within the FEIS. 
The EA must describe the potential effects of the eradication program on human health and the 
environment on a site-specific basis. In general, the document includes why the proposed action 
is needed, the alternatives to the proposed action, and the environmental effects of the proposed 
action and its alternative. The site-specific EA should be as concise as possible, but still contain 
all the information necessary for the responsible official to make an informed decision. 
For recent EAs and Findings of No Significant Impact (FONSIs), which may be used as 
examples in developing these documents, refer to Spongy Moth Programs Environmental 
Assessments. 
The following section provides an outline of information and analyses that may be included in an 
EA. This format is a suggestion based on the structure of recent EAs and may be modified if a 
different structure is preferred or better suits the proposed treatment program.

Decisions To Be Made 
1. Briefly discuss the interaction of the USDA and State, and the responsibilities of each. 
2. Specific decisions are: 
A. Should there be a cooperative treatment program, and if so, what type? 
B. Is the proposed action likely to have any significant impacts requiring further 
analysis in an EIS if treatments occur? 
Responsible Officials 
· Supervisory official (and contact information) for USDA–APHIS–PPQ 
· Supervisory official (and contact information) for the State 
Alternatives

Responsible Officials 
· Supervisory official (and contact information) for USDA–APHIS–PPQ 
· Supervisory official (and contact information) for the State 
Alternatives 
Briefly describe the proposed alternative in the introduction to this chapter. 
No Action 
1. No Action alternative is the alternative that continues the present course of action. 
2. No Action means USDA–APHIS–PPQ would not cooperate with the State in the proposed 
treatment program. 
3. Briefly discuss why this is not the preferred alternative (e.g., spongy moth populations and 
defoliation will increase). 
Proposed Alternative 
1. Proposed Alternative (sometimes called the “Preferred Alternative”) is the alternative 
USDA–APHIS–PPQ determines best meets the purpose and need; e.g., best eradicates 
spongy moth in the treatment area. 
2. Describe the proposed treatment alternative and mention USDA–APHIS– PPQ will 
cooperate with the State to accomplish it. 
Affected Environment 
Briefly describe the site-specific environment based on the terminology of the spongy moth 
FEIS. This chapter typically contains sections described immediately below. 
Natural Resources 
Briefly describe the physical location of the proposed treatment, including the land type, soils, 
water, and air resources (e.g., if the treatment block is near a watershed, near agricultural land, or 
soils do not drain well).

Guidelines for Environmental Documents 
Environmental Assessment 
9/26/24 Spongy Moth Program Manual E-5 
Biological Resources 
Briefly describe the biological organisms in the proposed treatment block, including any 
sensitive plants and animals. Include a description of any threatened or endangered plants and 
animals. Mention any organisms likely to be nontarget species of the treatment— i.e., any plants 
or animals that might potentially be affected by the proposed treatment. For spongy moth, that 
might include any lepidopteran larvae undergoing larval development at the time of the proposed 
treatment, particularly if they are threatened or endangered. 
Human Health and Safety 
Briefly discuss the demographics of the area in and near the treatment block: 
· Are there any Federal, State, or tribal lands located inside the treatment block? 
· Are there any schools, hospitals, parks, or other places where people might gather? 
· At the time of treatment, is there potential for people to be physically exposed? 
· How many people reside there? 
· Is the area residential or is there some industrial development? 
Environmental Consequences 
· Mention that both alternatives may have potential environmental consequences 
· Potential environmental consequences will determine whether the proposed alternative will 
be selected; prepare this section with careful analysis 
No Action 
Discuss the potential environmental consequences if the No Action Alternative is selected (i.e., if 
the proposed treatment does not take place). Depending on the situation, this might include an 
increase in spongy moth population in the treatment block, an increase in tree defoliation in the 
treatment block, and the loss of recreational resources

 careful analysis 
No Action 
Discuss the potential environmental consequences if the No Action Alternative is selected (i.e., if 
the proposed treatment does not take place). Depending on the situation, this might include an 
increase in spongy moth population in the treatment block, an increase in tree defoliation in the 
treatment block, and the loss of recreational resources, such as camping and hiking sites. 
Proposed Action 
Discuss the potential environmental consequences if the proposed treatment does take place. 
Depending on the situation, this might include protecting recreational wooded areas, pesticide 
drift, pesticide residues in bodies of water, and potentially exposed immunologically sensitive 
individuals. 
Other Issues 
Cumulative Impacts 
Cumulative impacts refers to an aggregate of impacts to human health and the environment over 
time, and include reasonably foreseeable future actions. These may include impacts from 
previous spongy moth management actions, pesticide impacts from other non-spongy moth 
programs, and impacts to the local environment from other actions that incrementally increase 
the impact of any program actions.

Threatened and Endangered Species 
· Are there any listed threatened and endangered species or designated critical habitat within 
the treatment block? If so, cite them. If there are no threatened and endangered species or 
designated critical habitat, indicate there are none. 
· If there are threatened or endangered species within the treatment block, USDA–APHIS 
generally prepares a Biological Assessment (BA) analyzing the potential jeopardy to the 
species that might be posed by the proposed treatment. Consult ERAS at Riverdale, MD, 
for assistance with preparing a BA. When completed, submit the BA

for assistance with preparing a BA. When completed, submit the BA to the U.S. Fish & 
Wildlife Service (USFWS) for concurrence or denial. 
Historical Preservation 
Are there any historic properties in or near the treatment block? If so, provide the number of 
properties and any potential effect of the proposed treatment on them. If there are no historic 
properties, indicate there are none. This generally requires consultation with the State historic 
preservation office. 
Executive Orders 
· 12898: Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and 
Low-Income Populations 
o Are there any minority and/or low-income populations living inside the treatment 
area? If so, what are the potential effects of the proposed treatment program on 
them? Are the potential impacts to these populations disproportionately greater than 
those potential impacts to the general population? Potential issues might include 
access to media sources announcing the proposed treatment or ethnic populations 
for whom English is not their first language. Cite any standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) or mitigations reducing these potential effects. 
· 13045: Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks 
o Does the proposed treatment pose a potential risk to environmental health and 
safety of the children living in the treatment area? Are the potential impacts to 
children living in the treatment area disproportionately higher than the impacts to 
other subgroups of the population living in this area? E.g., consider the location of

Finding of No Significant Impact 
The purpose of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is to provide a concise statement 
indicating the proposed action will not have a significant effect on human health or the 
environment. To justify the finding, a FONSI cites analyses in the EA and analyses incorporated 
from the associated programmatic EIS by reference. The FONSI is essentially a one- to two-page 
summary of the EA results. 
Contents of a spongy moth eradication program FONSI include the 
following: 
1. Treatment block location 
2. Estimated date of treatment 
3. Treatment block size 
4. Proposed treatment alternative

Procedure for Composting Bark in a Trench 
Step 1: Start a compost pile 
Start a compost pile of at least 200 cubic yards in one end of a trench. 
NOTICE 
1. The material on the outer side of the compost pile must be free of both eggs that could hatch and 
larvae. 
2. The compost pile must be as far away from host material as possible. 
Step 2: Leave compost pile undisturbed 
Allow the compost pile to remain undisturbed until the temperature reaches 120 °F (49 °C) for at 
least four continuous days. In situations in which 120 °F (49 °C) cannot be maintained for at 
least four continuous days, the compost pile shall remain undisturbed until the temperature 
reaches 100 °F (37.8 °C) for at least six continuous days. 
Step 3: Remove compost pile’s outer layer 
Using a front-end loader or a bulldozer, remove the outer layer of the compost pile to a depth of 
three feet. 
Step 4: Start a second compost pile 
Down the trench, start a second compost pile using the recently removed cover material as a 
core. 
Step 5: Move the core material

Move the core material from the first compost pile and place on the second compost pile as a 
cover at least three feet deep (leave some composted material to serve as “inoculum” for 
subsequent piles). 
Step 6: Leave second compost pile undisturbed 
Allow the second compost pile to remain undisturbed until the temperature reaches 120 °F (49 
°C) for at least four continuous days. In situations in which 120 °F (49 °C) cannot be maintained 
for at least four continuous days, the second compost pile shall remain undisturbed until the 
temperature reaches 100 °F (37.8 °C) for at least six continuous days. 
Step 7: Remove second compost pile 
Remove the second compost pile and use as fully composted material. 
Step 8: Repeat procedure 
This procedure will allow continuous operation. After the first compost pile is “turned” to

Executive Summary 
The Spongy Moth Program has adopted a standard-based approach to processing requirements 
for regulated logs moving to receiving mills or other facilities outside the quarantine area. The 
standard requires the number of moths caught in traps at each receiving mill or facility be 
statistically similar to trap catch numbers in the surrounding area. Spongy moth population levels 
at and around each regulated facility are monitored on an annual basis through a statistical 
analysis of each year’s trapping data. Should this analysis indicate elevated trap catch numbers

have occurred at a particular mill, a series of recommended remedial actions designed to bring 
the facility back into conformance with the standard has been developed. 
Background 
APHIS’s Spongy Moth Program has adopted a standard-based approach for how logs moving 
interstate from quarantine areas to processing facilities outside the quarantine area are regulated. 
Historically, moving logs was subject to a series of Federal requirements, including moving 
under an Accurate Statement or Limited Permit and certain processing conditions at the 
processing facility. Movement requirements are found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
(7 CFR

 for how logs moving 
interstate from quarantine areas to processing facilities outside the quarantine area are regulated. 
Historically, moving logs was subject to a series of Federal requirements, including moving 
under an Accurate Statement or Limited Permit and certain processing conditions at the 
processing facility. Movement requirements are found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
(7 CFR 301.45-4), while processing requirements were housed in the APHIS Spongy Moth 
Program Manual. However, over time, State to State variances in processing conditions arose 
and industry practices changed. An analysis of numbers of spongy moths caught in traps near 
regulated mills outside the quarantine area indicates moving logs from the quarantine area to 
primary processing facilities does not typically result in elevated spongy moth population levels 
in the vicinity of those facilities. Adopting this standard-based approach accommodates these 
changes and is in keeping with Executive Orders to minimize regulatory burdens on the public 
while still maintaining high levels of protection to America’s agricultural and natural resources. 
Under this standard-based approach, spongy moth population levels are m onitored at receiving 
mills and other facilities and compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. 
Each year, population levels in the immediate vicinity of the facilities receiving regulated logs 
are compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. The standard APHIS has 
adopted requires population levels in the immediate vicinity of each mill not be statistically 
elevated when compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. APHIS continues 
to require that log movement occur under a properly issued Limited Permit or Accurate 
Statement. Receiving mills and other facilities and their suppliers must enter into Federal 
compliance agreements (CA) for log movement. Each State determines appropriate requirements 
for processing regulated logs once they are at

elevated when compared to population levels in the surrounding environment. APHIS continues 
to require that log movement occur under a properly issued Limited Permit or Accurate 
Statement. Receiving mills and other facilities and their suppliers must enter into Federal 
compliance agreements (CA) for log movement. Each State determines appropriate requirements 
for processing regulated logs once they are at the processing facility and enters into State CAs 
with receiving facilities detailing those requirements and any other applicable conditions deemed 
necessary. 
Beginning in June 2014 an interagency working group convened to develop specific 
recommendations on the steps and actions necessary to implement the standard-based approach 
to regulating logs moving from the quarantine area to mills and other receiving facilities for 
processing. 
This document details the working group’s findings. Working group members included 
representatives from the major stakeholder groups that would be affected, including the National 
Plant Board (NPB), the U.S. Forest Service ( FS), the Spongy Moth Slow the Spread (STS) 
Foundation, and AP HIS .

Specific Policies and Protocols 
Federal Regulatory Actions 
APHIS’s spongy moth regulations serve as the foundational policy guidance for program 
activities. These regulations can be found in 7 CFR 301.45. Of particular relevance to this 
document are the regulations governing “Conditions of Movement of Regulated Articles” (7 
CFR 301.45-4). This section of the Federal spongy moth regulations contains only one 
requirement for moving logs out of the quarantine area—they must move

activities. These regulations can be found in 7 CFR 301.45. Of particular relevance to this 
document are the regulations governing “Conditions of Movement of Regulated Articles” (7 
CFR 301.45-4). This section of the Federal spongy moth regulations contains only one 
requirement for moving logs out of the quarantine area—they must move under a properly 
issued certificate or Limited Permit. Alternatively, the logs can move under an Accurate 
Statement after being inspected by trained personnel operating under a CA and found to be free 
of spongy moth life stages. This requirement is retained in the standard-based approach. 
Survey Protocols 
The standard-based approach to regulating logs is rooted in spongy moth traps being calibrated 
to pest population levels in the vicinity of a trap. For the standard-based approach to work, traps 
must be placed at and in the area surrounding primary processing facilities receiving regulated 
logs. In areas where significant levels of trapping already occur, set two traps at the facility 
itself—standard trapping densities are sufficient to monitor moth population  levels in the 
surrounding area. In areas where trapping densities are low, set two traps at the regulated facility, 
along with a small number of additional traps in the surrounding area to serve as a basis for 
comparison of population levels at the mill and in the surrounding environment. 
· For mills in areas covered by STS or State survey (areas with a ba ckground spongy moth 
population) follow current trapping protocols and densities 
· I dentify all  mills receiving regulated logs 
· Place two (or more) traps in host material at the perimeter of each regulated mill 
· Place four to ten traps around mills in areas with no known background spongy moth 
population

· I dentify all  mills receiving regulated logs 
· Place two (or more) traps in host material at the perimeter of each regulated mill 
· Place four to ten traps around mills in areas with no known background spongy moth

o Do not place traps closer than two kilometers from each mill 
o Trap array should extend out ten kilometers from each mill 
Data Capture and Management 
Properly capturing the outcomes from the survey effort is instrumental to performing an analysis 
of trap catch numbers at regulated primary processing facilities. 
· All trap catch data is entered into either Integrated Plant Health Information System 
(IPHIS) or the STS database 
· All trap placement data is entered into either IPHIS or the STS database 
· Appropriate existing notations within national spongy moth survey and STS survey data 
capture protocols should be used to designate traps placed at regulated mill sites

Data Analysis 
To determine a receiving primary processor is in conformance with standard of not exhibiting 
elevated population levels at the mill site, an annual, transparent, and robust analysis of trap 
catch numbers is necessary. A space-time cluster technique developed by PPQ’s Science and 
Technology (S&T) makes maximum use of existing trapping protocols while allowing each 
mill’s performance to be individually examined. 
· Description of the analytic technique is provided in each year’s report and in Description

· Description of the analytic technique is provided in each year’s report and in Description

· Each regulated mill site is analyzed separately using the space-time cluster technique 
o If two or more mills are in very close proximity to one another, they are combined 
into a single “mill feature” for the analysis 
· APHIS analyzes trap catch data annually (each winter) 
Compliance Agreements 
As noted in the Background section of this document, State-to-S tate variation exists in 
processing requirements for regulated logs. This variety of requirements is reflected in the 
current inventory of compliance agreements (CAs) held by the Spongy Moth Program. Under the 
standard-based approach, Federal CAs contain standard language relating to moving logs out of 
the quarantine area. Individual States remain free to establish or maintain processing 
requirements for those logs once they arrive at the mill site. State requirements for processing are 
detailed in a State-issued CA or in a clearly delineated section of a joint State-Federal CA. 
· F ederal CAs are limited to the continued need for a Limited Permit or Accurate Statement 
for interstate movement out of the quarantine area along with associated site and 
paperwork access requirements 
· Joint CAs may be issued, but activities governed under Federal authority (first bullet in this 
list) should be clearly delineated from those regulated under State authority (third bullet in 
this list) 
· State CAs stipulate what processing requirements are necessary at receiving mills (e.g

 of the quarantine area along with associated site and 
paperwork access requirements 
· Joint CAs may be issued, but activities governed under Federal authority (first bullet in this 
list) should be clearly delineated from those regulated under State authority (third bullet in 
this list) 
· State CAs stipulate what processing requirements are necessary at receiving mills (e.g., 
processing times, duration of high-risk period, distance from surrounding host vegetation) 
along with associated site and paperwork access requirements 
Costs 
Mills found to be out of conformance with the standard bears the costs associated with any 
necessary remedial actions. 
Recommended Remedial Actions 
In anticipation of the occasional instance in which a given primary processor is found to be 
exhibiting statistically significant higher trap catch numbers at the mill when compared to trap 
catch numbers from the surrounding area, and thus, out of conformance with the standard, 
provide a list of remedial actions to bring the mill back into conformance. There may be 
instances in which nonconformant trap catch numbers are not the result of the mill’s activities;

For this reason, it is strongly recommended that any follow-up actions begin with a visit to the 
nonconformant mill and identify any contributing factors. Additional remedial actions are 
predicated on the findings from that initial mill visit. Specific remedial actions are determined by 
the State in which that mill is located, in consultation with APHIS and mill management.

D. Increasing the frequency of compliance monitoring visits 
E. Requiring the mill to pay for eradication, treatment, or increased trapping costs (in 
States where authorities exist to do so) 
F. Offering (or requiring) recertification or other appropriate training to mill personnel 
and the mill’s loggers 
G. Installing a barrier to spongy moth movement between the mill premises and 
surrounding host vegetation

Description of Space-Time Cluster Analysis 
Basis for Statistical Analysis 
Anselin’s Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA), a measure of spatial autocorrelation, is 
used to identify “hot spot” clusters of trap counts compared to the background population, or 
average trap count. It also detects spatial outliers, which is useful in identifying a single trap with 
catch surrounded by traps with zero catches (which may be indicative of a new introduction).

average trap count. It also detects spatial outliers, which is useful in identifying a single trap with 
catch surrounded by traps with zero catches (which may be indicative of a new introduction). 
Procedure 
Sawmills are buffered by two kilometers, which represents their immediate environs affected by 
a pathways introduction of spongy moth via regulated lumber transport and processing. The 
background population is evaluated over a 24-kilometer buffer around the mill, which also 
defines the extent of the LISA analysis. Trap counts that intersect treatment areas are removed 
from the analysis. A moving window analysis of ten years of trap catch data within the environs 
area for each mill utilizes a four-kilometer, two-year space-time window. Multiple testing over x 
trap locations inflates significance testing, therefore, a false discovery rate is applied. Clusters 
are further analyzed to ensure they are “spatially distinct” and separated by a sufficient distance 
from other clusters of matching years outside the mill’s immediate environs. This ensures the
