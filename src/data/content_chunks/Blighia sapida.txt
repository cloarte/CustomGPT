 Reproduccion: The chromosome number of B. sapida is 2n=32 ( Sarkar et al., 1982 ). A preliminary study testing 12 microsatellite markers developed in Litchi , reported a higher number of alleles and higher heterozygosity in natural stands in Benin compared to planted stands ( Ekué et al., 2009 ). The whitish, fragrant flowers of B. sapida are bee-pollinated. They are also visited by Polistes wasps but these are not as efficient pollinators as the honeybees ( Free and Williams, 1976 ). In Benin, bees of the genera Dactylurina and Braunsapis have been also recorded visiting the flowers ( Pauly et al., 2009 ). Only around 4-5.6% of hermaphroditic flowers develop into fruits and 44% of fruit mature ( Janick and Paull,

 efficient pollinators as the honeybees ( Free and Williams, 1976 ). In Benin, bees of the genera Dactylurina and Braunsapis have been also recorded visiting the flowers ( Pauly et al., 2009 ). Only around 4-5.6% of hermaphroditic flowers develop into fruits and 44% of fruit mature ( Janick and Paull, 2008 ; PROTA, 2019 ). Fruit development takes 50-60 days from fruit set to open capsule stage (70-150 g final weight), with fruit doubling in size during the first 14-21 days. Fruit shed is particularly high up to 21 days, and adverse weather can cause total loss. Blighia sapida propagates relatively easily by seeds. The seeds are recalcitrant (short-lived) and it is recommended they are planted within a few days of collection. Germination percentage is reduced significantly with storage time. Seeds stored for seven days have a germination percentage of 33.3% while seeds stored for 14 days have only 3.3% ( Olayode and Osuji, 2016 ). Germination starts after 2-3 weeks ( Olayode and Osuji, 2016 ; PROTA, 2019 ) but may take up to two or three months ( Crane et al., 2008 ). The trees start producing flowers and fruits at about three to six years ( Crane et al., 2008 ). Cuttings are effective as a means of vegetative propagation and quickly produce roots if planted under the right conditions. Grafting and air layering have also been used as alternative methods to propagate this species ( PROTA, 2019 ). In a study to determine the effect of the rooting hormone indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on the air layering propagation, the highest rooting success was obtained with 3500 ppm IBA ( Maurya et al., 2013 ).

In a study to determine the effect of the rooting hormone indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on the air layering propagation, the highest rooting success was obtained with 3500 ppm IBA ( Maurya et al., 2013 ). In Jamaica, Cuba, Florida, and perhaps other tropical locations, B. sapida flowers and fruits twice a year. Flowering occurs generally from March to June and from September to November. The heaviest crop is harvested during the summer. In some areas, the trees may produce flowers and fruits year-round ( Crane et al., 2008 , PROTA, 2019 ). In tropical regions flowering seems to be induced by a dry period where plants slow their vegetative growth, enabling the buds to develop into flowers. In subtropical areas, flowering may be stimulated by relatively low temperatures which also suppress vegetative growth ( Crane et al., 2008 ). Although not formally described, there are several forms or varieties of B. sapida that can be distinguished by the color and texture of the arils. The two more common are “butter” with soft and yellow arils, and “cheese” with hard and cream arils ( Crane et al., 2008 ; Iplantz, 2019 ). The latter is preferred in food preparation because does not disintegrate in cooking ( Rashford, 2001 ). Blighia sapida is a tropical/subtropical tree found from sea level to 900 m in Jamaica and Honduras and is regarded as a forest climax tree in West Africa. Its native range has annual lows of 17-25°C and annual highs of 26-35°C ( Iplantz, 2019 ). Mature trees are moderately cold tolerant and, if mature, may withstand brief periods at –3.3°C.

 West Africa. Its native range has annual lows of 17-25°C and annual highs of 26-35°C ( Iplantz, 2019 ). Mature trees are moderately cold tolerant and, if mature, may withstand brief periods at –3.3°C. Its native range has a  dry season of 2-7 months, but B. sapida can also grow well in subtropical frost-free areas and wetter climates with no dry season, but flowering and fruiting in these regions is often poor due to fungal attack ( Iplantz, 2019 ). Blighia sapida grows well on soils ranging from fertile to stony, but seems to flourish best on fertile, slightly alkaline, well-drained soils at elevations up to 600 m. It does well in sands and oolitic limestone ( Crane and Balerdi, 2011 ). It is drought tolerant, and can tolerate moderately windy areas. If pruned regularly to limit tree size and open the canopy to wind movement then B. sapida can withstand hurricane-force winds without toppling, but it is susceptible to defoliation and desiccation from high winds. The tree is not flood tolerant and may decline in waterlogged or poor draining soil ( Iplantz, 2019 ; PROTA, 2019 ). The tree thrives in places with 1500-2000 mm annual rainfall. It can withstand prolonged dry periods once established, but fruit production will be low. Trees usually flush after any extended period of rain.  With two main rainy seasons in the Caribbean, there are two distinct fruiting peaks: January–March and July–September. However, considerable variability occurs in time and extent of flowering between trees even at the same site. A period of regeneration seems necessary before flowering recurs on a particular branch. At each flowering, the proportion of hermaphrodite to male flowers varies ( Stair and Sidrak, 1992 ). B. sapida can flower throughout

A period of regeneration seems necessary before flowering recurs on a particular branch. At each flowering, the proportion of hermaphrodite to male flowers varies ( Stair and Sidrak, 1992 ). B. sapida can flower throughout the year and may produce three or more crops annually, with the heaviest bloom during spring. In Florida, flowering occurs in the spring and fruit in midsummer, although there may be a light flowering during the autumn and fruit during the winter. In subtropical areas, trees probably respond to wet–dry periods and cool temperatures, which also inhibit vegetative growth. The major flower-inducing trigger in the tropics is probably wet weather after a pronounced dry period. During the dry period the tree’s vegetative growth slows or stops, allowing the buds in the leaf axils to mature and form flowers. Subsequently, under natural conditions, the tree flowers when the rainy season begins. Ackee flowers are easily cross-pollinated. The main pollinators are insects, especially bees ( Suah, 1975 ) and the wind ( Paull and Duarte, 2012 ).

Fruit shed is particularly high up to 21 days, and adverse weather can cause total loss. Blighia sapida propagates relatively easily by seeds. The seeds are recalcitrant (short-lived) and it is recommended they are planted within a few days of collection. Germination percentage is reduced significantly with storage time. Seeds stored for seven days have a germination percentage of 33.3% while seeds stored for 14 days have only 3.3% ( Olayode and Osuji, 2016 ). Germination starts after 2-3 weeks ( Olayode and Osuji, 2016 ; PROTA, 2019 ) but may take up to two or three months ( Crane et al., 2008 ). The trees start producing flowers and fruits at about three to six years ( Crane et al., 2008 ). Cuttings are effective as a means of vegetative propagation and quickly produce roots if planted under the right conditions.

Cuttings are effective as a means of vegetative propagation and quickly produce roots if planted under the right conditions. Grafting and air layering have also been used as alternative methods to propagate this species ( PROTA, 2019 ). In a study to determine the effect of the rooting hormone indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on the air layering propagation, the highest rooting success was obtained with 3500 ppm IBA ( Maurya et al., 2013 ). Physiology and Phenology In Jamaica, Cuba, Florida, and perhaps other tropical locations, B. sapida flowers and fruits twice a year. Flowering occurs generally from March to June and from September to November. The heaviest crop is harvested during the summer. In some areas, the trees may produce flowers and fruits year-round ( Crane et al., 2008 , PROTA, 2019 ). In tropical regions flowering seems to be induced by a dry period where plants slow their vegetative growth, enabling the buds to develop into flowers. In subtropical areas, flowering may be stimulated by relatively low temperatures which also suppress vegetative growth ( Crane et al., 2008 ). Population Size and Structure Although not formally described, there are several forms or varieties of B. sapida that can be distinguished by the color and texture of the arils. The two more common are “butter” with soft and yellow arils, and “cheese” with hard and cream arils ( Crane et al., 2008 ; Iplantz, 2019 ). The latter is preferred in food preparation because does not disintegrate in cooking ( Rashford, 2001 ).

 yellow arils, and “cheese” with hard and cream arils ( Crane et al., 2008 ; Iplantz, 2019 ). The latter is preferred in food preparation because does not disintegrate in cooking ( Rashford, 2001 ). Environmental Requirements Blighia sapida is a tropical/subtropical tree found from sea level to 900 m in Jamaica and Honduras and is regarded as a forest climax tree in West Africa. Its native range has annual lows of 17-25°C and annual highs of 26-35°C ( Iplantz, 2019 ). Mature trees are moderately cold tolerant and, if mature, may withstand brief periods at –3.3°C. Its native range has a  dry season of 2-7 months, but B. sapida can also grow well in subtropical frost-free areas and wetter climates with no dry season, but flowering and fruiting in these regions is often poor due to fungal attack ( Iplantz, 2019 ). Blighia sapida grows well on soils ranging from fertile to stony, but seems to flourish best on fertile, slightly alkaline, well-drained soils at elevations up to 600 m. It does well in sands and oolitic limestone ( Crane and Balerdi, 2011 ). It is drought tolerant, and can tolerate moderately windy areas. If pruned regularly to limit tree size and open the canopy to wind movement then B. sapida can withstand hurricane-force winds without toppling, but it is susceptible to defoliation and desiccation from high winds. The tree is not flood tolerant and may decline in waterlogged or poor draining soil ( Iplantz, 2019 ; PROTA, 2019 ). The tree thrives in places with 1500-2000 mm annual rainfall. It can withstand prolonged dry periods once established, but fruit production will be low. Trees usually flush after any extended period of rain.  With two main rainy seasons in

 high winds. The tree is not flood tolerant and may decline in waterlogged or poor draining soil ( Iplantz, 2019 ; PROTA, 2019 ). The tree thrives in places with 1500-2000 mm annual rainfall. It can withstand prolonged dry periods once established, but fruit production will be low. Trees usually flush after any extended period of rain.  With two main rainy seasons in the Caribbean, there are two distinct fruiting peaks: January–March and July–September. However, considerable variability occurs in time and extent of flowering between trees even at the same site. A period of regeneration seems necessary before flowering recurs on a particular branch. At each flowering, the proportion of hermaphrodite to male flowers varies ( Stair and Sidrak, 1992 ). B. sapida can flower throughout the year and may produce three or more crops annually, with the heaviest bloom during spring. In Florida, flowering occurs in the spring and fruit in midsummer, although there may be a light flowering during the autumn and fruit during the winter. In subtropical areas, trees probably respond to wet–dry periods and cool temperatures, which also inhibit vegetative growth. The major flower-inducing trigger in the tropics is probably wet weather after a pronounced dry period. During the dry period the tree’s vegetative growth slows or stops, allowing the buds in the leaf axils to mature and form flowers. Subsequently, under natural conditions, the tree flowers when the rainy season begins. Ackee flowers are easily cross-pollinated. The main pollinators are insects, especially bees ( Suah, 1975 ) and the wind ( Paull and Duarte, 2012 ).
