Overview
Appearance
Crupina vulgaris
is a Federal Noxious Weed and is native to southern Europe. It is a winter annual that grows 1-4 ft. (0.3-1.2 m) tall.
Foliage
Leaves are entire to finely dissected (leaves become more divided towards the apex) and up to 6 in. (15.2 cm) long.
Crupina vulgaris
begins as a basal rosette and eventually develops alternating dissected leaves that are rough to the touch.
Flowers
Flowers are purple to pink, long, slender (vase-shaped) and bloom from May until soil moisture is depleted.
Fruit
It reproduces by seed.
Ecological Threat
Dense populations of this plant can invade grasslands, pastures, rangelands, forested areas, canyons, riparian areas, roadsides and waste places in the western United States. Grazing (deer or livestock) or cutting can stimulate lateral branching, thereby increasing flower and seed production.
