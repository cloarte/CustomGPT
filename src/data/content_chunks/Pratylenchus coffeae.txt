 Reproduccion: P. coffeae is a migratory endoparasite of the root cortex; also of the corms of banana, plantain and Musa textilis; tubers of yam and caladium; and rhizomes of ginger, cardamom and turmeric, where it feeds and multiplies. It causes lesions and is often associated with primary and secondary rot in the root cortex, corms, tubers and rhizomes.The developmental stages of P. coffeae infesting coffee in Java are as follows: the first moult takes place within the egg, three moults occur outside, and the eggs hatch in 6-8 days at 28-30°C.In Japan, adult P. coffeae appeared about 2 weeks after hatching in potato tubers; the average lifespan was about 27 days at 25-30°C ( Siddiqi, 1972 ).P. coffeae has a life cycle of 21-28 days in yam roots and tubers. It can survive in moist soil for up to 8 months in the absence of host plants ( Colbran, 1954 ).The optimum temperature for reproduction in citrus roots is 29.5°C (Radewald et al., 1971). P. coffeae reproduces and multiplies in stored yams and is disseminated in seed tubers. It can also be introduced into yam fields in the roots and tissues of other crops. The nematodes can survive

 of host plants ( Colbran, 1954 ).The optimum temperature for reproduction in citrus roots is 29.5°C (Radewald et al., 1971). P. coffeae reproduces and multiplies in stored yams and is disseminated in seed tubers. It can also be introduced into yam fields in the roots and tissues of other crops. The nematodes can survive in field soil between yam crops on other hosts.
 Sintomas: P. coffeae only infects the roots, tubers, corms and rhizomes of host plants but referred symptoms are produced on other parts of the plant.Bananas, Plantains and Musa textilisP. coffeae causes damage symptoms similar to those observed with other root lesion nematodes such as Radopholus similis: stunting; lengthening of the vegetative cycle; reduction in the size and number of leaves, and in bunch weight; reduction of the productive life of the plantation; toppling. Roots heavily infested by P. coffeae have extensive black or purple necrosis of epidermal and cortical tissue, often accompanied by secondary rotting and root breakage. Similar necrosis can be observed on the outer parts of the corm.YamsP. coffeae causes dry rot symptoms in yam tubers. Brown, irregular dry rot extends 1-2 cm into the outer tissues of D. rotundata tubers, but can occur as deep as 5 cm in tubers of D. alata. The dry rot can be more pronounced in the oldest apical portions of the tubers, adjacent to the vines or may even be restricted to these portions in newly harvested tubers.External symptoms on tubers of D. alata, D. cayenensis and D. rotundata are deep cracks, a corky appearance, exposed dark-brown rotted areas and diseased tubers, which

 can be more pronounced in the oldest apical portions of the tubers, adjacent to the vines or may even be restricted to these portions in newly harvested tubers.External symptoms on tubers of D. alata, D. cayenensis and D. rotundata are deep cracks, a corky appearance, exposed dark-brown rotted areas and diseased tubers, which are spongy to the touch. Necrosis or rotting, caused by P. coffeae, has also been observed in tubers of D. esculenta and D. trifida. Above-ground symptoms of damage are not as obvious. Vines from tubers which are severely infected with P. coffeae are unthrifty and shorter than normal plants.Using planting material with a high proportion of dry rot can result in tubers not sprouting and poor stands in yam fields ( Acosta, 1974 ; Acosta and Ayala, 1975 ; Bridge and Page, 1984 ; Coates-Beckford and Brathwaite, 1977 ; Thompson et al., 1973 ). CoffeeCoffee roots infected by P. coffeae turn yellow, then brown and most of the lateral roots are rotten. Infected plants appear stunted and have few small, chlorotic leaves. The earliest symptoms of infection in newly transplanted trees are yellowing of the leaves, loss of young primary branches and stunting of the shoot. A gradual wilt sets in, followed by death of the whole tree. Severely infected plants may die prematurely.In the field, symptoms may occur in patches with yields reducing according to disease severity. Lesions occur on roots and, as a consequence, the whole root system is destroyed ( Campos et al., 1990 ; Monteiro and Lordello, 1974 ; Whitehead, 1969).Ginger and TurmericP. coffeae causes rhizome rot and leaf yellowing of ginger, and is associated with discoloration

At the advanced stages of infection, the rhizomes of turmeric become deep-red to brown in colour, less turgid, and wrinkled with rot symptoms. Internally, affected rhizomes have dark-brown, necrotic lesions ( Sarma et al., 1974 ; Koshy and Bridge, 1990 ).
