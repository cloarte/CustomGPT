 2 n = 12, 14 and 24 have been reported for P. lanceolat a ( Stace, 1997 ; Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ). The high level of genetic mixing, low polymorphism and lack of population genetic structure in this species are thought to result from its exclusive out-crossing strategy ( Sharma and Koul, 1995 ). Reproduction is via seed in this species. P. lanceolata is an obligate out-breeder and its flowers are self-incompatible ( Sagar and Harper, 1964 ; Sharma et al., 1992 ; Sharma and Koul, 1995 ). The species is considered mainly anemophilous ( Sagar and Harper, 1964 ), but there is evidence to suggest biotic pollination by syrphid flies ( Stelleman, 1982 ) and bees ( Apis dorsata and A . florea ) ( Sharma et al., 1993 ). Gynodioecy is observed in P. lanceolata , i.e. populations contain both hermaphrodites and sterile males ( Poot et al., 1997 ). Evidence suggests that there is little dormancy in this species, and virtually all seeds germinate within the first year ( Roberts and Boddrell, 1984 ; Pons, 1992 ). However, germination rate seems to increase with storage over 6 months ( Sousa et al., 1998 ). Unlike some close relatives, such as P . major , seeds of this species do not require light for germination (Pons and Toorn, 1988; Blom, 1992 ), although the effect of light intensity on germination rate seems unclear ( Roberts and Boddrell, 1984 ; Sousa et al., 1998 ). Optimum germination has been obtained at 21% soil moisture ( Blom, 1992 ). Sagar and Harper (1964) provide detailed lists of plants associated with P. lanceolata in the British Isles.

 although the effect of light intensity on germination rate seems unclear ( Roberts and Boddrell, 1984 ; Sousa et al., 1998 ). Optimum germination has been obtained at 21% soil moisture ( Blom, 1992 ). Sagar and Harper (1964) provide detailed lists of plants associated with P. lanceolata in the British Isles. In North America and Europe, it is particularly prevalent in dry grasslands, prairies and meadows ( Cavers et al., 1980 ). Plantago lanceolata is so widely distributed that it is probably not restricted by climate ( Holm et al., 1977 ). Suitable climates include those with winter rainfall (temperate), all-year rainfall (temperate), summer rainfall (temperate) and summer rainfall (sub-tropical) ( Wells et al., 1986 ). The deep taproot enables this species to withstand periods of drought. It is seldom reported to be an important weed in the tropics because more vigorous plants keep its growth in check. In open areas, plants will overwinter below ground and, if frosted, they can re-grow from underground storage organs. The chemical and physical characteristics of the soils in which Plantago species grow are described by Troelstra (1992) . Sagar and Harper (1964) note that P. lanceolata is found on a wide variety of soil types in the British Isles and occurs on sand-dunes, and spray-washed cliffs, but is absent from acidic uplands. It is mainly a species of basic and neutral grasslands, but tolerates pH in the range 4.2 to 7.8. Ecotypes tolerant of high soil concentrations of heavy metals have been described from both Europe and the United States ( Troelstra and Brouwer, 1992 ).
