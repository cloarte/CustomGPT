Pineland Rayless Goldenrod occurs in bogs, wet pine savannahs, pine flatwoods, and wet roadside ditches. It is a perennial from short rhizomes and basal offsets. Leaves form a basal rosette. Leaves are narrowly oblanceolate in outline, petiolate, 3-nerved, gland dotted, with entire margins. Flowering stems are nearly leafless, or with a few much-reduced leaves. Flowers are produced in heads. The heads are arranged in flat-topped corymbs. Heads are cylindrical and contain 2-6 yellow disc flowers. The phyllaries are appressed in several ranks, and yellow in color. The fruit is an achene. Pineland Rayless Goldenrod is an attractive species when in flower, but it is usually not available from nurseries. Plants can be grown from seed, of large clumps can be divided. It prefers full sun and wet, sandy or peaty soil. Pineland Rayless Goldenrod is an interesting addition to a bog garden.--A. Diamond  ;
