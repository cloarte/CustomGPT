 Invasion: S. saman is a medium-sized or large tree of potentially great size, often reaching 25-30 m tall, occasionally 45 m, with a short stout bole to 2-3 m dbh and a wide, low, spreading crown, often twice as wide as the tree is high. It is a stately tree, with heavy, nearly horizontal branches and an umbrella-shaped crown.

 m dbh and a wide, low, spreading crown, often twice as wide as the tree is high. It is a stately tree, with heavy, nearly horizontal branches and an umbrella-shaped crown. One notable old S. saman tree near Government House in Trinidad was recorded to shade approximately a hectare, and reach 50 m in height, a stem 2.6 m in diameter, with a crown diameter of 60 m (Allen and Allen, 1981;Raintree, 1987). The bark is grey-brown, rough and furrowed into ridges. A full botanical description is provided byBarneby and Grimes (1996). Leaves are large, 6-25 mm long x 3-8 cm wide, bipinnate, with 3-6 pairs of pinnae per leaf, 6-9 pairs of leaflets per pinna and large leaflets, 24-62 mm long x 10-25 mm wide. Leaflets are unequal in size, becoming larger towards the distal end of the pinnae. The new growth and leaf rachis are covered in short, velvety, tawny pubescence. The leaflets are rhombic-oblong or elliptic in shape, unequal at the base, dark olive-green, glabrous and slightly glossy above, dull grey-green and hairy below. The flowers are arranged in loose umbelliform heads, which develop in groups of 2-5 in the axils of leaves on actively growing shoots. The terminal or central flower on each head is sessile and enlarged compared to the peripheral flowers. The exposed and conspicuous stamen filaments are bright or pale pink and showy. The fruits are broadly linear, compressed pods, 10-22 cm long x 1.5-2.2 cm wide x 0.5-1 cm thick. They are green and fleshy when unripe, and turn dark blackish-brown when ripe. The thick mesocarp

The fruits are broadly linear, compressed pods, 10-22 cm long x 1.5-2.2 cm wide x 0.5-1 cm thick. They are green and fleshy when unripe, and turn dark blackish-brown when ripe. The thick mesocarp is filled with dry pitch-like, sweet, nutritious pulp. The pods are indehiscent and contain 5-10 mature seeds, 8-11.5 mm long x 5-7.5 mm wide.

 Reproduccion: In many respects S. saman is similar to its close relative, the ear-pod tree, Enterolobium cyclocarpum. General reviews of S. saman are provided by Streets (1962) , Allen and Allen (1981) , National Academy of Sciences (1979) , Raintree (1987) , Little and Skolmen (1989) , Little and Wadsworth (1989) , and Roshetko (1995) .GeneticsThere have been few, if any, attempts to systematically explore, evaluate and improve the genetic material used in planting of S. saman. Currently used seed sources are derived from land race material comprising, in most areas, an extremely narrow genetic base. Many early introductions are known to be from one or a few trees. For example, two seeds of S. saman were originally introduced to Hawaii from Mexico in 1847 ( Little and Skolmen, 1989 ).

Little or nothing is known about patterns of genetic diversity in S. saman.Physiology and PhenologyFlowering and reproductive biology of S. saman have been observed in natural populations in Central America and trees begin fruiting from an early age. Trees bear tens of thousands of small flowers during the late dry season. Pod set is low with fruit:flower ratios of <0.001 ( Bawa and Buckley, 1989 ). S. saman is generally deciduous, but may be evergreen where planted in wet forest areas or as an ornamental in humid climates, when flowering occurs towards the end of the dry season as the tree refoliates. Tiny immature pods persist for 8-10 months before expanding, ripening and falling, nearly a year after flowering, in the mid dry season ( Janzen, 1982 , 1983). Pods are shed indehiscent.Rapid early growth of S. saman on some sites, e.g. in Papua New Guinea ( Brook et al., 1992 ), is comparable with other fast-growing legumes such as Acacia angustissima, A. auriculiformis, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Schleinitzia novoguineensis.

S. saman does not appear to rank amongst the fastest-growing tropical trees, and trees with a dbh of >100 cm are generally estimated to be >100 years old.Reproductive BiologyThere is a hermaphroditic reproductive system ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). Flowers are believed to be pollinated by large night-flying hawk and noctuid moths, the central, enlarged flower of the inflorescence providing nectar. Pollen is dispersed as large 32-grained polyads and the species is thought to be predominantly outcrossing ( Bawa and Buckley, 1989 ). Flowering occurs towards the end of the dry season and the small immature pods persist for 8-10 months before expanding, ripening and falling nearly a year after flowering in the mid dry season ( Janzen, 1982 , 1983). There are between 4,400 and 7,700 seeds/kg. The seed coat is hard.Environmental RequirementsS. saman is a truly tropical species, intolerant of frost.

A modified description of climatic requirements was prepared by CSIRO ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). The mean annual rainfall is estimated to be 600 - 3000mm, with a dry season duration of 0 - 6 months. S. saman needs well-drained alluvial, fertile, neutral to moderately acid (>pH 4.6) soils for best growth ( Franco et al., 1995 ), but can also tolerate heavy clays (vertisols) and infertile, or seasonally waterlogged soils. It grows from sea level of to 1500 m altitude.AssociationsS. saman has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen.

The mean annual rainfall is estimated to be 600 - 3000mm, with a dry season duration of 0 - 6 months. S. saman needs well-drained alluvial, fertile, neutral to moderately acid (>pH 4.6) soils for best growth ( Franco et al., 1995 ), but can also tolerate heavy clays (vertisols) and infertile, or seasonally waterlogged soils.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology In many respects S. saman is similar to its close relative, the ear-pod tree, Enterolobium cyclocarpum. General reviews of S. saman are provided by Streets (1962) , Allen and Allen (1981) , National Academy of Sciences (1979) , Raintree (1987) , Little and Skolmen (1989) , Little and Wadsworth (1989) , and Roshetko (1995) .GeneticsThere have been few, if any, attempts to systematically explore, evaluate and improve the genetic material used in planting of S. saman. Currently used seed sources are derived from land race material comprising, in most areas, an extremely narrow genetic base. Many early introductions are known to be from one or a few trees. For example, two seeds of S. saman were originally introduced to Hawaii from Mexico in 1847 ( Little and Skolmen, 1989 ). No comprehensive provenance studies have been attempted although two different seed sources (e.g. Hughes and Pottinger, 1997 ) were collected and tested in a small number of trials. Two seed orchards comprising 46 and 50 half-sib families have been established in Honduras ( Mejia, 1997 ).

Two seed orchards comprising 46 and 50 half-sib families have been established in Honduras ( Mejia, 1997 ). Little or nothing is known about patterns of genetic diversity in S. saman.Physiology and PhenologyFlowering and reproductive biology of S. saman have been observed in natural populations in Central America and trees begin fruiting from an early age. Trees bear tens of thousands of small flowers during the late dry season. Pod set is low with fruit:flower ratios of <0.001 ( Bawa and Buckley, 1989 ). S. saman is generally deciduous, but may be evergreen where planted in wet forest areas or as an ornamental in humid climates, when flowering occurs towards the end of the dry season as the tree refoliates. Tiny immature pods persist for 8-10 months before expanding, ripening and falling, nearly a year after flowering, in the mid dry season ( Janzen, 1982 , 1983). Pods are shed indehiscent.Rapid early growth of S. saman on some sites, e.g. in Papua New Guinea ( Brook et al., 1992 ), is comparable with other fast-growing legumes such as Acacia angustissima, A. auriculiformis, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Schleinitzia novoguineensis. However, most trials suggest that early growth is generally slower than commonly planted fast-growing species, e.g. Rourke and Suardika (1990) in Timor (Indonesia); Glover and Heuveldop (1985) in Costa Rica; Hossain et al. (1992) in Bangladesh; Jama et al. (1989) in Kenya; Akkasaeng et al. (1989) in

(1992) in Bangladesh; Jama et al. (1989) in Kenya; Akkasaeng et al. (1989) in Thailand. S. saman does not appear to rank amongst the fastest-growing tropical trees, and trees with a dbh of >100 cm are generally estimated to be >100 years old.Reproductive BiologyThere is a hermaphroditic reproductive system ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). Flowers are believed to be pollinated by large night-flying hawk and noctuid moths, the central, enlarged flower of the inflorescence providing nectar. Pollen is dispersed as large 32-grained polyads and the species is thought to be predominantly outcrossing ( Bawa and Buckley, 1989 ). Flowering occurs towards the end of the dry season and the small immature pods persist for 8-10 months before expanding, ripening and falling nearly a year after flowering in the mid dry season ( Janzen, 1982 , 1983). There are between 4,400 and 7,700 seeds/kg. The seed coat is hard.Environmental RequirementsS. saman is a truly tropical species, intolerant of frost.
