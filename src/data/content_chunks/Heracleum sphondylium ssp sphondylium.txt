Heracleum sphondylium ssp. sphondylium- hogweed  -Umbelliferae / Apiaceae© Angela Ross© Angela Ross© Angela Ross(Map updated: March 2008)Hogweed is one of the commonest of the native umbellifers, occurring as a wayside weed, a member of the woodland or hedgerow floras and as a garden weed; also in a wide variety of other habitats. It has white or pale pink flowers, followed by flattened oval fruits which have a distinctive smell when crushed. The leaves are lobed, usually with quite broad segments although a form with very narrow lobes (var.angustifolia) is quite common. The plant is biennial, perhaps rarely annual, with a stout taproot.This species can cause inflammation when the sap contacts the skin on bright sunny days. The related giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) has a similar, but probably more pronounced effect.Northern Ireland plants belong to the subspeciessphondylium. The hybrid betweenH. sphondyliumandH. mantegazzianumhas been found in Northern Ireland on rare occasions.All names:Heracleum sphondylium ssp. sphondyliumNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
