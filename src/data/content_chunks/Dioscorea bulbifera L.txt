This relative of the yam is a tall-climbing, twining herb with alternate, heart-shaped leaves. It forms large tubers of variable size and shape in the axils of the leaves. These may attain several pounds in weight and are palatable and potato-like in flavor. The plant is native to South Asia and is cultivated to a limited extent in tropical and subtropical areas.
