1. Reagent Name: Clostridium perfringens Type D (epsilon) Antitoxin 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 249 
4. Fill Date: December 9, 1981 
5. Expiration Date: February 28, 2029 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: To serve as the standard antitoxin when conducting C. perfringens type D 
(epsilon) toxin-neutralization tests in mice. 
7. Instructions for Use: Clostridium perfringens type D (epsilon) antitoxin IRP 249 
contains 44 antitoxin units per mL (AU/ml). A dilution of standard antitoxin containing 
1.0 AU/mL is used in the toxin-neutralization test as described in title 9, Code of Federal 
Regulations (9 CFR), sections 113.112 and 113.455. The dilution may be prepared by adding 2.0 
mL of IRP 249 to 86 mL of peptone diluent. The 1:44 dilution of antitoxin is stable when 
stored at -70°± 10°C and should be al

mL of IRP 249 to 86 mL of peptone diluent. The 1:44 dilution of antitoxin is stable when 
stored at -70°± 10°C and should be aliquoted for future testing. 
8. Test of Reagent: 
Determination of antitoxin titer - The antitoxin titer was determined by injecting mice with 
0.2-mL volumes of diluted antitoxin mixed with 10 L+ toxin doses (the smallest amount of toxin 
which, when mixed with 1.0 unit of antitoxin, causes death in at least 80% of the animals within 
24 hours) and 10 Lo toxin doses (the smallest amount of toxin which, when mixed with 1.0 unit 
of antitoxin, causes no death in animals within 24 hours). The antitoxin titer of IRP 249 was 
confirmed by injecting mice with toxin-antitoxin mixtures that contained 1.0 mL of IRP 249 
diluted 1:44 and mixtures that contained 1.0 mL of C. perfringens type D International antitoxin 
possessing 1.0 unit of antitoxin per mL. 
Sterility test - IRP 249 was tested for sterility by inoculating it in sterile fluid thioglycollate 
medium and streaking it on 5% bovine blood agar plates. No detectable growth appeared in the 
medium or on the blood plates.

10. Storage Conditions: Store at -25°C or lower. Once the antitoxin has been thawed, store 
at 2º to 7°C.

12. Origin and Passage History: Not applicable 
13. Method of Preparation: Ponies with no history of clostridial vaccinations received 
multiple injections of C. perfringens type D toxoid and type D toxin during a 12-month period. 
Serums from the hyper-immunized ponies were fractionated with ammonium sulfate and the 
immunoglobulin dialyzed against .015 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 6.8. The antitoxin was 
passed through a Millipore filtration unit containing a 0.22-µm membrane and mixed with 20% 
sterile glycerol. A final concentration of 1:10,000 Thimerosal was added to the glycerinated 
antitoxin.
