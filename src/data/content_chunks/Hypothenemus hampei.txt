 Reproduccion: A detailed study of H. hampei populations from 17 countries by Benavides et al. (2005) showed the highest genetic variation was from Ethiopia. Generally though they confirmed the very low level of genetic variability in this insect, but detected enough differences to suggest that H. hampei which invaded both Asia and the Americas came from West Africa. They further suggest that there were three separate introductions to the Americas, two into Brazil which spread to the rest of Latin America and a third into Peru and Colombia. All three strains are found in Colombia. Gauthier (2010) however, used nine polymorphic microsatellite loci to look for differences between H. hampei collected from 37 sites in 18 countries and found that the global H. hampei community is more heterogeneous than previously thought. Five different sub-groups were distinguished, which are so distinct that they might even be different species. The groups are i) Ethiopian, ii) Kenya-Ugandan, iii) Brazilian, iv) Central America plus Colombian, v) a mixed group including India, Java, New Caledonia and W Africa. Jamaica seems to have representatives from two groups, suggesting that it was invaded twice.

The broad category of group v) suggests that Java, India and the Pacific were infested originally from W Africa, perhaps by the introduction of infested Robusta berries in the early part of the 20th century. The female H. hampei attacks developing coffee berries from about eight weeks after flowering up to harvest time (32+ weeks). It shows a marked preference for older berries if they are available. The endosperm is the site of oviposition but is only suitable for development of the brood if it is solid, i.e. if it has more than about 20% dry weight (J.F. Barrera and P.S. Baker, ECOSUR, personal communication, 1995). This stage of development of the berry may only be arrived at after about 16 weeks after flowering (depending on ambient temperature). Thus if the female attacks a berry with a young watery endosperm, it penetrates only to the mesoderm and waits in a short tunnel, sometimes for several weeks, whilst the berry matures. Studies suggest that mortality of the borer is high when it attacks young berries, presumably because it is only in a superficial position and thus more exposed to natural enemies and pesticides applied by the farmer ( Baker, 1999 ). Attacks by the fungus Beauveria bassiana may be particularly heavy at this time especially in very humid climates. This is easily diagnosed by the presence of a white powdery patch at the apex of the berry with a dead female underneath.When the endosperm has hardened, the borer enters and begins to excavate irregular tunnels and galleries in which she lays clusters of eggs. These 30-50 eggs develop to adult over a period that may range from as little as 25 days to more than 60, depending on temperature and the consistency of the endosperm. The female stays with

These 30-50 eggs develop to adult over a period that may range from as little as 25 days to more than 60, depending on temperature and the consistency of the endosperm. The female stays with her brood and does not leave to start another one in another berry (Baker et al., 1992). When the progeny reach adulthood, the females (which out-number males by about 10:1) mate with their dwarf flightless brothers. Brun et al. (1995) suggest that the mating system is functionally haplo-diploid, so that males contain functioning genes only from their mothers and do not pass genetic material from their fathers to their daughters. Although reproduction is overwhelmingly incestuous, it is possible that out-breeding occasionally occurs when two females attack the same berry and the male offspring of one female finds a female offspring of the other founder female.When the endosperm has hardened, the borer enters and begins to excavate irregular tunnels and galleries in which she lays clusters of eggs.

Although reproduction is overwhelmingly incestuous, it is possible that out-breeding occasionally occurs when two females attack the same berry and the male offspring of one female finds a female offspring of the other founder female. Some of the mated females from the first brood stay in the berry and egg-laying resumes (Baker et al., 1992). Others leave the berry though the number departing and the stimuli causing them to leave, rather than start a new brood, are not yet well understood. A perfect understanding of the fecundity and mortality inside the berry is difficult because the females carry out brood hygiene and may eject dead or dying immature and adult stages from the berry ( Baker et al., 1994 ). This makes accurate assessment of mortality factors in the field almost impossible; the best estimate of reproduction so far gives r = 0.065; R 0 = 25.0; T = 45.2 (Baker et al., 1992). Intrinsic rates of increase have now been established in relation to the age of the berry on which H. hampei feeds (Ruiz, in Baker 1999 ). Up to three generations are possible inside the berry though it is likely that the first two generations are the most important. In old dry berries left after harvest it is not uncommon to find more than 100 individuals. It is frequently stated that the borer goes through eight or more generations per year, but with the often slow start to attack and the possible long wait in an old berry before emerging, it is unlikely that many borers give rise to more than five generations per year.

 is not uncommon to find more than 100 individuals. It is frequently stated that the borer goes through eight or more generations per year, but with the often slow start to attack and the possible long wait in an old berry before emerging, it is unlikely that many borers give rise to more than five generations per year. Fallen berries in dry conditions can build up large numbers of adults which are triggered to emerge by high humidity ( > 90% RH) that occurs after rain ( Baker, 1984 ). Before emergence the borers are in a quiescent state: more research is needed to determine if this is true diapause or not. Laboratory studies ( Baker et al., 1994 ) show that the borer is surprisingly sensitive to low humidities thus possibly she waits to emerge until after rain so that she has a better chance of avoiding desiccation before she finds a new berry. The emerged females typically fly from late morning to late afternoon; they are not thought to fly at night. They are slow fliers but are capable of sustained flight of at least 30 minutes and probably much longer ( Baker, 1984 ). They may fly for many minutes around a tree before finally finding a berry to attack, they land on a branch and walk around for many minutes before finally selecting a berry (F. Posada, Cenicafé (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones de Café, Colombia), personal communication, 1996). When different maturities are present on the same branch, there is a strong selection for mature berries with over 25% dry matter content (Castaño and P.S. Baker, Cenicafé (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones de Café, Colombia), personal communication, 1996). In coffee plantations attack is frequently aggregated towards a part of a field, often where there is shade or higher humidity or a border ( Barrera, 1994 ). If the infestation is not controlled, attack becomes general over the entire plot.

In coffee plantations attack is frequently aggregated towards a part of a field, often where there is shade or higher humidity or a border ( Barrera, 1994 ). If the infestation is not controlled, attack becomes general over the entire plot. H. hampei favours warm, humid environments such as the tropics, suitable for the growth of coffee. A study by Baker et al. (1992) found that the emergence of H. hampei was low at temepratures below 20°C and humidities of 90%. A laboratory study estimated that the extremes for survival are between 15-32°C (Jaramillo et al., 2009).
 Sintomas: Attack by H. hampei begins at the apex of the coffee berry from about eight weeks after flowering. A small perforation about 1 mm diameter is often clearly visible though this may become partly obscured by subsequent growth of the berry or by fungi that attack the borer. During active boring by the adult female, she pushes out the debris, which forms a deposit over the hole. This deposit may be brown, grey or green in colour.

 is not uncommon to find more than 100 individuals. It is frequently stated that the borer goes through eight or more generations per year, but with the often slow start to attack and the possible long wait in an old berry before emerging, it is unlikely that many borers give rise to more than five generations per year. Fallen berries in dry conditions can build up large numbers of adults which are triggered to emerge by high humidity ( > 90% RH) that occurs after rain ( Baker, 1984 ). Before emergence the borers are in a quiescent state: more research is needed to determine if this is true diapause or not. Laboratory studies ( Baker et al., 1994 ) show that the borer is surprisingly sensitive to low humidities thus possibly she waits to emerge until after rain so that she has a better chance of avoiding desiccation before she finds a new berry. The emerged females typically fly from late morning to late afternoon; they are not thought to fly at night. They are slow fliers but are capable of sustained flight of at least 30 minutes and probably much longer ( Baker, 1984 ). They may fly for many minutes around a tree before finally finding a berry to attack, they land on a branch and walk around for many minutes before finally selecting a berry (F. Posada, Cenicafé (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones de Café, Colombia), personal communication, 1996). When different maturities are present on the same branch, there is a strong selection for mature berries with over 25% dry matter content (Castaño and P.S. Baker, Cenicafé (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones de Café, Colombia), personal communication, 1996). In coffee plantations attack is frequently aggregated towards a part of a field, often where there is shade or higher humidity or a border ( Barrera, 1994 ). If the infestation is not controlled, attack becomes general over the entire plot.

In coffee plantations attack is frequently aggregated towards a part of a field, often where there is shade or higher humidity or a border ( Barrera, 1994 ). If the infestation is not controlled, attack becomes general over the entire plot. H. hampei favours warm, humid environments such as the tropics, suitable for the growth of coffee. A study by Baker et al. (1992) found that the emergence of H. hampei was low at temepratures below 20°C and humidities of 90%. A laboratory study estimated that the extremes for survival are between 15-32°C (Jaramillo et al., 2009).
 Sintomas: Attack by H. hampei begins at the apex of the coffee berry from about eight weeks after flowering. A small perforation about 1 mm diameter is often clearly visible though this may become partly obscured by subsequent growth of the berry or by fungi that attack the borer. During active boring by the adult female, she pushes out the debris, which forms a deposit over the hole. This deposit may be brown, grey or green in colour.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics A detailed study of H. hampei populations from 17 countries by Benavides et al. (2005) showed the highest genetic variation was from Ethiopia. Generally though they confirmed the very low level of genetic variability in this insect, but detected enough differences to suggest that H. hampei which invaded both Asia and the Americas came from West Africa. They further suggest that there were three separate introductions to the Americas, two into Brazil which spread to the rest of Latin America and a third into Peru and Colombia.

They further suggest that there were three separate introductions to the Americas, two into Brazil which spread to the rest of Latin America and a third into Peru and Colombia. All three strains are found in Colombia. Gauthier (2010) however, used nine polymorphic microsatellite loci to look for differences between H. hampei collected from 37 sites in 18 countries and found that the global H. hampei community is more heterogeneous than previously thought. Five different sub-groups were distinguished, which are so distinct that they might even be different species. The groups are i) Ethiopian, ii) Kenya-Ugandan, iii) Brazilian, iv) Central America plus Colombian, v) a mixed group including India, Java, New Caledonia and W Africa. Jamaica seems to have representatives from two groups, suggesting that it was invaded twice. The broad category of group v) suggests that Java, India and the Pacific were infested originally from W Africa, perhaps by the introduction of infested Robusta berries in the early part of the 20th century. Physiology and Phenology The female H. hampei attacks developing coffee berries from about eight weeks after flowering up to harvest time (32+ weeks). It shows a marked preference for older berries if they are available. The endosperm is the site of oviposition but is only suitable for development of the brood if it is solid, i.e. if it has more than about 20% dry weight (J.F. Barrera and P.S. Baker, ECOSUR, personal communication, 1995). This stage of development of the berry may only be arrived at after about 16 weeks after flowering (depending on ambient temperature). Thus if the female attacks a b

 suitable for development of the brood if it is solid, i.e. if it has more than about 20% dry weight (J.F. Barrera and P.S. Baker, ECOSUR, personal communication, 1995). This stage of development of the berry may only be arrived at after about 16 weeks after flowering (depending on ambient temperature). Thus if the female attacks a berry with a young watery endosperm, it penetrates only to the mesoderm and waits in a short tunnel, sometimes for several weeks, whilst the berry matures. Studies suggest that mortality of the borer is high when it attacks young berries, presumably because it is only in a superficial position and thus more exposed to natural enemies and pesticides applied by the farmer ( Baker, 1999 ). Attacks by the fungus Beauveria bassiana may be particularly heavy at this time especially in very humid climates. This is easily diagnosed by the presence of a white powdery patch at the apex of the berry with a dead female underneath.When the endosperm has hardened, the borer enters and begins to excavate irregular tunnels and galleries in which she lays clusters of eggs. These 30-50 eggs develop to adult over a period that may range from as little as 25 days to more than 60, depending on temperature and the consistency of the endosperm. The female stays with her brood and does not leave to start another one in another berry (Baker et al., 1992). When the progeny reach adulthood, the females (which out-number males by about 10:1) mate with their dwarf flightless brothers. Brun et al. (1995) suggest that the mating system is functionally haplo-diploid, so that males contain functioning genes only from their mothers and do not pass genetic material from their fathers to their daughters. Although reproduction is overwhelmingly incestuous, it is possible that out-breeding occasionally occurs when two females attack the same berry and the

Although reproduction is overwhelmingly incestuous, it is possible that out-breeding occasionally occurs when two females attack the same berry and the male offspring of one female finds a female offspring of the other founder female.When the endosperm has hardened, the borer enters and begins to excavate irregular tunnels and galleries in which she lays clusters of eggs.

Some of the mated females from the first brood stay in the berry and egg-laying resumes (Baker et al., 1992). Others leave the berry though the number departing and the stimuli causing them to leave, rather than start a new brood, are not yet well understood. A perfect understanding of the fecundity and mortality inside the berry is difficult because the females carry out brood hygiene and may eject dead or dying immature and adult stages from the berry ( Baker et

aying resumes (Baker et al., 1992). Others leave the berry though the number departing and the stimuli causing them to leave, rather than start a new brood, are not yet well understood. A perfect understanding of the fecundity and mortality inside the berry is difficult because the females carry out brood hygiene and may eject dead or dying immature and adult stages from the berry ( Baker et al., 1994 ). This makes accurate assessment of mortality factors in the field almost impossible; the best estimate of reproduction so far gives r = 0.065; R 0 = 25.0; T = 45.2 (Baker et al., 1992). Intrinsic rates of increase have now been established in relation to the age of the berry on which H. hampei feeds (Ruiz, in Baker 1999 ). Up to three generations are possible inside the berry though it is likely that the first two generations are the most important. In old dry berries left after harvest it is not uncommon to find more than 100 individuals. It is frequently stated that the borer goes through eight or more generations per year, but with the often slow start to attack and the possible long wait in an old berry before emerging, it is unlikely that many borers give rise to more than five generations per year.
