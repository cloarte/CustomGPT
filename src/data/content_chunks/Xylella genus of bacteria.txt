National Priority Plant Pests (2024)
Our National Priority Plant Pests (NPPP) list highlights the threats Australia faces from plant pests and diseases.
The NPPP guides national action and investment of public funds to address these threats. This effort often has broader benefits to the system than just in preparedness for the specific pest or disease. The National Priority Plant Pest is not the list that sets Australia quarantine restrictions and determines risk.
The NPPP list includes 119 pests and diseases in 37 groups. Pests and diseases are grouped together if:
they share similar biology or potential pathways to Australia
they share methods of surveillance and response
their effect depends on a relationship between two pests.
Pest groups posing the greatest threat are numbered from 1 (most significant) to 10. All other pests on the list are nationally significant and are listed in alphabetical order.
Plant Health Committee endorsed the NPPP on 2 December 2024.
Top 3 pests
The top 3 National Priority Plant Pests are:
the Xylella genus of bacteria and the vectors (insects) that carry it
Khapra beetle
spotted wing drosophila.

Research highlight
AI for brown marmorated stink bug
The brown marmorated stink bug is number 9 on the list of National Priority Plant Pests.
Identifying the stink bug at Australia’s borders is time consuming. It can delay the release of cargo and increase the risk of the pest entering the country.
To reduce these risks, we have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) app to identify stink bugs, including the brown marmorated stink bug, in real time.

Governance
The National Priority Plant Pests are endorsed by Plant Health Committee (PHC). PHC is a government forum. It makes decisions about plant biosecurity policy to maintain or improve plant health in Australia.
PHC is the custodian of the National Priority Plant Pests and manages its reviews. 
PHC endorsed the list of National Priority Plant Pests in 2016. They consulted with experts from the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, CSIRO and Plant Health Australia 
The NPPP was reviewed in 2019 and 2024. It is reviewed every 5 years.
Other priority lists
National Priority Plant Pests are highly significant. They are often found on other priority lists. Examples include:
The National Priority List of Ex

Other priority lists
National Priority Plant Pests are highly significant. They are often found on other priority lists. Examples include:
The National Priority List of Exotic Environmental Pests, Weeds and Diseases
High Priority Pests
Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy
Torres Strait and Northern Peninsula priority pest list
National Plant Health Surveillance Program
State priority pest lists: Priority plant pests and diseases, and Priority hitchhiking pests.
Comparison of priority lists
Table 2 compares the main features of the:
National Priority Plant Pests
National Priority List of Exotic Environmental Pests, Weeds and Diseases (abbreviated to the Exotic Environmental Pest List)
High Priority Pests. 
These 3 lists set out agreed activities to address the risks to Australia from exotic plant pests. Each list differs in its focus, role and management.
