Meeting of the Panel on Efficacy Evaluation of Fungicides and Insecticides Oeiras, PT, 2012-11-27/29 The Panel on Efficacy Evaluation of Fungicides and Insecticides met at the Direção-Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária, Oei ras, Portugal, on 2012-11-27/29. Special thanks are due to Mrs Miriam Cavaco and her colleagues for warm hospitability and fine organization of this meeting. The Panel continued its main work on the preparation of standards for conducting field trials to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and insecticides. Several revised and one new standard were completed and are now considered ready to be sent to EPPO countries for comment : Rhizoctonia solani on potato (revision PP1/32) Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (new) Aphids on beet (minor revision PP1/228) Foliar diseases on maize (minor revision PP1/272) Two further standards were addressed for relatively new pests in the EPPO region (both on EPPO A2 List).  However, it was considered that further expert input will be needed before they could be sent to country consultation: Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (red palm weevil) (new) Drosophila suzukii (spotted wing drosophila) (new) Another example of a zonal efficacy evaluation to assist applicants and evaluators to interpret EPPO Standard PP1/278 Principles of zonal data production and evaluation was addressed on: ‘Efficacy data requirements for the authorization of fungicide for the control of Septoria leaf blotch ( Mycosphaerella graminicola (SEPTTR) on winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum (TRZAX)) in the European Central authorization zone’.

PPO Standard PP1/278 Principles of zonal data production and evaluation was addressed on: ‘Efficacy data requirements for the authorization of fungicide for the control of Septoria leaf blotch ( Mycosphaerella graminicola (SEPTTR) on winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum (TRZAX)) in the European Central authorization zone’. This will be presented to the Working Party on Plant Protection Products for agreement in 2013 for publication on the EPPO Zonal webpage . The Panel also discussed other important topics, including pheromones and other semiochemicals; extrapolation solutions for polyphagous pests; and the forthcoming EPPO Workshop entitled, ‘Experiences with the implementation of zonal evaluation of plant protection products’ (2013-10-22/24 Bulgaria). The Panel on Efficacy Evaluation of Fungicides and Insecticides will next meet on 2012-11-27/29 in Naples.
