Plant Notes:  Rayless Sunflower is a native herbaceous perennial in the Sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to the southern third of Alabama. Rayless Sunflower occurs in sandy Longleaf pine woods, in wet flatwoods, on roadsides, and in forest clearings. It is a perennial with a short, erect rootstock, sometimes elongating and becoming rhizome- or stolon-like. Leaves are primarily basal. The leaves are opposite, short petiolate, obovate to orbicular in outline, thick and rough in texture, pubescent, not gland dotted, and with entire to serrulate margins. The cauline leaves are narrow and much reduced. Flowers are produced in heads. The heads are solitary on long peduncles. The phyllaries are often dark purple-black. The heads have 0-2 yellow ray flowers and 100-150 reddish-purple disc flowers. The fruit is an achene. Rayless Sunflower is available from some wildflower nurseries or it can be grown from seed. It prefers a site with full sun and will adapt to a variety of soil and moisture conditions. Although not as showy as other members of the genus it still attracts a wide range of butterflies and other pollinators.—A. Diamond  ;
