Rhododendron ponticumL. - Rhododendron  -Ericaceae© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This is a small tree or large shrub which occurs naturally in three main regions: around about the Black Sea, the Balkans and in the Iberian Peninsula. It was introduced into the British Isles in the second half of the eighteenth century.It is a very common plant in parks, much planted in Victorian times. It has given rise to a number of hybrids and in fact many plants in cultivation and those that have escaped may be hybrids and not the pure species. They are a great nuisance in that they spread easily into woodland and into open acid peaty ground such as bogland. They pose a threat both to natural vegetation and to the balance of species in planted woodland and parkland, often forming great impenetrable thickets if left unchecked .A huge dense thicket of this species covers a hillside in the Mourne Mountains at Kinnahalla.All names:Rhododendron ponticumL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
