Plant Notes:  Clasping Heliotrope is an introduced herbaceous perennial in the Heliotrope family (Heliotropiaceae). It is native to South America. In Alabama it can be found at scattered locations statewide, but is most common in central and south Alabama. Clasping Heliotrope occurs on roadsides, in fields and pastures, and in waste places. It is a perennial with a taproot. Each root crown produces several ascending to decumbent glandular pubescent green stems. Leaves are alternate, sessile or short petiolate, often clasping, oblong to oblanceolate in outline, slightly toothed with wavy margins, and pubescent. Flowers are produced in terminal helicoid false racemes. Individual flowers are blue or purple in color with a distinctive yellowish throat, salverform or funnelform in shape, with 5 shallow lobes. The fruits are paired nutlets. Clasping Heliotrope is sometime cultivated. Once established it tolerates drought and is resistant to most pests. It is propagated from seed or sections of the root. Clasping Heliotrope is listed as an invasive species in California and in Australia. It is also poisonous to livestock, especially cattle.—A. Diamond  ;
