13.Tetramelaceae四数木科 si shu mu keAuthors:Yinzheng Wang&Nicholas J. TurlandTrees deciduous [or evergreen], large, often buttressed, with soft wood, dioecious. Leaves alternate, long-petiolate; leaf blade simple, pubescent [or glabrous], lepidote, palmately 3-5-veined, margin entire or dentate. Inflorescences long, pendent spikes clustered at stem apices, male ones mostly branched, female ones usually simple [or axillary, solitary, simple spikes]. Bracts deciduous. Male flowers: calyx lobes 4-8, equal or unequal; petals absent [or 6-8, erect, greenish, narrowly triangular]; stamens 4-8, antesepalous; filaments elongate, somewhat flattened subulate; anthers basifixed, introrse or extrorse, incurved in bud, relatively short and ovoid, or if larger and ± oblong then conspicuously recurved; sterile ovary present or sometimes absent. Female flowers: calyx lobes 4-8, free or connate below ovary; petals and staminodes absent; ovary inferior, 1-loculed, with 4-8 parietal placentas; ovules numerous; styles 4-8, antesepalous, short, stout, with large, capitate or obliquely oblong-decurrent stigmas. Fruit a capsule, dehiscing apically between persistent styles [or shedding exocarp and dehiscing longitudinally]. Seeds numerous, ovoid or fusiform, tiny.Two genera and two species: from India and Nepal through tropical SE Asia to Australia and the Solomon Islands; one species in China.The other genus,Oct

Seeds numerous, ovoid or fusiform, tiny.Two genera and two species: from India and Nepal through tropical SE Asia to Australia and the Solomon Islands; one species in China.The other genus,OctomelesMiquel, comprises the single speciesO. sumatranaMiquel (O. moluccanaTeijsmann & Binnendijk ex Hasskarl), which occurs in Indonesia, Malaysia (Sabah), New Guinea, the Philippines, and the Solomon Islands. It is a large tree likeTetrameles, but differs in the features enclosed in square brackets in the above description, as well as in having (5 or)6-8-merous flowers (vs. 4(or 5)-merous flowers inTetrameles).In the past,OctomelesandTetrameleshave been included together withDatiscaLinnaeus to comprise the Datiscaceae. However, that group would be paraphyletic unless Begoniaceae were included. Therefore, two families are recognized here: Datiscaceae, comprisingDatiscaonly, and Tetramelaceae, comprising the other two genera. Zhang et al. (Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 39: 305-322. 2006) placed Tetramelaceae as sister to Datiscaceae + Begoniaceae, although the latter clade had less than 50% support. The same authors placed Tetramelaceae + Datiscaceae + Begoniaceae as sister to Cucurbitaceae.Datiscacomprises two species:D. glomerata(C.

It grows in moist places, often by streams in forests, and might yet be found in SW Xinjiang or SW Xizang.Li Yanhui. 1999. Tetramelaceae.In:Ku Tsuechih, ed., Fl. Reipubl.
