Crassulaceae Candolle Ghulam Rasool Sarwar Department of Botany, University of Karachi, Karachi. Rhodiola saxifragoides Credit: Jan Alam Annual, biennial or perennial herbs, rarely undershrubs or shrubs, usually succulent, sometimes woody at base. Leaves alternate, opposite or verticillate, usually simple, sometimes compound, exstipulate, often thick and fleshy, sometimes forming a basal rosette. Flowers actinomorphic, (3-)4-5(-32)-merous, usually bisexual, in axillary or terminal cymes, often grouped in corymb- or panicle-like inflorescences, less often in racemes or spike or solitary in the leaf axil. Sepals free or united. Petals free or united, sometimes forming a tubular corolla. Stamens as many or twice as many as the petals, filaments free or more or less adnate to the corolla; anthers 2-celled, usually basifixed, introrse, dehiscing longitudinally. Carpels superior or semi-inferior, equal in number to the petals, free or united at the base. Nectar scales usually present, small, applied to the base of the outer face of the carpels. Fruit a follicle. Seeds few-numerous, very small with smooth, rugose or tuberculate tegument and usually fleshy endosperm and straight embryo. A family of c. 33 genera and c. 1500 species distributed all over the world except Occeania. Represented in Pakistan by 9 genera and 32 species. 1 Stamens as many as petals. (2) + Stamens twice as many as petals. (3) 2 (1) Leaves opposite, connate at the base. Flowers minute in the axils of the leaves 0.9-2
