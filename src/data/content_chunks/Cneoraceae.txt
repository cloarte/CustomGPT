11.Cneoraceae牛筋果科 niu jin guo keAuthors:Hua Peng&Thomas G. HartleyShrubs (sometimes scrambling or rarely somewhat climbing) or rarely small trees, monoclinous or andromonoecious, armed or unarmed, apparently without oil glands. Stipules absent. Leaves alternate, simple, odd-pinnate, or digitately trifoliolate; blades of simple leaves entire at margin, those of compound leaves crenulate, crenate, lobulate, or rarely entire at margin. Flowers solitary and axillary or in terminal and/or axillary cymes, racemes, or rarely thyrses, actinomorphic, hypogynous, 3-5(or 6)-merous. Sepals distinct or connate to ± half their length. Petals distinct, imbricate or narrowly so in bud. Stamens equal to or 2 × as many as petals, inserted in lateral pits on disk or at base of disk; filaments distinct, linear, with or without adaxial ligulate appendage at base; anthers longitudinally dehiscent. Disk within androecium, nectariferous, columnar to barrel-shaped or pulvinate to cup-shaped. Gynoecium 3-5(or 6)-carpelled and -loculed; ovaries axially or ± completely connate; placentation apical-axile; ovules pendulous, solitary or collateral in each locule; style terminal, stylar elements coherent or rarely distinct at base; stigma 3- or 4-branched or capitate (often slightly lobed). Fruit drupaceous, of separating mericarps or ± completely syncarpous, drying brown to black or rarely pale gray-brown when ripe; abortive carpels, if any, persistent; outer

Fruit drupaceous, of separating mericarps or ± completely syncarpous, drying brown to black or rarely pale gray-brown when ripe; abortive carpels, if any, persistent; outer pericarp (exocarp and mesocarp) ± fleshy; endocarp bony next to locule(s), otherwise woody, in mericarps developed from 2-ovuled carpels forming a median longitudinal partial partition within locule. Seeds pyriform or rarely irregular in shape; seed coat membranous or thin and brittle; endosperm copious or ± scant, fleshy; embryo relatively large, bent double or rarely broadly horseshoe-shaped; cotyledons plano-convex and linear or ± flattened and elliptic-oblong; hypocotyl superior.Two genera and six species: tropical Africa, S and SE Asia, N Australia, Canary Islands, NW Mediterranean region, Cuba; one species in China.This electronic version, published online on 26 August 2008, supersedes the printed treatment in Fl.
