 Reproduccion: Genetics Dioscorea alata is a polyploid species with a basic chromosome number x=20 ( Arnau et al., 2009 ) and ploidy levels ranging from diploid (2n=2x=40) to tetraploid (2n=4x=80) ( Abraham et al., 2013 ; Nemorin et al., 2013 ).

The second phase, lasting from 6-12 weeks after emergence, is characterized by limited root growth, extensive shoot and leaf growth, and the onset of tuber formation.

Cultivated Forms Dioscorea alata is the most important yam for Southeast Asia and is easily recognized by its quadrangular winged stems. The variability of the tubers in form, size, weight, colour and flesh is so great that in every country where it grows and is used, many forms, selections and cultivars exist, all with their own vernacular names. Because D. alata is not known as a wild plant in its original range, a classification into cultivar groups and cultivars is most suitable, but there is no satisfactory worldwide system.

Overview
Appearance
Dioscorea alata
is an herbaceous, twining vine that can grow to lengths exceeding 30 ft. (9.1 m). It invades open to shady areas in the extreme southeastern United States.
Foliage
Leaves are opposite, 8 in. (20.3 cm) long and narrowly heart-shaped with long petioles. The stems are square with the corners compressed into wings.
Flowers
The vine rarely flowers.
Fruit
The chief means of reproduction is by aerial potato-like tubers (bulbils) located at the leaf axils and by underground tubers.
Ecological Threat
Dioscorea alata
can form dense masses of vines that cover and kill native vegetation including trees. It was introduced from Asia as a possible food source in the early 1800s. In some countries it is presently being cultivated for medicinal uses.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics Dioscorea alata is a polyploid species with a basic chromosome number x=20 ( Arnau et al., 2009 ) and ploidy levels ranging from diploid (2n=2x=40) to tetraploid (2n=4x=80) ( Abraham et al., 2013 ; Nemorin et al., 2013 ). Nemorin et al. (2013) attributed the origin of spontaneous D. alata triploids and tetraploids to the formation of unreduced gametes. Genetic studies on D. alata have included assessing genetic diversity ( Egesi et al., 2003 ) and population structure ( Arnau et al., 2017 ), identifying quantitative trait loc

orin et al., 2013 ). Nemorin et al. (2013) attributed the origin of spontaneous D. alata triploids and tetraploids to the formation of unreduced gametes. Genetic studies on D. alata have included assessing genetic diversity ( Egesi et al., 2003 ) and population structure ( Arnau et al., 2017 ), identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes associated with physicochemical traits related to tuber quality ( Bredeson et al., 2022 ; Arnau et al., 2024 ), identifying QTLs controlling resistance to anthracnose disease ( Agre et al., 2022a ; Bredeson et al., 2022 ); inheritance of virus resistance ( Mignouna et al., 2001 ), development of genetic maps ( Mignouna et al., 2002 ; Cormier et al., 2019 ), and establishing the genetic control of important traits such as flowering ( Cormier et al., 2021 ). Advances in developing genomic resources ( Saski et al., 2015 ; Tamiru, 2015; Gatarira et. al., 2020; Agre et al., 2023 ) would facilitate marker-assisted breeding and quality control in yam genetics and breeding. Reproductive Biology Dioscorea alata is a dioecious species, with staminate and pistillate flowers occurring on separate plants. Staminate flowers may remain open for 4-5 h while pistillate flowers open for 9-11 days. In Puerto Rico, this species has been collected in flower in October and November and in fruit in January ( Acevedo-Rodríguez, 2005 ). D. alata was believed to be sterile because no natural seed set had been observed until reports of fertility, some fruit set, and seed production in the 1970s by the breeding programs at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI), India, and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA),

 in January ( Acevedo-Rodríguez, 2005 ). D. alata was believed to be sterile because no natural seed set had been observed until reports of fertility, some fruit set, and seed production in the 1970s by the breeding programs at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI), India, and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Nigeria. This was followed by reports of successful hand pollination between diploid males and females that led to large seedling populations at CTCRI ( Abraham et al., 1986 ; Bai and Jos, 1986 ). Recent studies at IITA have provided more details on sex determination and cross-compatibility ( Mondo et al., 2021 ; 2022a ), floral biology ( Mondo et al., 2020 ) and pollination efficiency ( Mondo et al., 2020 ; 2022b in the species. Physiology and Phenology As with most other edible yams, the growth and development of D. alata falls roughly into four phases ( Onwueme and Ganga, 1996 ). The first phase spans from 0-6 weeks after emergence, and is characterized by extensive root and vine growth, but very limited leaf expansion. The second phase, lasting from 6-12 weeks after emergence, is characterized by limited root growth, extensive shoot and leaf growth, and the onset of tuber formation. The third phase, lasting until the end of the season, is characterized by tuber bulking and maturity. Root and shoot growth are very limited in this phase. The total growing period is 8-10 months. In the fourth phase, the shoot senesces and dies back, and the tubers enter a dormant period lasting 2-4 months before sprouting again ( Onwueme and Ganga, 1996 ). Environmental Requirements Dioscorea alata grows in areas with mild temperatures (around 15-35°C) and high precipitation (>1000 mm annual rainfall), at low to middle elevations. When

 In the fourth phase, the shoot senesces and dies back, and the tubers enter a dormant period lasting 2-4 months before sprouting again ( Onwueme and Ganga, 1996 ). Environmental Requirements Dioscorea alata grows in areas with mild temperatures (around 15-35°C) and high precipitation (>1000 mm annual rainfall), at low to middle elevations. When cultivated, an annual rainfall of 1000-1500 mm, distributed over at least 6-7 months, is required. It is adapted to partially and fully shaded conditions, but it does not tolerate frost. Tuberization is promoted by short days (less than 12 h). As with many species within the genus Dioscorea ,this species climbs by twining on other plants to capture sunlight ( Langeland and Craddock-Burks, 2008 ). D. alata is sensitive to aluminium toxicity in the soil but tolerates poorer soils than most other cultivated yam species. Cultivated Forms Dioscorea alata is the most important yam for Southeast Asia and is easily recognized by its quadrangular winged stems. The variability of the tubers in form, size, weight, colour and flesh is so great that in every country where it grows and is used, many forms, selections and cultivars exist, all with their own vernacular names. Because D. alata is not known as a wild plant in its original range, a classification into cultivar groups and cultivars is most suitable, but there is no satisfactory worldwide system. In a study of 235 different cultivars from all over the world ( Martin and Rhodes, 1977 ), 15 cultivar groups could be distinguished. The greatest variability was present in materials from New Guinea, Indonesia and the Philippines. Relevant groups for Southeast Asia include ( Purnomo et al., 2012 ): - cv. group Purple Compact. Plants with a large content of anthocyanin, especially in the petiole;

Overview
Appearance
Dioscorea alata
is an herbaceous, twining vine that can grow to lengths exceeding 30 ft. (9.1 m). It invades open to shady areas in the extreme southeastern United States.
Foliage
Leaves are opposite, 8 in. (20.3 cm) long and narrowly heart-shaped with long petioles. The stems are square with the corners compressed into wings.
Flowers
The vine rarely flowers.
Fruit
The chief means of reproduction is by aerial potato-like tubers (bulbils) located at the leaf axils and by underground tubers.
Ecological Threat
Dioscorea alata
can form dense masses of vines that cover and kill native vegetation including trees. It was introduced from Asia as a possible food source in the early 1800s. In some countries it is presently being cultivated for medicinal uses.
