Ambrosia confertiflora (Asteraceae) 
  
Why 
Ambrosia confertiflora (Asteraceae) is a perennial herb native to northern Mexico and 
the southwestern United States. One of its English common names is ‘burr ragweed’. 
This species has been introduced to Australia and Israel. A. confertiflora has severe 
agricultural and environmental impacts, and its pollen is a severe allergen. This 
species has a limited distribution in the EPPO region, and can be considered an 
emerging invader. 
Geographic distribution 
EPPO region: Israel. 
North America: USA (native) (Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii (alien), 
Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah). 
Central America and Caribbean: México (native) (Aguascalientes, Baja California 
Norte, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Colima, Durango, Guanajuato, 
Guerrero, Jalisco, México, Nuevo León, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa, Sonora, 
Tamaulipas and Zacatecas), Puerto Rico (alien). 
Oceania: Australia (alien) (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia). 
Note: In Israel, A. confertiflora began to spread in the Shechem area in central 
Samaria during the mid-1990s. It is now widespread in Samaria, especially along 
roads and in cultivated areas, but also in Nature Reserves such as wadi Qana. The 
plant spread westwards and is now present in the Emek Hefer area (Sharon region),

 confertiflora began to spread in the Shechem area in central 
Samaria during the mid-1990s. It is now widespread in Samaria, especially along 
roads and in cultivated areas, but also in Nature Reserves such as wadi Qana. The 
plant spread westwards and is now present in the Emek Hefer area (Sharon region), 
where 480 ha of riverbanks along the Alexander river are already heavily infested. 
The plant also spread eastward along wadi Tirza and has reached the Northern Jordan 
Valley. Additional foci were recently discovered along the Yarkon River, on the 
Carmel mount, in the Haifa region, in the southern part of Yizre'el valley in lower 
Galilee, and in the south near Gadera and in the Ashdod area.  
In Australia, the species was introduced into Queensland in 1950 and is confined to 
small colonies in the western Darling Downs and the Burnett Pastoral District. In New 
South Wales, populations occur on the Far Western and North Western Plains and on 
the Central Western Slopes, while in South Australia the species is only recorded in 
the surroundings of Adelaide. 
The species has been reported as present in the Dominican Republic (alien), but this 
could not be confirmed.  
Morphology 
A. confertiflora is an erect perennial herb reaching 75-200 cm high, forming large 
stands from creeping runner-like roots that are part of a very dense root system 
concentrated in the upper soil layer extending down to a depth of 30 cm.  
It has grey-green, bipinnate, fern-like leaves, 12-16 cm long and 10-15 cm wide. 
Flowers are yellow-green, and the species is monoec

 from creeping runner-like roots that are part of a very dense root system 
concentrated in the upper soil layer extending down to a depth of 30 cm.  
It has grey-green, bipinnate, fern-like leaves, 12-16 cm long and 10-15 cm wide. 
Flowers are yellow-green, and the species is monoecious. The female florets, without 
petals, form 1-flowered head, 5 mm long and 4 mm wide, clustered between the base 
of the upper leaves and the stems, and surrounded by a ring of spiny bracts. Male 
flowers are numerous and small, 1 cm in diameter, they consist of shortly stalked 
hemispherical heads (made up of many tiny male florets) which are grouped into 
branching spikes at the ends of the stems. In the male flowers, the bracts are not spiny 
and they are fused together. Fruits are achenes covered with 10-20 short, hooked 
spines, each containing one seed. The seeds are brown, woody, 3-4 mm in diameter. 
Biology and ecology 
A. confertiflora generally forms very dense stands and outcompetes many other 
plants. It reproduces from seeds and through vegetative propagation. The seeds 
germinate in autumn and the roots and runners are established during winter. Growth 
increases in spring and flower stems are produced in early summer. Flowering begins 
in mid-summer and continues until early autumn. The numerous spiny seeds are 
dispersed when they stick to the fur of mammals. Dispersal can also occur by flowing 
water, particularly during floods. Vegetative reproduction happens through adaptive 
buds found on spreading horizontal roots. The plants can renew

 flower stems are produced in early summer. Flowering begins 
in mid-summer and continues until early autumn. The numerous spiny seeds are 
dispersed when they stick to the fur of mammals. Dispersal can also occur by flowing 
water, particularly during floods. Vegetative reproduction happens through adaptive 
buds found on spreading horizontal roots. The plants can renew themselves five 
weeks after mowing. The plant spreads very fast both vegetatively and through seeds 
and is considered to have the fastest rate of spread among land invasive alien plants in 
Israel. Aerial growth dies back in autumn. 
Low winter temperatures, such as those found around the Mediterranean basin, do not 
seem to affect the plant’s survival. 
In which habitats 
A. confertiflora occurs in various natural and disturbed habitats, including dry plains 
and semi-arid valleys, run-down pastures, cultivated orchards, avocado and date 
groves, along roadsides, river-banks, and wadi beds, in wastelands and other disturbed 
areas. According to the CORINE land cover classification, the following habitats are 
suitable for the plant: arable land, pastures, sclerophyllous vegetation (e.g. garrigue, 
maquis); inland wetlands (marshes, peat bogs); banks of continental water, riverbanks 
/ canalsides (dry river beds), road and rail networks and associated land; other 
artificial surfaces (wastelands); green urban areas, including parks, gardens, sport and 
leisure facilities.  
Pathways 
A. confertiflora can spread naturally over short distances through creeping roots. The 
seeds can also be spread over long distances when the hooked spines attach to

 networks and associated land; other 
artificial surfaces (wastelands); green urban areas, including parks, gardens, sport and 
leisure facilities.  
Pathways 
A. confertiflora can spread naturally over short distances through creeping roots. The 
seeds can also be spread over long distances when the hooked spines attach to 
livestock and wild animals, or can be spread by water, especially during flooding, as 
the woody burr floats. 
The plant is spread through human activities when seeds attach to clothing and other 
fibrous material (e.g. tents). Root fragments may also be spread over long distance as 
a contaminant of machinery and vehicles, in particular agricultural machinery. It is 
unknown how A. confertiflora arrived in Australia. Seeds of the species are suspected 
to have entered Israel as contaminants in seed mixes imported from the United States 
for feeding birds and pond fish.  
Impacts  
Ambrosia confertiflora forms very dense stands. The plant is also a serious pest in 
cultivated fields, citrus groves and orchards in general, competing for nutrients, 
interfering with the harvest. In addition, the plant is unpalatable to stock and excludes 
other pastures plant and can therefore reduce carrying capacity. The burrs of the plant 
contaminate wool and can lower its value. 
The plant radically modifies the vegetation cover and consequently the whole 
ecosystem, readily suppressing understory native plants which results in 
environmental impacts, in particular in humid habitats and in pastures.  
As with the other Ambrosia species, A. confertiflora produces a large amount of 
pollen considered to be severely allergenic, causing hay fever and contact dermatitis

 cover and consequently the whole 
ecosystem, readily suppressing understory native plants which results in 
environmental impacts, in particular in humid habitats and in pastures.  
As with the other Ambrosia species, A. confertiflora produces a large amount of 
pollen considered to be severely allergenic, causing hay fever and contact dermatitis 
in susceptible people, although no report on this allergenic effect were found in Israel.  
The plant also invades gardens and parks and is reported to disrupt their maintenance. 
Control 
A. confertiflora is not effectively controlled by cultural practices. In fact, cultural 
practices usually makes the infestation worse by spreading pieces of the perennial root 
and stimulating development of root buds. Mechanical control can even exacerbate 
the intensity of the invasion, as the plant regenerates very quickly after mowing. 
Uprooting may only be effective against very young plants as otherwise, the root 
remains in the soil and the plant regenerates. A study conducted in Israel showed that 
natural vegetation restoration along river banks with Arundo donax and Arundo 
mediterranea (Poaceae) successfully prevented A. confertiflora re-establishment in 
previously infested areas. 
Herbicides such as glyphosate, triclopyr, and fluroxypyr are not very effective as the 
plant recovers quickly after the spraying. However, these herbicides are not registered 
for use in wetlands and riparian habitats. Though, herbicides have been recorded as 
providing satisfying results in controlling A. confertiflora in pastures in Australia. A 
recent experiment in Israel suggests imazapyr is effective in killing mature specimens 
of the burr ragweed.

Samaria during the mid-1990s. It is now widespread in Samaria, especially along 
roads and in cultivated areas, but also in Nature Reserves such as wadi Qana. The 
plant spread westwards and is now present in the Emek Hefer area (Sharon region), 
where 480 ha of riverbanks along the Alexander river are already heavily infested. 
The plant also spread eastward along wadi Tirza and has reached the Northern Jordan 
Valley. Additional foci were recently discovered along the Yarkon River, on the 
Carmel mount, in the Haifa region, in the southern part of Yizre'el valley in lower 
Galilee, and in the south near Gadera and in the Ashdod area.  
In Australia, the species was introduced into Queensland in 1950 and is confined to 
small colonies in the western Darling Downs and the Burnett Pastoral District. In New
