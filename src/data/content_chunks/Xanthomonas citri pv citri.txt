 Invasion: Xanthomonas citripv.citriis a Gram-negative, straight, rod-shaped bacterium measuring 1.5-2.0 x 0.5-0.75 µm. It is motile by means of a single, polar flagellum. It shares many physiological and biochemical properties with other members of the genusXanthomonas. It is chemoorganotrophic and obligately aerobic with the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Colonies are formed on nutrient agar plates containing glucose and are creamy-yellow with copious slime. The yellow pigment is xanthomonadin. Catalase is positive, but Kovacs' oxidase is negative or weak; nitrate reduction is negative. Asparagine is not used as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen simultaneously; various carbohydrates and organic acids are used as a sole source of carbon. Hydrolysis of starch, casein, Tween 80 and aesculin is positive. Gelatine and pectate gel are liquefied. Growth requires methionine or cysteine and is inhibited by 0.02% triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Biovars may be distinguished by utilization of mannitol. Strains of groups B, C and D (Xanthomonas citripv.aurantifolii) have many properties in common with group A (X. citripv.citri), the differences being

Strains of groups B, C and D (Xanthomonas citripv.aurantifolii) have many properties in common with group A (X. citripv.citri), the differences being detected by the utilization of only a few carbohydrates (Goto et al., 1980). Molecular and genomic features of citrus-attacking xanthomonads includingX. citripv.citriand the genusXanthomonasas a whole, have been characterized at the molecular level for the development of quick and accurate methods for reclassification and identification. The procedures include DNA-DNA hybridization (Vauterin et al., 1995), genomic fingerprinting (Lazo et al., 1987), fatty acid profiling (Yang et al., 1993), SDS-PAGE (Vauterin et al., 1991), isoenzyme profiles (Kubicek et al., 1989) and monoclonal antibodies. For further information on the bacteriological properties ofX. citripv.citri, seeVauterin et al. (1995)andSchaad et al. (2005).

 Reproduccion: Asiatic citrus canker occurs in areas of the world where high rainfall and high temperatures co-exist. In those areas, the disease occurs on seedlings and young trees in which there are continuous flushes of shoots from spring through autumn. However, the disease becomes sporadic as trees reach full fruiting development when flushes of growth occur sporadically. Leaves and stems are susceptible to infection for only a short time period after flushes begin growth. If weather conditions are not favourable for

 co-exist. In those areas, the disease occurs on seedlings and young trees in which there are continuous flushes of shoots from spring through autumn. However, the disease becomes sporadic as trees reach full fruiting development when flushes of growth occur sporadically. Leaves and stems are susceptible to infection for only a short time period after flushes begin growth. If weather conditions are not favourable for infection during the susceptibility period disease will not develop ( Stall et al., 1982 ). Fruit are susceptible for longer periods after set than are leaves and stems. Disease severity also depends on the susceptibility of the host plant species and cultivar ( Goto, 1992 ; Ference et al., 2018 ). Canker lesions are formed on the leaves, twigs and fruits of host plants. The occurrence of canker lesions on root systems in soil is not confirmed ( Reddy and Naidu, 1986 ). X. citri pv. citri can also be isolated from discoloured areas in bark on branches, limbs and trunks, however it is not certain whether these are novel lesions resulting from direct infection or scars remaining from infection at an earlier stage of growth ( Goto, 1992 ). A large number of X. citri pv. citri cells were isolated 3 years after inoculation, from the bark of the trunk of a 12-year-old lemon tree ( Goto, 1972 ). Exposures of leaves to wind and rain for 15 or 30 min will increase disease severity by 10-fold (Bock et al., 2012). Wind speed affects the quantity of X. citri pv. citri dispersed downwind within the canopy ( Bock et al., 2010 ). Splash-driven infection is the main route for the colonization of fruits ( Bock et al., 2011a , b; 2012). Biofilm formation on citrus leaves plays an important role in the epiphytic survival of X. citri pv. citri ( Yaryura et al

Biofilm formation on citrus leaves plays an important role in the epiphytic survival of X. citri pv. citri ( Yaryura et al., 2015 ). Differentially expressed proteins play a critical role in maintaining a functional external structure and enabling the appropriate flow of nutrients/signals specific to the biofilm lifestyle of X. citri pv. citri ( Zimaro et al., 2013 ). Exopolysaccharide production, motility and cell surface structures are determinant factors in biofilm formation and stability of the pathogen on host plant surfaces ( Malamud et al., 2013 ). Type III secretion system (T3SS) has a determinative role in the modulation of biofilm formation in X. citri pv. citri ( Zimaro et al., 2014 ). Deletion of the nrtT gene affects xantham gum synthesis, adhesion and biofilm production of the pathogen. Organic-sulfur sources are directly involved with bacterial infection in vivo and are needed for pathogenesis of X. citri pv. citri ( Sampaio et al., 2017 ). Xanthomonas citri pv. citri survives in diseased plant tissues from season to season which could be considered the primary inoculum source. It has been reported to survive as an epiphyte on host and non-host plants, and as a saprophyte on straw mulch or in soil. However, overwintering lesions, particularly those formed on angular shoots in the autumn, are the most important source of inoculum for the following season. Epiphytic populations of X. citri pv. citri were found on symptomless grapefruit and mandarin fruits

te on host and non-host plants, and as a saprophyte on straw mulch or in soil. However, overwintering lesions, particularly those formed on angular shoots in the autumn, are the most important source of inoculum for the following season. Epiphytic populations of X. citri pv. citri were found on symptomless grapefruit and mandarin fruits for as long as 6 and 5 days of incubation, respectively ( Al-Saleh and Ibrahim, 2010 ). Furthermore, the pathogen multiplies on red nightshade, black nightshade, bindweed, Chenopodium , common bean and wheat up to 20 days post-inoculation under greenhouse conditions ( Zarei et al., 2018 ). A high growth rate of X. citri pv. citri was observed on Medicago sativa and Plantago lanceolata upon artificial inoculation ( Ebrahimi et al., 2020 ). The overwintering bacterium forms lesions early in the following spring and a large number of bacteria disperse from these lesions. The bacterium can survive for long periods in discoloured bark tissue of tree trunks, low scaffold limbs and lateral branches. Tsuyumu et al. (2011) provided a comprehensive overview on the pathogenicity determinants of X. citri pv. citri . Molecular recognition events eliciting a virulence response were reported for Asiatic citrus canker. The protein from the expression of the pthA gene in the pathogen is secreted into the host cells through a functional type III secretion system. The pthA protein mobilizes to the nucleus of host cells and combines with DNA of the host cells. The transcription activation of host cells results in division, enlargement and death of hosts cells. One of the pthA homologues, Ap11 (avir/pthA-like), is thought to be a signal specific for canker formation

One of the pthA homologues, Ap11 (avir/pthA-like), is thought to be a signal specific for canker formation ( Kanamori and Tsuyumu, 1998 ; Almeida and Tsuyumu, 2000 ). X. citri pv. citri develops a characteristic biofilm on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. The presence of flagellum is required for mature biofilm development on lemon leaf surfaces. The absence of flagellin produced a slight reduction in X. citri pv. citri pathogenicity and this reduction will be more severe when the complete flagellum structure is absent ( Malamud et al., 2011 ). Yaryura et al. (2015) showed that mutation of XAC3733 (xbmR) results in impaired structural development of the X. citri pv. citri biofilm, loss of chemotaxis and reduced virulence in grapefruit plants. Furthermore, AvrGf1 contributes to the host range limitation while XopAF contributes to the virulence process ( Jalan et al., 2013a ). Complete or whole genome sequences of dozens of X. citri pv. citri strains have recently been released in public databases, e.g. NCBI GenBank ( Jalan et al., 2013b ; Munoz Bodnar et al., 2017; Richard et al., 2017; 2021; Zheng et al., 2022 ).

Southern Asia, e.g. the Indian subcontinent, is referred to as an area of relatively wide genetic diversity of X. citri pv. citri ( Vernière et al., 2013 ). Canker disease development is enhanced by salt stress. The physiological performance of plants was enhanced by X. citri pv. citri and X. citri pv. citri + moderate salt stress but then demolished under severe salt stress ( Nayem et al., 2020 ). A 14-minisatellite-based typing system was developed for the citrus canker bacterium (Ngoc et al., 2009). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, insertion sequence ligation-mediated PCR (IS-LM-PCR) typing and multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) techniques suggested that Asia is more likely to be the centre of origin of the pathogen. Goncalves-Zuliani et al. (2017) noted relatively high, yet uniform, genetic diversity among isolates and a low degree of spatial differentiation between populations of X. citri pv. citri in Paraná state, Brazil. All X. citri pv. citri strains in Iran were genetically related to pathotype A* ( Pruvost et al., 2015 ). Bui Thi Ngoc et al. (2009) report the occurrence in the Indian peninsula of strains genetically related to pathotype A* but with a host range similar to that of pathotype A, which makes the classification of this bacterium even more complicated. Nearly all X. citri pv. citri strains isolated from different regions in Japan are lysed by either phage Cp1 or Cp2. Cp1-sensitive (Cp1s) strains have been observed to

Nearly all X. citri pv. citri strains isolated from different regions in Japan are lysed by either phage Cp1 or Cp2. Cp1-sensitive (Cp1s) strains have been observed to be resistant to Cp2 (Cp2r) and vice versa ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). Clonal analysis of the core genome revealed the presence of two major lineages within X. citri pv. citri consisting of some clonal variants ( Bansal et al., 2017 ).
 Sintomas: Canker lesions begin as light yellow, raised, spongy eruptions on the surface of leaves, twigs and fruits. The lesions continuously enlarge from pin-point size over several months and can be of many different sizes based on the age of the lesion. As the lesions enlarge, the spongy eruptions begin to collapse, and brown depressions appear in their central portion, forming a crater-like appearance. The edges of the lesions remain raised above the surface of host tissue and the area around the raised portion of the lesion may have a greasy appearance. The lesions become surrounded by characteristic yellow halos. Canker lesions retain the erupted and spongy appearance under dry conditions; whereas they quickly enlarge and turn to flat lesions with a water-soaked appearance with frequent rain. Canker lesions vary in maximum size from 5 to 10 mm, depending on the susceptibility of the host plant. The symptoms are similar on leaves, fruit and stems ( Agrios, 2005 ; Ference et al., 2018 ). Canker lesions are histologically characterized by the development of a large number of hypertrophic cells and a small number of hyperplastic cells. At an early stage of infection, the cells increase in size and the

 to 10 mm, depending on the susceptibility of the host plant. The symptoms are similar on leaves, fruit and stems ( Agrios, 2005 ; Ference et al., 2018 ). Canker lesions are histologically characterized by the development of a large number of hypertrophic cells and a small number of hyperplastic cells. At an early stage of infection, the cells increase in size and the nuclei and nucleoids stain more easily; there is also an increase in the amount of cytoplasm synchronized with rapid enlargement. However, these hypertrophied cells do not divide; cell division is only detected in the peripheral areas of lesions adjacent to healthy tissue. The lesions of canker B, C and D are similar in appearance and histology to those of canker A ( Goto, 1992 ). Reddy and Naidu (1986) reported canker lesions on roots; however, this has not been confirmed.

 Invasion: Xanthomonas citripv.citriis a Gram-negative, straight, rod-shaped bacterium measuring 1.5-2.0 x 0.5-0.75 µm. It is motile by means of a single, polar flagellum. It shares many physiological and biochemical properties with other members of the genusXanthomonas. It is chemoorganotrophic and obligately aerobic with the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Colonies are formed on nutrient agar plates containing glucose and are creamy-yellow with copious slime. The yellow pigment is xanthomonadin. Catalase is positive, but Kovacs' oxidase is negative or weak; nitrate reduction is negative. Asparagine is not used as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen simultaneously; various carbohydrates and organic acids are used as a sole source of carbon. Hydrolysis of starch, casein, Tween 80 and aesculin is positive. Gelatine and pectate gel are liquefied. Growth requires methionine or cysteine and is inhibited by 0.02% triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Biovars may be distinguished by utilization of mannitol. Strains of groups B, C and D (Xanthomonas citripv.aurantifolii) have many properties in common with group A (X. citripv.citri), the differences being

Strains of groups B, C and D (Xanthomonas citripv.aurantifolii) have many properties in common with group A (X. citripv.citri), the differences being detected by the utilization of only a few carbohydrates (Goto et al., 1980). Molecular and genomic features of citrus-attacking xanthomonads includingX. citripv.citriand the genusXanthomonasas a whole, have been characterized at the molecular level for the development of quick and accurate methods for reclassification and identification. The procedures include DNA-DNA hybridization (Vauterin et al., 1995), genomic fingerprinting (Lazo et al., 1987), fatty acid profiling (Yang et al., 1993), SDS-PAGE (Vauterin et al., 1991), isoenzyme profiles (Kubicek et al., 1989) and monoclonal antibodies.

 Reproduccion: Asiatic citrus canker occurs in areas of the world where high rainfall and high temperatures co-exist. In those areas, the disease occurs on seedlings and young trees in which there are continuous flushes of shoots from spring through autumn. However, the disease becomes sporadic as trees reach full fruiting development when flushes of growth occur sporadically. Leaves and stems are susceptible to infection for only a short time period after flushes begin growth. If weather conditions are not favourable for

 co-exist. In those areas, the disease occurs on seedlings and young trees in which there are continuous flushes of shoots from spring through autumn. However, the disease becomes sporadic as trees reach full fruiting development when flushes of growth occur sporadically. Leaves and stems are susceptible to infection for only a short time period after flushes begin growth. If weather conditions are not favourable for infection during the susceptibility period disease will not develop ( Stall et al., 1982 ). Fruit are susceptible for longer periods after set than are leaves and stems. Disease severity also depends on the susceptibility of the host plant species and cultivar ( Goto, 1992 ; Ference et al., 2018 ). Canker lesions are formed on the leaves, twigs and fruits of host plants. The occurrence of canker lesions on root systems in soil is not confirmed ( Reddy and Naidu, 1986 ). X. citri pv. citri can also be isolated from discoloured areas in bark on branches, limbs and trunks, however it is not certain whether these are novel lesions resulting from direct infection or scars remaining from infection at an earlier stage of growth ( Goto, 1992 ). A large number of X. citri pv. citri cells were isolated 3 years after inoculation, from the bark of the trunk of a 12-year-old lemon tree ( Goto, 1972 ). Exposures of leaves to wind and rain for 15 or 30 min will increase disease severity by 10-fold (Bock et al., 2012). Wind speed affects the quantity of X. citri pv. citri dispersed downwind within the canopy ( Bock et al., 2010 ). Splash-driven infection is the main route for the colonization of fruits ( Bock et al., 2011a , b; 2012). Biofilm formation on citrus leaves plays an important role in the epiphytic survival of X. citri pv. citri ( Yaryura et al

Biofilm formation on citrus leaves plays an important role in the epiphytic survival of X. citri pv. citri ( Yaryura et al., 2015 ). Differentially expressed proteins play a critical role in maintaining a functional external structure and enabling the appropriate flow of nutrients/signals specific to the biofilm lifestyle of X. citri pv. citri ( Zimaro et al., 2013 ). Exopolysaccharide production, motility and cell surface structures are determinant factors in biofilm formation and stability of the pathogen on host plant surfaces ( Malamud et al., 2013 ). Type III secretion system (T3SS) has a determinative role in the modulation of biofilm formation in X. citri pv. citri ( Zimaro et al., 2014 ). Deletion of the nrtT gene affects xantham gum synthesis, adhesion and biofilm production of the pathogen. Organic-sulfur sources are directly involved with bacterial infection in vivo and are needed for pathogenesis of X. citri pv. citri ( Sampaio et al., 2017 ). Xanthomonas citri pv. citri survives in diseased plant tissues from season to season which could be considered the primary inoculum source. It has been reported to survive as an epiphyte on host and non-host plants, and as a saprophyte on straw mulch or in soil. However, overwintering lesions, particularly those formed on angular shoots in the autumn, are the most important source of inoculum for the following season. Epiphytic populations of X. citri pv. citri were found on symptomless grapefruit and mandarin fruits

te on host and non-host plants, and as a saprophyte on straw mulch or in soil. However, overwintering lesions, particularly those formed on angular shoots in the autumn, are the most important source of inoculum for the following season. Epiphytic populations of X. citri pv. citri were found on symptomless grapefruit and mandarin fruits for as long as 6 and 5 days of incubation, respectively ( Al-Saleh and Ibrahim, 2010 ). Furthermore, the pathogen multiplies on red nightshade, black nightshade, bindweed, Chenopodium , common bean and wheat up to 20 days post-inoculation under greenhouse conditions ( Zarei et al., 2018 ). A high growth rate of X. citri pv. citri was observed on Medicago sativa and Plantago lanceolata upon artificial inoculation ( Ebrahimi et al., 2020 ). The overwintering bacterium forms lesions early in the following spring and a large number of bacteria disperse from these lesions. The bacterium can survive for long periods in discoloured bark tissue of tree trunks, low scaffold limbs and lateral branches. Tsuyumu et al. (2011) provided a comprehensive overview on the pathogenicity determinants of X. citri pv. citri . Molecular recognition events eliciting a virulence response were reported for Asiatic citrus canker. The protein from the expression of the pthA gene in the pathogen is secreted into the host cells through a functional type III secretion system. The pthA protein mobilizes to the nucleus of host cells and combines with DNA of the host cells. The transcription activation of host cells results in division, enlargement and death of hosts cells. One of the pthA homologues, Ap11 (avir/pthA-like), is thought to be a signal specific for canker formation

One of the pthA homologues, Ap11 (avir/pthA-like), is thought to be a signal specific for canker formation ( Kanamori and Tsuyumu, 1998 ; Almeida and Tsuyumu, 2000 ). X. citri pv. citri develops a characteristic biofilm on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. The presence of flagellum is required for mature biofilm development on lemon leaf surfaces. The absence of flagellin produced a slight reduction in X. citri pv. citri pathogenicity and this reduction will be more severe when the complete flagellum structure is absent ( Malamud et al., 2011 ). Yaryura et al. (2015) showed that mutation of XAC3733 (xbmR) results in impaired structural development of the X. citri pv. citri biofilm, loss of chemotaxis and reduced virulence in grapefruit plants. Furthermore, AvrGf1 contributes to the host range limitation while XopAF contributes to the virulence process ( Jalan et al., 2013a ). Complete or whole genome sequences of dozens of X. citri pv. citri strains have recently been released in public databases, e.g. NCBI GenBank ( Jalan et al., 2013b ; Munoz Bodnar et al., 2017; Richard et al., 2017; 2021; Zheng et al., 2022 ).

Southern Asia, e.g. the Indian subcontinent, is referred to as an area of relatively wide genetic diversity of X. citri pv. citri ( Vernière et al., 2013 ). Canker disease development is enhanced by salt stress. The physiological performance of plants was enhanced by X. citri pv. citri and X. citri pv. citri + moderate salt stress but then demolished under severe salt stress ( Nayem et al., 2020 ). A 14-minisatellite-based typing system was developed for the citrus canker bacterium (Ngoc et al., 2009). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, insertion sequence ligation-mediated PCR (IS-LM-PCR) typing and multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) techniques suggested that Asia is more likely to be the centre of origin of the pathogen. Goncalves-Zuliani et al. (2017) noted relatively high, yet uniform, genetic diversity among isolates and a low degree of spatial differentiation between populations of X. citri pv. citri in Paraná state, Brazil. All X. citri pv. citri strains in Iran were genetically related to pathotype A* ( Pruvost et al., 2015 ). Bui Thi Ngoc et al. (2009) report the occurrence in the Indian peninsula of strains genetically related to pathotype A* but with a host range similar to that of pathotype A, which makes the classification of this bacterium even more complicated. Nearly all X. citri pv. citri strains isolated from different regions in Japan are lysed by either phage Cp1 or Cp2. Cp1-sensitive (Cp1s) strains have been observed to

Nearly all X. citri pv. citri strains isolated from different regions in Japan are lysed by either phage Cp1 or Cp2. Cp1-sensitive (Cp1s) strains have been observed to be resistant to Cp2 (Cp2r) and vice versa ( Ahmad et al., 2014 ). Clonal analysis of the core genome revealed the presence of two major lineages within X. citri pv. citri consisting of some clonal variants ( Bansal et al., 2017 ).
 Sintomas: Canker lesions begin as light yellow, raised, spongy eruptions on the surface of leaves, twigs and fruits. The lesions continuously enlarge from pin-point size over several months and can be of many different sizes based on the age of the lesion. As the lesions enlarge, the spongy eruptions begin to collapse, and brown depressions appear in their central portion, forming a crater-like appearance. The edges of the lesions remain raised above the surface of host tissue and the area around the raised portion of the lesion may have a greasy appearance. The lesions become surrounded by characteristic yellow halos. Canker lesions retain the erupted and spongy appearance under dry conditions; whereas they quickly enlarge and turn to flat lesions with a water-soaked appearance with frequent rain. Canker lesions vary in maximum size from 5 to 10 mm, depending on the susceptibility of the host plant. The symptoms are similar on leaves, fruit and stems ( Agrios, 2005 ; Ference et al., 2018 ). Canker lesions are histologically characterized by the development of a large number of hypertrophic cells and a small number of hyperplastic cells. At an early stage of infection, the cells increase in size and the

 to 10 mm, depending on the susceptibility of the host plant. The symptoms are similar on leaves, fruit and stems ( Agrios, 2005 ; Ference et al., 2018 ). Canker lesions are histologically characterized by the development of a large number of hypertrophic cells and a small number of hyperplastic cells. At an early stage of infection, the cells increase in size and the nuclei and nucleoids stain more easily; there is also an increase in the amount of cytoplasm synchronized with rapid enlargement. However, these hypertrophied cells do not divide; cell division is only detected in the peripheral areas of lesions adjacent to healthy tissue. The lesions of canker B, C and D are similar in appearance and histology to those of canker A ( Goto, 1992 ). Reddy and Naidu (1986) reported canker lesions on roots; however, this has not been confirmed.
