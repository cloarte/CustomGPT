 Invasion: P. canariensisis a large palm up to 18 m tall, with a thick erect trunk up to 1.2 m in diameter and a crown occupying the upper 2.5-4.5 m. Leaves up to 1.5-1.8 m long are alternate and pinnately compound, containing lanceolate leaflets 30-45 cm long with sharp spines 5-8 cm long on the lower half of the petiole. Flowers creamy yellow-white and open from a husk-like structure that appears periodically throughout the year, being dioecious with both males and female flowers occurring on dense, hanging bunches, though on separate trees. Fruit is an orange-brown to dark purple fleshy drupe, elliptical and 1-3 cm long, occurring in hanging clusters, each containing a single large seed. Adapted fromGilman and Watson (1994).

 Reproduccion: P. canariensis has a chromosome number of 36, the same as that of P. dactvlifera, P. reclinata and other species thatare known to be able to hybridise with it (Beal, 1937). Like P. dactylifera, P. canariensis is dioecious, and may not start to produce fruit until it is at least 5-10 years old. P. canariensis is often described as anemophilous (wind pollinated), though is likely to be pollinated, at least in part, by the weevil Neoderelomus piriformis (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Derelomini)( Meekijjaroenroj, 2004 ). The fruit ripens in summer. It is interesting to note that this pollinator now appears to be spreading, with first records on P. canariensis from France ( Piry and Gompel, 2002 ), and Israel, where it is also noted as an invasive species ( Friedman, 2006 ). P. canariensis trees, especially in more humid climates. It is a very slow growing tree especially in early establishment.

Various epiphytes are commonly seen growing in the crowns of large P. canariensis trees, especially in more humid climates. Organic matter tends to collect at the bases of fronds thus providing a suitable environment for such plants to grow and thrive. The palms are found growing on a wide variety of soils, and P. canariensis has an extensive root system for finding sub-surface water, and is also resistant to temporary waterlogging caused by sudden rains. In urban environments where P. canariensis is often introduced as an ornamental, this species can thrive in a variety of habitats and soil types ( Gilman and Watson, 1994 ). It can withstand light frosts when mature though it is frost-sensitive as a seedling and during early establishment. It can tolerate high temperatures and salt winds. It is found in its native range from 200-600 m altitude ( Santos Guerra, 1994 ).
