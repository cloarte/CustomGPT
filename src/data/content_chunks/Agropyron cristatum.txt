Fairway is a bunch wheatgrass of Siberian origin more widely grown inCanada than in the United States. It generally resembles crested wheatgrass but is finer stemmed and shorter than crested and yields less forage. It isespecially suited for dryland lawns and other turf planting because of itsdense growth and relatively fine texture. It is also used extensively forpasture and hay in Western Canada and to a more limited extent in the NorthernGreat Plains and Intermountain Region in the United States.
