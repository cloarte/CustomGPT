17 th Meeting of the Joint EPPO/IOBC Panel on Biological Control Agents Helsinki, 2024-10-08/10 Additions to PM 6/3 Biological control agents safely used in the EPPO region The Panel recommended the addition of Aeolothrips intermedius (Thysanoptera: Aeolothripidae) and Nephus includens (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to PM 6/3, Appendix 1 which lists biological control agents used for augmentative biological control. In addition, the Panel recommended the addition of Torymus sinensis (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) to PM 6/3, Appendix 2 which lists the classical biological control agents (BCAs) successfully established in the EPPO region. The dossiers will be presented to the Working Party on Phytosanitary Regulations in 2025 accompanied by an explanatory document reflecting the Panel’s discussion on these biological control agents. The Panel noted that currently PM 6/3 does not include any biological control agents used against invasive alien plants even though there are examples in the EPPO region that may fulfil the criteria for listing in the Standard. The Panel suggest dossiers could be developed on Stenopelmus rufinasus (Coleoptera: Brachyceridae) a biological control agent used against Azolla filiculoides and Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) which is utilised against Acacia longifolia . EPPO Standard PM 6/4 Decision-support scheme for import and release of biological control agents The Panel agreed to test the decision-support scheme with the augmentative biological control agent, Podisus maculiventris . This document will be developed in 2025 and presented to the Panel at the next meeting. Development of PM 6 Standards The Panel discussed and agreed on the structure of two new PM 6 Standards: (1

/4 Decision-support scheme for import and release of biological control agents The Panel agreed to test the decision-support scheme with the augmentative biological control agent, Podisus maculiventris . This document will be developed in 2025 and presented to the Panel at the next meeting. Development of PM 6 Standards The Panel discussed and agreed on the structure of two new PM 6 Standards: (1) Host range testing of arthropod biological control agents for invertebrate pests, (2) Assessing the establishment potential of non-indigenous augmentative biological control agents. Sub-groups of experts, including experts external to the Panel will commence development of these Standards in 2025. Information The Panel reviewed a case study for pre-emptive biological control of Diaphorina citri in the EPPO region. The Panel agreed some edits to the document and agreed other case studies like this could be developed and this information included on the EPPO website. The Panel agreed to develop one page information documents on specific aspects of biological control. In 2025, two documents will be produced explaining classical biological control and augmentative biological control. Platform on information exchange for biological control agents The Panel were informed that the EPPO Working Party on Phytosanitary Regulations agreed that a platform on information exchange for biological control agents should be developed. The Panel reviewed the specification for the development of the platform. EPPO Global Database The Panel noted the new feature in EPPO Global Database which links biological control agents from the EPPO Standard PM 6/3 with their targets, and vice versa.
