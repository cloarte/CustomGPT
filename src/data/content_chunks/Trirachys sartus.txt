 Invasion: EggsThe eggs are white, about 3-4 mm long.LarvaThe larvae are pale yellowish, covered with golden hairs, about 60-70 mm long, with black mandibles. They are like Cerambyx larvae, but more flat and without sharp constrictions between the abdominal segments (Plavilshtikov, 1940).AdultThe adult has an elongated, dark grey-brown body, 28-47 mm long, with elytra covered with short silvery hairs. Shiny, silvery spots form two irregular bands crossing the elytra. The male is usually smaller than the female. The male has antennae 2.5 times as long as the body, whereas the female antennae are shorter than the body.

 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: No encontrado
 Reproduccion: The adults emerge from April to mid-July. Shortly after leaving the pupation cells, the females lay eggs into cracks in the bark of trunks and large branches, and sometimes into old larval galleries. Between 1 and 3 eggs are laid at each site. Each female lays about 270 eggs. Egg development lasts 9-17 days. At first, the larva gnaws out a gallery in the bark without touching the cambium, but older larvae gnaw the alburnum so that the bark becomes quite thick in some places. This may result in the formation of bark holes, through which boring dust spills out. The larvae can reach 50-60 mm long by the end of the summer. The larvae penetrate into the wood, mainly in the apical part of the galleries, in the following spring or sometimes from the autumn. The wood gallery is oriented upwards at first, then turns downwards like a bow. The larva gnaws a chamber at the end of the bow-shaped gallery, the entrance to which is blocked with a plug composed of borings. Pupation takes place in June to August. Adult emergence occurs in July-September, but the adults do not leave the chambers until the following spring. The life cycle of T. sartus , therefore, takes 2 years (Pavlovskii and Shtakelberg, 1955; Ahmad et al., 1977 ; Maslov, 1988 ; Orlinskii et al., 1991 ; Vorontsov, 1995 ). The imago is found everywhere that its host occurs (tree groves, town boulevards, and small gardens or railway stations with 1-2 trees).

T. sartus causes a great deal of damage and can often destroy trees. The most visible damage is in town boulevards, railway stations and other places where trees can be entirely invaded by the larvae ( Plavilshtikov, 1940 ; Vorontsov, 1975).
 Sintomas: The large emergence holes of T. sartus may be seen on the trunks and branches of affected trees, and borings may be found at the base of these trees. Beetles may also be found sitting on the trunk of the tree. Wilting or dried leaves are symptoms of branch and tree dieback.
