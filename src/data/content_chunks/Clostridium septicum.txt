1. Reagent Name: Clostridium septicum Antitoxin 
2. Strain or Source: Not Applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 600 
4. Fill Date: June 28, 2012 
5. Expiration Date: February 28, 2029 
Precautions: This reagent does not present a hazard to laboratory personnel who manipulate the 
antitoxin provided standard laboratory practices are followed. 
6. Intended Use: IRP 600 serves as the standard antitoxin when determining C. septicum 
alpha antitoxin values using a toxin neutralization (TN) test in mice. 
7. Instructions for Use: C. septicum antitoxin IRP 600 contains 120 units of antitoxin. One 
mL of standard antitoxin containing 1.0 antitoxin unit per mL (AU/mL) is used when 
determining the antitoxin content of serum from animals vaccinated with product containing C. 
septicum toxoid. 
To conduct TN tests in mice at the 1 AU/mL level, dilute IRP 600 1:120. Prepare the dilution by 
transferring 1.0 mL of IRP 600 to 9 mL of diluent and transferring 1.0 mL of the 1:10 dilution to 
11 mL

11 mL of diluent. 
8. Test of Reagent: 
Determination of antitoxin titer – The antitoxin titer of IRP 600 was determined by injecting 
mice intravenously with 0.5 mL of diluted antitoxin mixed with 1.0 L+ dose of toxin (the 
smallest amount of toxin which, when mixed with 1.0 unit of antitoxin, causes death in at least 
80% of the animals within 72 hours) and 1.0 Lo dose of toxin (the largest amount of toxin which, 
when mixed with 1.0 unit of antitoxin, causes no deaths in any of the animals within 72 hours). 
The antitoxin titer was confirmed by comparing the results of mice injected with toxin-antitoxin 
mixtures containing 1.0 mL of IRP 600 possessing 1.0 unit of antitoxin to the results of mice 
injected with toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing 1.0 mL of C. septicum International antitoxin 
possessing 1.0 AU/mL.
