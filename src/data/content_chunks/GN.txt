Subject:  APHIS updates the Golden Nematode (Globodera rostochiensis) Regulated Area 
in Suffolk County in New York 
 
To:   State and Territory Agricultural Regulatory Officials  
 
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is removing 
11,648.25 acres from the golden nematode (GN) regulated area in Suffolk County, New York. 
 
APHIS is removing these acres based on survey results and other criteria listed in the "Canada 
and United States Guidelines on Surveillance and Phytosanitary Actions for the Potato Cyst 
Nematodes, Globodera rostochiensis, and Globodera pallida.” The attached Federal Order 
describes the regulated area and includes the associated reference to the 7 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) § 301.85-2(a), which lists the provisions for the movement of GN-regulated 
articles.  
 
Since 2010, APHIS, working closely with the New York State Department of Agriculture and 
Markets (NYS AGM), has removed 1,198,342.04 acres from the GN-regulated area in New York 
since 2010. Of the remaining 90,307.02 acres regulated in eight counties, APHIS considers 5,945 
acres to be infested with GN and has an active control and mitigation program in place to prevent 
its spread.  
 
APHIS will follow up with a notice of this change to the regulated area in the Federal Register. 
The specific GN-regulated areas are on the following website:

This Federal Order amends the golden nematode (GN) regulated areas in New York. 
Specifically, it reduces the overall regulated area in Suffolk County, New York.  
 
This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the authority provided by the Plant Protection Act of 
June 20, 2000, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture 
to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant part, or article, if 
the Secretary determines the prohibition or restriction is

This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the authority provided by the Plant Protection Act of 
June 20, 2000, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture 
to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant part, or article, if 
the Secretary determines the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the dissemination 
of a plant pest within the United States. The regulatory authority provided by 7 U.S.C. 7754 
allows the Secretary to issue orders to carry out this provision of the Plant Protection Act. This 
Federal Order is likewise issued pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Plant 
Protection Act found at 7 CFR 301.85 et. seq. 
 
Section 7 CFR § 301.85-2(a) allows the designation of less than an entire state as a GN regulated 
area only when the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 
has determined, as in this case, that the designation is adequate to prevent the interstate spread of 
GN. In addition, 7 CFR § 301.85-3(a)(1) requires that the state enforce an intrastate GN 
quarantine that is equivalent to federal GN regulations. The New York State Plant Regulatory 
Official has confirmed the establishment of intrastate regulated areas for GN that mirror the 
federal regulatory requirements as specified in 7 CFR § 301.85. 
This Federal Order updates the regulated areas in New York designated in the Code of Federal 
Regulations located at 7 CFR § 301.85-2a. 
Following a review of survey data, APHIS determined that 11,648.25 acres in Suffolk County, 
New York, qualify for deregulation in accordance with the criteria listed in 7 CFR § 301.85-2(c).

 regulated areas in New York designated in the Code of Federal 
Regulations located at 7 CFR § 301.85-2a. 
Following a review of survey data, APHIS determined that 11,648.25 acres in Suffolk County, 
New York, qualify for deregulation in accordance with the criteria listed in 7 CFR § 301.85-2(c). 
Accordingly, APHIS will no longer restrict the interstate movement of GN-regulated articles 
from these areas. We will, however, continue to regulate the remaining acres regulated for GN in 
New York.

FOR INFORMATION AND ACTION 
 DA-2022-35 
October 20, 2022 
  
 
Subject:  APHIS updates the Golden Nematode (Globodera rostochiensis) Regulated Area 
in Suffolk County in New York 
 
To:   State and Territory Agricultural Regulatory Officials  
 
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is removing 
11,648.25 acres from the golden nematode (GN) regulated area in Suffolk County, New York. 
 
APHIS is removing these acres based on survey results and other criteria listed in the "Canada 
and United States Guidelines on Surveillance and Phytosanitary Actions for the Potato Cyst 
Nematodes, Globodera rostochiensis, and Globodera pallida.” The attached Federal Order 
describes the regulated area and includes the associated reference to the 7 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) § 301.85-2(a), which lists the provisions for the movement of GN-regulated 
articles.  
 
Since 2010, APHIS, working closely with the New York State Department of Agriculture and 
Markets (NYS AGM), has removed 1,198,342.04 acres from the GN-regulated area in New York 
since 2010. Of the remaining 90,307.02 acres regulated in eight counties, APHIS considers 5,945 
acres to be infested with GN and has an active control and mitigation program in place to prevent 
its spread.  
 
APHIS will follow up with a notice of this change to the regulated area in the Federal Register. 
The specific GN-regulated areas are on the following website: 
 
https://www.aphis.usda.

This Federal Order amends the golden nematode (GN) regulated areas in New York. 
Specifically, it reduces the overall regulated area in Suffolk County, New York.  
 
This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the authority provided by the Plant Protection Act of 
June 20, 2000, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture 
to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant part, or article, if 
the Secretary determines the prohibition or restriction is

This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the authority provided by the Plant Protection Act of 
June 20, 2000, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture 
to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant part, or article, if 
the Secretary determines the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the dissemination 
of a plant pest within the United States. The regulatory authority provided by 7 U.S.C. 7754 
allows the Secretary to issue orders to carry out this provision of the Plant Protection Act. This 
Federal Order is likewise issued pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Plant 
Protection Act found at 7 CFR 301.85 et. seq. 
 
Section 7 CFR § 301.85-2(a) allows the designation of less than an entire state as a GN regulated 
area only when the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 
has determined, as in this case, that the designation is adequate to prevent the interstate spread of 
GN. In addition, 7 CFR § 301.85-3(a)(1) requires that the state enforce an intrastate GN 
quarantine that is equivalent to federal GN regulations. The New York State Plant Regulatory 
Official has confirmed the establishment of intrastate regulated areas for GN that mirror the 
federal regulatory requirements as specified in 7 CFR § 301.85. 
This Federal Order updates the regulated areas in New York designated in the Code of Federal 
Regulations located at 7 CFR § 301.85-2a. 
Following a review of survey data, APHIS determined that 11,648.25 acres in Suffolk County, 
New York, qualify for deregulation in accordance with the criteria listed in 7 CFR § 301.85-2(c).

Following a review of survey data, APHIS determined that 11,648.25 acres in Suffolk County, 
New York, qualify for deregulation in accordance with the criteria listed in 7 CFR § 301.85-2(c). 
Accordingly, APHIS will no longer restrict the interstate movement of GN-regulated articles 
from these areas. We will, however, continue to regulate the remaining acres regulated for GN in 
New York.
