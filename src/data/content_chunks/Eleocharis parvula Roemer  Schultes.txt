Eleocharis parvula(Roemer & Schultes) Link ex Bluff, Nees & Schauer - Dwarf Spike-rush  -Cyperaceae(Map updated: March 2008)This is a tiny plant which grows immersed in the estuarine mud around the mouth of the River Bann. The plant appears as tufts of dark green stems with tiny dingy flower spikes at the ends of each stem. The tufts are connected by runners below the mud surface. Visible only to a careful searcher, the plant has been seen by very few people, but in both the UK and Irish contexts the River Bann population is very significant.All names:Eleocharis parvula(Roemer & Schultes) Link ex Bluff, Nees & Schauer;Scirpus nanusSpreng., non Poir.;Scirpus parvulusRoem. & Schult.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
