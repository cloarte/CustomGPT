You now know about the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) beetle: how it hides under bark and destroys ash trees. You’ve discovered how important it is to stop 
it, so now you can share this news with others, too! Use this EAB Investigator to alert your family, friends, and neighbors. First, try to stump them with the 
EAB “investigation questions.” Then, share what you’ve learned through your own Stop the Beetle: Now! exploration: EAB larvae can be hidden under the 
bark, so you should never move ﬁ  rewood. You never know what could be lurking inside!     
EAB       Investigator
How can you 
stop EAB from 
spreading? 
The EAB is only 
½ inch long. What is 
the smallest coin 
an EAB can 
fit on? 
Where does 
EAB lay its 
eggs? 
What spreads 
EAB?
Ash trees
What’s metallic 
green and flies? 
Guitars, most baseball      
   bats, and some 
      furniture are made 
          of what kind of 
              wood? 
What species of tree does EAB love 
to eat? 
  How does the EAB 
     larvae kill a tree?

Folding Instructions 
1. Cut along the dotted line. 
2. Place the EAB Investigator image-side down. Fold 2 opposite corners 
together to form a triangle. Crease and unfold. Now fold the other 
2 corners together; crease and unfold. You’ll see the “center point.”
3. Fold each corner to the center point. 
4. Turn the folded paper over and fold each corner into the center. 
5. Fold the square in half. Unfold it and fold it in half the other way. 
6. Using both hands, place your thumbs and index fingers under 
the bark flaps. 
How to Play
•   Have a player pick a number between 1 and 5. 
Open/close the EAB Investigator that many times.
• Now have the player choose a number on a bark 
flap (noted by EAB eggs), from 1 to 4.
• Ask the question under the chosen flap.
• Invite the player to answer, then lift the flap to 
see if correct. 
• Be sure to show the
