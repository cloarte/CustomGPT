 Reproduccion: A. fragariae is an obligate parasite of above-ground plant parts and may be ecto- or endoparasitic. On strawberry it is ectoparasitic on folded crown and runner buds, feeding causing small, dry brown areas delimited by the midrib and major veins. The nematodes may be found feeding endoparasitically on leaf tissues and have occasionally been found in fruit pulp ( Tacconi, 1972 ). In violets, it is also ectoparasitic in the unopened leaf and flower buds and has been found within the ovary. It is endoparasitic in leaves of ferns, begonias, peonies, etc., the feeding causing leaf-blotch symptoms. The nematode enters the leaf through the stomata when the surface is covered with a thin film of water ( Klingler, 1970 ), or by penetrating the epidermis of the under surface ( Strümpel, 1967 ). Both A. fragariae and A. ritzemabosi showed peak populations in March to May and November to January and were influenced by moisture and temperature ( Szczygiel and Hasior, 1972 ).

Both A. fragariae and A. ritzemabosi showed peak populations in March to May and November to January and were influenced by moisture and temperature ( Szczygiel and Hasior, 1972 ). Reproduction and life cycleA. fragariae is bisexual and amphimictic with n=2 (A. ritzemabosi and A. besseyi are also amphimictic with n=4 and n=3, respectively) ( Cayrol and Dalmasso, 1975 ). In the leaves of Lorraine begonia the life cycle is completed in 10-11 days at 18°C. The eggs hatch in 4 days and the juveniles mature in 6-7 days; about 32 eggs are laid by a single female ( Strümpel, 1967 ).SurvivalThe nematode cannot survive in soil without a host for more than 3 months ( Szczygiel and Hasior, 1971 ). It survived in a dormant state in fern fronds buried in soil for at least 46 days (Stewart, 1921).No change in nematode population per number of hearts occurred when strawberry plants infested with A. fragariae and A. ritzemabosi were stored at temperatures of 14-15°C or in an unheated glasshouse in winter. However, at 20°C, the population increased several times. Under cold-storage conditions at -2 to -1°C it performed well in plant tissues ( Tacconi, 1972 ). Relatively few individuals of A. fragariae survived at -20°C ( Hirling, 1972 ).

Under dry conditions, A. fragariae survived in damaged lily leaves for more than 600 days ( Yamada and Takakura, 1987 ).InteractionsFeeding on strawberry crown affects feeding areas only (Crosse and Pitcher, 1952), but when involved with the bacterium, Corynebacterium fascians, cauliflower disease symptoms were produced; the bacterium alone causes galls and secondary crowns ( Pitcher and Crosse, 1958 ; Strümpel, 1968 ). In the USSR, A. fragariae and highly virulent strains of C. fascians are thought to be responsible for cauliflower symptoms and less virulent strains cause red plants or alaminate leaves (Drozdovski et al., 1971). In the Moscow region, analysis of A. fragariae-Corynebacterium fascians infection in strawberry fields showed the incidence of infection amongst plants established for 3 to 4 years to be 3 to 7 times higher than for those established for shorter periods ( Matveeva and Yakubovich, 1972 ).On Rieger begonias, in the presence of A. fragariae the bacterial leaf spot disease caused by Xanthomonas begoniae was more severe and developed more rapidly than when bacteria alone were present ( Riedel and Larsen, 1974 ). A. fragariae and Pseudomonas cichorii were found interacting and causing damage on Barleria cristata in a Florida nursery. This is the first report of this association ( Lehman and Miller, 1988 ). A. fragariae and bacteria together cause necrosis in fern fronds (Aggéry, 1935).

 Sintomas: On strawberry, A. fragariae causes malformations of the shoot such as twisting and puckering of leaves, discoloured areas with a hard and rough surface, undersized leaves with crinkled edges, reddening of petioles, short internodes of runners, reduced flower trusses with only one or two flowers and death of the crown bud ( Dicker, 1948 ; Franklin, 1950 ; Iyatomi and Nishizawa, 1951 ; Ogilvie and Thompson, 1936 ). Ectoparasitic feeding on folded crown and runner buds causes small dry, brown feeding areas which can be seen on expanded leaves usually near the mid-rib; occasionally the nematodes are found in strawberry fruit pulp ( Tacconi, 1972 ). Endoparasitic feeding within leaf tissue produces typical leaf-blotch symptoms. The strawberry disease referred to as Spring dwarf, Spring crimp and Red plant, may be due wholly or partly to A. fragariae; sometimes these symptoms could be due to other nematodes (A. ritzemabosi, Ditylenchus dipsaci) or caused by bacteria or frost.On flowering plant leaves, the feeding areas appear as irregular, water-soaked patches later turning brown, violet or purple. Stokes (1979) describes leaf lesions and bud abnormalities on ornamental plants caused by A. fragariae in Florida, USA. The nematode causes die-back disease of lilies, in which leaves, flower buds and fruits turn brown and die. Decay of buds of tree peonies in Japan due to A. fragariae has been reported

The nematode causes die-back disease of lilies, in which leaves, flower buds and fruits turn brown and die. Decay of buds of tree peonies in Japan due to A. fragariae has been reported ( Saigusa, 1968 ). Symptoms on Philippine violet (Barleria cristata) begin as chlorotic vein delineated areas which later change to light brown, then dark brown and finally black ( Lehman and Miller, 1988 ).In British ferneries, leaf-blotch symptoms are well marked during winter when vegetative growth is lowest ( Goodey, 1933 ). Typical water-soaked stripes on fronds of Western Sword-fern (Polystichum munitum) are seen during February-March in Oregon, USA, and the stripes turn brown in summer when the fern forest dries out ( Sandeno and Jensen, 1962 ). On ferns, for example, Pteris spp., leaf blotches or water-soaked areas occur in stripes, often chevron-like. It causes severe deformity of the fronds of Sphaeropteris cooperis.

Stokes (1979) describes leaf lesions and bud abnormalities on ornamental plants caused by A. fragariae in Florida, USA. The nematode causes die-back disease of lilies, in which leaves, flower buds and fruits turn brown and die. Decay of buds of tree peonies in Japan due to A. fragariae has been reported

 later turning brown, violet or purple. Stokes (1979) describes leaf lesions and bud abnormalities on ornamental plants caused by A. fragariae in Florida, USA. The nematode causes die-back disease of lilies, in which leaves, flower buds and fruits turn brown and die. Decay of buds of tree peonies in Japan due to A. fragariae has been reported ( Saigusa, 1968 ). Symptoms on Philippine violet (Barleria cristata) begin as chlorotic vein delineated areas which later change to light brown, then dark brown and finally black ( Lehman and Miller, 1988 ).In British ferneries, leaf-blotch symptoms are well marked during winter when vegetative growth is lowest ( Goodey, 1933 ). Typical water-soaked stripes on fronds of Western Sword-fern (Polystichum munitum) are seen during February-March in Oregon, USA, and the stripes turn brown in summer when the fern forest dries out ( Sandeno and Jensen, 1962 ). On ferns, for example, Pteris spp., leaf blotches or water-soaked areas occur in stripes, often chevron-like. It causes severe deformity of the fronds of Sphaeropteris cooperis.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology A. fragariae is an obligate parasite of above-ground plant parts and may be ecto- or endoparasitic. On strawberry it is ectoparasitic on folded crown and runner buds, feeding causing small, dry brown areas delimited by the midrib and major veins. The nematodes may be found feeding endoparasitically on leaf tissues and have occasionally been found in fruit pulp ( Tacconi, 1972 ). In violets, it is

The nematodes may be found feeding endoparasitically on leaf tissues and have occasionally been found in fruit pulp ( Tacconi, 1972 ). In violets, it is also ectoparasitic in the unopened leaf and flower buds and has been found within the ovary. It is endoparasitic in leaves of ferns, begonias, peonies, etc., the feeding causing leaf-blotch symptoms. The nematode enters the leaf through the stomata when the surface is covered with a thin film of water ( Klingler, 1970 ), or by penetrating the epidermis of the under surface ( Strümpel, 1967 ). Both A. fragariae and A. ritzemabosi showed peak populations in March to May and November to January and were influenced by moisture and temperature ( Szczygiel and Hasior, 1972 ). Reproduction and life cycleA. fragariae is bisexual and amphimictic with n=2 (A. ritzemabosi and A. besseyi are also amphimictic with n=4 and n=3, respectively) ( Cayrol and Dalmasso, 1975 ). In the leaves of Lorraine begonia the life cycle is completed in 10-11 days at 18°C. The eggs hatch in 4 days and the juveniles mature in 6-7 days; about 32 eggs are laid by a single female ( Strümpel, 1967 ).SurvivalThe nematode cannot survive in soil without a host for more than 3 months ( Szczygiel and Hasior, 1971 ). It survived in a dormant state in fern fronds buried in soil for at least 46 days (Stewart, 1921

It survived in a dormant state in fern fronds buried in soil for at least 46 days (Stewart, 1921).No change in nematode population per number of hearts occurred when strawberry plants infested with A. fragariae and A. ritzemabosi were stored at temperatures of 14-15°C or in an unheated glasshouse in winter. However, at 20°C, the population increased several times. Under cold-storage conditions at -2 to -1°C it performed well in plant tissues ( Tacconi, 1972 ). Relatively few individuals of A. fragariae survived at -20°C ( Hirling, 1972 ). Under dry conditions, A. fragariae survived in damaged lily leaves for more than 600 days ( Yamada and Takakura, 1987 ).InteractionsFeeding on strawberry crown affects feeding areas only (Crosse and Pitcher, 1952), but when involved with the bacterium, Corynebacterium fascians, cauliflower disease symptoms were produced; the bacterium alone causes galls and secondary crowns ( Pitcher and Crosse, 1958 ; Strümpel, 1968 ). In the USSR, A. fragariae and highly virulent strains of C. fascians are thought to be responsible for cauliflower symptoms and less virulent strains cause red plants or alaminate leaves (Drozdovski et al., 1971). In the Moscow region, analysis of A. fragariae-Corynebacterium fascians infection in strawberry fields showed the incidence of infection amongst plants established for 3 to 4 years to be 3 to 7 times higher than for those established for

In the Moscow region, analysis of A. fragariae-Corynebacterium fascians infection in strawberry fields showed the incidence of infection amongst plants established for 3 to 4 years to be 3 to 7 times higher than for those established for shorter periods ( Matveeva and Yakubovich, 1972 ).On Rieger begonias, in the presence of A. fragariae the bacterial leaf spot disease caused by Xanthomonas begoniae was more severe and developed more rapidly than when bacteria alone were present ( Riedel and Larsen, 1974 ). A. fragariae and Pseudomonas cichorii were found interacting and causing damage on Barleria cristata in a Florida nursery. This is the first report of this association ( Lehman and Miller, 1988 ). A. fragariae and bacteria together cause necrosis in fern fronds (Aggéry, 1935).
