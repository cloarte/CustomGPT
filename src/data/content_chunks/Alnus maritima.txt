Uses
Since in its narrower sense; this species has a very limited
distribution (including one transplant in my back yard), there is little
economic botany data on this species. Van Steenis has elected to include
Alnus japonica
as a synonym of
Alnus maritime
.  He notes that it
has been planted for reafforestation purposes on eroded slopes in the
Philippines.  Amerindians had a wide array of uses for alder, for dyestuffs,
insect repellant or insecticide, but mostly for folk medicine.  Fernald,
Kinsey, and Rollins (1958) relate that "the inner bark is a possible emergency
food.  The young bark and winter buds are popular nibbles with country boys,
not alone for their tolerable flavor, but particularly for the beautiful,
olive-brown saliva produced."  Bees use the pollen to rear their spring broods.
None of these uses were specific to
Alnus maritime
.
Folk Medicine
According to Hartwell (1967–1970), the alders are used in folk remedies
for cancers, indurations and/or tumors, especially of the breast, epithelium,

Folk Medicine
According to Hartwell (1967–1970), the alders are used in folk remedies
for cancers, indurations and/or tumors, especially of the breast, epithelium,
duodenum, esophagus, face, lip, pancreas, pylorus, rectum, throat, tongue, and
uterus.  Reported to be astringent and depurative, closely related
Alnus
serrulata
is a folk remedy for bruises, burns, diarrhea, eye, hematuria,
malaria, poison ivy, scalds, sores, syphilis, and wounds (Duke and Wain, 1981).
Erichsen-Brown (1979) lists many other uses of the alder; e.g. the Potawatomi
Indians made a bark tea for flushing the vagina or to shrink hemorrhoids via
rectal syringe.  None of these are specific to
Alnus maritima
, just
generic.
Chemistry
Alnus serrulata
is said to contain a sedoheptulose.
Description
Shrub or small tree to 10 m tall; bark light brown to reddish-brown,
occasionally mottled with gray, with small orange-colored lenticels on younger
branches.  Twigs reddish-brown and glabrous in winter; buds ovoid, acute, about
6 mm long, with some pale pubescence.  Leaves oblong, ovate, or obovate, 7.5–10
cm long, 3.7–5 cm wide, dark green above, glandular dotted below; margins

6 mm long, with some pale pubescence.  Leaves oblong, ovate, or obovate, 7.5–10
cm long, 3.7–5 cm wide, dark green above, glandular dotted below; margins
remotely serrulate; tips acuminate or rounded; bases cuneate; petioles 12–18 mm
long.  Staminate aments green at first, becoming dark orange-brown, 3.75–6.5 cm
long, pistillate catkins peduncled, 3 mm long at first, green tinged with red
toward tip, enlarging the following spring, becoming broad-ovoid cones, 1.5–3
cm long; nutlets ovate to obovate, 3–4 mm long; wings narrow (Brown and Brown,
1972).
Germplasm
Reported from the American Center of Diversity, seaside alder, or cvs
thereof, is reported to tolerate frost, poor soil, and some salinity and
waterlogging.
Alnus maritima
"seems to be more affected by water stress
and must be closer to a reliable source of water than
Alnus serrulata
to
survive" (Stibolt, 1978).  2
n
= 28.
Distribution
In the narrow sense,
Alnus maritima
occurs on the Delmarva
Peninsula (four counties in Maryland, one in Delaware), two counties near the
Red River in Oklahoma.  "Because of its restricted range and susceptibility of

Distribution
In the narrow sense,
Alnus maritima
occurs on the Delmarva
Peninsula (four counties in Maryland, one in Delaware), two counties near the
Red River in Oklahoma.  "Because of its restricted range and susceptibility of
the habitat to alteration by man's activities,
Alnus maritima
should be
considered as threatened" as proposed in the Report on Endangered and
Threatened Plant Species of the United States."  (Stibolt, 1978).  The peculiar
disjunction DelmarvaOklahoma has been postulated by Reed (pers. commun.) to
reflect Indian transplant, perhaps of a medicinal species.  Perhaps they did
not distinguish the species from other alders that they used.
Ecology
Probably ranging from Warm Temperate Dry through Moist Forest Life
Zones, seaside alder is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 9.5 to 40
dm, annual temperature of 13. 5 to 18°C, and pH of 6. 1 to 8. 1.  Although
the Oklahoma site has the higher annual temperature, it is subject to about the
same number of freezes and thaws as the Delmarva sites.  Generally restricted
to damp or wet soils in sunny areas, most often at the edges of ponds, rivers,
or streams.  Perhaps due to their N-fixing ability, they can survive on N-poor
soils.  Mg levels ranged from 75–150 ppm, P

(1981) states that it flourishes only in cooler parts of the Philippines, e.g.
around Baguio at ca 1500–1800 m, annual precipitation ca 40 dm (164 in.) and
annual temperature ca 18.5°C (64.8°F).
Cultivation
No data uncovered.
Harvesting
Can be harvested for fuel as needed.
Yields and Economics
Since this is proposed as a threatened or endangered species, there is little
data on its productivity.  Perhaps it or its hybrids with other alder species
could equal the annual productivity of other alders now being considered for
biomass or pulp production.
Energy
According to the phytomass files (Duke, 1981b), annual productivity of
other
Alnus
spp. ranges from 5 to 26 MT/ha.  Citing literature yields of
58–229 kg N/ha, Aspiras noted that
Casuarina equisetifolia
fixes 1,742
nmoles C2H4/24 hrs/g dry weight, compared to 4,479 for

reaches a certain level, root nodulation is reduced and no net increase occurs
(Stibolt, 1978).  "The degree of nitrogen fixation in alder nodules usually
exceeds that in legume nodules on a per weight basis."  (Stibolt, 1978).
Comparing
Alnus serrulata
,
Stibolt found its nodules had higher
nitrogenase activity, while
Alnus maritima
nodules had higher fixation
rates some of the time.  Twenty-four hours after collection,
Aluns
serrulata
activitiy was reduced while that of
Alnus maritima
was
retained longer or even increased.  In spite of this Stibolt concluded that,
overall "
A. serrulata
has some advantage in the ability to fix
nitrogen.
Biotic Factors
No data uncovered.
