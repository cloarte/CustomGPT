Sonneratiaceae Shahina Ghazanfar National Herbarium, Agricultural Research Council, Rawalpindi. Mangrove or seacoast trees. Leaves simple, opposite, exstipulate. Flowers conspicuous, bisexual; l-3 or in corymbs, usually terminal, ebracteate. Sepals persistent, 4-8 united, segmented at the top; valvate. Petals 4-8, alternating with the sepals, or absent.

A family of two genera, one confined to SE Asia and Malaysia, the other extending from tropical East Africa to N. Australia and Polynesia. Represented here by 1 species. Sonneratiaceae has previously been included in Lythraceae or Punicaceae, but has been separated on account of its superior, 4-multilocular ovary, ebracteate flowers and hygrophilous habit.Acknowledgements: We are grateful to the United States Department of Agriculture for financing this research under PL.480.
