APHIS-Authorized Disinfectants for Use When Handling APHIS 
Regulated Garbage 
Entities wishing to handle garbage regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must be approved to do so and 
have a regulated garbage compliance agreement. Approval granted by APHIS to handle APHIS 
regulated garbage does not reduce or eliminate any entity of their legal duty and responsibility to 
comply with all other applicable Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements. By signing a 
regulated garbage compliance agreement with APHIS or United States Customs and Border 
Protection, the signatory certifies that his/her establishment has met or will meet the 
requirements of all applicable environmental protection laws prior to handling garbage regulated 
by APHIS under the authority of USDA.
