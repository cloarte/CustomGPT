T. granulosus is the female and T. similis the male of R. similis, T. granulosus having page priority over T. similis. To preserve the well known name similis for this widely distributed economic pest,Sher (1968)proposed its retention, regarding T. granulosus as a senior synonym.SEM studies of populations of R. similis collected from different countries showed differences in morphological characteristics, especially in the number of anterior hypoptygmata in the males and annules terminating the vulva of the females.

 Reproduccion: R. similis is a migratory endoparasitic species which completes its life cycle within the root cortex and tissues of corms and tubers.In bananas, penetration occurs mostly near the root tips, but nematodes can invade along the entire length of the root. Females and all juvenile stages are infective although males, morphologically degenerate (without stylet), are probably not parasitic. After entering the roots of banana, the nematodes occupy an intercellular position in the cortical parenchyma where they feed on the cytoplasm of nearby cells, causing cavities which then coalesce to appear as tunnels. Invasion of the stele is never observed, even in heavily infected roots. The presence of lignified and suberized layers in endodermal cells of endodermal layers limits invasion of the vascular bundle by R. similis. Phenolic compounds play a significant role in the host plant's defence response to the nematode. High levels of lignin, flavanoids, dopamine, cafeic esters and ferulic acids were associated with low levels of penetration in resistant cultivars ( Valette et al., 1998b ). It is within infected tissues that females lay their eggs, with an average of four to five eggs per day for 2 weeks. The complete life cycle from egg to egg spans 20-25 days at a temperature range of 24-32°C, the eggs hatch after 8-10 days and the juvenile stages are completed in 10-13

 in resistant cultivars ( Valette et al., 1998b ). It is within infected tissues that females lay their eggs, with an average of four to five eggs per day for 2 weeks. The complete life cycle from egg to egg spans 20-25 days at a temperature range of 24-32°C, the eggs hatch after 8-10 days and the juvenile stages are completed in 10-13 days ( Gowen and Quénéhervé, 1990 ; Loos, 1962 ).In absence or reduced densities of competitors such as Helicotylenchus multicinctus, high populations of R. similis colonize the entire set of banana roots. The presence of competitors reduces the density of R. similis in the soil and roots and restricts it to the areas close to the rhizome (Queneherve, 1990).R. similis forms a disease complex with Fusarium oxysporum f.sp cubense and the damage caused by R.similis was greater in the presence of the fungus. The percentage of root rots caused by the fungus was 6.5% in the presence of R. similis and 4% with the fungus alone ( Abdel-Hadi et al., 1987 ).In tea, R. similis is attracted to the growing part of the roots. It enters the cortical region and feeds on the cells, destroying them. Being an endoparasite, most of the population is found within the feeder roots in young tea. However, when the parasitized roots are severely damaged or become overparasitized, they move into the soil in search of fresh roots. In mature tea fields, large populations can be encountered within the roots and in the rhizosphere of infested bushes. Field observations and differential host trials indicate that different biological races of R. similis exist in tea areas ( Gnanapragasam et al., 1991 ); this has been confirmed by

Field observations and differential host trials indicate that different biological races of R. similis exist in tea areas ( Gnanapragasam et al., 1991 ); this has been confirmed by RAPD analysis ( Hahn et al., 1994 ). R. similis is sensitive to cold and favours warm temperatures and moist soil conditions. In very wet or dry soil, populations of the nematode are found to decline ( Gnanapragasam, 1993 ).When P. loosi and R. similis are inoculated together on tea grown at high altitudes, the former rapidly takes over the latter by competitive displacement ( Campos et al., 1990 ). On the other hand, when the tea cultivar is more susceptible to R. similis, populations of this species build up more than P. loosi at warmer temperatures ( Gnanapragasam, 1991 ). In borderline areas, suitable for the build up of both species, it is common to encounter both R. similis and P. loosi. In semi-dry areas, R. similis also occurs with R. reniformis.Soil type and texture has a significant influence on the reproductive rate and population build up of R. similis. Detailed experiments carried out in a temperature controlled water bath (25±1°C) showed the population to build up most rapidly in sandy soil, followed by gravelly or loamy soil. There was hardly any build up in clay soils. Damage to tea was significantly greater in gravelly soil, followed by sandy, then loamy soil ( Gnanapragasam, 1990 ).In coconut, R. similis takes about 25 days at 25-28°C to complete its life cycle.

Damage to tea was significantly greater in gravelly soil, followed by sandy, then loamy soil ( Gnanapragasam, 1990 ).In coconut, R. similis takes about 25 days at 25-28°C to complete its life cycle. Most juveniles and adults, including gravid females, infest healthy, succulent root tips. In the field, the nematode can survive for 6 months in moist soil (27-36°C) and only 1 month in dry soil (29-39°C). Under glasshouse conditions it survives for longer periods: 15 months in moist soil (25.5-28.5°C) and 3 months in dry soil (27-31°C) ( Griffith and Koshy, 1990 ).The fungi Cylindrocarpon effusum, C. lucid and Cylindrocladium clavatum have been recorded in association with lesions produced by R. similis. When these fungi were inoculated simultaneously with the nematode, the rate of multiplication of R. similis was reduced, as was damage to coconut seedlings ( Sosamma and Koshy, 1978 , 1983; Koshy and Sosamma, 1987 ). Inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi also brought about a reduction in the population of R. similis ( Koshy et al., 1998 ; Sosamma et al., 1999 ).In black pepper, R. similis penetrates roots within 24 hours of inoculation and the cells around the site of penetration become brown. Nematodes do not enter the stelar portions of the root, but plugging of xylem vessels with a gum-like substance has been reported.

Nematodes do not enter the stelar portions of the root, but plugging of xylem vessels with a gum-like substance has been reported. The life cycle is completed within 25-30 days, at a temperature range of 21-31°C. In India, the maximum nematode population in roots of pepper occurs during September-October and the minimum population during April-June ( Koshy and Bridge, 1990 ).R. similis takes about 25-30 days to complete its life cycle on arecanut seedlings at 21-31°C under glasshouse conditions. The population of R. similis in arecanut fluctuates at different times of the year. In India, the maximum populations occur in the roots during 0ctober-November and minimum populations during March-June. Populations are also known to vary depending on the type of roots, palms, groves and soil types during the same period ( Koshy and Sosamma, 1978 ).The occurrence of R. similis was greater in sandy loam soil (42.3%) followed by laterite (29.6%) and alluvial 28.0%) soils. The maximum number of nematodes recorded was 139 per gram of root (Koshy et al., 1978).
 Sintomas: BananasThe most obvious symptom of attack of R. similis on banana is the toppling over or uprooting of plants, especially those bearing fruit, but there is a range in damage severity, from the lengthening of the vegetative cycle to the drastic reduction in bunch weight. This reveals two types of damage that can occur in banana plantations; that affecting the anchorage of the plant, and less apparent, the effect on the plant's ability to take up water and

 is the toppling over or uprooting of plants, especially those bearing fruit, but there is a range in damage severity, from the lengthening of the vegetative cycle to the drastic reduction in bunch weight. This reveals two types of damage that can occur in banana plantations; that affecting the anchorage of the plant, and less apparent, the effect on the plant's ability to take up water and nutrients and the subsequent effect on yield.Macroscopically, several dark red lesions appear on the outer part of the root, penetrating throughout the cortex but not into the stele; adjacent lesions may coalesce and the cortical root tissue atrophies and later turns black. In heavy infestations the lesion girdles the roots. Nematodes migrate from infected roots into the corm causing black lesions which may then spread around the corm. Roots emerging become infected as they grow out of the corm. Uprooting occurs commonly in windstorms or if heavy rains loosen the soil ( Gowen and Quénéhervé, 1990 ).Black PepperR. similis on black pepper is associated with pepper yellows (slow-wilt) disease, which appears as pale yellow or whitish-yellow drooping leaves on the vines. The number of such leaves increases gradually until large numbers of leaves, or even the entire foliage, become yellow. Yellowing is followed by shedding leaves, cessation of growth and dieback symptoms. The symptoms are well pronounced when soil moisture is depleted. Within 3-5 years of initiation of yellowing, all the leaves are shed and death of the vine takes place; hence the name slow-wilt disease.In bearing vines, shedding of inflorescences is a major symptom. Large numbers of shed inflorescences are seen at the base of affected vines. In large plantations, affected patches become conspicuous initially as yellowed plants, and later with large numbers of barren standards that have lost the vines, or standards supporting dead vines without

 death of the vine takes place; hence the name slow-wilt disease.In bearing vines, shedding of inflorescences is a major symptom. Large numbers of shed inflorescences are seen at the base of affected vines. In large plantations, affected patches become conspicuous initially as yellowed plants, and later with large numbers of barren standards that have lost the vines, or standards supporting dead vines without any leaves. Young and old plants are affected and the replanted vines normally die within 2 years.The tender, thin, white feeding roots show typical orange- to purple-coloured lesions. Lesions are not clearly seen on older roots, being brown in colour. The root system exhibits extensive rotting and this results in a lack of fine feeder roots from the main roots. Extensive necrosis of larger lateral roots develops subsequently ( Koshy and Bridge, 1990 ).GingerGinger plants infected with R. similis exhibit stunting, reduced vigour and tillering. The topmost leaves become chlorotic with scorched tips. Affected plants tend to mature and dry out faster than unaffected healthy plants. Incipient infections of the rhizomes are evidenced by small, shallow, sunken, water-soaked lesions. The nematodes migrate intracellularly through tissues, producing large infection channels or galleries within the rhizomes.CoconutIn coconut, R. similis causes non-specific general decline symptoms such as stunting, yellowing, reduction in number and size of leaves and leaflets, delay in flowering, button shedding and reduced yield. R. similis infestation produces small, elongate, orange-coloured lesions on tender creamy-white roots. Tender roots of coconut seedlings with heavy infestation become spongy in texture. Surface cracks develop on the semi-hard, orange-coloured main roots. Lesions and rotting are confined to the tender portions of the root. Lesions are also not conspicuous on the

Surface cracks develop on the semi-hard, orange-coloured main roots. Lesions and rotting are confined to the tender portions of the root. Lesions are also not conspicuous on the secondary and tertiary roots as these are narrow and rot quickly on infestation ( Griffith and Koshy, 1990 ).ArecanutPlants infested with R. similis induces 'yellow leaf' disease. Infestation produces small, elongate, orange lesions in young, succulent, creamy-white to light-orange portions of the main and lateral roots. The adjoining lesions coalesce and cause extensive rotting ( Sundararaju, 1984 ) . TeaTea plants infested with R. similis show similar symptoms to those caused by Pratylenchus loosi, such as stunting with twiggy branches, defoliation, premature flowering and fruiting. The roots of infested plants are sparse and dried compared with the whitish, succulent feeder roots of healthy plants. Although R. similis produces lesions on tea roots, they are very small compared to those formed by P. loosi ( Gnanapragasam, 1983 ).

The population of R. similis in arecanut fluctuates at different times of the year. In India, the maximum populations occur in the roots during 0ctober-November and minimum populations during March-June. Populations are also known to vary depending on the type of roots, palms, groves and soil types during the same period ( Koshy and Sosamma, 1978 ).The occurrence of R. similis was greater in sandy loam soil (42.3%) followed by laterite (29.6%) and alluvial 28.0%) soils. The maximum number of nematodes recorded was 139 per gram of root (Koshy et al., 1978).

Breadcrumb Home News and Updates Program Update APHIS Approves California FRSMP Petition for Burrowing Nematode (Radopholus similis) APHIS Approves California FRSMP Petition for Burrowing Nematode (Radopholus similis) Print The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) approved the Federally Recognized State Managed Phytosanitary (FRSMP, pronounced “free-stamp”) program petition from California for Radopholus similis, also known as the burrowing nematode. This is APHIS’ third State-managed phytosanitary program recognized in California and the first FRSMP program for this pest. APHIS established the FRSMP program to promote greater consistency in actions taken against certain plant pests, whether those pests arrive at U.S. ports of entry or are moving interstate. By better harmonizing import and interstate requirements, APHIS strengthens its ability to advocate for safe, fair, and reciprocal treatment of U.S. exports by our trading partners. For additional information about the FRSMP program go to the APHIS Federally Recognized State Managed Phytosanitary Program web page. Under International Plant Protection Convention Standards, Radopholus similis is considered to be a pest that is present only in some areas of the United States. APHIS recognizes California’s official control program. APHIS recognition will justify actions ordered by APHIS officials to mitigate the risk when a pest covered under a FRSMP program is moving in foreign commerce and intercepted at a U.S port of entry.

 Reproduccion: R. similis is a migratory endoparasitic species which completes its life cycle within the root cortex and tissues of corms and tubers.In bananas, penetration occurs mostly near the root tips, but nematodes can invade along the entire length of the root. Females and all juvenile stages are infective although males, morphologically degenerate (without stylet), are probably not parasitic. After entering the roots of banana, the nematodes occupy an intercellular position in the cortical parenchyma where they feed on the cytoplasm of nearby cells, causing cavities which then coalesce to appear as tunnels. Invasion of the stele is never observed, even in heavily infected roots. The presence of lignified and suberized layers in endodermal cells of endodermal layers limits invasion of the vascular bundle by R. similis. Phenolic compounds play a significant role in the host plant's defence response to the nematode. High levels of lignin, flavanoids, dopamine, cafeic esters and ferulic acids were associated with low levels of penetration in resistant cultivars ( Valette et al., 1998b ). It is within infected tissues that females lay their eggs, with an average of four to five eggs per day for 2 weeks. The complete life cycle from egg to egg spans 20-25 days at a temperature range of 24-32°C, the eggs hatch after 8-10 days and the juvenile stages are completed in 10-13

 in resistant cultivars ( Valette et al., 1998b ). It is within infected tissues that females lay their eggs, with an average of four to five eggs per day for 2 weeks. The complete life cycle from egg to egg spans 20-25 days at a temperature range of 24-32°C, the eggs hatch after 8-10 days and the juvenile stages are completed in 10-13 days ( Gowen and Quénéhervé, 1990 ; Loos, 1962 ).In absence or reduced densities of competitors such as Helicotylenchus multicinctus, high populations of R. similis colonize the entire set of banana roots. The presence of competitors reduces the density of R. similis in the soil and roots and restricts it to the areas close to the rhizome (Queneherve, 1990).R. similis forms a disease complex with Fusarium oxysporum f.sp cubense and the damage caused by R.similis was greater in the presence of the fungus. The percentage of root rots caused by the fungus was 6.5% in the presence of R. similis and 4% with the fungus alone ( Abdel-Hadi et al., 1987 ).In tea, R. similis is attracted to the growing part of the roots. It enters the cortical region and feeds on the cells, destroying them. Being an endoparasite, most of the population is found within the feeder roots in young tea. However, when the parasitized roots are severely damaged or become overparasitized, they move into the soil in search of fresh roots. In mature tea fields, large populations can be encountered within the roots and in the rhizosphere of infested bushes. Field observations and differential host trials indicate that different biological races of R. similis exist in tea areas ( Gnanapragasam et al., 1991 ); this has been confirmed by

Field observations and differential host trials indicate that different biological races of R. similis exist in tea areas ( Gnanapragasam et al., 1991 ); this has been confirmed by RAPD analysis ( Hahn et al., 1994 ). R. similis is sensitive to cold and favours warm temperatures and moist soil conditions. In very wet or dry soil, populations of the nematode are found to decline ( Gnanapragasam, 1993 ).When P. loosi and R. similis are inoculated together on tea grown at high altitudes, the former rapidly takes over the latter by competitive displacement ( Campos et al., 1990 ). On the other hand, when the tea cultivar is more susceptible to R. similis, populations of this species build up more than P. loosi at warmer temperatures ( Gnanapragasam, 1991 ). In borderline areas, suitable for the build up of both species, it is common to encounter both R. similis and P. loosi. In semi-dry areas, R. similis also occurs with R. reniformis.Soil type and texture has a significant influence on the reproductive rate and population build up of R. similis. Detailed experiments carried out in a temperature controlled water bath (25±1°C) showed the population to build up most rapidly in sandy soil, followed by gravelly or loamy soil. There was hardly any build up in clay soils. Damage to tea was significantly greater in gravelly soil, followed by sandy, then loamy soil ( Gnanapragasam, 1990 ).In coconut, R. similis takes about 25 days at 25-28°C to complete its life cycle.

Damage to tea was significantly greater in gravelly soil, followed by sandy, then loamy soil ( Gnanapragasam, 1990 ).In coconut, R. similis takes about 25 days at 25-28°C to complete its life cycle. Most juveniles and adults, including gravid females, infest healthy, succulent root tips. In the field, the nematode can survive for 6 months in moist soil (27-36°C) and only 1 month in dry soil (29-39°C). Under glasshouse conditions it survives for longer periods: 15 months in moist soil (25.5-28.5°C) and 3 months in dry soil (27-31°C) ( Griffith and Koshy, 1990 ).The fungi Cylindrocarpon effusum, C. lucid and Cylindrocladium clavatum have been recorded in association with lesions produced by R. similis. When these fungi were inoculated simultaneously with the nematode, the rate of multiplication of R. similis was reduced, as was damage to coconut seedlings ( Sosamma and Koshy, 1978 , 1983; Koshy and Sosamma, 1987 ). Inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi also brought about a reduction in the population of R. similis ( Koshy et al., 1998 ; Sosamma et al., 1999 ).In black pepper, R. similis penetrates roots within 24 hours of inoculation and the cells around the site of penetration become brown. Nematodes do not enter the stelar portions of the root, but plugging of xylem vessels with a gum-like substance has been reported.

 Sintomas: BananasThe most obvious symptom of attack of R. similis on banana is the toppling over or uprooting of plants, especially those bearing fruit, but there is a range in damage severity, from the lengthening of the vegetative cycle to the drastic reduction in bunch weight. This reveals two types of damage that can occur in banana plantations; that affecting the anchorage of the plant, and less apparent, the effect on the plant's ability to take up water and

 is the toppling over or uprooting of plants, especially those bearing fruit, but there is a range in damage severity, from the lengthening of the vegetative cycle to the drastic reduction in bunch weight. This reveals two types of damage that can occur in banana plantations; that affecting the anchorage of the plant, and less apparent, the effect on the plant's ability to take up water and nutrients and the subsequent effect on yield.Macroscopically, several dark red lesions appear on the outer part of the root, penetrating throughout the cortex but not into the stele; adjacent lesions may coalesce and the cortical root tissue atrophies and later turns black. In heavy infestations the lesion girdles the roots. Nematodes migrate from infected roots into the corm causing black lesions which may then spread around the corm. Roots emerging become infected as they grow out of the corm. Uprooting occurs commonly in windstorms or if heavy rains loosen the soil ( Gowen and Quénéhervé, 1990 ).Black PepperR. similis on black pepper is associated with pepper yellows (slow-wilt) disease, which appears as pale yellow or whitish-yellow drooping leaves on the vines. The number of such leaves increases gradually until large numbers of leaves, or even the entire foliage, become yellow. Yellowing is followed by shedding leaves, cessation of growth and dieback symptoms. The symptoms are well pronounced when soil moisture is depleted. Within 3-5 years of initiation of yellowing, all the leaves are shed and death of the vine takes place; hence the name slow-wilt disease.In bearing vines, shedding of inflorescences is a major symptom. Large numbers of shed inflorescences are seen at the base of affected vines. In large plantations, affected patches become conspicuous initially as yellowed plants, and later with large numbers of barren standards that have lost the vines, or standards supporting dead vines without

 death of the vine takes place; hence the name slow-wilt disease.In bearing vines, shedding of inflorescences is a major symptom. Large numbers of shed inflorescences are seen at the base of affected vines. In large plantations, affected patches become conspicuous initially as yellowed plants, and later with large numbers of barren standards that have lost the vines, or standards supporting dead vines without any leaves. Young and old plants are affected and the replanted vines normally die within 2 years.The tender, thin, white feeding roots show typical orange- to purple-coloured lesions. Lesions are not clearly seen on older roots, being brown in colour. The root system exhibits extensive rotting and this results in a lack of fine feeder roots from the main roots. Extensive necrosis of larger lateral roots develops subsequently ( Koshy and Bridge, 1990 ).GingerGinger plants infected with R. similis exhibit stunting, reduced vigour and tillering. The topmost leaves become chlorotic with scorched tips. Affected plants tend to mature and dry out faster than unaffected healthy plants. Incipient infections of the rhizomes are evidenced by small, shallow, sunken, water-soaked lesions. The nematodes migrate intracellularly through tissues, producing large infection channels or galleries within the rhizomes.CoconutIn coconut, R. similis causes non-specific general decline symptoms such as stunting, yellowing, reduction in number and size of leaves and leaflets, delay in flowering, button shedding and reduced yield. R. similis infestation produces small, elongate, orange-coloured lesions on tender creamy-white roots. Tender roots of coconut seedlings with heavy infestation become spongy in texture. Surface cracks develop on the semi-hard, orange-coloured main roots. Lesions and rotting are confined to the tender portions of the root. Lesions are also not conspicuous on the

Surface cracks develop on the semi-hard, orange-coloured main roots. Lesions and rotting are confined to the tender portions of the root. Lesions are also not conspicuous on the secondary and tertiary roots as these are narrow and rot quickly on infestation ( Griffith and Koshy, 1990 ).ArecanutPlants infested with R. similis induces 'yellow leaf' disease. Infestation produces small, elongate, orange lesions in young, succulent, creamy-white to light-orange portions of the main and lateral roots. The adjoining lesions coalesce and cause extensive rotting ( Sundararaju, 1984 ) . TeaTea plants infested with R. similis show similar symptoms to those caused by Pratylenchus loosi, such as stunting with twiggy branches, defoliation, premature flowering and fruiting. The roots of infested plants are sparse and dried compared with the whitish, succulent feeder roots of healthy plants. Although R. similis produces lesions on tea roots, they are very small compared to those formed by P. loosi ( Gnanapragasam, 1983 ).

Under glasshouse conditions it survives for longer periods: 15 months in moist soil (25.5-28.5°C) and 3 months in dry soil (27-31°C) ( Griffith and

. In the field, the nematode can survive for 6 months in moist soil (27-36°C) and only 1 month in dry soil (29-39°C). Under glasshouse conditions it survives for longer periods: 15 months in moist soil (25.5-28.5°C) and 3 months in dry soil (27-31°C) ( Griffith and Koshy, 1990 ).The fungi Cylindrocarpon effusum, C. lucid and Cylindrocladium clavatum have been recorded in association with lesions produced by R. similis. When these fungi were inoculated simultaneously with the nematode, the rate of multiplication of R. similis was reduced, as was damage to coconut seedlings ( Sosamma and Koshy, 1978 , 1983; Koshy and Sosamma, 1987 ). Inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi also brought about a reduction in the population of R. similis ( Koshy et al., 1998 ; Sosamma et al., 1999 ).In black pepper, R. similis penetrates roots within 24 hours of inoculation and the cells around the site of penetration become brown. Nematodes do not enter the stelar portions of the root, but plugging of xylem vessels with a gum-like substance has been reported. The life cycle is completed within 25-30 days, at a temperature range of 21-31°C. In India, the maximum nematode population in roots of pepper occurs during September-October and the minimum population during April-June ( Koshy and Bridge, 1990 ).R. similis takes about 25-30 days to complete its life cycle on arecanut seedlings at 21-31°C under glasshouse conditions. The population of R. similis in arecanut fluctuates at different times of the year. In

 roots of pepper occurs during September-October and the minimum population during April-June ( Koshy and Bridge, 1990 ).R. similis takes about 25-30 days to complete its life cycle on arecanut seedlings at 21-31°C under glasshouse conditions. The population of R. similis in arecanut fluctuates at different times of the year. In India, the maximum populations occur in the roots during 0ctober-November and minimum populations during March-June. Populations are also known to vary depending on the type of roots, palms, groves and soil types during the same period ( Koshy and Sosamma, 1978 ).The occurrence of R. similis was greater in sandy loam soil (42.3%) followed by laterite (29.6%) and alluvial 28.0%) soils. The maximum number of nematodes recorded was 139 per gram of root (Koshy et al., 1978).

Breadcrumb Home News and Updates Program Update APHIS Approves California FRSMP Petition for Burrowing Nematode (Radopholus similis) APHIS Approves California FRSMP Petition for Burrowing Nematode (Radopholus similis) Print The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) approved the Federally Recognized State Managed Phytosanitary (FRSMP, pronounced “free-stamp”) program petition from California for Radopholus similis, also known as the burrowing nematode. This is APHIS’ third State-managed phytosanitary program recognized in California and the first FRSMP program for this pest. APHIS established the FRSMP program to promote greater consistency in actions taken against certain plant pests, whether those pests arrive at U.S. ports of entry or are moving interstate. By better harmonizing import and interstate requirements, APHIS strengthens its ability to advocate for safe, fair, and reciprocal treatment of U.S. exports by our trading partners. For additional information about the FRSMP program go to the APHIS Federally Recognized State Managed Phytosanitary Program web page. Under International Plant Protection Convention Standards, Radopholus similis is considered to be a pest that is present only in some areas of the United States. APHIS recognizes California’s official control program. APHIS recognition will justify actions ordered by APHIS officials to mitigate the risk when a pest covered under a FRSMP program is moving in foreign commerce and intercepted at a U.S port of entry.
