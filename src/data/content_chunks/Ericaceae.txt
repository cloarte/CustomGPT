), they were treated as the Pyrolaceae.Chiogenes, recorded from China in FRPS (57(3): 69–71. 1991), is here included inGaultheria. Over the last half century, the Empetraceae have usually been separated from, but closely associated with, the Ericaceae. In their ecology, leaf morphology and insertion, rusts, embryology, stamen anatomy, etc., they largely agree with that family. Molecular data placeEmpetrumand its relatives firmly within the Ericaceae, and in particular within the subfamily Ericoideae, in agreement with phytochemical and palynological data, and there they are best recognized as a separate tribe. There are distinctive features of the Empetreae that were responsible for their past familial status, e.g., reduced perianth with separate members, low ovule number, enlarged stigmas, etc. However, these are likely to be derived features associated with wind pollination. See Kron et al. (Bot. Rev. 68: 335–423. 2002) and the recent treatment of the Ericaceae by Stevens et al. (in Kubitzki, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 6: 145–194. 2004).Several genera and many species are ornamentals. Some fruits ofVacciniumin N China are sweet and edible, but of no particular value to humans. Some species ofChamaedaphne,Craibiodendron,Leucothoë,Lyonia,Pieris, andRhododendroncontain more or less toxic diterpenes, which are harmful to humans or domestic animals.Fang Rhuicheng, Yang Hanbi & Chin Tsenli. 1999.
