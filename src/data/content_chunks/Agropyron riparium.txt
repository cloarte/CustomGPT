Streambank wheatgrass
Gramineae, Poaceae
Agropyron riparium
Scribn. & Smith
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This grass, native from Alberta and British Columbia in Canada south to Nevada and Colorado, resembles thickspike wheatgrass except that leaf blades are more narrow. It develops vigorous rhizomes, resulting in dense sods. It is drought tolerant and especially valuable for erosion control. Top growth is short and it produces less forage than some other wheatgrasses. Its greatest value is for sods on airports, roadbanks and irrigation canal banks.
