 Invasion: Ficus caricatrees can range from open to compact and from pendulous to upright to spreading, depending on the specific cultivar. Tree size and tree density are also rather dependent upon the cultivar, although cultural factors and soil quality can have a substantial impact upon eventual tree size. Exceptional specimens exist that have attained from 9 to 12 m in height and 10 m in spread, although commercially grown trees might only average from 5 to 8 m in height and from 6 to 7 m in width in the widest set plantings. Some cultivars produce trees that are round-topped and dense with many twiggy lateral spurs. Other cultivars have more apically dominant branches with fewer spurs, producing a more open or leggy appearance (Janick and Paull, 2008).

 F. carica is 26 ( IPCN Chromosome Reports, 2014 ). Life History and Growth Stages The lifespan of the fig tree is generally 50-75 years, depending upon soil and cultural conditions. In some cultivars, trunks can be renewed with suckers. Fig trees can start producing fruits even in the nursery; however, the producing age commences the seventh season after planting. This period is shorter in dense orchards and in breba production. In fig trees, growth starts with budburst (leafing) as the scales unfold in early spring. This period is at the end of March in the Northern Hemisphere. In many cultivars, there is a strong apical dominancy resulting in seasonal growth from the terminal or adjacent one or two buds. Apical dominancy is weaker in some breba-producing cultivars. The apical meristem develops into many formations as scales, leaves, fruit primordia and axillary vegetative buds. The shoot growth period varies according to the prevailing climatic conditions, applied practices, vigour and cultivar. Under Mediterranean conditions, it is around 75-90 days and displays a sigmoidal curve. The average shoot lengths are 7-11 cm, and the number of nodes is 6-9 per shoot. At each leaf axil, there are three buds, two fruiting and one vegetative. They form during late summer and autumn and remain dormant during the winter. In spring, the leaves form from the vegetative buds at each node. Fruits are formed on the median portion of the shoot. The fruit buds at proximal and distal nodes remain dormant. Maximum fruiting occurs on those nodes between the third and the sixth. In some cultivars (‘Kadota’, ‘Calimyrna’) both of the fruit buds develop into fruits ( Aksoy, 1981 ; Vidaud, 1997 ). In female and male figs, there are

. The fruit buds at proximal and distal nodes remain dormant. Maximum fruiting occurs on those nodes between the third and the sixth. In some cultivars (‘Kadota’, ‘Calimyrna’) both of the fruit buds develop into fruits ( Aksoy, 1981 ; Vidaud, 1997 ). In female and male figs, there are three successive crops. In female figs, the first crop (breba) is borne from buds at the distal end of the previous season's growth; these remain dormant during winter, become active in spring and the fruits ripen in May-July according to the local conditions (in the Northern Hemisphere). The second crop (main or summer crop) is produced on current season's growth and matures towards the latter part of July-November. The third crop refers to fruits forming at the distal end of the shoot and ripening later in the season. These buds differentiate during the same season. Female figs are classified under three groups according to the pollination requirement of the fruits: - Common type. None of the crops requires pollination for fruit set; all are of the persistent type. Breba fruits may or may not form. The second crop is abundant and sometimes a third crop sets and matures. - San Pedro type. The breba crop is persistent (parthenocarpic). The second crop requires caprification (artificial pollination by wasps) for fruit set. If not fertilized, fruits grow up to 1.5 cm in diameter and then drop. - Smyrna type. The second crop requiring pollination for fruit set (caducous type) is the main crop. Few brebas may form ( Storey, 1975 ). In male figs, the three successive crops are mamme (winter crop), profichi (spring crop) and mammoni (summer crop). The growth and development of fruits set at

. - Smyrna type. The second crop requiring pollination for fruit set (caducous type) is the main crop. Few brebas may form ( Storey, 1975 ). In male figs, the three successive crops are mamme (winter crop), profichi (spring crop) and mammoni (summer crop). The growth and development of fruits set at different nodes are completed in three distinct periods: two rapid growth periods, I and III, separated by a slow growth period (II). The first rapid phase is described with high respiration rate, active cell division and differentiation, dense protoplasmic material and high rates of ribosome, nucleic acid and protein synthesis. During the second phase, cell division in the receptacle is terminated, and rates of respiration, growth and biosynthetic activity are slowed down. The third stage is characterized by rapid cell enlargement and changes related to maturation, such as in colour, taste and texture. A very rapid maturation accompanied by rapid sugar accumulation is characteristic of fig fruits. During the last 5-10 days before ripening, fruits increase in size and the colour changes from green to the colour characteristic of the cultivar. Pollination The pollen-bearing profichi is the unique crop used in caprifying the main crop of female figs. The other male crops act as the bridge for completing the life cycle of the fig wasp, Blastophaga psenes , which is vital for crop pollination, but which generally makes the caprifigs inedible. The process by which figs are pollinated is called caprification. This event is the result of an association between the fig, the caprifig and the fig wasp Blastophaga psenes .

 The process by which figs are pollinated is called caprification. This event is the result of an association between the fig, the caprifig and the fig wasp Blastophaga psenes . The fig wasp inhabits and completes its life cycle within the caprifig. Caprifig cultivars grown for use in caprification usually produce three crops of caprifigs annually. Beginning with the winter crop caprifigs, known as the mamme crop, the wasp overwinters in these caprifigs in the form of a larva within the ovary of a pistillate flower. The larvae begin to pupate in late winter through to early spring and emerge as adults beginning in mid-March through to early April. The male is first to emerge inside the caprifig synconium and begins to open the psenocarps and mate with the females still inside. The males rarely leave the caprifig synconium of origin and die soon after mating is complete. The bred females emerge after mating and exit the mamme caprifig through the ostiole. The females move along branches or by short flights from branch to branch within the caprifig tree. The female wasps seek out the developing spring or profichi crop now developing on the caprifig tree and enter the profichi through the ostiole and commence to deposit eggs in the developing short-styled pistillate flowers within the caprifig syconium. When egg laying is complete, the female wasp dies. The profichi syconia, now inhabited by the next generation of developing wasps, continue to grow until about early June, when mature bred female wasps again emerge. At the same time as the emergence of the female wasps is occurring, the staminate flowers within the profichi syconium have matured and are shedding pollen. The emerging females,

, the female wasp dies. The profichi syconia, now inhabited by the next generation of developing wasps, continue to grow until about early June, when mature bred female wasps again emerge. At the same time as the emergence of the female wasps is occurring, the staminate flowers within the profichi syconium have matured and are shedding pollen. The emerging females, covered with pollen, seek out the summer or mammoni caprifig crop developing on the current season’s shoots. The cycle begins again as the female wasps enter the young mammoni caprifigs to lay eggs. In the process of searching for mammoni caprifigs, the female wasp will enter any fig syconium nearby to try and find an appropriate short-styled staminate fig flower in which to deposit her eggs. Within the receptacle of the fig syconia, there are no short-styled florets, only the long-styled form. Since the ovipositor of the wasp cannot penetrate the embryo sac at the bottom of the long-styled flowers of the fig, no eggs will develop. In the process of searching for an ovipositing site, however, the pollen-bearing wasp brings about the pollination of the fig’s long-styled florets. This process of introduction of the pollen-bearing wasp into the fig syconium is called caprification and is the means by which the main crop of Smyrna (non-persistent or caducous)-type figs is set. The caprified fig will develop viable seed and will remain on the fig tree until maturity. The movement of the fig wasp from the profichi caprifig crop to the mammoni caprifig crop is again followed by egg laying and the eventual emergence in early August of another wasp generation. The

The movement of the fig wasp from the profichi caprifig crop to the mammoni caprifig crop is again followed by egg laying and the eventual emergence in early August of another wasp generation. The wasps emerging from the mature mammoni caprifigs will then enter the developing mamme caprifig crop. The inhabited mamme crop overwinters on the tree with developing fig wasp larvae inside and begins the yearly cycle again the following spring. Ecology Fig was originally adapted to semi-arid subtropical regions; however, it can be found both in the natural flora in mild temperate climates and in the tropics as an evergreen. It is grown in regular plantations between latitudes 20 and 40° both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In most producing countries, commercial orchards are located at lower altitudes, but in the tropics, they can be found at altitudes of 3000 m. Temperatures below -10°C are the main limiting factors in site selection. New growth in early spring or secondary growth in late autumn (mainly in young trees) may be damaged at -1°C. Some cold-hardy cultivars are known to exist in colder climates. Low temperatures also create a risk to the fig wasps over-wintering in mamme fruits. It requires little or no chilling to break dormancy. During fruit development and ripening, higher temperatures are required for adequate sugar accumulation and proper maturation. Accompanying rain or high humidity exert a negative impact on fruit quality. For commercial sun-drying, a long, dry and hot summer is a prerequisite.

 break dormancy. During fruit development and ripening, higher temperatures are required for adequate sugar accumulation and proper maturation. Accompanying rain or high humidity exert a negative impact on fruit quality. For commercial sun-drying, a long, dry and hot summer is a prerequisite. Ficus carica can tolerate a range of habitats, including infertile rocky land, woodland, scrubland, and even hot dry soil ( Lansky and Paavilainen, 2010 ). It can be grown on all types of soils, preferably on sandy-clay loam within a pH range of 6.0-8.0. It is known to tolerate higher lime contents, but highly acid soils are unsuitable. A soil depth of 1-1.5 m will provide the required growth conditions. Some cultivars are more selective ( Aksoy and Anac, 1993 ). The tree is fairly tolerant of moderate salinity ( Morton, 1987 ). Ficus carica is generally found at mid elevations. In Colombia, it is reported to grow between 1000 and 2500 m ( Vascular Plants of Antioquia, 2014 ), and in Bolivia at 2000-2500 m ( Bolivia Checklist, 2014 ). In Ecuador, the species has been reported in Galapagos, Coastal, and Andean regions between elevations of 0 and 2500 m ( Vascular Plants of Ecuador, 2014 ). In Peru, the species reportedly occurs in disturbed areas of the Andean region at elevations of 1500-2000 m ( Peru Checklist, 2014 ).

 Invasion: Ficus caricatrees can range from open to compact and from pendulous to upright to spreading, depending on the specific cultivar. Tree size and tree density are also rather dependent upon the cultivar, although cultural factors and soil quality can have a substantial impact upon eventual tree size. Exceptional specimens exist that have attained from 9 to 12 m in height and 10 m in spread, although commercially grown trees might only average from 5 to 8 m in height and from 6 to 7 m in width in the widest set plantings. Some cultivars produce trees that are round-topped and dense with many twiggy lateral spurs. Other cultivars have more apically dominant branches with fewer spurs, producing a more open or leggy appearance (Janick and Paull, 2008).

 F. carica is 26 ( IPCN Chromosome Reports, 2014 ). Life History and Growth Stages The lifespan of the fig tree is generally 50-75 years, depending upon soil and cultural conditions. In some cultivars, trunks can be renewed with suckers. Fig trees can start producing fruits even in the nursery; however, the producing age commences the seventh season after planting. This period is shorter in dense orchards and in breba production. In fig trees, growth starts with budburst (leafing) as the scales unfold in early spring. This period is at the end of March in the Northern Hemisphere. In many cultivars, there is a strong apical dominancy resulting in seasonal growth from the terminal or adjacent one or two buds. Apical dominancy is weaker in some breba-producing cultivars. The apical meristem develops into many formations as scales, leaves, fruit primordia and axillary vegetative buds. The shoot growth period varies according to the prevailing climatic conditions, applied practices, vigour and cultivar. Under Mediterranean conditions, it is around 75-90 days and displays a sigmoidal curve. The average shoot lengths are 7-11 cm, and the number of nodes is 6-9 per shoot. At each leaf axil, there are three buds, two fruiting and one vegetative. They form during late summer and autumn and remain dormant during the winter. In spring, the leaves form from the vegetative buds at each node. Fruits are formed on the median portion of the shoot. The fruit buds at proximal and distal nodes remain dormant. Maximum fruiting occurs on those nodes between the third and the sixth. In some cultivars (‘Kadota’, ‘Calimyrna’) both of the fruit buds develop into fruits ( Aksoy, 1981 ; Vidaud, 1997 ). In female and male figs, there are

. The fruit buds at proximal and distal nodes remain dormant. Maximum fruiting occurs on those nodes between the third and the sixth. In some cultivars (‘Kadota’, ‘Calimyrna’) both of the fruit buds develop into fruits ( Aksoy, 1981 ; Vidaud, 1997 ). In female and male figs, there are three successive crops. In female figs, the first crop (breba) is borne from buds at the distal end of the previous season's growth; these remain dormant during winter, become active in spring and the fruits ripen in May-July according to the local conditions (in the Northern Hemisphere). The second crop (main or summer crop) is produced on current season's growth and matures towards the latter part of July-November. The third crop refers to fruits forming at the distal end of the shoot and ripening later in the season. These buds differentiate during the same season. Female figs are classified under three groups according to the pollination requirement of the fruits: - Common type. None of the crops requires pollination for fruit set; all are of the persistent type. Breba fruits may or may not form. The second crop is abundant and sometimes a third crop sets and matures. - San Pedro type. The breba crop is persistent (parthenocarpic). The second crop requires caprification (artificial pollination by wasps) for fruit set. If not fertilized, fruits grow up to 1.5 cm in diameter and then drop. - Smyrna type. The second crop requiring pollination for fruit set (caducous type) is the main crop. Few brebas may form ( Storey, 1975 ). In male figs, the three successive crops are mamme (winter crop), profichi (spring crop) and mammoni (summer crop). The growth and development of fruits set at

. - Smyrna type. The second crop requiring pollination for fruit set (caducous type) is the main crop. Few brebas may form ( Storey, 1975 ). In male figs, the three successive crops are mamme (winter crop), profichi (spring crop) and mammoni (summer crop). The growth and development of fruits set at different nodes are completed in three distinct periods: two rapid growth periods, I and III, separated by a slow growth period (II). The first rapid phase is described with high respiration rate, active cell division and differentiation, dense protoplasmic material and high rates of ribosome, nucleic acid and protein synthesis. During the second phase, cell division in the receptacle is terminated, and rates of respiration, growth and biosynthetic activity are slowed down. The third stage is characterized by rapid cell enlargement and changes related to maturation, such as in colour, taste and texture. A very rapid maturation accompanied by rapid sugar accumulation is characteristic of fig fruits. During the last 5-10 days before ripening, fruits increase in size and the colour changes from green to the colour characteristic of the cultivar. Pollination The pollen-bearing profichi is the unique crop used in caprifying the main crop of female figs. The other male crops act as the bridge for completing the life cycle of the fig wasp, Blastophaga psenes , which is vital for crop pollination, but which generally makes the caprifigs inedible. The process by which figs are pollinated is called caprification. This event is the result of an association between the fig, the caprifig and the fig wasp Blastophaga psenes .

 The process by which figs are pollinated is called caprification. This event is the result of an association between the fig, the caprifig and the fig wasp Blastophaga psenes . The fig wasp inhabits and completes its life cycle within the caprifig. Caprifig cultivars grown for use in caprification usually produce three crops of caprifigs annually. Beginning with the winter crop caprifigs, known as the mamme crop, the wasp overwinters in these caprifigs in the form of a larva within the ovary of a pistillate flower. The larvae begin to pupate in late winter through to early spring and emerge as adults beginning in mid-March through to early April. The male is first to emerge inside the caprifig synconium and begins to open the psenocarps and mate with the females still inside. The males rarely leave the caprifig synconium of origin and die soon after mating is complete. The bred females emerge after mating and exit the mamme caprifig through the ostiole. The females move along branches or by short flights from branch to branch within the caprifig tree. The female wasps seek out the developing spring or profichi crop now developing on the caprifig tree and enter the profichi through the ostiole and commence to deposit eggs in the developing short-styled pistillate flowers within the caprifig syconium. When egg laying is complete, the female wasp dies. The profichi syconia, now inhabited by the next generation of developing wasps, continue to grow until about early June, when mature bred female wasps again emerge. At the same time as the emergence of the female wasps is occurring, the staminate flowers within the profichi syconium have matured and are shedding pollen. The emerging females,

, the female wasp dies. The profichi syconia, now inhabited by the next generation of developing wasps, continue to grow until about early June, when mature bred female wasps again emerge. At the same time as the emergence of the female wasps is occurring, the staminate flowers within the profichi syconium have matured and are shedding pollen. The emerging females, covered with pollen, seek out the summer or mammoni caprifig crop developing on the current season’s shoots. The cycle begins again as the female wasps enter the young mammoni caprifigs to lay eggs. In the process of searching for mammoni caprifigs, the female wasp will enter any fig syconium nearby to try and find an appropriate short-styled staminate fig flower in which to deposit her eggs. Within the receptacle of the fig syconia, there are no short-styled florets, only the long-styled form. Since the ovipositor of the wasp cannot penetrate the embryo sac at the bottom of the long-styled flowers of the fig, no eggs will develop. In the process of searching for an ovipositing site, however, the pollen-bearing wasp brings about the pollination of the fig’s long-styled florets. This process of introduction of the pollen-bearing wasp into the fig syconium is called caprification and is the means by which the main crop of Smyrna (non-persistent or caducous)-type figs is set. The caprified fig will develop viable seed and will remain on the fig tree until maturity. The movement of the fig wasp from the profichi caprifig crop to the mammoni caprifig crop is again followed by egg laying and the eventual emergence in early August of another wasp generation. The

The movement of the fig wasp from the profichi caprifig crop to the mammoni caprifig crop is again followed by egg laying and the eventual emergence in early August of another wasp generation. The wasps emerging from the mature mammoni caprifigs will then enter the developing mamme caprifig crop. The inhabited mamme crop overwinters on the tree with developing fig wasp larvae inside and begins the yearly cycle again the following spring. Ecology Fig was originally adapted to semi-arid subtropical regions; however, it can be found both in the natural flora in mild temperate climates and in the tropics as an evergreen. It is grown in regular plantations between latitudes 20 and 40° both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In most producing countries, commercial orchards are located at lower altitudes, but in the tropics, they can be found at altitudes of 3000 m. Temperatures below -10°C are the main limiting factors in site selection. New growth in early spring or secondary growth in late autumn (mainly in young trees) may be damaged at -1°C. Some cold-hardy cultivars are known to exist in colder climates. Low temperatures also create a risk to the fig wasps over-wintering in mamme fruits. It requires little or no chilling to break dormancy. During fruit development and ripening, higher temperatures are required for adequate sugar accumulation and proper maturation. Accompanying rain or high humidity exert a negative impact on fruit quality. For commercial sun-drying, a long, dry and hot summer is a prerequisite.

 break dormancy. During fruit development and ripening, higher temperatures are required for adequate sugar accumulation and proper maturation. Accompanying rain or high humidity exert a negative impact on fruit quality. For commercial sun-drying, a long, dry and hot summer is a prerequisite. Ficus carica can tolerate a range of habitats, including infertile rocky land, woodland, scrubland, and even hot dry soil ( Lansky and Paavilainen, 2010 ). It can be grown on all types of soils, preferably on sandy-clay loam within a pH range of 6.0-8.0. It is known to tolerate higher lime contents, but highly acid soils are unsuitable. A soil depth of 1-1.5 m will provide the required growth conditions. Some cultivars are more selective ( Aksoy and Anac, 1993 ). The tree is fairly tolerant of moderate salinity ( Morton, 1987 ). Ficus carica is generally found at mid elevations. In Colombia, it is reported to grow between 1000 and 2500 m ( Vascular Plants of Antioquia, 2014 ), and in Bolivia at 2000-2500 m ( Bolivia Checklist, 2014 ). In Ecuador, the species has been reported in Galapagos, Coastal, and Andean regions between elevations of 0 and 2500 m ( Vascular Plants of Ecuador, 2014 ). In Peru, the species reportedly occurs in disturbed areas of the Andean region at elevations of 1500-2000 m ( Peru Checklist, 2014 ).
