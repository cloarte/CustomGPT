Uses
Very young shoots are consumed as food in some parts of India and China.  In
raw state, shoots (ca 8 cm in diameter and 37.5 cm long) are very acrid, but
with two changes of water in cooking and with addition of salt and butter, they
make a pleasant vegetable.  Young shoots pickled or made into curries.  Wood
used by Chinese in household carpentry, furniture, boxes, ornamental vases,
scaffolding, etc.  Leaves used as fodder.  Stems in great demand for
manufacture of paper pulp of good quality.  Seeds edible and used in times of
scarcity of food.  Other species of Bambusa, found in various parts of the
tropics, are used for similar purposes: those used for the young shoots or buds
as a vegetable include

Folk Medicine
An ointment from the root is said to be a folk remedy for cirrhosis and hard
tumors, especially tumors of the abdomen, liver, spleen and stomach (Hartwell,
1967–1971).  Tabasheer, a siliceous secretion (up to 97% SiO
2
), considered
aphrodisiac, cooling, and tonic, is used in asthma, cough and debilitating
diseases (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  Leaves

), considered
aphrodisiac, cooling, and tonic, is used in asthma, cough and debilitating
diseases (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  Leaves given to horses suffering coughs and
colds.
Chemistry
The stem consists almost entirely of cellulose and hemicellulose (xylans,
arabans, polyuronides, etc.) and lignins, with a small amount of resins.
Oven-dried stems contain 3.3% ash, 1.8% silica, 6.0% hot water solubles (see
above), 19.6% pentosans, 30.1% lignin, and 57.6% cellulose.  Analyses from
paper pulping showed 8.5% water extract, 1.2% fat, wax, etc., 24.4% pectose,
15.6% lignin, 50.3% cellulose, and 1.6% ash.  Per 100 g, the seeds are reported
to contain 11.0% H

O, 11.8 g protein, 0.6 g fat, 75.4 g total carbohydrate, 1.7
g fiber, and 1.2 g ash (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  On a zero moisture basis the
fresh leaves (57.1% DM) contain 18.6% CP, 24.1% CF, 11.8% ash, 4.1% EE, 41.4%

NFE 48.8% (Gohl, 1981).  Per 100 g, the shoot is reported to contain 29
calories, 90.7 gH2 0, 2.3 g protein, 0.2 g fat, 6.6 g total carbohydrate, 0.5 g

-carotene
equivalent, 0.15 mg thiamine, 0.7 mg riboflavin, 0.6 mg niacin, and 4 mg
ascorbic acid (Food Comp. Table Latin America).
Toxicity
Eight grams of raw shoots or slightly more improperly cooked shoots can cause
death.  Young shoots contain 0.03% HCN (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  Hairs on various
bamboos, and fungi which live thereon, may cause dermatitis (Mitchell and Rook,
1979).  Benzoic acid and traces of cyanogenic glucoside present in shoots have
lethal effect on mosquito larvae (has antiseptic and larval properties).

Description
Tall woody bamboo, stems thorny, numerous, tufted, up to 40 m tall, curving at
top; branches numerous, internodes 30–45 cm long, prominent, bearing in lower
parts of stems dense half whorls of stiff, naked, horizontal branches, armed
with 2–3 recurved, stout spines; lowest nodes rooting; stem-sheaths leathery,
orange-yellow when young, hairy outside, shining and ribbed inside, 30–45 cm
long; blade triangular, glabrous, covered with a brown felt of bristly hairs
inside; leaves thin, linear, up to 20 cm long, glabrous above, hair beneath;
leaf-sheaths hairy, small; inflorescence an enormous panicle, often occupying
the entire stem; branchlets loose clusters of pale, glabrous spikes.
Germplasm
Reported from Asian Centers of Diversity, bamboos are reported to tolerate
insects, laterites, low pH, slope, and weeds (2
n
= 72, 70) (Duke, 1978).
Distribution
Wild in most parts of tropical India and Pakistan, growing up to 1000 m
altitudes in the Nilgiris and hills of southern India; north into China.
Ecology
Probably ranging from Subtropical to Tropical Very Dry to Wet Forest Life
Zones, spiny bamboo probably tolerates annual precipitation of ca 6 to 40 dm,
annual temperature of ca 18 to 29°C, and pH of 4.3 to 7.3.  Thrives in

 Life
Zones, spiny bamboo probably tolerates annual precipitation of ca 6 to 40 dm,
annual temperature of ca 18 to 29°C, and pH of 4.3 to 7.3.  Thrives in
tropical to subtropical climates, growing in warm humid temperate areas as
well, but thriving best under frost-free conditions, in rich to medium fertile
soils with good water supply.
Cultivation
Bamboos may be produced by means of seeds, vegetative portions or by layering
the stems and letting them root at the nodes.  Seeds are sown in soil about 0.6
cm deep and about 2.5 cm apart in rows 7.5–10 cm apart.  Germination occurs in
about a week and seedlings grow rapidly.  When plants are 15–20 cm tall, they
are transplanted to individual containers.  Transplanting to the field is done
when plants are about 1 m tall.  Growing plants from seed is the most
economical and convenient method of propagating large numbers of plants.  Clump
division is the traditional and most generally prevalent method of propagating
bamboos vegetatively.  Active growth of young shoots from buds on the rhizome
in this group of bamboos is initiated during the summer.  The commonly
recommended practice is to process vegetative propagules just before the
initiation of growth of these buds.  A clump is divided into two equal parts,
retaining the root system, branches and leaves of each part as fully intact as
possible.  Properly set out, these propagules usually give the highest degree
of success.  Clump divisions taken from the edge of the clump are apt to give
superior results.  The rh

 buds.  A clump is divided into two equal parts,
retaining the root system, branches and leaves of each part as fully intact as
possible.  Properly set out, these propagules usually give the highest degree
of success.  Clump divisions taken from the edge of the clump are apt to give
superior results.  The rhizome should be severed at one point only, at the neck
of the oldest rhizome axis in the propagule.  Cut should be made at the slender
neck where the minimum damage to the rhizome is done.  Roots are best preserved
and protected keeping them in a ball of earth when the propagule is taken from
the parent plant.  Some species, as
B. tulda,
has been successfully
propagated by rhizomes planted
in situ
, with 95% survival not uncommon.
Culm segments, with one or more nodes, bearing buds or branches, are used
widely as a means of propagation in both the Old and New World.  Branches are
usually pruned to 30 cm or less, with no foliage retained.  Such cuttings are
set upright or at an angle, with at least one node well covered.
B.
vulgaris
is often propagated this way.
Harvesting
Bamboos are harvested for food when the young shoots are 30–75 cm tall.  Other
parts of the plant are harvested whenever needed, as the leaves, branches and
woody stems.
Yields and Economics
Finding no published data, I estimate the yields in excess of 10 MT DM/ha/yr.

Yields and Economics
Finding no published data, I estimate the yields in excess of 10 MT DM/ha/yr.
One of the most useful group of plants in the tropics, bamboos are used as food
for man and fodder for livestock, for building materials, for weaving and
cordage, for paper pulp and for making all types of utensils.  Bamboos are very
important in the economy of Oriental peoples; millions are occupied in growing
and producing raw bamboo, and manufacturing of bamboo products.
Energy
New culms start growing slowly, growth soon approaching 30 cm/day with 75 cm
having been recorded in one day in Sri Lanka.  In Trinidad,
Bambusa vulgaris
produced more than 10 MT pure dry cellulose pulp per hectare per year on a
three-year cutting cycle.  The culms of
B. arundinacea
are said to be
considerably more durable than those of
B. vulgaris
.  With sheep, the ME
of the leaves is 1.77 megacalories per kg dry weight.
Biotic Factors
Few serious diseases or pests of bamboos are reported.  Bamboo borers can be
problematical
