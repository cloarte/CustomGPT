Grama grasses
Gramineae
Bouteloua
sp.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
Some 18 species of
Bouteloua
, the grama grasses, are native inthe United States, mainly throughout the Great Plains and Western States. Theyare summer growers, and the amount of growth produced is dependent on availablemoisture. Most species cure naturally, so growth from a previous season ispalatable for livestock. They are prized as forage producers on range andpasture land. The three most valuable species are side-oats grama, black grama, and blue grama.
