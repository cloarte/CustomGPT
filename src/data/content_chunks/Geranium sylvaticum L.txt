Geranium sylvaticumL. - Wood Crane's-bill  -Geraniaceae© Alan Hill© Alan Hill© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)LikeGeranium pratensethis wild geranium has a very restricted range as a native in Ireland, being confined to scrubby places about Glenarm. A characteristic habitat is the hazel scrub which clings to the basalt cliffs of the Antrim coastal escarpment. These native sites show up on the map as a cluster of four dots in the Glenarm area. The other dots are either records of the plant as a garden escape or errors for meadow cranesbill (G. pratense).The plant is much commoner in Scotland and Northern England than in Ireland for reasons that are a mystery.All names:Geranium sylvaticumL.;Geranium angulatumCurt.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
