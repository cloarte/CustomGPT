Cattle fever ticks—Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus 
and R. (B.) microplus—are the most dangerous cattle 
ectoparasites in the United States. These ticks threaten 
American agriculture because they spread the disease 
bovine babesiosis, commonly called cattle fever. This 
disease caused enormous economic losses to the U.S. 
cattle industry in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
A Deadly Cattle Disease
Cattle fever is caused by one of two protozoan blood 
parasites carried by cattle fever ticks. The parasites, called 
Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis, infect, reproduce in, 
and eventually rupture an infected animal’s red blood cells, 
releasing the parasites and hemoglobin into the animal’s 
bloodstream. This results in anemia and lower blood 
oxygen levels, which can reduce milk production and cause 
weight loss, increased respiratory rate, and death. Infected 
animals may also have red-colored urine because the 
kidneys filter the hemoglobin out of the blood. This is why 
the disease is also called “red water.”
Cattle Fever Tick Life Cycle
Cattle fever ticks develop through three life stages while 
on the host animal: larva, nymph, and adult. Adult female 
ticks mate while on the host animal. After

 because the 
kidneys filter the hemoglobin out of the blood. This is why 
the disease is also called “red water.”
Cattle Fever Tick Life Cycle
Cattle fever ticks develop through three life stages while 
on the host animal: larva, nymph, and adult. Adult female 
ticks mate while on the host animal. After engorging with 
host blood, they drop off the animal to lay up to 4,000 eggs 
on the ground. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae attach 
to animals that walk by the larval cluster, and the cycle 
continues. Up to four generations of ticks can be produced 
each year. 
Disease Spread
When cattle fever ticks take a blood meal from an infected 
animal, they ingest the protozoan blood parasites. These 
protozoa develop and eventually migrate to the tick’s 
reproductive system where they can pass to laid eggs. Tick 
larvae that hatch from these eggs may be infected with the 
protozoa when they begin to feed on a new animal. This is

Eradication Efforts
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cattle Fever Tick 
Eradication Program (CFTEP) works alongside the Texas 
Animal Health Commission in a cooperative program to 
stop these ticks from spreading. However, in recent years, 
the number of cattle fever tick infestations has increased 
significantly. Cattle fever and the ticks that spread it 
are common to parts of Mexico. The CFTEP’s mounted 
inspectors routinely patrol horse trails that they maintain 
alongside the Rio Grande to monitor for signs of stray or 
smuggled livestock from Mexico that might carry fever ticks 
into the United States. Intercepted animals are inspected, 
treated for ticks, and quarantined. Land that the intercepted 
animals have crossed is also quarantined. Inspectors also 
watch for illegal livestock movements. Currently, there are 
eight CFTEP work areas in South Texas.
