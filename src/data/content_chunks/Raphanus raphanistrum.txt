 Invasion: R. raphanistrum may behave as an annual, winter annual or biennial and has a large basal rosette of leaves. The fibrous root system is very extensive to a depth of 20 cm, spreading horizontally to 80 cm in all directions. Stems are erect or spreading (striate to angled in South Africa), much branched, 30 to 100 cm (to 200 cm in Australia), with short, stiff hairs especially at the base.

Stems are erect or spreading (striate to angled in South Africa), much branched, 30 to 100 cm (to 200 cm in Australia), with short, stiff hairs especially at the base. Leaves are alternate, rough, lower deeply lobed with much enlarged terminal segment, upper narrower, entire to slight indentations, 8 to 20 cm long. The flowers have a perianth with four free segments in long terminal, corymbose racemes, petals pale yellow, rarely white, purple veins (occasionally petals reported to be pinkish or purplish, may be straw coloured in Scotland, UK), 1 to 2 cm across, pedicels, 1 to 2 cm. The fruit is a fleshy pod, spongy, long, narrow, cylindrical, 5 to 10 mm in diameter, 2 to 7 cm long, terminating in a 1-2 cm pointed beak, longitudinally ribbed, indehiscent, 2 to 10 seeds, constricted but without septum between seeds, lower pods often small and seedless, sections with seed break apart at constriction when mature. The seeds are globular, ovoid, reddish to orange-brown (dark brown in South Africa), 2 to 4 mm in diameter, covered with fine network of veins with shallow interspaces.

In field studies in Australia, seed yields reached 17,275 seeds/m² ( Reeves et al., 1981 ), and accumulated seed banks reached levels of 45,000 seeds/m² at some sites.

: R. raphanistrum is an annual, or rarely biennial species which reproduces solely by seed. It is a prolific seed producer. In field studies in Australia, seed yields reached 17,275 seeds/m² ( Reeves et al., 1981 ), and accumulated seed banks reached levels of 45,000 seeds/m² at some sites. Seed production by individual plants is density dependent, with increasing population densities of R. raphanistrum resulting in reduced production per plant, but an overall increase per unit area.Seed populations in the soil exhibit protracted germination and Reeves et al. (1981) estimated that in a single season one half of the seeds in the soil germinated. In Australia, germination usually occurs after autumn rains, but 'flushes' of germination occur throughout the year after rain. In the UK, the peak period of germination is in March and April, but seedlings continue to appear until late autumn ( Roberts and Boddrell, 1983 ). Piggin et al. (1978) concluded that this sporadic germination may be the result of the gradual, but continuous breakdown of buried seed pods which have an inhibitory effect on seed germination.In laboratory germination tests, R. raphanistrum has been shown to germinate over a range of temperatures, but was most responsive to fluctuating temperatures. Mekenian and Willensen (1975) in the USA, showed that the after-ripening requirement was completed in less than 6 months and that germination was generally greater in the dark. Cheam (1984, 1986) found that seeds from southern Australia had a greater level of initial primary dormancy than those from northern Australia, and Steinbauer and Frank (1954) recommended treating fresh seeds with potassium nitrate to break primary dormancy.

In Germany, Lauer (1953) found that the minimum temperature for germination was 5°C, the maximum 35°C, with an optimum of 20°C.The longevity of R. raphanistrum seed is increased by burial in the soil ( Piggin et al., 1978 ). Kurth (1967) in Germany, reported that seeds could remain viable for between 15 and 20 years in the soil. In the UK, Chancellor (1986) reported a mean annual decline of 30% of the seed bank, corresponding to a half-life of 2 years.Seed may be dispersed by a number of agents and is frequently a contaminant of commercial grain seed stocks. Seed may also be spread in irrigation water and is able to pass unharmed through the gut of many animals including birds and cattle ( Holm et al., 1997 ).
