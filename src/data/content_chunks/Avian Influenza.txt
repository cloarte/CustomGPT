AI viruses can infect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese and guinea fowl as well as a wide variety of other birds, including migratory waterfowl. AI viruses are classified by a combination of two groups of proteins: hemagglutinin proteins (H), of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase proteins (N), of which there are 9 (N1-N9). AI strains are also divided into two groups based on pathogenicity-the ability of the virus to produce disease. Most AI strains are classified as low pathogenicity (LP) avian influenza and cause little or no clinical signs in infected birds. LPAI poses no serious threat to humans. Some strains of LPAI-H5 and H7-can mutate to the more highly pathogenic forms. Birds with HPAI get a more virulent form of avian influenza. People can get HPAI from birds, but it requires extensive close contact with infected birds. For HPAI to spread from person to person, the virus would have to mutate, to change. The strain that is currently a problem from Southeast Asia is H5N1 HPAI.

" A New, Rapid Test for Avian Influenza ," in the February 2003 issue of Agricultural Research magazine. ARS Research Projects and Programs ARS is developing new information and important tools to help control this disease in poultry. ARS supports USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service , The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and poultry industry action programs with epidemiology, molecular virology, pathogenesis research, and technical assistance on avian influenza. In 2002, ARS developed a new rapid diagnostic test for avian influenza and has been continually improving the test's sensitivity. This test now diagnoses avian influenza within three hours, compared with up to two weeks required for previous tests. Today, ARS researchers are studying factors that affect the virus' transmission between birds and its genetic and molecular adaptation from waterfowl and other migratory birds to domestic poultry. They are also evaluating the role of ducks in Asia as an infection reservoir that might be sustaining the virus in the environment. ARS researchers are also working to develop enhanced vaccines for birds against avian influenza. ARS is developing and evaluating techniques to predict which mild forms of viruses might change to more deadly forms of the AI virus. ARS is assisting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with evaluating recombinant vaccines to ensure human vaccines will not cause disease in poultry. ARS is directly assisting APHIS in trade negotiations of poultry products by determining the risk for low and high pathogenicity AIV in poultry meat and the ability of pasteurization to inactivate AIV in egg products and cooking to kill HPAIV in poultry meat.

Avian influenza is a disease found in wild and domestic 
birds.  Although wild waterfowl rarely show signs of the 
disease, they can shed the virus into the environment 
through their oral and nasal secretions and feces. The 
viruses can cause severe illness and death in domestic 
birds.  
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is working 
closely with State and local officials and industry experts 
to assist poultry producers in the surveillance, reporting, 
and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).  
Experts are still evaluating how HPAI is spreading in the 
United States.
Biosecurity is Key  
 
The best way to prevent HPAI at your farm is by 
consistently using appropriate biosecurity measures. 
The USDA and its industry partners provide a list of 
recommended biosecurity measures at www.aphis.usda.
gov/animal_health/birdbiosecurity/biosecurity. 
 
You can build upon and enhance these measures with 
the addition of simple wildlife management practices 
around your farm. The following management practices 
can help you prevent wild birds and other wildlife from 
coming into direct contact with your poultry, as well 
as wild bird fecal material and secretions from being 
accidentally transported on boots, equipment, and food to 
your birds.

Prevent Avian Influenza at Your Farm  
Improve Your Biosecurity with Simple Wildlife Management Practices
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  July 2015 
Remove 
standing water
• Grade property to avoid pooling of water.
• Fill areas where water stands for more than 48 hours. 
• Workers should avoid walking or moving equipment in or near 
     standing water used by wildlife. 
•   Consider French drains and culverts to carry water away from  
     poultry houses.
Manage risks at 
ponds and basins
•   Do not use untreated surface water for watering poultry or
  cleaning poultry barns and other facilities as it may be contaminated.
• Consider removing vegetation from the banks of man-made
  water structures.
• Use deterrent techniques (e.g. wire grids, predator decoys, and 
     scare devices) to keep waterfowl from using water bodies near 
     poultry barns. 
• Use fencing to separate natural ponds or vegetation areas from the 
     active area around barns.
Reduce food 
sources
• Do not feed wildlife.
• Locate feed structures on a clean pad.
• Inspect pipes and connections regularly for leaks.
• Keep a broom and lidded garbage container at every feed storage 
     area for quick clean-ups. 
• Natural wildlife feed such as grass seeds, insects and fruit trees,  
     may also be present:
 − Mow frequently
 − Do not pile used litter near barns
 − Remove fallen fruit
1.  Reduce wildlife attractants

Cover waste • Keep carcasses covered at all times.

2. Prevent wildlife access
Remove perches, 
plug holes
• Repair holes and tears in barn walls.
• Remove unnecessary ledges or horizontal surfaces.
• Install exclusionary netting, screens, and perch deterrents, such as 
     repellent gel or bird spikes.
• Before nesting season begins, wash away or remove old nests in 
     accordance with state and federal regulations. Please note it is  
     unlawful to remove nests with eggs or young in them at any time of 
     year. 
• Inspect foam installation for signs of rodent or bird digging, chewing 
     or pecking.
3. Add wildlife deterrents
Move and replace 
scare devices 
frequently
• Move decoys and scare devices frequently to improve effectiveness.
• Pyrotechnics can be effective, but require dedicated and trained 
     personnel and may be stressful to poultry. 
NOTE: USDA and other experts do not recommend the lethal removal 
of wild birds in order to prevent the spread of HPAI. Because of the 
high number and constant movement of wild birds, the use of lethal 
methods is neither practical nor environmentally sound.
