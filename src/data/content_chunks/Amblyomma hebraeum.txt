Bont Tick and Tropical Bont Tick
 
Etiology and Ecology Quick Summary 
 
Organisms 
The bont tick and tropical bont tick are hard ticks of the genus Amblyomma.  
 
Susceptible Species 
Adult ticks will feed on cattle, sheep, goats, horses, camels, dogs, and some species of 
large wildlife. They may also bite humans. Immature ticks may feed on the same hosts 
as adults but tend to be found on smaller mammals, reptiles, and wild birds.  
 
Zoonotic Disease Potential 
Tropical bont ticks are able to transmit certain diseases, such as African tick bite

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 horses, camels, dogs, and some species of 
large wildlife. They may also bite humans. Immature ticks may feed on the same hosts 
as adults but tend to be found on smaller mammals, reptiles, and wild birds.  
 
Zoonotic Disease Potential 
Tropical bont ticks are able to transmit certain diseases, such as African tick bite fever 
(Rickettsia africae), to humans. 
 
Transmission 
Pathogens use the tropical bont tick as a host, and disease is spread to an animal's blood 
through the tick's bite while feeding; among other diseases, the bont tick can spread the 
OIE-reportable diesease heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminatium). The bite itself causes a 
large wound, which may become infected or attract other parasites to the site, such as 
screwworms.  
 
Persistence in the Environment 
Tropical bont ticks have three life stages where they change hosts and can live up to a 
few years. Immature individuals are vulnerable to drying out, and all ages can be killed 
with acaricides. 
 
 
SOP Manual 1-1 Bont/Tropical Bont Tick Etiology and Ecology 
 
1.1 Introduction  
The bont tick and tropical bont tick are two species of hard ticks in the genus Amblyomma that 
both feed on many domesticated animals, wildlife, and, sometimes, humans. Ticks are obligate 
parasites and thus cannot persist without feeding on blood from a host. These particular ticks 
leave large wounds where they bite, which can become infected or attract other parasites, and 
they also are vectors for microbial pathogens.1,2 The most common diseases associated with both

 on many domesticated animals, wildlife, and, sometimes, humans. Ticks are obligate 
parasites and thus cannot persist without feeding on blood from a host. These particular ticks 
leave large wounds where they bite, which can become infected or attract other parasites, and 
they also are vectors for microbial pathogens.1,2 The most common diseases associated with both 
ticks are African tick-bite fever and heartwater. African tick-bite fever is a zoonotic, febrile 
illness that can pose a danger to people traveling into an endemic area.3 For more information on 
heartwater, please see the FAD PReP SOP Overview of Etiology and Ecology: Heartwater.  
These ticks are common pests in many tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Both are 
found in parts of Africa, and the tropical bont tick is established on certain islands in the Indian 
Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Caribbean Sea. Bont ticks and tropical bont ticks feed on three hosts 
over their life cycles; each host is usually a different animal, and each may be a different species. 
Immature ticks tend to feed on small animals, including birds, while adults feed on large 
mammals, frequently including livestock.4,5 
1.1.1  Goals  
As a preparedness goal, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will provide 
etiology and ecology summaries on the bont tick and tropical bont tick and update these 
summaries at regular intervals. 
As a response goal, the Unified Command and stakeholders will have a common set of etiology 
and ecology definitions and descriptions, to ensure proper understanding of the bont tick and 
tropical bont tick when establishing or revising goals, objectives, strategies, and procedures.

1.3 Etiology  
1.3.1  Name 
The bont tick is also called the English bont tick and the Southern Africa bont tick; the tropical 
bont tick may also be known as the tropical African bont tick, Senegalese tick, or Antigua gold 
tick.6,7,8,9   
1.3.2  Species Characteristics 
These ticks have the following taxonomy:10   
• Family: Ixodidae 
• Subfamily: Amblyomminae 
• Genus: Amblyomma 
• Species: Amblyomma hebraeum (bont tick) and Amblyomma variegatum (tropical bont 
tick) 
1.3.3  Identification and Morphology 
Both the bont tick and tropical bont tick are oval with a dorsal shield and long mouthparts. They 
are relatively large ticks, typically around 5 mm
Text Len: 1048
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Species: Amblyomma hebraeum (bont tick) and Amblyomma variegatum (tropical bont 
tick) 
1.3.3  Identification and Morphology 
Both the bont tick and tropical bont tick are oval with a dorsal shield and long mouthparts. They 
are relatively large ticks, typically around 5 mm long but growing up to 20 mm when engorged. 
These along with many other ticks of the Amblyomma genus have striped legs and ornate scuta 
(dorsal shields). Females have a much smaller scutum than the male so that much of her dorsal 
surface is uncovered, appearing dark brown or black. 
The scutum of an A. hebraeum male has pale, yellowish markings on a dark brown or black 
background (see Figure 1-1), while the A. variegatum males have more brightly colored orange 
or golden ornamentation. Distinguishing between species is best left to an expert when possible, 
as there are over 130 species of ticks in the genus Amblyomma.  
The bont tick and tropical bont tick are both three-host ticks, meaning that they take a separate 
meal at each stage of their development: larva, nymph, and adult. Larvae of both species are 
much smaller and have only six legs. Nymphal ticks have eight legs and are more flattened and 
elongated.11

1.4 Ecology 
1.4.1  General Overview 
Bont ticks can be found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and the tropical bont tick is on several 
tropical and sub-tropical islands; these include, but are certainly not limited to, Madagascar, 
Reunion, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Comoros Islands, São Tomé, Guadeloupe, Marie Galante, and 
Antigua.  The bont tick prefers warm, humid savanna habitats of Africa.12 Tropical bont ticks are 
also found in savanna regions, but their distribution extends to the southern edges of the Middle 
East and islands of the Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean.13 
1.4.2  Susceptible Species 
Small mammals, birds, and reptiles are hosts of larval and nymphal bont ticks, while adults tend 
to prefer cattle and wildlife, in particular antelopes or similar species. All stages of tropical bont 
ticks share hosts with bont ticks at corresponding stages, but they will additionally attach to 
larger livestock hosts while in their immature stages and to sheep, goats, horses, camels, and 
dogs.  
While preferring wildlife and domestic ruminants, both tick species have also been known to bite 
humans.14, 15  People are at particular risk in areas of dense vegetation where ticks are endemic.16 
1.4.3  Introduction and Transmission of Bont Ticks and Tropical Bont Ticks 
Ticks of both species spend the majority of their lives on the ground. At all life stages, ticks find 
hosts by waiting in grass or on ground-cover plants, and clinging to the host animal as it passes

by. Ticks spend 5-20 days feeding on the host during which they are disseminated to new areas 
by the movement of their hosts, dropping onto the ground when engorged. For example, the 
movement of livestock from island to island led to the wide distribution of the tropical bont tick 
throughout the Caribbean after its introduction to Guadeloupe from Senegal in about 1828.17 
1.4.3.1  Wildlife 
Migratory birds, particularly the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), have been identified as an important 
agent of dispersal of the tropical bont tick among islands in the Caribbean18; birds can carry 
immature ticks long distances and have presented a challenge to tick eradication programs in that 
region.19

agent of dispersal of the tropical bont tick among islands in the Caribbean18; birds can carry 
immature ticks long distances and have presented a challenge to tick eradication programs in that 
region.19,20  
1.4.4  Clinical Signs  
These ticks cause illness by inflicting bite wounds that are vulnerable to infection and by 
transmitting pathogens to their hosts; signs exhibited by a host depend on a number of factors, 
including host species and age, extent of tick infestation, previous exposure, and environmental 
factors.  
• Bite wound: The large mouthparts of both tick species result in large, painful wounds. 
The bite sites can become infected or, in some regions, infested with screwworms or 
other fly larvae. As adults, ticks often latch onto hairless areas; inflammation caused by 
bites on the teats of dairy animals may impede milk production.21 
• Heartwater: There are several clinical forms of heartwater, a bacterial disease caused by 
Ehrlichia ruminantium. Most cases of heartwater are characterized by fever, respiratory 
distress, diarrhea, and, sometimes, neurologic signs. For more information on heartwater, 
please see the FAD PReP Heartwater Etiology and Ecology SOP.22  
• Nairobi sheep disease: The tropical bont tick may serve as a vector for Nairobi sheep 
disease (NSD), a virus (family Bunyaviridae) which primarily affects sheep and goats in 
East and Southern Africa. This often fatal disease is characterized by fever, rapid 
breathing, anorexia,

• Nairobi sheep disease: The tropical bont tick may serve as a vector for Nairobi sheep 
disease (NSD), a virus (family Bunyaviridae) which primarily affects sheep and goats in 
East and Southern Africa. This often fatal disease is characterized by fever, rapid 
breathing, anorexia, depression, and diarrhea. People may contract NSD, but it causes 
only a mild, influenza-like illness.23 
• Dermatophilosis: A skin disease caused by the bacterium Dermatophilus congolensis, 
dermatophilosis can be spread by fomites and direct contact as well as by ticks and other

 fever. This disease causes flu-like illness, 
with signs including fever, fatigue, nausea, muscle ache, rash, and headache.25,26 
 
1.4.5  Morbidity and Mortality 
The harm to a host of bont or tropical bont ticks will depend on the extent of infestation; species, 
age, and condition of the host animal; and the specific effects of any transmitted infection caused 
by the tick’s bite. Mortality rates from heartwater infections vary from 60–90 percent.27 
Screwworm infestations and dematophilosis often do not result in death, but both can weaken 
animals and lead to death if left untreated.28 Dermatophilosis is the leading contributor to 
financial losses of producers and owners whose livestock are infested with tropical bont ticks in 
the Caribbean.29 
In addition to spreading disease and creating wounds on the skin or surface of a host, bont and 
tropical bont ticks can cause stress and detrimental blood loss to hosts. Hosts can typically 
endure being bitten by a few ticks, but more intense infestations, of dozens to hundreds of ticks 
per animal, are common in rural areas where heavy tick concentrations are maintained in wildlife 
species.30  
1.5 Environmental Persistence of Bont and Tropical Bont Ticks  
Bont ticks and tropical bont ticks must feed on blood to survive, but they may take 2–4 years to 
complete their three life stages, during which they can spend well over 90 percent of the time in 
the environment.31,32 However, ticks often depend on certain microhabitats and vegetation types 
within wide-ranging ecosystems.33 Acaricides are effective against both species, but susceptible 
host species must be treated often

There is a risk that either species of tick could enter the United States on a wildlife host, an 
imported host animal, or travelers and/or their pets. Bont ticks have been documented on U.S.

travelers returning from Africa and on imported rhinoceroses.35,36 Introduction of bont or tropical 
bont ticks is of concern not only due to the direct damage they can do to their hosts (bite wounds, 
stress, blood loss), but also because there are many competent arthropod vectors, and domestic 
animal and wildlife hosts in the United States for the pathogens they may carry, particularly

(other members include Belgium, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on 
Agriculture, and the Caribbean Community). The CAP program had varied success before 
ending in 2008, with six islands declared “provisionally free”, but re-infestations sometimes 
occurred, such as in St. Kitts in 2004.38,39

Bont Tick and Tropical Bont Tick
 
Etiology and Ecology Quick Summary 
 
Organisms 
The bont tick and tropical bont tick are hard ticks of the genus Amblyomma.  
 
Susceptible Species 
Adult ticks will feed on cattle, sheep, goats, horses, camels, dogs, and some species of 
large wildlife. They may also bite humans. Immature ticks may feed on the same hosts 
as adults but tend to be found on smaller mammals, reptiles, and wild birds.  
 
Zoonotic Disease Potential 
Tropical bont ticks are able to transmit certain diseases, such as African tick bite

 horses, camels, dogs, and some species of 
large wildlife. They may also bite humans. Immature ticks may feed on the same hosts 
as adults but tend to be found on smaller mammals, reptiles, and wild birds.  
 
Zoonotic Disease Potential 
Tropical bont ticks are able to transmit certain diseases, such as African tick bite fever 
(Rickettsia africae), to humans. 
 
Transmission 
Pathogens use the tropical bont tick as a host, and disease is spread to an animal's blood 
through the tick's bite while feeding; among other diseases, the bont tick can spread the 
OIE-reportable diesease heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminatium). The bite itself causes a 
large wound, which may become infected or attract other parasites to the site, such as 
screwworms.  
 
Persistence in the Environment 
Tropical bont ticks have three life stages where they change hosts and can live up to a 
few years. Immature individuals are vulnerable to drying out, and all ages can be killed 
with acaricides. 
 
 
SOP Manual 1-1 Bont/Tropical Bont Tick Etiology and Ecology 
 
1.1 Introduction  
The bont tick and tropical bont tick are two species of hard ticks in the genus Amblyomma that 
both feed on many domesticated animals, wildlife, and, sometimes, humans. Ticks are obligate 
parasites and thus cannot persist without feeding on blood from a host. These particular ticks 
leave large wounds where they bite, which can become infected or attract other parasites, and 
they also are vectors for microbial pathogens.1,2 The most common diseases associated with both

 on many domesticated animals, wildlife, and, sometimes, humans. Ticks are obligate 
parasites and thus cannot persist without feeding on blood from a host. These particular ticks 
leave large wounds where they bite, which can become infected or attract other parasites, and 
they also are vectors for microbial pathogens.1,2 The most common diseases associated with both 
ticks are African tick-bite fever and heartwater. African tick-bite fever is a zoonotic, febrile 
illness that can pose a danger to people traveling into an endemic area.3 For more information on 
heartwater, please see the FAD PReP SOP Overview of Etiology and Ecology: Heartwater.  
These ticks are common pests in many tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Both are 
found in parts of Africa, and the tropical bont tick is established on certain islands in the Indian 
Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Caribbean Sea. Bont ticks and tropical bont ticks feed on three hosts 
over their life cycles; each host is usually a different animal, and each may be a different species. 
Immature ticks tend to feed on small animals, including birds, while adults feed on large 
mammals, frequently including livestock.4,5 
1.1.1  Goals  
As a preparedness goal, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will provide 
etiology and ecology summaries on the bont tick and tropical bont tick and update these 
summaries at regular intervals. 
As a response goal, the Unified Command and stakeholders will have a common set of etiology 
and ecology definitions and descriptions, to ensure proper understanding of the bont tick and 
tropical bont tick when establishing or revising goals, objectives, strategies, and procedures.

1.3 Etiology  
1.3.1  Name 
The bont tick is also called the English bont tick and the Southern Africa bont tick; the tropical 
bont tick may also be known as the tropical African bont tick, Senegalese tick, or Antigua gold 
tick.6,7,8,9   
1.3.2  Species Characteristics 
These ticks have the following taxonomy:10   
• Family: Ixodidae 
• Subfamily: Amblyomminae 
• Genus: Amblyomma 
• Species: Amblyomma hebraeum (bont tick) and Amblyomma variegatum (tropical bont 
tick) 
1.3.3  Identification and Morphology 
Both the bont tick and tropical bont tick are oval with a dorsal shield and long mouthparts. They 
are relatively large ticks, typically around 5 mm
Text Len: 1048
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Species: Amblyomma hebraeum (bont tick) and Amblyomma variegatum (tropical bont 
tick) 
1.3.3  Identification and Morphology 
Both the bont tick and tropical bont tick are oval with a dorsal shield and long mouthparts. They 
are relatively large ticks, typically around 5 mm long but growing up to 20 mm when engorged. 
These along with many other ticks of the Amblyomma genus have striped legs and ornate scuta 
(dorsal shields). Females have a much smaller scutum than the male so that much of her dorsal 
surface is uncovered, appearing dark brown or black. 
The scutum of an A. hebraeum male has pale, yellowish markings on a dark brown or black 
background (see Figure 1-1), while the A. variegatum males have more brightly colored orange 
or golden ornamentation. Distinguishing between species is best left to an expert when possible, 
as there are over 130 species of ticks in the genus Amblyomma.  
The bont tick and tropical bont tick are both three-host ticks, meaning that they take a separate 
meal at each stage of their development: larva, nymph, and adult. Larvae of both species are 
much smaller and have only six legs. Nymphal ticks have eight legs and are more flattened and 
elongated.11

1.4.1  General Overview

Reunion, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Comoros Islands,

1.4 Ecology 
1.4.1  General Overview 
Bont ticks can be found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and the tropical bont tick is on several 
tropical and sub-tropical islands; these include, but are certainly not limited to, Madagascar, 
Reunion, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Comoros Islands, São Tomé, Guadeloupe, Marie Galante, and 
Antigua.  The bont tick prefers warm, humid savanna habitats of Africa.12 Tropical bont ticks are 
also found in savanna regions, but their distribution extends to the southern edges of the Middle 
East and islands of the Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean.13 
1.4.2  Susceptible Species 
Small mammals, birds, and reptiles are hosts of larval and nymphal bont ticks, while adults tend 
to prefer cattle and wildlife, in particular antelopes or similar species. All stages of tropical bont 
ticks share hosts with bont ticks at corresponding stages, but they will additionally attach to 
larger livestock hosts while in their immature stages and to sheep, goats, horses, camels, and 
dogs.  
While preferring wildlife and domestic ruminants, both tick species have also been known to bite 
humans.14, 15  People are at particular risk in areas of dense vegetation where ticks are endemic.16 
1.4.3  Introduction and Transmission of Bont Ticks and Tropical Bont Ticks 
Ticks of both species spend the majority of their lives on the ground. At all life stages, ticks find 
hosts by waiting in grass or on ground-cover plants, and clinging to the host animal as it passes

by. Ticks spend 5-20 days feeding on the host during which they are disseminated to new areas 
by the movement of their hosts, dropping onto the ground when engorged. For example, the 
movement of livestock from island to island led to the wide distribution of the tropical bont tick 
throughout the Caribbean after its introduction to Guadeloupe from Senegal in about 1828.17 
1.4.3.1  Wildlife 
Migratory birds, particularly the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), have been identified as an important 
agent of dispersal of the tropical bont tick among islands in the Caribbean18; birds can carry 
immature ticks long distances and have presented a challenge to tick eradication programs in that

.4.3.1  Wildlife 
Migratory birds, particularly the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), have been identified as an important 
agent of dispersal of the tropical bont tick among islands in the Caribbean18; birds can carry 
immature ticks long distances and have presented a challenge to tick eradication programs in that 
region.19,20  
1.4.4  Clinical Signs  
These ticks cause illness by inflicting bite wounds that are vulnerable to infection and by 
transmitting pathogens to their hosts; signs exhibited by a host depend on a number of factors, 
including host species and age, extent of tick infestation, previous exposure, and environmental 
factors.  
• Bite wound: The large mouthparts of both tick species result in large, painful wounds. 
The bite sites can become infected or, in some regions, infested with screwworms or 
other fly larvae. As adults, ticks often latch onto hairless areas; inflammation caused by 
bites on the teats of dairy animals may impede milk production.21 
• Heartwater: There are several clinical forms of heartwater, a bacterial disease caused by 
Ehrlichia ruminantium. Most cases of heartwater are characterized by fever, respiratory 
distress, diarrhea, and, sometimes, neurologic signs. For more information on heartwater, 
please see the FAD PReP Heartwater Etiology and Ecology SOP.22  
• Nairobi sheep disease: The tropical bont tick may serve as a vector for Nairobi sheep 
disease (NSD), a virus (family Bunyaviridae) which primarily affects sheep and goats in 
East and Southern Africa. This often fatal disease is characterized by fever, rapid 
breathing, anorexia,

• Nairobi sheep disease: The tropical bont tick may serve as a vector for Nairobi sheep 
disease (NSD), a virus (family Bunyaviridae) which primarily affects sheep and goats in 
East and Southern Africa. This often fatal disease is characterized by fever, rapid 
breathing, anorexia, depression, and diarrhea. People may contract NSD, but it causes 
only a mild, influenza-like illness.23 
• Dermatophilosis: A skin disease caused by the bacterium Dermatophilus congolensis, 
dermatophilosis can be spread by fomites and direct contact as well as by ticks and other

• African tick-bite fever: Humans bitten by either tick can become infected with Rickettsia 
africae, the bacterial agent of African tick-bite fever. This disease causes flu-like illness, 
with signs including fever, fatigue, nausea, muscle ache, rash, and headache.25,26

 fever. This disease causes flu-like illness, 
with signs including fever, fatigue, nausea, muscle ache, rash, and headache.25,26 
 
1.4.5  Morbidity and Mortality 
The harm to a host of bont or tropical bont ticks will depend on the extent of infestation; species, 
age, and condition of the host animal; and the specific effects of any transmitted infection caused 
by the tick’s bite. Mortality rates from heartwater infections vary from 60–90 percent.27 
Screwworm infestations and dematophilosis often do not result in death, but both can weaken 
animals and lead to death if left untreated.28 Dermatophilosis is the leading contributor to 
financial losses of producers and owners whose livestock are infested with tropical bont ticks in 
the Caribbean.29 
In addition to spreading disease and creating wounds on the skin or surface of a host, bont and 
tropical bont ticks can cause stress and detrimental blood loss to hosts. Hosts can typically 
endure being bitten by a few ticks, but more intense infestations, of dozens to hundreds of ticks 
per animal, are common in rural areas where heavy tick concentrations are maintained in wildlife 
species.30  
1.5 Environmental Persistence of Bont and Tropical Bont Ticks  
Bont ticks and tropical bont ticks must feed on blood to survive, but they may take 2–4 years to 
complete their three life stages, during which they can spend well over 90 percent of the time in 
the environment.31,32 However, ticks often depend on certain microhabitats and vegetation types 
within wide-ranging ecosystems.33 Acaricides are effective against both species, but susceptible 
host species must be treated often

1.6 Bont and Tropical Bont Ticks in the United States 
There is a risk that either species of tick could enter the United States on a wildlife host, an 
imported host animal, or travelers and/or their pets. Bont ticks have been documented on U.S.

travelers returning from Africa and on imported rhinoceroses.35,36 Introduction of bont or tropical 
bont ticks is of concern not only due to the direct damage they can do to their hosts (bite wounds, 
stress, blood loss), but also because there are many competent arthropod vectors, and domestic 
animal and wildlife hosts in the United States for the pathogens they may carry, particularly 
heartwater.37

T
he tropical bont tick has spread throughout the Caribbean, once as far north as Puerto Rico. 
This, in combination with the presence of the cattle egret in the Florida Keys, led to the United 
States entering a coalition of international government agencies and non-profits to establish the 
Caribbean Ambylomma Program (CAP) to eradicate the tropical bont tick from certain islands 
(other members include Belgium, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on 
Agriculture, and the Caribbean Community). The CAP program had varied success before 
ending in 2008, with six islands declared “provisionally free”, but re-infestations sometimes 
occurred, such as in St. Kitts in 2004.38,39
