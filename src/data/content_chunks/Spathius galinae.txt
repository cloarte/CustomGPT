I.  Purpose and Need for the Proposed 
Action 
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Pest 
Permitting Branch is proposing to issue permits for release of the insect 
parasitoid1 species Spathius galinae (S. galinae) Belokobylskij & Strazanac 
(Hymenoptera: Braconidae).  This organism would be used by the permit 
applicant for biological control of the nonindigenous emerald ash borer 
(EAB) (Agrilus planipennis) in the continental United States.   
 
This environmental assessment2 (EA) has been prepared, consistent with 
USDA, APHIS' National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing 
procedures (Title 7 of the Code of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 control of the nonindigenous emerald ash borer 
(EAB) (Agrilus planipennis) in the continental United States.   
 
This environmental assessment2 (EA) has been prepared, consistent with 
USDA, APHIS' National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing 
procedures (Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 372).  It 
examines the potential effects on the quality of the human environment that 
may be associated with the release of the parasitoid wasp, S. galinae, to 
control EAB within the continental United States.  This EA considers a “no 
action” alternative and the potential effects of the proposed action. 
 
The applicant’s purpose for releasing S. galinae is to reduce infestations of 
EAB in the continental United States. The EAB is an invasive wood-boring 
beetle from Asia threatening North America’s ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  It 
was introduced into the Detroit, Michigan area, probably sometime in the 
1990s, and was identified as the cause of ash mortality in the area in 2002 
(Haack et al., 2002). EAB larvae feed on ash phloem, cutting off the 
movement of resources within the tree and killing the tree in 4-5 years 
(Smith, 2006; Knight, 2013). Unlike other Agrilus species that are attracted 
to and attack mainly stressed trees, EAB is able to attack and kill 
presumably healthy trees in both natural and urban settings.  Today, EAB 
infestations have been detected in 22 states; Colorado, Connecticut, 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan,

grilus species that are attracted

presumably healthy trees in both natural and urban settings.  Today, EAB 
infestations have been detected in 22 states; Colorado, Connecticut, 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West 
Virginia, and Wisconsin. EAB appears well suited for climatic conditions 
in North America and destroys entire stands of ash trees. EAB will 
continue to disperse along continuous corridors of ash now present in 
natural and urban environments due to the widespread use of ash as a 
landscape tree. 
1 In this case, small, stingless wasps that during their development, live in the body or egg of a single 
host individual, eventually killing that individual. 
2 Regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42   
United States Code 4321 et seq.) provide that an environmental assessment “[shall include brief 
discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E), of the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons 
consulted.”  40 CFR § 1508.9.

All of the existing EAB management options (discussed below) are 
expensive, temporary, ineffective, and/or include non-target impacts.  For 
these reasons, there is a need to identify and release an effective, host-
specific biological control organism against EAB in the continental United 
States.   
 
II. Alternatives 
  
This section will explain the two alternatives available to APHIS–PPQ: no 
action (no issuance of permits) and issuance of permits for environmental 
release of S. galinae in the continental United States. Although APHIS’ 
alternatives are limited to a decision of whether to issue permits for release 
of S. galinae, other methods are described that are currently used to control 
EAB in the United States. Use of these control methods is not an APHIS 
decision, and their use is likely to continue whether or not APHIS-PPQ 
issued permits for environmental release of S. galinae.   
 
APHIS–PPQ considered a third alternative but will not analyze it further. 
Under this third alternative, APHIS–PPQ would issue permits for the field 
release of S. galinae. The permits, however, would contain special 
provisions or requirements concerning release procedures or mitigating 
measures, such as limited releases of S. galinae in the United States. There 
are no issues raised indicating that special provisions or requirements are 
necessary.

release of S. galinae. The permits, however, would contain special 
provisions or requirements concerning release procedures or mitigating 
measures, such as limited releases of S. galinae in the United States. There 
are no issues raised indicating that special provisions or requirements are 
necessary. 
 
A.  No Action  
 
Under the no action alternative, APHIS–PPQ would not issue permits for 
the field release of S. galinae for the control of EAB — t he release of this 
biological control agent would not occur, and current methods to control 
EAB in the United States will continue. Use of these methods is likely to 
continue even if APHIS–PPQ issues permits for release of S. galinae. 
Presently, control of EAB in the United States is limited to physical, 
chemical, and biological control methods. 
 
1. Physical Control 
 
In a forest environment, rapid detection of EAB presence and destruction 
of affected tree materials is the best method to reduce the chance of other 
ash trees being attacked in the area. Dead and dying ash trees should be cut 
down and chipped, burned, or buried on the site. 
 
 
 
 2 
2. Chemical Control 
 
There are several insecticides that may be applied to ash trees; systemic 
insecticides and protective cover sprays.  Systemic insecticides are applied 
and translocated throughout the tree. Systemic insecticides including 
imidacloprid, emamectin benzoate, and Bidrin® may be applied as soil 
injections or drenches, or may be injected directly into the tree using 
specialized equipment (Herms et al., 2009).  The systemic

  Systemic insecticides are applied 
and translocated throughout the tree. Systemic insecticides including 
imidacloprid, emamectin benzoate, and Bidrin® may be applied as soil 
injections or drenches, or may be injected directly into the tree using 
specialized equipment (Herms et al., 2009).  The systemic insecticide 
dinotefuran can be applied to the bark; it is absorbed through the bark and 
distributed throughout the tree (Herms et al., 2009). Protective cover sprays 
using permethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, or carbaryl, are applied to the bark 
and foliage to target adult beetles or EAB larvae as they chew through the 
bark (Herms et al., 2009).    
 
3. Biological Control  
 
Three parasitoids were discovered parasitizing EAB in China and were 
approved as biological control agents of EAB in the United States (Liu et 
al., 2003; 2007). These EAB biocontrol agents are:  (1) Oobius agrili, a 
solitary egg parasitoid that has two generations per year (Zhang et al., 
2005; Bauer and Liu, 2007), (2) Tetrastichus planipennisi, a larval 
endoparasitoid that may complete four generations per year and produces 
an average of 57 progeny per EAB larva (Liu et al., 2003; 2007; Yang et 
al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010), and  (3) Spathius agrili, a larval 
ectoparasitoid that has two generations per year and produces an average of 
five progeny per EAB lar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
an average of 57 progeny per EAB larva (Liu et al., 2003; 2007; Yang et 
al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010), and  (3) Spathius agrili, a larval 
ectoparasitoid that has two generations per year and produces an average of 
five progeny per EAB larva (Yang et al., 2010; Gould et al., 2011).   
 
B.  Issue Permits for Environmental Release of  
S. galinae (Preferred Alternative)  
 
Under this alternative, APHIS–PPQ would issue permits upon request and 
after evaluation of each application for the field release of S. galinae for the 
control of EAB in the continental United States. These permits would 
contain no special provisions or requirements concerning release 
procedures or mitigating measures. 
 
1. Spathius galinae Taxonomic Information 
 
Spathius galinae is an ectoparasitoid attacking 2nd to 4th instar EAB larvae. 
Oviposition (egg laying) by S. galinae on the EAB larva paralyzes it and 
stops its development beyond the larval stage.

Insects Introduction Research Unit. 
 
c. Natural geographic range, other areas of introduction, and expected 
attainable range in North America (also habitat preference and 
climatic requirements of S. galinae).  Spathius galinae has been collected 
from Vladivostok and Khaborovsk, Russia and from Daejeon and 
Yangsuri, South Korea (Belokobylskij et al., 2012; Gould and Duan, 2013).  
The insects used to initiate colonies in the United States were all collected 
from EAB populations infesting Fraxinus pennsylvanica trees in the 
Vladivostok area (Duan et al., 2012a).  In contrast, the previously 
introduced agent S. agrili was collected primarily from Tianjin, China, and 
it is rare and difficult to collect in Changchun, China.  Tianjin, 
approximately 1,000 kilometers south of Vladivostok, is the source of the 
S. agrili population released in the United States.  The climatic conditions 
that are most conducive to population growth of S. galinae or S. agrili are 
not explicitly known; therefore, climate matching analyses were conducted

000 kilometers south of Vladivostok, is the source of the 
S. agrili population released in the United States.  The climatic conditions 
that are most conducive to population growth of S. galinae or S. agrili are 
not explicitly known; therefore, climate matching analyses were conducted 
to determine how similar Vladivostok and Tianjin are with the regions of 
the United States that are infested with EAB.   
The climate matching feature of the climate analysis software CLIMEX 
(Hearne Scientific Software Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) was used.  The 
software calculated a Climate Match Index (CMI) that is a measure of the 
degree of similarity between a home location and away locations.  The 
index had values between 0, complete dissimilarity, and 1, exact climate 
match.  Adult Spathius are only present in the summer, so the adult model 
for matching was restricted to June 4 through September 30 and was based 
on minimum temperature, maximum temperature, total precipitation, 
precipitation pattern, and relative humidity.  Because larvae live under 
bark, the larval model for matching was based on minimum temperature, 
maximum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation pattern for an 
entire year. 
Climate matching analyses comparing Vladivostok and Tianjin to the rest 
of Asia indicate that S. agrili and S. galinae come from climatically unique 
regions of Asia. Species adapted to one of these conditions are more likely 
to establish and survive well in parts of North America that match these 
climatic conditions than will other species.  The climate of Tianjin (the 
source area for S. agrili) is best matched with the climate in the center of

 come from climatically unique 
regions of Asia. Species adapted to one of these conditions are more likely 
to establish and survive well in parts of North America that match these 
climatic conditions than will other species.  The climate of Tianjin (the 
source area for S. agrili) is best matched with the climate in the center of 
the United States (larval model – green area in Fig. 1) and the southeastern 
 4 
United States (adult model – green area in Fig. 2).  The areas where 
scientists have released and studied establishment of S. agrili to date are in 
the more northern parts of the United States (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois).  At 
these sites, S. agrili does establish, and percentage parasitism after the first 
winter is sometimes high, but after the first year the insects are found in 
very low numbers or not at all.  Climate incompatibility and possible 
asynchrony between parasitoid and host could certainly contribute to the 
observed lack of persistence of S. agrili in the northern United States.  The 
climate matching analysis indicates that S. galinae may be better adapted 
than S. agrili for establishment in the northern United States (green areas in 
Figs. 3 and 4).

e. Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  Spathius galinae females search the trunk of ash trees infested with 
EAB, ovipositing on the larvae through the bark.  The EAB is paralyzed 
and the parasitoid eggs are deposited on the outside of the larva.  From 
6−15 larvae feed externally on the EAB larva and spin cocoons inside the 
EAB gallery (Duan et al., 2012a), eventually chewing through the bark and 
emerging as adults.  In the laboratory, a female lays an average of 31 eggs 
during her lifetime, which averages 6.8 weeks.  Spathius galinae can 
complete a generation in 3–4 weeks under normal rearing conditions (25–
27oC, and 16 hours of light:8 hours of dark photoperiod) and diapause is 
not obligatory (it does not enter diapause under long day/warm temperature 
conditions), both of which indicate that this insect completes at least two 
generations per year. Sample percentage parasitism on green ash at two 
sites near Vladivostok, Russia averaged approximately 63 percent (Duan et 
al., 2012a); while at a site near Khabarovsk, EAB were attacked by T. 
planipennisi and S. galinae was not present.  Because S. galinae has at least 
two generations per year, total attack by parasitoids within a single EAB

two generations per year, total attack by parasitoids within a single EAB 
 7 
generation is likely higher.  Although data are not available on the dispersal 
capability of S. galinae, they fly strongly and are long lived (10–12 weeks), 
indicating that dispersal capabilities may be high.   
 
f. History of past use of S. galinae.  Spathius galinae has never been used 
as a biological control agent. 
 
g. Pathogens, parasites, hyperparasitoids of S. galinae and how to 
eliminate them from a culture of the agent.  No pathogens, parasitoids, 
or hyperparasitoids have been observed attacking S. galinae, either in 
Russia or Korea or in specimens imported to the United States. Only 
healthy S. galinae are used to establish colonies. If any diseased organisms 
are discovered, they will be sent to insect pathologists for identification, 
and hyperparasitoids will be eliminated from the colony. Insects that are 
subsequently reared in the United States will be maintained in pure culture 
and monitored for disease.

h. Standard Operating Procedures stating how agent will be handled in 
quarantine.  Both the ARS Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit 
and PPQ have well developed quarantine standard operating procedures for 
handling exotic insects including S. galinae. All imported (exotic) insects 
will be first examined and screened in a well-confined sample processing 
room; any contaminants will be excluded during the process. Spathius 
galinae will be reared on EAB larvae feeding in small ash logs according to 
methods described in Duan et al. (2011; 2013b).  Spathius galinae females 
readily parasitize EAB larvae in these logs. Colonies will be maintained in 
bioclimatic chambers set at 25ºC, 65 percent relative humidity, and a day 
length of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark. Under these conditions, S. 
galinae does not enter diapause and colonies can be maintained 
indefinitely. All material is sterilized before being removed from 
quarantine. 
 
III. Affected Environment 
 
A.  North American Agrilus species 
 
The “Nomina insecta Nearctica; a checklist of the insects of North 
America” (Poole, 1997) lists 164 species of Agrilus in North America.  
Most are not considered pests; however, Solomon (1995) considers 24 
Agrilus species to cause injury to trees and shrubs under certain 
circumstances. Most species of Agrilus are unable to colonize healthy trees; 
in fact, EAB is not typically a pest of Fraxinus in its native range. Agrilus 
species typically attack trees that are stressed by factors such as drought, 
damage

 24 
Agrilus species to cause injury to trees and shrubs under certain 
circumstances. Most species of Agrilus are unable to colonize healthy trees; 
in fact, EAB is not typically a pest of Fraxinus in its native range. Agrilus 
species typically attack trees that are stressed by factors such as drought, 
damage from other insects, or poor silvicultural practices. In some cases 
their actions may be considered beneficial since they remove sick or 
 8 
damaged trees from the forest. Species such as Agrilus anxius Gory (bronze 
birch borer) and Agrilus bilineatus (Weber) (two-lined chestnut borer) are 
often considered major pest species in forest and landscape situations, but 
they are typically acting as secondary pests on already stressed trees or 
trees not native to the United States. Agrilus hyperici (Creutzer) has been 
released as a biological control agent of the weedy St. John’s wort, 
Hypericum perforatum L., in the western United States and is considered to 
be contributing to weed suppression in Idaho (Campbell and McCaffery, 
1991).  However, St. John’s wort is a perennial herb, not a tree, and grows 
in meadows, not in forests. 
 
B.  Ash Resources of North America 
 
The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  
Twenty-two species of ash grow in the United States, of which sixteen are 
native (USDA, NRCS, 2006). Ash species native to North American forests 
and known to be susceptible to EAB include:  white ash (F. americana

The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  
Twenty-two species of ash grow in the United States, of which sixteen are 
native (USDA, NRCS, 2006). Ash species native to North American forests 
and known to be susceptible to EAB include:  white ash (F. americana), 
green ash (F. pennsylvanica), and black ash (F. nigra), which are major 
components of the forest; and blue ash (F. quadrangulata) and pumpkin 
ash (F. profunda), which are less common species.  There is increasing 
evidence that EAB will attack all Fraxinus spp., although susceptibility 
varies by ash species and variety (Liu et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2004; 2007; 
Rebek et al., 2008; Duan et al., 2012a).  
Ash trees are present as ornamentals, street trees, or timber trees in all of 
the lower 48 states except Idaho. It is estimated that there are more than 7.5 
billion ash trees in the United States, and unless climate inhibits population 
growth in the most southern states, all of those trees are at risk of being 
destroyed by EAB. Each Fraxinus species is adapted to slightly different 
habitats within forest ecosystems.  Several species are tolerant of poorly-
drained sites and wet soils, protecting environmentally-sensitive riparian 
areas; pure stands of black ash grow in bogs and swamps in northern areas 
where they provide browse, thermal cover, and protection for wildlife such 
as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash provides vital 
shelter for livestock; for example, about 25 percent of all trees in North

 protecting environmentally-sensitive riparian 
areas; pure stands of black ash grow in bogs and swamps in northern areas 
where they provide browse, thermal cover, and protection for wildlife such 
as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash provides vital 
shelter for livestock; for example, about 25 percent of all trees in North 
Dakota are Fraxinus spp.  Bark of young ash trees is a favored food of 
mammals including beaver, rabbit, and porcupines; older trees provide 
habitat for cavity-nesting birds such as wood ducks, woodpeckers, 
chickadees, and nuthatches; seeds are consumed by ducks, song and game 
birds, small mammals, and insects. 
Ash timber is valued for applications requiring strong, hardwood, but with 
less rigidity than maple.  In the eastern United States, a net volume of 114 
billion board feet of ash sawtimber is harvested, comprising 7.5 percent of 
the volume of all hardwood species (FR, 2003).  In 2001, ash accounted for 
over 149 million board feet of timber products produced in the United 
 9 
States.  White ash is the primary commercial hardwood used in production 
of tool handles, baseball bats, furniture, flooring, containers, railroad cars 
and ties, canoe paddles, snowshoes, boats, doors, and cabinets; green ash is 
used for both solid wood applications such as crating, boxes, handles, and 
for fiber in the manufacture of high grade paper; black ash is typically used 
for interior furniture, cabinets (FR, 2003), and Northeastern Native 
Americans require ash for the art of basketry.

for interior furniture, cabinets (FR, 2003), and Northeastern Native 
Americans require ash for the art of basketry. 
 
Beyond manufacturing, ash trees play an important role in the urban 
landscape due to their historical resistance to pests and tolerance of adverse 
growing conditions, such as soil compaction and drought.  Many of the ash 
trees that now serve as street, shade, and landscape trees were planted to 
replace elm trees destroyed by Dutch elm disease; ash trees now comprise 
5−20 percent of all street trees throughout North America.  In the United 
States, urban areas cover about 3.5 percent of the total land area, contain 
more than 75 percent of the population, and support about 3.8 billion trees.  
The City of Chicago has approximately 603,000 ash trees that provide 14.4 
percent of leaf area (FR, 2003).  Trees are considered vital to the health of 
cities because they sequester gaseous air pollutants and particulate matter, 
help people conserve energy through the shade they provide, assist in the 
dispersal of storm water, provide shelter belts for urban fauna, and 
contribute aesthetic pleasure to the lives of city-dwellers and tourists.  Ash 
is a vital component of the urban forest.

IV.  Environmental Consequences 
 
A.  No Action Alternative 
 
1.  Impact of EAB  
 
EAB is an invasive wood-boring beetle that is spreading rapidly and poses 
a serious threat to ash trees in the United States if not controlled.  Despite 
state and federal quarantines designed to contain EAB, there is a lack of 
effective methods to detect and control EAB.  Besides natural dispersal, the 
spread of EAB has been accelerated through human-assisted movement of 
infested ash firewood, timber, solid-wood packing materials, and nursery 
stock. As EAB spreads throughout North America, regulatory agencies, 
land managers, and the public are seeking sustainable management tools to 
reduce EAB population densities and to slow its spread (Cappaert et al., 
2005; GAO, 2006; Poland and McCullough, 2006).  Since its discovery, 
EAB has killed tens of millions of ash trees and has cost municipalities, 
property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries tens of 
millions of dollars.

Trees in the genus Fraxinus are important components of many forested 
ecosystems throughout North America and are planted extensively as urban 
and shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis 
estimates that establishment of EAB throughout the United States could 
result in loss of approximately 2.6 percent of trees in timberlands or 7.5 
billion trees (USDA FS, 2006).  White, blue, and Oregon ash grow on 
fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, Carolina, and pumpkin ash

 the United States could 
result in loss of approximately 2.6 percent of trees in timberlands or 7.5 
billion trees (USDA FS, 2006).  White, blue, and Oregon ash grow on 
fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, Carolina, and pumpkin ash 
are wetland species; and velvet and single-leaf ash grow in semi-deserts 
and canyons.  If EAB populations are not managed, ash resources 
throughout North America will be devastated (MacFarlane and Meyer, 
2005).  The loss of ash over large geographical areas will adversely affect 
water, soil, and air, resources.  Ash is an important riparian tree and is often 
found along river banks.  Removing ash from stream banks will affect bank 
soil retention and stream processes.  
 
2. Impact from the Use of Other EAB Control Methods 
 
The continued use of physical, chemical, and biological control at current 
levels would result if the “no action” alternative is chosen, and may 
continue even if permits are issued for environmental release of S. galinae. 
 
a. Physical Control 
 
Although physical control may slow the spread of EAB to other ash trees in 
an area, this method is not effective at controlling the EAB population.  It 
is likely that ash trees in the area will eventually become infested.   
 
b. Chemical Control 
 
Insecticide treatment of ash trees for EAB control is inconsistent in 
effectiveness, especially on larger trees.  Results have been mixed in 
insecticide efficacy studies; in some sites, insecticides are effective but fail 
in other sites (Herms et al., 2009). In addition, insecticide treatment does

b. Chemical Control 
 
Insecticide treatment of ash trees for EAB control is inconsistent in 
effectiveness, especially on larger trees.  Results have been mixed in 
insecticide efficacy studies; in some sites, insecticides are effective but fail 
in other sites (Herms et al., 2009). In addition, insecticide treatment does 
not guarantee that the tree will be protected from EAB attack.  Trees with 
greater than 50 percent canopy loss are unlikely to recover even if treated 
with insecticides (Herms et al., 2009). Foliar and bark treatments can result 
in pesticide drift that affects non-target organisms in the treatment area, and 
trunk injections can cause damage to the injected tree. Insecticide 
treatments can be costly, especially on large trees and must be repeated 
annually to be effective, although emamectin benzoate is effective for two 
years or longer (Herms et al., 2009).   
 
Insecticide treatments are useful to protect certain high value trees but are 
not practical for controlling EAB over a large area or forest situation.  
Besides being costly, there are label restrictions on the amount of 
insecticide that can be applied per acre per year.

c. Biological Control  
 
All three parasitoid species that have been previously released against EAB 
(Oobius agrili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Spathius agrili) have been 
recovered following release in the United States; however, only T. 
planipennisi and O. agrili have been recovered consistently more than one 
year after release. At two sites in Michigan, parasitism by O. agrili

ili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Spathius agrili) have been 
recovered following release in the United States; however, only T. 
planipennisi and O. agrili have been recovered consistently more than one 
year after release. At two sites in Michigan, parasitism by O. agrili 
increased from 3-4 percent in the year of release to 20–28 percent two 
years later.  Tetrastichis planipennisi, a stronger flier than O. agrili, has 
effectively spread and established.  At six intensively studied sites in 
Michigan, 92 percent of the trees at the release site contained at least one 
brood of T. planipennisi four years after release, and parasitism levels 
increased steadily to an average of over 20 percent (Duan et al., 2013a).  
Parasitism by T. planipennisi at the six control sites (at least 1 kilometer 
away) also increased yearly to an average level of 13 percent.  The story 
was not the same for S. agrili.  At a release site near Hawley, Michigan, 18 
percent of the EAB were parasitized by S. agrili after one year; however, a 
sample of 40 entire trees the following year revealed not a single parasitoid.  
At another site, parasitism one year after release was 45 percent, two 
broods were discovered the following year and two broods were recovered 
in 2011, but parasitism by S. agrili has been very low.  At the six 
intensively sampled study sites, S. agrili was recovered in yellow pan traps, 
but only two EAB larvae parasitized by this species have been recovered

broods were discovered the following year and two broods were recovered 
in 2011, but parasitism by S. agrili has been very low.  At the six 
intensively sampled study sites, S. agrili was recovered in yellow pan traps, 
but only two EAB larvae parasitized by this species have been recovered 
after 2–5 years of sampling.  One possible explanation is that S. agrili was 
collected from Tianjin, China, which is near the southern limit of the EAB 
distribution in China, and the climate there is a better match for the central 
rather than the northern United States.  There may be a problem with 
synchrony between the emergence of adult S. agrili and availability of the 
mature EAB larvae that they attack. 
 
Although O. agrili and T. planipennisi are establishing and dispersing, both 
have limitations that affect their ability to successfully control EAB 
populations. Oobius agrili is a very small insect, dispersing much more 
slowly than T. planipennisi. It is also solitary, with only one adult emerging 
from an EAB egg, although it is important because it prevents damage to 
the phloem caused by EAB larvae. Tetrastichus planipennisi is a gregarious 
larval parasitoid, producing an average of 57 adults per EAB larva (Liu et 
al., 2003; 2007; Yang et al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010); however, it is a 
relatively small insect with a short ovipositor (egg-laying organ) and 
cannot parasitize EAB larvae under the thick bark of larger trees (Abell et

al., 2003; 2007; Yang et al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010); however, it is a 
relatively small insect with a short ovipositor (egg-laying organ) and 
cannot parasitize EAB larvae under the thick bark of larger trees (Abell et 
al., 2012).  Tetrastichus planipennisi cannot oviposit in bark thicker than 
3.2 millimeters (mm), which means it is limited to attacking EAB in the top 
of mature trees or in smaller trees (stems <11.2 centimeters (cm) diameter).  
It is anticipated that T. planipennisi will be most effective in stands of 
small, early successional ash rather than in mature forests.

B.  Biological control alternative (preferred alternative) 
 
1.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of S. galinae 
 
a. Known impact on vertebrates including humans:   Spathius galinae is 
an obligate parasitoid of wood boring larvae, specifically EAB.  As such, it 
will rarely come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it 
does, it is incapable of stinging or biting.  Braconid wasps have no known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
b. Direct impact of S. galinae (e.g., intended effects on EAB, direct 
effects on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism by S. galinae in Russia can 
reach 63 percent in stands of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) (Duan et 
al., 2012a).

b. Direct impact of S. galinae (e.g., intended effects on EAB, direct 
effects on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism by S. galinae in Russia can 
reach 63 percent in stands of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) (Duan et 
al., 2012a).  Because S. galinae has at least two generations per year 
compared with just one (univoltine) or half (semivoltine) for EAB, 
generational percentage parasitism will be greater than that measured 
during a single collection.  Spathius galinae clearly has the potential to 
cause considerable mortality to EAB populations.  In Asia, it is probable 
that EAB is not typically a pest because of the interaction between host 
plant resistance and natural enemies. While it is clear that American ash 
species are not resistant to EAB per se, they can withstand some attack as 
evidenced by callusing of EAB galleries, and woodpeckers can remove a 
considerable percentage of overwintering larvae.  In Michigan, 32 to 42 
percent of EAB larvae were removed by woodpeckers (Duan et al., 2010; 
2013a) and a 2012 study at sites in Ulster County in New York found that 
woodpeckers removed between 40 and 65 percent of mature EAB larvae 
(Gould and Vandenberg, unpublished). Duan et al. (2010) also found that 
tree defenses in lightly infested young green ash killed 10 to 12 percent of 
EAB larvae. Spathius galinae will not have to cause 100 percent mortality 
of EAB to beneficially affect the health of ash stands, because ash can 
successfully withstand some attack.

tree defenses in lightly infested young green ash killed 10 to 12 percent of 
EAB larvae. Spathius galinae will not have to cause 100 percent mortality 
of EAB to beneficially affect the health of ash stands, because ash can 
successfully withstand some attack. 
 
To evaluate the effects of S. galinae on non-target insect species, no-choice 
and choice host specificity tests were conducted in the United States to 
determine the physiological host range of S. galinae and possible direct 
effects on non-target species. Between 2011 and 2013, 15 North American 
species of wood-boring insects were exposed to S. galinae by scientists at 
the ARS Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit and PPQ to assess 
the parasitoid’s host range. Spathius galinae finds hosts to parasitize by 
using cues associated with sounds or vibrations produced by feeding borer 
larvae.  Studies have shown that they do not attack prepupae or molting 
larvae that are not feeding (Duan et al., 2013c).  All test larvae, therefore, 
had to be feeding inside their natural hosts during testing.  To accomplish 
this, bark flaps were created in 4-8 cm diameter logs and a 3 cm long 
groove was drilled underneath each flap.  The test larvae were placed in 
 13 
these grooves, and the flaps were reassembled and secured with rubber 
bands.  The logs were placed into plastic jars that contained five one-week 
old S. galinae females and one male.  The parasitoids were fed honey 
streaked on the fabric covering the lid of the jars.  Every time

 larvae were placed in 
 13 
these grooves, and the flaps were reassembled and secured with rubber 
bands.  The logs were placed into plastic jars that contained five one-week 
old S. galinae females and one male.  The parasitoids were fed honey 
streaked on the fabric covering the lid of the jars.  Every time a test was 
initiated with one or more non-target hosts, the same number of EAB 
larvae was tested in ash as a positive control to demonstrate that the wasps 
used in the tests were physiologically ready to attack suitable hosts.  After 
two weeks, the larvae were checked to determine if they were parasitized.  
All parasitized larvae were held for at least 4 weeks to determine if S. 
galinae could develop to the adult stage. For the choice tests, gravid 
females of S. galinae were presented simultaneously to both an ash log 
containing five target host larvae (EAB) and an ash or non-ash log 
containing five non-target host larvae in a test arena (ventilated-clear 
polystyrene crisper boxes,each 17.6 × 12.6 × 10 cm, Tri-State Plastics, 
Latonia, KY). After a period of 2-weeks of exposure, the logs were 
incubated in normal rearing conditions for two weeks and scored for 
parasitism by S. galinae as previously described for the no-choice test.      
The larvae of fifteen wood-boring insects were tested to assess the host 
specificity of S. galinae (Table 1).  Emphasis was placed on species closely 
related to the target pest or those feeding on ash.  Thirteen species were

. galinae as previously described for the no-choice test.      
The larvae of fifteen wood-boring insects were tested to assess the host 
specificity of S. galinae (Table 1).  Emphasis was placed on species closely 
related to the target pest or those feeding on ash.  Thirteen species were 
wood-boring beetles; one clearwing moth (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) and one 
sawfly (Hymenoptera: Cephidae) were also tested.  Of the beetles, five 
were in the genus Agrilus, and were thus closely related to the EAB, and 
another was in the same family (Buprestidae).  Three of the tested insects, 
the longhorned beetle Neoclytus acuminatus; the clearwinged moth 
Podosesia spp.; and the eastern ash bark beetle, Hylesinus fraxini attack ash 
as their main host and would be susceptible to parasitism if S. galinae 
accepts any boring insects infesting ash.   
Spathius galinae only attacked one species other than the EAB, and that 
was the gold spotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus in red oak.  The rate 
of parasitism was, however, considerably less (41 percent) on the non-
target host than on the EAB (71 percent) under test conditions that strongly 
favored parasitism. Spathius galinae did not attack any of the other three 
species infesting red oak, nor did they attack any of the other Agrilus or any 
of the three non-Agrilus species infesting ash.

the Release of S. galinae 
 
a. Effects on physical environment (e.g. water, soil and air resources):  
Trees in the genus Fraxinus are important components of many forested 
ecosystems throughout North America and are planted extensively as 
urban and shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and

 shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and 
Analysis estimates that establishment of EAB throughout the United 
States could result in loss of approximately 2.6 percent of trees in U.S. 
timberlands or 7.5 billion trees (USDA, FS, 2006).  White, blue, and 
Oregon ash grow on fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, 
Carolina, and pumpkin ash are wetland species; and velvet and single-leaf 
ash grow in semi-deserts and canyons.  If EAB populations are not 
managed, ash resources throughout North America could be devastated 
(MacFarlane and Meyer, 2005).  The loss of ash over large geographical 
areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air, resources.  Ash is an 
important riparian tree and is often found along river banks.  Removing 
ash from stream banks will affect bank soil retention and stream processes. 
The successful deployment of EAB biocontrol agents such as S. galinae 
will have a positive impact on the physical environment by moderating 
EAB population increase, thus limiting tree damage.  Conservation of ash 
trees in North American timberlands and urban forests will result in less 
flooding and soil erosion and moderate changes in air quality. 
 
b. Indirect effects (e.g. potential impacts on organisms that depend on 
EAB or non-target species including potential competition with 
resident biological control agents).  Successful management of EAB 
using biological control agents, including S. galinae, will result in 
positive, indirect effects on U.S. municipalities, land owners, wood 
industries, Native American basketry, air quality, forest biodiversity, 
wildlife, riparian areas, wildlife,

 species including potential competition with 
resident biological control agents).  Successful management of EAB 
using biological control agents, including S. galinae, will result in 
positive, indirect effects on U.S. municipalities, land owners, wood 
industries, Native American basketry, air quality, forest biodiversity, 
wildlife, riparian areas, wildlife, and organisms dependent on Fraxinus 
spp. (e.g., the cerambycid: red-headed ash borer, Neoclytus acuminatus; 
the sphingid: great ash sphinx, Sphinx chersis). Organisms most directly 
affected by EAB-associated ash demise will be those directly dependent 
on ash trees, such as ash-specialist plant-feeding arthropods (Gandhi and 
Herms, 2010), including several Lepidoptera (butterflies, moths, and 
skippers) species identified at high risk of endangerment (Wagner, 2007). 
Fraxinus pennsylvanica provides food and nesting for songbirds and food 
and shelter for mammals (USDA, NRCS, 2003). Fraxinus nigra seeds are 
consumed by game birds, songbirds and small mammals and used as 
browse by white-tailed deer and moose (Wright et al., 1990). Beavers also 
use ash as a food resource (Henry and Bookhout, 1970).    
 
The indirect effects on a few biological control projects that utilize Agrilus 
species to control weeds must be considered. Agrilus hyperici was

The indirect effects on a few biological control projects that utilize Agrilus 
species to control weeds must be considered. Agrilus hyperici was 
released against Klamath weed (St. John’s wort) in the western United 
 17 
States and has shown mixed results.  In northern Idaho it is beneficial in 
assisting two Klamath weed beetles, Chrysolina sp., in controlling the 
target weed (Campbell and McCaffery, 1991), but in California it has been 
displaced by Chrysolina quadrigemina (McCaffrey et al., 1995). Agrilus 
hyperici is a root feeder acting on a rangeland weed and it is not likely to 
come in contact with populations of S. galinae. Another exotic buprestid, 
Sphenoptera jugoslavica, also a root feeder, was released against spotted, 
diffuse, and squarrose knapweeds. Spathius galinae attacks larvae in 
branches and trunks in forest ecosystems. It is unlikely that S. galinae will 
be attracted to rangeland habitats or to attack larvae in the roots of 
herbaceous plants. Spathius galinae is not known to search for hosts 
underground and is not likely to attack A. hyperici or S. jugoslavica. 
 
3.  Uncertainties Regarding the Environmental Release of S. 
galinae. 
 
Once a biological control agent such as S. galinae is released into the 
environment and becomes established, there is a slight possibility that it 
could move from the target insect (EAB) to attack nontarget insects, such 
as native Agrilus species. Based on host specificity testing conducted, S.

 of S. 
galinae. 
 
Once a biological control agent such as S. galinae is released into the 
environment and becomes established, there is a slight possibility that it 
could move from the target insect (EAB) to attack nontarget insects, such 
as native Agrilus species. Based on host specificity testing conducted, S. 
galinae only attacked one species other than the EAB, and that was the 
gold spotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus, in red oak.  The rate of 
parasitism was considerably less (41 percent) on the non-target host than 
on EAB (71 percent) under test conditions that strongly favored 
parasitism. Native species that are closely related to the target species are 
the most likely to be attacked (Louda et al., 2003). If other insect species 
were to be attacked by S. galinae, the resulting effects could be 
environmental impacts that may not be easily reversed. Biological control 
agents such as S. galinae generally spread without intervention by man. In 
principle, therefore, release of these parasitoids at even one site should be 
considered equivalent to release over the entire area in which potential 
hosts occur and in which the climate is suitable for reproduction and 
survival. Post-release evaluations of S. galinae populations and their 
effects on EAB and other non-target species will be conducted by the 
permittee. 
 
In addition, these agents may not be successful in reducing EAB 
populations in the continental United States. Approximately 12 percent of 
all parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control
Text Len: 1657
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 other non-target species will be conducted by the 
permittee. 
 
In addition, these agents may not be successful in reducing EAB 
populations in the continental United States. Approximately 12 percent of 
all parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control of the pest (Greathead and Greathead, 1992) either because 
introduction did not lead to establishment or establishment did not lead to 
control (Lane et al., 1999). Actual impacts on EAB populations by S. 
galinae will not be known until after release occurs and post-release 
monitoring has been conducted.  For instance, although Oobius agrili and 
 18 
Tetrastichus planipennisi are establishing and dispersing, both have 
limitations that affect their ability to successfully control EAB populations 
that were not known until after their release. Parasitism of EAB by 
Spathius agrili has also been much lower than expected.  
The environmental consequences discussed under the “no action” 
alternative may occur even with the implementation of the biological 
control alternative, depending on the efficacy of S. galinae, in 
combination with the other organisms released for biological control of 
EAB, to reduce EAB populations in the continental United States. 
 
4.  Cumulative Impacts 
 
“Cumulative impacts are defined as the impact on the environment which 
results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, 
present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agencies or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).   
 
APHIS has put quarantines

“Cumulative impacts are defined as the impact on the environment which 
results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, 
present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agencies or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).   
 
APHIS has put quarantines in place to prevent the movement of EAB out 
of EAB-infested areas of the United States (7 CFR Subpart 301.53).  This 
area may expand as new infestations are discovered.  Quarantines are put 
in place to prevent the artificial spread of EAB through movement of 
infested firewood or other infested wood materials.  In addition, APHIS, in 
cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of Agriculture, 
conducts survey program to determine new areas of EAB infestation.  
These methods do not control EAB but slow the spread or provide 
infestation information to state departments of agriculture for 
implementation of quarantines.   
 
Homeowners apply insecticides or hire arborists and tree care 
professionals to make applications to protect high-value ash trees in the 
landscape.  Landowners may conduct a salvage harvest should EAB be 
detected in their ash trees. Insecticide applications and tree removals 
provide a temporary local reduction of EAB but do not result in long term 
control. 
 
Because little can be done to control EAB, research is being conducted at 
universities and by Federal agencies to understand the beetle's life cycle 
and find ways to detect new infestations, control EAB adults and larvae, 
and contain the infestation.

control. 
 
Because little can be done to control EAB, research is being conducted at 
universities and by Federal agencies to understand the beetle's life cycle 
and find ways to detect new infestations, control EAB adults and larvae, 
and contain the infestation.    
  
Release of S. galinae will have no negative cumulative impacts in the 
continental United States because of its host specificity to EAB, other than 
potential impacts on non-target Agrilus species such as the gold spotted 
oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus.  However, based on host-specificity 
testing conducted, impacts to non-target Agrilus spp. are expected to be 
 19 
minimal because S. galinae clearly preferred EAB.  Effective biological 
control of EAB will have beneficial effects to current EAB management 
activities, and may result in protection of ash resources and reduction in 
removals of infested trees. 
 
5.  Endangered Species Act 
 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ESA’s implementing 
regulations require Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of federally listed threatened 
or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification 
of critical habitat.   
 
Only one wood boring insect is listed as threatened under the ESA, the 
valley elderberry longhorned beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) 
and none are listed as endangered.  The valley elderberry longhorned 
beetle mines the interior wood of the host plant, which must be at least 2.5 
cm in diameter (P
Text Len: 1575

 insect is listed as threatened under the ESA, the 
valley elderberry longhorned beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) 
and none are listed as endangered.  The valley elderberry longhorned 
beetle mines the interior wood of the host plant, which must be at least 2.5 
cm in diameter (Paine et al., 2004), where it would not be accessible to the 
relatively short ovipositor of S. galinae.  In addition, the valley elderberry 
longhorned borer is not closely related to EAB, and elderberry is not 
closely related to ash. Therefore, release of S. galinae will have no effect 
on the valley elderberry longhorned beetle or its designated critical 
habitat. Spathius galinae must attack its hosts, even EAB, as they are 
feeding beneath the bark of trees; therefore S. galinae will have no effect 
on any other threatened or endangered insects (or their critical habitat), 
which are all external feeders.   
 
V.  Other Issues 
 
Consistent with Executive Order (EO) 12898, “Federal Actions to Address 
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income 
Populations,” APHIS considered the potential for disproportionately high 
and adverse human health or environmental effects on any minority 
populations and low-income populations.  No environmental or human 
health effects from the proposed action are expected and there will be no 
disproportionate adverse effects to any minority or low-income 
populations.   
 
Consistent with EO 13045, “Protection of Children From Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks,” APHIS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
income populations.  No environmental or human 
health effects from the proposed action are expected and there will be no 
disproportionate adverse effects to any minority or low-income 
populations.   
 
Consistent with EO 13045, “Protection of Children From Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks,” APHIS considered the potential for 
disproportionately high and adverse environmental health and safety risks 
to children.  No circumstances that would trigger the need for special 
environmental reviews are involved in implementing the preferred 
alternative.  Therefore, it is expected that no disproportionate effects on 
children are anticipated as a consequence of implementing the preferred 
 20 
alternative. 
 
EO 13175, “Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments”, was issued to ensure that there would be “meaningful 
consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of 
Federal policies that have tribal implications….” Consistent with EO 
13175, in April and May, 2014, APHIS sent letters of notification and 
requests for comment and consultation on this proposed action to tribes in 
32 states, reflecting the very wide national distribution of ash (Fraxinus 
spp.) in the lower 48 states.  APHIS received responses from the Quartz 
Valley Indian Reservation (California), the Sokaogon Chippewa 
Community (Wisconsin), and the Houlton Band of Maliseets (Maine). In 
June, 2014, APHIS conducted a phone conversation with the Seneca 
Nation (New York) who expressed support at the end of the call.  Contacts 
were made informally with other tribes in New York, followed by calls in 
July and August 1

Community (Wisconsin), and the Houlton Band of Maliseets (Maine). In 
June, 2014, APHIS conducted a phone conversation with the Seneca 
Nation (New York) who expressed support at the end of the call.  Contacts 
were made informally with other tribes in New York, followed by calls in 
July and August 1, 2014.  On August 1, APHIS officials participated in 
informal consultation, via telephone, with representatives from the Saint 
Regis Mohawk Tribe and the Shinnecock Nation, both in New York. The 
Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe supported the action, while the Shinnecock 
Nation wished to further examine the documents.  The Shinnecock Nation 
subsequently indicated they had no further questions.  Some of these tribes 
have expressed interest in participating in S. galinae releases and 
monitoring activities.  APHIS will continue to consult and collaborate 
with Indian tribal officials to ensure that they are well-informed and 
represented in policy and program decisions that may impact their 
agricultural interests, in accordance with EO 13175.

Appendix 1. Response to comments. 
 
The draft EA was made available to the public in the Federal Register 
(docket APHIS-2014-0094) from February 12, 2015 to March 16, 2015.  
Ten comments were received on the draft EA.  Five were in support of the 
proposed release of S. galinae.  One comment was unrelated to the 
proposed release and was a general complaint against APHIS’ Wildlife 
Services.   
 
Four commenters had questions or concerns about the release.  These 
comments are addressed below. 
 
1. Three commenters were concerned about non-target impacts of S. 
galinae.  What is the effect of parasitism on the gold spotted oak borer? If 
the gold spotted oak borer experiences a decrease in population numbers, 
could this result in an 'outbreak' in population numbers of other species to 
fill the void in the food web or might species that predate on the gold 
spotted oak borer experience a decline if the gold spotted oak borer is not 
available to its native predator(s)? Will the effects on gold spotted oak 
borer, and its natural predator(s), be monitored by APHIS or another 
agency or academic institution?  
 
No biological control agent has ever completely eliminated its host.  
Therefore, it is expected that the emerald ash borer

 oak borer is not 
available to its native predator(s)? Will the effects on gold spotted oak 
borer, and its natural predator(s), be monitored by APHIS or another 
agency or academic institution?  
 
No biological control agent has ever completely eliminated its host.  
Therefore, it is expected that the emerald ash borer will always be 
available for S. galinae.  As discussed on pages 14 and 18 of this EA, 
based on host specificity testing conducted, S. galinae only attacked one 
species other than the emerald ash borer, and that was the gold spotted oak 
borer, Agrilus auroguttatus, in red oak.  Parasitism attack rates on A. 
auroguttatus were approximately half the levels seen for A. planipennis.  
It is possible that S. galinae will occasionally attack a few non-target 
Agrilus species, but host specificity testing predicts minimal impact. Even 
under no choice test conditions, S. galinae rejected four other Agrilus 
species, and these are the species they are more likely to encounter in the 
eastern United States where the majority of the ash resource occurs.  In 
host specificity testing, S. galinae was even more host specific than the 
previous biological control organisms released for emerald ash borer 
control.   
 
Researchers intend to monitor the impacts of S. galinae on non-target 
species.  They have been collecting data on impacts of previously 
introduced emerald ash borer parasitoids on ash phloem feeding insects 
(clear wing moths and redheaded ash borer) and Agrilus species (A. anxius 
and A. bilineatus) in
Text Len: 1552
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 monitor the impacts of S. galinae on non-target 
species.  They have been collecting data on impacts of previously 
introduced emerald ash borer parasitoids on ash phloem feeding insects 
(clear wing moths and redheaded ash borer) and Agrilus species (A. anxius 
and A. bilineatus) in both Michigan and Maryland, and have observed 
limited parasitism of these non-target insects by previously introduced 
parasitoids (one bronze birch borer was parasitized by Spathius agrili; this 
was not unexpected based on the host-specificity testing that was 
 28 
conducted for that agent). The researchers plan to do the same with S. 
galinae when it is released. 
 
The possibility of risk of the potential S. galinae introduction to some non-
target Agrilus species in North America needs to be balanced against the 
potential benefit that could result from successful biological control of the 
emerald ash borer. Emerald ash borer has now spread to 25 U.S. states and 
two Canadian provinces and killed tens of millions of North American ash 
trees along with the spread.  It has been estimated that eight billion ash 
trees in U.S. forests and woodlands are vulnerable to the emerald ash 
borer.  Uncontrolled spread of emerald ash borer in the United States will 
have adverse impacts on many non-target species and there are no 
methods available to control it at this time. The loss of ash over large 
geographical areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air resources.     
 
2. One commenter questioned the sting/venom/allergic potential of S. 
galinae.

geographical areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air resources.     
 
2. One commenter questioned the sting/venom/allergic potential of S. 
galinae. 
  
As stated on page 13 of this EA, S. galinae is an obligate parasitoid of 
wood boring larvae, specifically emerald ash borer.  As such, it will rarely 
come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it does, it is 
incapable of stinging or biting.  Braconid wasps have no known adverse 
impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
3. One commenter asked whether S. galinae requires a very warm climate. 
 
As described on pages 4 to 7 of this EA, S. galinae does not require a very 
warm climate. 
 
4. One commenter asked what the sensitivities are to various insecticides 
present in the emerald ash borer infested region.  
 
Although it was unclear as to what insecticide sensitivity the commenter 
was referring to, it was interpreted as human sensitivity.  As described on 
page 3 of this EA, several systemic and protective cover insecticides are 
used against emerald ash borers. A portion of the human population is 
sensitive to insecticides, although the percentage of sensitivities to the 
insecticides used against emerald ash borer in the infested area of the 
United States is not known.  Regardless of whether the commenter was 
referring to human sensitivity to insecticides or the sensitivity of other 
organisms to insecticides, the release

 portion of the human population is 
sensitive to insecticides, although the percentage of sensitivities to the 
insecticides used against emerald ash borer in the infested area of the 
United States is not known.  Regardless of whether the commenter was 
referring to human sensitivity to insecticides or the sensitivity of other 
organisms to insecticides, the release of S. galinae is expected to reduce 
the need for the use of insecticides against the emerald ash borer, thus 
having a beneficial effect to any organisms with insecticide sensitivity.    
 
5. Was the use of native woodpeckers considered as a control method in 
combination with other options? A third alternative, which evaluates a 
 29 
multi-factorial approach combining control methods, such as native 
woodpeckers, along with selective chemical control, would help illustrate 
why the preferred method was selected. This discussion should include 
relative costs and risks in greater detail than is currently provided.  
 
The use of woodpeckers as a control method is beyond the scope of this 
EA, and does not meet the purpose and need for the proposed action, 
although woodpeckers are a significant source of mortality of emerald ash 
borer (Cappaert et al., 2005).  The proposed action is the permitting of S. 
galinae, not a general control program for the emerald ash borer. Although 
other methods of control are discussed in the EA for informational 
purposes, these are beyond the purview of the APHIS-PPB Permit Unit.  
The Plant Protection Act of 2000 provides the PPB Permit Unit with the 
authority to issue permits for release of biological control agents as 
requested by permit applicants.  The preferred

 Although 
other methods of control are discussed in the EA for informational 
purposes, these are beyond the purview of the APHIS-PPB Permit Unit.  
The Plant Protection Act of 2000 provides the PPB Permit Unit with the 
authority to issue permits for release of biological control agents as 
requested by permit applicants.  The preferred alternative was selected 
because of the host specificity of S. galinae and its potential as a stand-
alone method for control of emerald ash borer, regardless of any other 
methods of control that are being used.  The only decision available to the 
PPB Permit Unit is whether or not to issue the permit to release S. galinae.   
 
The alternatives could be potentially infinite if the PPB Permit Unit 
analyzed all of the possible emerald ash borer control tools and their 
combinations.  If the PPB Permit Unit were analyzing a proposed control 
program for the emerald ash borer, these alternatives (or a selected suite of 
them) would be appropriate, but not for the decision to issue a permit for 
the environmental release of a biological control organism.  
 
6. What is the plan of control in the event that S. galinae moves from the 
target (emerald ash borer) to other non-target Agrilus species? If 
establishment occurs, but does not lead to control, what species will S. 
galinae be preying upon, what are the potential negative impacts of those 
relationships, and how will the S. galinae population be controlled? 
What are the costs associated with that control?  
  
As stated in the response to comment 1, S. galinae is expected to only 
occasionally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 what species will S. 
galinae be preying upon, what are the potential negative impacts of those 
relationships, and how will the S. galinae population be controlled? 
What are the costs associated with that control?  
  
As stated in the response to comment 1, S. galinae is expected to only 
occasionally attack some non-target Agrilus species. Even under no choice 
test conditions, S. galinae rejected four Agrilus species, and these are 
species that S. galinae is likely to encounter in the eastern United States 
where the majority of the ash resource occurs. In host specificity testing, 
S. galinae was even more host specific than the previous biological control 
organisms released for emerald ash borer control. Emerald ash borers are 
abundant in the environment, while native Agrilus species are less 
abundant and difficult for S. galinae to locate.  If S. galinae establishes but 
does not control the emerald ash borer, it would still continue to parasitize 
it as its preferred host.  There would be no negative impacts expected from 
this other than the emerald ash borer would continue to spread unabated.   
 30 
 
However, if extensive non-target effects are observed, APHIS would not 
issue any more permits for releases or interstate movement of S. galinae, 
although the organism would continue to spread naturally if it became 
established.  There would not likely be a control program implemented 
against S. galinae even if extensive non-target impacts were observed.

helpful to evaluate various control options and how they could possibly be

although the organism would continue to spread naturally if it became 
established.  There would not likely be a control program implemented 
against S. galinae even if extensive non-target impacts were observed.   
 
7. Specific details concerning costs of other control measures would be 
helpful to evaluate various control options and how they could possibly be 
used in combination with other methods.  Additionally, a discussion of 
potential costs associated with the unbridled increase of S. galinae should 
be discussed.  
 
The cost of other control measures for emerald ash borer is beyond the 
scope of this EA.  However, APHIS alone has spent $300 million to 
combat the emerald ash borer since 2002 when it was first detected here. 
This does not include spending by other Federal agencies or the costs to 
states, towns, or homeowners for emerald ash borer control, tree removal, 
and replanting.  Kovacs et al. (2010) used simulations of emerald ash 
borer spread and infestation for 2009-2019 to estimate the cost of ash 
treatment, removal, and replacement on developed land in a 25-state study 
area.  They estimated that 38 million ash trees occur on this land base and 
predict that it would require treatment, removal, and replacement of more 
than 17 million ash trees with a mean discounted cost of $10.7 billion 
(Kovacs et al., 2010).  In contrast, to collect, test, and rear S. galinae, the 
cost to the permit applicant was approximately $500,000.  If S. galinae 
establishes and spreads, it becomes self-perpetuating and there is no 
additional cost besides monitoring costs.

8. EPA recommends adding any correspondence between APHIS and U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regarding this issue as an appendix to 
the EA.  In particular, we recommend that APHIS obtain and document 
concurrence from USFWS on APHIS’ preliminary determination of no 
effect on the valley elderberry longhorned beetle.   
 
APHIS made a no effect determination for the valley elderberry 
longhorned beetle, and justified that determination based on the 
unrelatedness of the longhorned beetle to the emerald ash borer and the 
inability of S. galinae to oviposit in valley elderberry longhorned beetle 
larvae because the ovipositor is too short. Therefore, APHIS is not 
required to consult with or receive concurrence from the USFWS.   
 
9.  EPA recommends USDA analyze the potential for the anticipated loss 
of ash trees, 2.6 percent as estimated by the U.S. Forest Service, to 
contribute to climate change. Alternatively, analysis of the average 
anticipated loss of ash at a more localized geographical level may be more 
 31 
informative. 
 
It has been estimated that eight billion ash trees in U.S. forests and 
woodlands are vulnerable to the emerald ash borer.  Although the impact

anticipated loss of ash at a more localized geographical level may be more

It has been estimated that eight billion ash trees in U.S. forests and 
woodlands are vulnerable to the emerald ash borer.  Although the impact 
of the loss of ash trees on climate change is an important issue, it is 
beyond the scope of this EA.  However, the release and establishment of S. 
galinae is expected to reduce the loss of ash trees and thus, will help to 
reduce the effects of tree loss on climate change.   
 
10. EPA recommends APHIS discuss whether the ash flower gall could 
interfere with the efficacy of S. galinae. 
 
The ash flower gall would have no effect on S. galinae.  Spathius galinae 
does not use ash flowers.  There is no plausible reason to believe that ash 
flower gall would interfere with S. galinae.  
 
11. EPA recommends USDA advise states and communities impacted by 
EAB to replant using a variety of tree species native to the respective 
ecoregion of the country, thereby diversifying urban tree plantings.  
 
APHIS works with State cooperators to detect, control and prevent the 
human-assisted spread of the pest in order to safeguard America’s ash 
trees. Strategies to manage the pest focus on biological control, survey, 
and regulatory activities, combined with public outreach and education 
initiatives to promote program support and compliance. APHIS continues 
work to identify effective tools to manage and control EAB populations.

I.  Purpose and Need for the Proposed 
Action 
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Pest 
Permitting Branch is proposing to issue permits for release of the insect 
parasitoid1 species Spathius galinae (S. galinae) Belokobylskij & Strazanac 
(Hymenoptera: Braconidae).  This organism would be used by the permit 
applicant for biological control of the nonindigenous emerald ash borer 
(EAB) (Agrilus planipennis) in the continental United States.   
 
This environmental assessment2 (EA) has been prepared, consistent with 
USDA, APHIS' National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing 
procedures (Title 7 of the Code of

 control of the nonindigenous emerald ash borer 
(EAB) (Agrilus planipennis) in the continental United States.   
 
This environmental assessment2 (EA) has been prepared, consistent with 
USDA, APHIS' National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing 
procedures (Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 372).  It 
examines the potential effects on the quality of the human environment that 
may be associated with the release of the parasitoid wasp, S. galinae, to 
control EAB within the continental United States.  This EA considers a “no 
action” alternative and the potential effects of the proposed action. 
 
The applicant’s purpose for releasing S. galinae is to reduce infestations of 
EAB in the continental United States. The EAB is an invasive wood-boring 
beetle from Asia threatening North America’s ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  It 
was introduced into the Detroit, Michigan area, probably sometime in the 
1990s, and was identified as the cause of ash mortality in the area in 2002 
(Haack et al., 2002). EAB larvae feed on ash phloem, cutting off the 
movement of resources within the tree and killing the tree in 4-5 years 
(Smith, 2006; Knight, 2013). Unlike other Agrilus species that are attracted 
to and attack mainly stressed trees, EAB is able to attack and kill 
presumably healthy trees in both natural and urban settings.  Today, EAB 
infestations have been detected in 22 states; Colorado, Connecticut, 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan,

infestations have been detected in 22 states; Colorado, Connecticut, 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West 
Virginia, and Wisconsin. EAB appears well suited for climatic conditions 
in North America and destroys entire stands of ash trees. EAB will 
continue to disperse along continuous corridors of ash now present in 
natural and urban environments due to the widespread use of ash as a 
landscape tree. 
1 In this case, small, stingless wasps that during their development, live in the body or egg of a single 
host individual, eventually killing that individual. 
2 Regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42   
United States Code 4321 et seq.) provide that an environmental assessment “[shall include brief 
discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E), of the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons 
consulted.”  40 CFR § 1508.9.

All of the existing EAB management options (discussed below) are 
expensive, temporary, ineffective, and/or include non-target impacts.  For 
these reasons, there is a need to identify and release an effective, host-
specific biological control organism against EAB in the continental United 
States.   
 
II. Alternatives 
  
This section will explain the two alternatives available to APHIS–PPQ: no 
action (no issuance of permits) and issuance of permits for environmental 
release of S. galinae in the continental United States. Although APHIS’ 
alternatives are limited to a decision of whether to issue permits for release 
of S. galinae, other methods are described that are currently used to control 
EAB in the United States. Use of these control methods is not an APHIS 
decision, and their use is likely to continue whether or not APHIS-PPQ 
issued permits for environmental release of S. galinae.   
 
APHIS–PPQ considered a third alternative but will not analyze it further. 
Under this third alternative, APHIS–PPQ would issue permits for the field 
release of S. galinae. The permits, however, would contain special 
provisions or requirements concerning release procedures or mitigating 
measures, such as limited releases of S. galinae in the United States. There 
are no issues raised indicating that special provisions or requirements are 
necessary.

release of S. galinae. The permits, however, would contain special 
provisions or requirements concerning release procedures or mitigating 
measures, such as limited releases of S. galinae in the United States. There 
are no issues raised indicating that special provisions or requirements are 
necessary. 
 
A.  No Action  
 
Under the no action alternative, APHIS–PPQ would not issue permits for 
the field release of S. galinae for the control of EAB — t he release of this 
biological control agent would not occur, and current methods to control 
EAB in the United States will continue. Use of these methods is likely to 
continue even if APHIS–PPQ issues permits for release of S. galinae. 
Presently, control of EAB in the United States is limited to physical, 
chemical, and biological control methods. 
 
1. Physical Control 
 
In a forest environment, rapid detection of EAB presence and destruction 
of affected tree materials is the best method to reduce the chance of other 
ash trees being attacked in the area. Dead and dying ash trees should be cut 
down and chipped, burned, or buried on the site. 
 
 
 
 2 
2. Chemical Control 
 
There are several insecticides that may be applied to ash trees; systemic 
insecticides and protective cover sprays.  Systemic insecticides are applied 
and translocated throughout the tree. Systemic insecticides including 
imidacloprid, emamectin benzoate, and Bidrin® may be applied as soil 
injections or drenches, or may be injected directly into the tree using 
specialized equipment (Herms et al., 2009).  The systemic

  Systemic insecticides are applied

imidacloprid, emamectin benzoate, and Bidrin® may be applied as soil 
injections or drenches, or may be injected directly into the tree using 
specialized equipment (Herms et al., 2009).  The systemic insecticide 
dinotefuran can be applied to the bark; it is absorbed through the bark and 
distributed throughout the tree (Herms et al., 2009). Protective cover sprays 
using permethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, or carbaryl, are applied to the bark 
and foliage to target adult beetles or EAB larvae as they chew through the 
bark (Herms et al., 2009).    
 
3. Biological Control  
 
Three parasitoids were discovered parasitizing EAB in China and were 
approved as biological control agents of EAB in the United States (Liu et 
al., 2003; 2007). These EAB biocontrol agents are:  (1) Oobius agrili, a 
solitary egg parasitoid that has two generations per year (Zhang et al., 
2005; Bauer and Liu, 2007), (2) Tetrastichus planipennisi, a larval 
endoparasitoid that may complete four generations per year and produces 
an average of 57 progeny per EAB larva (Liu et al., 2003; 2007; Yang et 
al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010), and  (3) Spathius agrili, a larval 
ectoparasitoid that has two generations per year and produces an average of 
five progeny per EAB lar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
an average of 57 progeny per EAB larva (Liu et al., 2003; 2007; Yang et 
al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010), and  (3) Spathius agrili, a larval 
ectoparasitoid that has two generations per year and produces an average of 
five progeny per EAB larva (Yang et al., 2010; Gould et al., 2011).   
 
B.  Issue Permits for Environmental Release of  
S. galinae (Preferred Alternative)  
 
Under this alternative, APHIS–PPQ would issue permits upon request and 
after evaluation of each application for the field release of S. galinae for the 
control of EAB in the continental United States. These permits would 
contain no special provisions or requirements concerning release 
procedures or mitigating measures. 
 
1. Spathius galinae Taxonomic Information 
 
Spathius galinae is an ectoparasitoid attacking 2nd to 4th instar EAB larvae. 
Oviposition (egg laying) by S. galinae on the EAB larva paralyzes it and 
stops its development beyond the larval stage.

Insects Introduction Research Unit. 
 
c. Natural geographic range, other areas of introduction, and expected 
attainable range in North America (also habitat preference and 
climatic requirements of S. galinae).  Spathius galinae has been collected 
from Vladivostok and Khaborovsk, Russia and from Daejeon and 
Yangsuri, South Korea (Belokobylskij et al., 2012; Gould and Duan, 2013).  
The insects used to initiate colonies in the United States were all collected 
from EAB populations infesting Fraxinus pennsylvanica trees in the 
Vladivostok area (Duan et al., 2012a).  In contrast, the previously 
introduced agent S. agrili was collected primarily from Tianjin, China, and 
it is rare and difficult to collect in Changchun, China.  Tianjin, 
approximately 1,000 kilometers south of Vladivostok, is the source of the 
S. agrili population released in the United States.  The climatic conditions 
that are most conducive to population growth of S. galinae or S. agrili are 
not explicitly known; therefore, climate matching analyses were conducted 
to determine how similar Vladivostok and Tian

000 kilometers south of Vladivostok, is the source of the 
S. agrili population released in the United States.  The climatic conditions 
that are most conducive to population growth of S. galinae or S. agrili are 
not explicitly known; therefore, climate matching analyses were conducted 
to determine how similar Vladivostok and Tianjin are with the regions of 
the United States that are infested with EAB.   
The climate matching feature of the climate analysis software CLIMEX 
(Hearne Scientific Software Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) was used.  The 
software calculated a Climate Match Index (CMI) that is a measure of the 
degree of similarity between a home location and away locations.  The 
index had values between 0, complete dissimilarity, and 1, exact climate 
match.  Adult Spathius are only present in the summer, so the adult model 
for matching was restricted to June 4 through September 30 and was based 
on minimum temperature, maximum temperature, total precipitation, 
precipitation pattern, and relative humidity.  Because larvae live under 
bark, the larval model for matching was based on minimum temperature, 
maximum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation pattern for an 
entire year. 
Climate matching analyses comparing Vladivostok and Tianjin to the rest 
of Asia indicate that S. agrili and S. galinae come from climatically unique 
regions of Asia. Species adapted to one of these conditions are more likely 
to establish and survive well in parts of North America that match these 
climatic conditions than will other species.  The climate of Tianjin (the 
source area for S. agrili) is best matched with the climate in the center of

regions of Asia. Species adapted to one of these conditions are more likely 
to establish and survive well in parts of North America that match these 
climatic conditions than will other species.  The climate of Tianjin (the 
source area for S. agrili) is best matched with the climate in the center of 
the United States (larval model – green area in Fig. 1) and the southeastern 
 4 
United States (adult model – green area in Fig. 2).  The areas where 
scientists have released and studied establishment of S. agrili to date are in 
the more northern parts of the United States (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois).  At 
these sites, S. agrili does establish, and percentage parasitism after the first 
winter is sometimes high, but after the first year the insects are found in 
very low numbers or not at all.  Climate incompatibility and possible 
asynchrony between parasitoid and host could certainly contribute to the 
observed lack of persistence of S. agrili in the northern United States.  The 
climate matching analysis indicates that S. galinae may be better adapted 
than S. agrili for establishment in the northern United States (green areas in 
Figs. 3 and 4).

e. Life history (including dispersal capability and damage inflicted on 
EAB).  Spathius galinae females search the trunk of ash trees infested with 
EAB, ovipositing on the larvae through the bark.  The EAB is paralyzed 
and the parasitoid eggs are deposited on the outside of the larva.  From 
6−15 larvae feed externally on the EAB larva and spin cocoons inside the 
EAB gallery (Duan et al., 2012a), eventually chewing through the bark and 
emerging as adults.  In the laboratory, a female lays an average of 31 eggs 
during her lifetime, which averages 6.8 weeks.  Spathius galinae can 
complete a generation in 3–4 weeks under normal rearing conditions (25–
27oC, and 16 hours of light:8 hours of dark photoperiod) and diapause is 
not obligatory (it does not enter diapause under long day/warm temperature 
conditions), both of which indicate that this insect completes at least two 
generations per year. Sample percentage parasitism on green ash at two 
sites near Vladivostok, Russia averaged approximately 63 percent (Duan et 
al., 2012a); while at a site near Khabarovsk, EAB were attacked by T. 
planipennisi and S. galinae was not present.  Because S. galinae has at least

planipennisi and S. galinae was not present.  Because S. galinae has at least 
two generations per year, total attack by parasitoids within a single EAB 
 7

capability of S. galinae, they fly strongly and are long lived (10–12 weeks), 
indicating that dispersal capabilities may be high.   
 
f. History of past use of S. galinae.  Spathius galinae has never been used 
as a biological control agent. 
 
g. Pathogens, parasites, hyperparasitoids of S. galinae and how to 
eliminate them from a culture of the agent.  No pathogens, parasitoids, 
or hyperparasitoids have been observed attacking S. galinae, either in 
Russia or Korea or in specimens imported to the United States. Only 
healthy S. galinae are used to establish colonies. If any diseased organisms 
are discovered, they will be sent to insect pathologists for identification, 
and hyperparasitoids will be eliminated from the colony. Insects that are 
subsequently reared in the United States will be maintained in pure culture 
and monitored for disease.

h. Standard Operating Procedures stating how agent will be handled in 
quarantine.  Both the ARS Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit 
and PPQ have well developed quarantine standard operating procedures for 
handling exotic insects including S. galinae. All imported (exotic) insects 
will be first examined and screened in a well-confined sample processing 
room; any contaminants will be excluded during the process. Spathius 
galinae will be reared on EAB larvae feeding in small ash logs according to 
methods described in Duan et al. (2011; 2013b).  Spathius galinae females 
readily parasitize EAB larvae in these logs. Colonies will be maintained in 
bioclimatic chambers set at 25ºC, 65 percent relative humidity, and a day 
length of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark. Under these conditions, S. 
galinae does not enter diapause and colonies can be maintained 
indefinitely. All material is sterilized before being removed from 
quarantine. 
 
III. Affected Environment 
 
A.  North American Agrilus species 
 
The “Nomina insecta Nearctica; a checklist of the insects of North 
America” (Poole, 1997) lists 164 species of Agrilus in North America.  
Most are not considered pests; however, Solomon (1995) considers 24 
Agrilus species to cause injury to trees and shrubs under certain 
circumstances. Most species of Agrilus are unable to colonize healthy trees; 
in fact, EAB is not typically a pest of Fraxinus in its native range. Agrilus 
species typically attack trees that are stressed by factors such as drought,

Agrilus species to cause injury to trees and shrubs under certain 
circumstances. Most species of Agrilus are unable to colonize healthy trees; 
in fact, EAB is not typically a pest of Fraxinus in its native range. Agrilus 
species typically attack trees that are stressed by factors such as drought, 
damage from other insects, or poor silvicultural practices. In some cases 
their actions may be considered beneficial since they remove sick or 
 8 
damaged trees from the forest. Species such as Agrilus anxius Gory (bronze 
birch borer) and Agrilus bilineatus (Weber) (two-lined chestnut borer) are 
often considered major pest species in forest and landscape situations, but 
they are typically acting as secondary pests on already stressed trees or 
trees not native to the United States. Agrilus hyperici (Creutzer) has been 
released as a biological control agent of the weedy St. John’s wort, 
Hypericum perforatum L., in the western United States and is considered to 
be contributing to weed suppression in Idaho (Campbell and McCaffery, 
1991).  However, St. John’s wort is a perennial herb, not a tree, and grows 
in meadows, not in forests. 
 
B.  Ash Resources of North America 
 
The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  
Twenty-two species of ash grow in the United States, of which sixteen are 
native (USDA, NRCS, 2006). Ash species native to North American forests 
and known to be susceptible to EAB include:  white ash (F. americana

The known hosts of EAB in the United States are ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).  
Twenty-two species of ash grow in the United States, of which sixteen are 
native (USDA, NRCS, 2006). Ash species native to North American forests 
and known to be susceptible to EAB include:  white ash (F. americana), 
green ash (F. pennsylvanica), and black ash (F. nigra), which are major 
components of the forest; and blue ash (F. quadrangulata) and pumpkin 
ash (F. profunda), which are less common species.  There is increasing 
evidence that EAB will attack all Fraxinus spp., although susceptibility 
varies by ash species and variety (Liu et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2004; 2007; 
Rebek et al., 2008; Duan et al., 2012a).  
Ash trees are present as ornamentals, street trees, or timber trees in all of 
the lower 48 states except Idaho. It is estimated that there are more than 7.5 
billion ash trees in the United States, and unless climate inhibits population 
growth in the most southern states, all of those trees are at risk of being 
destroyed by EAB. Each Fraxinus species is adapted to slightly different 
habitats within forest ecosystems.  Several species are tolerant of poorly-
drained sites and wet soils, protecting environmentally-sensitive riparian 
areas; pure stands of black ash grow in bogs and swamps in northern areas 
where they provide browse, thermal cover, and protection for wildlife such 
as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash provides vital 
shelter for livestock; for example, about 25 percent of all trees in North

 protecting environmentally-sensitive riparian 
areas; pure stands of black ash grow in bogs and swamps in northern areas 
where they provide browse, thermal cover, and protection for wildlife such 
as deer and moose.  In agricultural and shelterbelt areas, ash provides vital 
shelter for livestock; for example, about 25 percent of all trees in North 
Dakota are Fraxinus spp.  Bark of young ash trees is a favored food of 
mammals including beaver, rabbit, and porcupines; older trees provide 
habitat for cavity-nesting birds such as wood ducks, woodpeckers, 
chickadees, and nuthatches; seeds are consumed by ducks, song and game 
birds, small mammals, and insects. 
Ash timber is valued for applications requiring strong, hardwood, but with 
less rigidity than maple.  In the eastern United States, a net volume of 114 
billion board feet of ash sawtimber is harvested, comprising 7.5 percent of 
the volume of all hardwood species (FR, 2003).  In 2001, ash accounted for 
over 149 million board feet of timber products produced in the United 
 9 
States.  White ash is the primary commercial hardwood used in production 
of tool handles, baseball bats, furniture, flooring, containers, railroad cars 
and ties, canoe paddles, snowshoes, boats, doors, and cabinets; green ash is 
used for both solid wood applications such as crating, boxes, handles, and 
for fiber in the manufacture of high grade paper; black ash is typically used 
for interior furniture, cabinets (FR, 2003), and Northeastern Native 
Americans require ash for the art of basketry.

for interior furniture, cabinets (FR, 2003), and Northeastern Native 
Americans require ash for the art of basketry. 
 
Beyond manufacturing, ash trees play an important role in the urban 
landscape due to their historical resistance to pests and tolerance of adverse 
growing conditions, such as soil compaction and drought.  Many of the ash 
trees that now serve as street, shade, and landscape trees were planted to 
replace elm trees destroyed by Dutch elm disease; ash trees now comprise 
5−20 percent of all street trees throughout North America.  In the United 
States, urban areas cover about 3.5 percent of the total land area, contain 
more than 75 percent of the population, and support about 3.8 billion trees.  
The City of Chicago has approximately 603,000 ash trees that provide 14.4 
percent of leaf area (FR, 2003).  Trees are considered vital to the health of 
cities because they sequester gaseous air pollutants and particulate matter, 
help people conserve energy through the shade they provide, assist in the 
dispersal of storm water, provide shelter belts for urban fauna, and 
contribute aesthetic pleasure to the lives of city-dwellers and tourists.  Ash 
is a vital component of the urban forest.

IV.  Environmental Consequences 
 
A.  No Action Alternative 
 
1.  Impact of EAB  
 
EAB is an invasive wood-boring beetle that is spreading rapidly and poses 
a serious threat to ash trees in the United States if not controlled.  Despite 
state and federal quarantines designed to contain EAB, there is a lack of 
effective methods to detect and control EAB.  Besides natural dispersal, the 
spread of EAB has been accelerated through human-assisted movement of 
infested ash firewood, timber, solid-wood packing materials, and nursery 
stock. As EAB spreads throughout North America, regulatory agencies, 
land managers, and the public are seeking sustainable management tools to 
reduce EAB population densities and to slow its spread (Cappaert et al., 
2005; GAO, 2006; Poland and McCullough, 2006).  Since its discovery, 
EAB has killed tens of millions of ash trees and has cost municipalities, 
property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries tens of 
millions of dollars.  
 
 10 
Trees in the genus Fraxinus are important components of many forested 
ecosystems throughout North America and are planted extensively as urban 
and shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis 
estimates that establishment of EAB throughout the United States could 
result in loss of approximately 2.6 percent of trees in timberlands or 7.5 
billion trees (USDA FS, 2006).  White, blue, and Oregon ash grow on 
fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, Carolina, and pumpkin ash 
are wetland species; and velvet and single-leaf ash

 the United States could 
result in loss of approximately 2.6 percent of trees in timberlands or 7.5 
billion trees (USDA FS, 2006).  White, blue, and Oregon ash grow on 
fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, Carolina, and pumpkin ash 
are wetland species; and velvet and single-leaf ash grow in semi-deserts 
and canyons.  If EAB populations are not managed, ash resources 
throughout North America will be devastated (MacFarlane and Meyer, 
2005).  The loss of ash over large geographical areas will adversely affect 
water, soil, and air, resources.  Ash is an important riparian tree and is often 
found along river banks.  Removing ash from stream banks will affect bank 
soil retention and stream processes.  
 
2. Impact from the Use of Other EAB Control Methods 
 
The continued use of physical, chemical, and biological control at current 
levels would result if the “no action” alternative is chosen, and may 
continue even if permits are issued for environmental release of S. galinae. 
 
a. Physical Control 
 
Although physical control may slow the spread of EAB to other ash trees in 
an area, this method is not effective at controlling the EAB population.  It 
is likely that ash trees in the area will eventually become infested.   
 
b. Chemical Control 
 
Insecticide treatment of ash trees for EAB control is inconsistent in 
effectiveness, especially on larger trees.  Results have been mixed in 
insecticide efficacy studies; in some sites, insecticides are effective but fail 
in other sites (Herms et al., 2009). In addition, insecticide treatment does

b. Chemical Control 
 
Insecticide treatment of ash trees for EAB control is inconsistent in 
effectiveness, especially on larger trees.  Results have been mixed in 
insecticide efficacy studies; in some sites, insecticides are effective but fail 
in other sites (Herms et al., 2009). In addition, insecticide treatment does 
not guarantee that the tree will be protected from EAB attack.  Trees with 
greater than 50 percent canopy loss are unlikely to recover even if treated 
with insecticides (Herms et al., 2009). Foliar and bark treatments can result 
in pesticide drift that affects non-target organisms in the treatment area, and 
trunk injections can cause damage to the injected tree. Insecticide 
treatments can be costly, especially on large trees and must be repeated 
annually to be effective, although emamectin benzoate is effective for two 
years or longer (Herms et al., 2009).   
 
Insecticide treatments are useful to protect certain high value trees but are 
not practical for controlling EAB over a large area or forest situation.  
Besides being costly, there are label restrictions on the amount of 
insecticide that can be applied per acre per year.

c. Biological Control  
 
All three parasitoid species that have been previously released against EAB 
(Oobius agrili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Spathius agrili) have been 
recovered following release in the United States; however, only T. 
planipennisi and O. agrili have been recovered consistently more than one

ili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Spathius agrili) have been 
recovered following release in the United States; however, only T. 
planipennisi and O. agrili have been recovered consistently more than one 
year after release. At two sites in Michigan, parasitism by O. agrili 
increased from 3-4 percent in the year of release to 20–28 percent two 
years later.  Tetrastichis planipennisi, a stronger flier than O. agrili, has 
effectively spread and established.  At six intensively studied sites in 
Michigan, 92 percent of the trees at the release site contained at least one 
brood of T. planipennisi four years after release, and parasitism levels 
increased steadily to an average of over 20 percent (Duan et al., 2013a).  
Parasitism by T. planipennisi at the six control sites (at least 1 kilometer 
away) also increased yearly to an average level of 13 percent.  The story 
was not the same for S. agrili.  At a release site near Hawley, Michigan, 18 
percent of the EAB were parasitized by S. agrili after one year; however, a 
sample of 40 entire trees the following year revealed not a single parasitoid.  
At another site, parasitism one year after release was 45 percent, two 
broods were discovered the following year and two broods were recovered 
in 2011, but parasitism by S. agrili has been very low.  At the six 
intensively sampled study sites, S. agrili was recovered in yellow pan traps,

 percent, two 
broods were discovered the following year and two broods were recovered 
in 2011, but parasitism by S. agrili has been very low.  At the six 
intensively sampled study sites, S. agrili was recovered in yellow pan traps, 
but only two EAB larvae parasitized by this species have been recovered 
after 2–5 years of sampling.  One possible explanation is that S. agrili was 
collected from Tianjin, China, which is near the southern limit of the EAB 
distribution in China, and the climate there is a better match for the central 
rather than the northern United States.  There may be a problem with 
synchrony between the emergence of adult S. agrili and availability of the 
mature EAB larvae that they attack. 
 
Although O. agrili and T. planipennisi are establishing and dispersing, both 
have limitations that affect their ability to successfully control EAB 
populations. Oobius agrili is a very small insect, dispersing much more 
slowly than T. planipennisi. It is also solitary, with only one adult emerging 
from an EAB egg, although it is important because it prevents damage to 
the phloem caused by EAB larvae. Tetrastichus planipennisi is a gregarious 
larval parasitoid, producing an average of 57 adults per EAB larva (Liu et 
al., 2003; 2007; Yang et al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010); however, it is a 
relatively small insect with a short ovipositor (egg-laying organ) and 
cannot parasitize EAB larvae under the thick bark of larger trees (Abell et

 EAB larva (Liu et 
al., 2003; 2007; Yang et al., 2006; Ulyshen et al., 2010); however, it is a 
relatively small insect with a short ovipositor (egg-laying organ) and 
cannot parasitize EAB larvae under the thick bark of larger trees (Abell et 
al., 2012).  Tetrastichus planipennisi cannot oviposit in bark thicker than 
3.2 millimeters (mm), which means it is limited to attacking EAB in the top 
of mature trees or in smaller trees (stems <11.2 centimeters (cm) diameter).  
It is anticipated that T. planipennisi will be most effective in stands of 
small, early successional ash rather than in mature forests.

B.  Biological control alternative (preferred alternative) 
 
1.  Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Proposed 
Release of S. galinae 
 
a. Known impact on vertebrates including humans:   Spathius galinae is 
an obligate parasitoid of wood boring larvae, specifically EAB.  As such, it 
will rarely come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it 
does, it is incapable of stinging or biting.  Braconid wasps have no known 
adverse impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
b. Direct impact of S. galinae (e.g., intended effects on EAB, direct 
effects on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism by S. galinae in Russia can 
reach 63 percent in stands of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) (Duan et 
al., 2012a).

b. Direct impact of S. galinae (e.g., intended effects on EAB, direct 
effects on non-targets).  Percentage parasitism by S. galinae in Russia can 
reach 63 percent in stands of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) (Duan et 
al., 2012a).  Because S. galinae has at least two generations per year 
compared with just one (univoltine) or half (semivoltine) for EAB, 
generational percentage parasitism will be greater than that measured 
during a single collection.  Spathius galinae clearly has the potential to 
cause considerable mortality to EAB populations.  In Asia, it is probable 
that EAB is not typically a pest because of the interaction between host 
plant resistance and natural enemies. While it is clear that American ash 
species are not resistant to EAB per se, they can withstand some attack as 
evidenced by callusing of EAB galleries, and woodpeckers can remove a 
considerable percentage of overwintering larvae.  In Michigan, 32 to 42 
percent of EAB larvae were removed by woodpeckers (Duan et al., 2010; 
2013a) and a 2012 study at sites in Ulster County in New York found that 
woodpeckers removed between 40 and 65 percent of mature EAB larvae 
(Gould and Vandenberg, unpublished). Duan et al. (2010) also found that 
tree defenses in lightly infested young green ash killed 10 to 12 percent of 
EAB larvae. Spathius galinae will not have to cause 100 percent mortality 
of EAB to beneficially affect the health of ash stands, because ash can 
successfully withstand some attack.

EAB larvae. Spathius galinae will not have to cause 100 percent mortality 
of EAB to beneficially affect the health of ash stands, because ash can 
successfully withstand some attack. 
 
To evaluate the effects of S. galinae on non-target insect species, no-choice 
and choice host specificity tests were conducted in the United States to 
determine the physiological host range of S. galinae and possible direct 
effects on non-target species. Between 2011 and 2013, 15 North American 
species of wood-boring insects were exposed to S. galinae by scientists at 
the ARS Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit and PPQ to assess 
the parasitoid’s host range. Spathius galinae finds hosts to parasitize by 
using cues associated with sounds or vibrations produced by feeding borer 
larvae.  Studies have shown that they do not attack prepupae or molting 
larvae that are not feeding (Duan et al., 2013c).  All test larvae, therefore, 
had to be feeding inside their natural hosts during testing.  To accomplish 
this, bark flaps were created in 4-8 cm diameter logs and a 3 cm long 
groove was drilled underneath each flap.  The test larvae were placed in 
 13 
these grooves, and the flaps were reassembled and secured with rubber 
bands.  The logs were placed into plastic jars that contained five one-week 
old S. galinae females and one male.  The parasitoids were fed honey 
streaked on the fabric covering the lid of the jars.  Every time

 larvae were placed in 
 13 
these grooves, and the flaps were reassembled and secured with rubber 
bands.  The logs were placed into plastic jars that contained five one-week 
old S. galinae females and one male.  The parasitoids were fed honey 
streaked on the fabric covering the lid of the jars.  Every time a test was 
initiated with one or more non-target hosts, the same number of EAB 
larvae was tested in ash as a positive control to demonstrate that the wasps 
used in the tests were physiologically ready to attack suitable hosts.  After 
two weeks, the larvae were checked to determine if they were parasitized.  
All parasitized larvae were held for at least 4 weeks to determine if S. 
galinae could develop to the adult stage. For the choice tests, gravid 
females of S. galinae were presented simultaneously to both an ash log 
containing five target host larvae (EAB) and an ash or non-ash log 
containing five non-target host larvae in a test arena (ventilated-clear 
polystyrene crisper boxes,each 17.6 × 12.6 × 10 cm, Tri-State Plastics, 
Latonia, KY). After a period of 2-weeks of exposure, the logs were 
incubated in normal rearing conditions for two weeks and scored for 
parasitism by S. galinae as previously described for the no-choice test.      
The larvae of fifteen wood-boring insects were tested to assess the host 
specificity of S. galinae (Table 1).  Emphasis was placed on species closely 
related to the target pest or those feeding on ash.  Thirteen species were

. galinae as previously described for the no-choice test.      
The larvae of fifteen wood-boring insects were tested to assess the host 
specificity of S. galinae (Table 1).  Emphasis was placed on species closely 
related to the target pest or those feeding on ash.  Thirteen species were 
wood-boring beetles; one clearwing moth (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) and one 
sawfly (Hymenoptera: Cephidae) were also tested.  Of the beetles, five 
were in the genus Agrilus, and were thus closely related to the EAB, and 
another was in the same family (Buprestidae).  Three of the tested insects, 
the longhorned beetle Neoclytus acuminatus; the clearwinged moth 
Podosesia spp.; and the eastern ash bark beetle, Hylesinus fraxini attack ash 
as their main host and would be susceptible to parasitism if S. galinae 
accepts any boring insects infesting ash.   
Spathius galinae only attacked one species other than the EAB, and that 
was the gold spotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus in red oak.  The rate 
of parasitism was, however, considerably less (41 percent) on the non-
target host than on the EAB (71 percent) under test conditions that strongly 
favored parasitism. Spathius galinae did not attack any of the other three 
species infesting red oak, nor did they attack any of the other Agrilus or any 
of the three non-Agrilus species infesting ash.

2.  Effects on the Physical Environment and Indirect Effects of 
the Release of S. galinae 
 
a. Effects on physical environment (e.g. water, soil and air resources):  
Trees in the genus Fraxinus are important components of many forested 
ecosystems throughout North America and are planted extensively as 
urban and shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and 
Analysis estimates that establishment of EAB throughout the United 
States could result in loss of approximately 2.6 percent of trees in U.S. 
timberlands or 7.5 billion trees (USDA, FS, 2006).  White, blue, and 
Oregon ash grow on fertile uplands and river terr

 shelterbelt trees.  USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and 
Analysis estimates that establishment of EAB throughout the United 
States could result in loss of approximately 2.6 percent of trees in U.S. 
timberlands or 7.5 billion trees (USDA, FS, 2006).  White, blue, and 
Oregon ash grow on fertile uplands and river terraces; green, black, 
Carolina, and pumpkin ash are wetland species; and velvet and single-leaf 
ash grow in semi-deserts and canyons.  If EAB populations are not 
managed, ash resources throughout North America could be devastated 
(MacFarlane and Meyer, 2005).  The loss of ash over large geographical 
areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air, resources.  Ash is an 
important riparian tree and is often found along river banks.  Removing 
ash from stream banks will affect bank soil retention and stream processes. 
The successful deployment of EAB biocontrol agents such as S. galinae 
will have a positive impact on the physical environment by moderating 
EAB population increase, thus limiting tree damage.  Conservation of ash 
trees in North American timberlands and urban forests will result in less 
flooding and soil erosion and moderate changes in air quality. 
 
b. Indirect effects (e.g. potential impacts on organisms that depend on 
EAB or non-target species including potential competition with 
resident biological control agents).  Successful management of EAB 
using biological control agents, including S. galinae, will result in 
positive, indirect effects on U.S. municipalities, land owners, wood 
industries, Native American basketry, air quality, forest biodiversity, 
wildlife, riparian areas, wildlife,

 species including potential competition with 
resident biological control agents).  Successful management of EAB 
using biological control agents, including S. galinae, will result in 
positive, indirect effects on U.S. municipalities, land owners, wood 
industries, Native American basketry, air quality, forest biodiversity, 
wildlife, riparian areas, wildlife, and organisms dependent on Fraxinus 
spp. (e.g., the cerambycid: red-headed ash borer, Neoclytus acuminatus; 
the sphingid: great ash sphinx, Sphinx chersis). Organisms most directly 
affected by EAB-associated ash demise will be those directly dependent 
on ash trees, such as ash-specialist plant-feeding arthropods (Gandhi and 
Herms, 2010), including several Lepidoptera (butterflies, moths, and 
skippers) species identified at high risk of endangerment (Wagner, 2007). 
Fraxinus pennsylvanica provides food and nesting for songbirds and food 
and shelter for mammals (USDA, NRCS, 2003). Fraxinus nigra seeds are 
consumed by game birds, songbirds and small mammals and used as 
browse by white-tailed deer and moose (Wright et al., 1990). Beavers also 
use ash as a food resource (Henry and Bookhout, 1970).    
 
The indirect effects on a few biological control projects that utilize Agrilus 
species to control weeds must be considered. Agrilus hyperici was 
released against Klamath weed (St. John’s wort) in the western United 
 17 
States and has shown mixed results.  In northern Idaho it is beneficial in

The indirect effects on a few biological control projects that utilize Agrilus 
species to control weeds must be considered. Agrilus hyperici was 
released against Klamath weed (St. John’s wort) in the western United 
 17 
States and has shown mixed results.  In northern Idaho it is beneficial in 
assisting two Klamath weed beetles, Chrysolina sp., in controlling the 
target weed (Campbell and McCaffery, 1991), but in California it has been 
displaced by Chrysolina quadrigemina (McCaffrey et al., 1995). Agrilus 
hyperici is a root feeder acting on a rangeland weed and it is not likely to 
come in contact with populations of S. galinae. Another exotic buprestid, 
Sphenoptera jugoslavica, also a root feeder, was released against spotted, 
diffuse, and squarrose knapweeds. Spathius galinae attacks larvae in 
branches and trunks in forest ecosystems. It is unlikely that S. galinae will 
be attracted to rangeland habitats or to attack larvae in the roots of 
herbaceous plants. Spathius galinae is not known to search for hosts 
underground and is not likely to attack A. hyperici or S. jugoslavica. 
 
3.  Uncertainties Regarding the Environmental Release of S. 
galinae. 
 
Once a biological control agent such as S. galinae is released into the 
environment and becomes established, there is a slight possibility that it 
could move from the target insect (EAB) to attack nontarget insects, such 
as native Agrilus species. Based on host specificity testing conducted, S.

 of S. 
galinae. 
 
Once a biological control agent such as S. galinae is released into the 
environment and becomes established, there is a slight possibility that it 
could move from the target insect (EAB) to attack nontarget insects, such 
as native Agrilus species. Based on host specificity testing conducted, S. 
galinae only attacked one species other than the EAB, and that was the 
gold spotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus, in red oak.  The rate of 
parasitism was considerably less (41 percent) on the non-target host than 
on EAB (71 percent) under test conditions that strongly favored 
parasitism. Native species that are closely related to the target species are 
the most likely to be attacked (Louda et al., 2003). If other insect species 
were to be attacked by S. galinae, the resulting effects could be 
environmental impacts that may not be easily reversed. Biological control 
agents such as S. galinae generally spread without intervention by man. In 
principle, therefore, release of these parasitoids at even one site should be 
considered equivalent to release over the entire area in which potential 
hosts occur and in which the climate is suitable for reproduction and 
survival. Post-release evaluations of S. galinae populations and their 
effects on EAB and other non-target species will be conducted by the 
permittee. 
 
In addition, these agents may not be successful in reducing EAB 
populations in the continental United States. Approximately 12 percent of 
all parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control
Text Len: 1657
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 other non-target species will be conducted by the 
permittee. 
 
In addition, these agents may not be successful in reducing EAB 
populations in the continental United States. Approximately 12 percent of 
all parasitoid introductions have led to significant sustained control of the 
target pests, but the majority of introductions have failed to provide 
control of the pest (Greathead and Greathead, 1992) either because 
introduction did not lead to establishment or establishment did not lead to 
control (Lane et al., 1999). Actual impacts on EAB populations by S. 
galinae will not be known until after release occurs and post-release 
monitoring has been conducted.  For instance, although Oobius agrili and 
 18 
Tetrastichus planipennisi are establishing and dispersing, both have 
limitations that affect their ability to successfully control EAB populations 
that were not known until after their release. Parasitism of EAB by 
Spathius agrili has also been much lower than expected.  
The environmental consequences discussed under the “no action” 
alternative may occur even with the implementation of the biological 
control alternative, depending on the efficacy of S. galinae, in 
combination with the other organisms released for biological control of 
EAB, to reduce EAB populations in the continental United States. 
 
4.  Cumulative Impacts 
 
“Cumulative impacts are defined as the impact on the environment which 
results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, 
present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agencies or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).   
 
APHIS has put quarantines

“Cumulative impacts are defined as the impact on the environment which 
results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, 
present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agencies or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).   
 
APHIS has put quarantines in place to prevent the movement of EAB out 
of EAB-infested areas of the United States (7 CFR Subpart 301.53).  This 
area may expand as new infestations are discovered.  Quarantines are put 
in place to prevent the artificial spread of EAB through movement of 
infested firewood or other infested wood materials.  In addition, APHIS, in 
cooperation with the appropriate State Departments of Agriculture, 
conducts survey program to determine new areas of EAB infestation.  
These methods do not control EAB but slow the spread or provide 
infestation information to state departments of agriculture for 
implementation of quarantines.   
 
Homeowners apply insecticides or hire arborists and tree care 
professionals to make applications to protect high-value ash trees in the 
landscape.  Landowners may conduct a salvage harvest should EAB be 
detected in their ash trees. Insecticide applications and tree removals 
provide a temporary local reduction of EAB but do not result in long term 
control. 
 
Because little can be done to control EAB, research is being conducted at 
universities and by Federal agencies to understand the beetle's life cycle 
and find ways to detect new infestations, control EAB adults and larvae, 
and contain the infestation.

Because little can be done to control EAB, research is being conducted at 
universities and by Federal agencies to understand the beetle's life cycle 
and find ways to detect new infestations, control EAB adults and larvae, 
and contain the infestation.    
  
Release of S. galinae will have no negative cumulative impacts in the 
continental United States because of its host specificity to EAB, other than 
potential impacts on non-target Agrilus species such as the gold spotted 
oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus.  However, based on host-specificity 
testing conducted, impacts to non-target Agrilus spp. are expected to be 
 19 
minimal because S. galinae clearly preferred EAB.  Effective biological 
control of EAB will have beneficial effects to current EAB management 
activities, and may result in protection of ash resources and reduction in 
removals of infested trees. 
 
5.  Endangered Species Act 
 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ESA’s implementing 
regulations require Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of federally listed threatened 
or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification 
of critical habitat.   
 
Only one wood boring insect is listed as threatened under the ESA, the 
valley elderberry longhorned beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) 
and none are listed as endangered.  The valley elderberry longhorned 
beetle mines the interior wood of the host plant, which must be at least 2.5 
cm in diameter (P

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 insect is listed as threatened under the ESA, the 
valley elderberry longhorned beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) 
and none are listed as endangered.  The valley elderberry longhorned 
beetle mines the interior wood of the host plant, which must be at least 2.5 
cm in diameter (Paine et al., 2004), where it would not be accessible to the 
relatively short ovipositor of S. galinae.  In addition, the valley elderberry 
longhorned borer is not closely related to EAB, and elderberry is not 
closely related to ash. Therefore, release of S. galinae will have no effect 
on the valley elderberry longhorned beetle or its designated critical 
habitat. Spathius galinae must attack its hosts, even EAB, as they are 
feeding beneath the bark of trees; therefore S. galinae will have no effect 
on any other threatened or endangered insects (or their critical habitat), 
which are all external feeders.   
 
V.  Other Issues 
 
Consistent with Executive Order (EO) 12898, “Federal Actions to Address 
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income 
Populations,” APHIS considered the potential for disproportionately high 
and adverse human health or environmental effects on any minority 
populations and low-income populations.  No environmental or human 
health effects from the proposed action are expected and there will be no 
disproportionate adverse effects to any minority or low-income 
populations.

Consistent with EO 13045, “Protection of Children From Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks,” APHIS considered the potential for 
disproportionately high and adverse environmental health and safety risks 
to children.  No circumstances that would trigger the need for special 
environmental reviews are involved in implementing the preferred 
alternative.  Therefore, it is expected that no disproportionate effects on 
children are anticipated as a consequence of implementing the preferred 
 20 
alternative. 
 
EO 13175, “Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments”, was issued to ensure that there would be “meaningful 
consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of 
Federal policies that have tribal implications….” Consistent with EO 
13175, in April and May, 2014, APHIS sent letters of notification and 
requests for comment and consultation on this proposed action to tribes in 
32 states, reflecting the very wide national distribution of ash (Fraxinus 
spp.) in the lower 48 states.  APHIS received responses from the Quartz 
Valley Indian Reservation (California), the Sokaogon Chippewa 
Community (Wisconsin), and the Houlton Band of Maliseets (Maine). In 
June, 2014, APHIS conducted a phone conversation with the Seneca 
Nation (New York) who expressed support at the end of the call.  Contacts 
were made informally with other tribes in New York, followed by calls in 
July and August 1

Community (Wisconsin), and the Houlton Band of Maliseets (Maine). In 
June, 2014, APHIS conducted a phone conversation with the Seneca 
Nation (New York) who expressed support at the end of the call.  Contacts 
were made informally with other tribes in New York, followed by calls in 
July and August 1, 2014.  On August 1, APHIS officials participated in 
informal consultation, via telephone, with representatives from the Saint 
Regis Mohawk Tribe and the Shinnecock Nation, both in New York. The 
Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe supported the action, while the Shinnecock 
Nation wished to further examine the documents.  The Shinnecock Nation 
subsequently indicated they had no further questions.  Some of these tribes 
have expressed interest in participating in S. galinae releases and 
monitoring activities.  APHIS will continue to consult and collaborate 
with Indian tribal officials to ensure that they are well-informed and 
represented in policy and program decisions that may impact their 
agricultural interests, in accordance with EO 13175.

Appendix 1. Response to comments. 
 
The draft EA was made available to the public in the Federal Register 
(docket APHIS-2014-0094) from February 12, 2015 to March 16, 2015.  
Ten comments were received on the draft EA.  Five were in support of the 
proposed release of S. galinae.  One comment was unrelated to the 
proposed release and was a general complaint against APHIS’ Wildlife 
Services.   
 
Four commenters had questions or concerns about the release.  These 
comments are addressed below. 
 
1. Three commenters were concerned about non-target impacts of S. 
galinae.  What is the effect of parasitism on the gold spotted oak borer? If 
the gold spotted oak borer experiences a decrease in population numbers, 
could this result in an 'outbreak' in population numbers of other species to 
fill the void in the food web or might species that predate on the gold 
spotted oak borer experience a decline if the gold spotted oak borer is not 
available to its native predator(s)? Will the effects on gold spotted oak 
borer, and its natural predator(s), be monitored by APHIS or another 
agency or academic institution?  
 
No biological control agent has ever completely eliminated its host.  
Therefore, it is expected that the emerald ash borer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 oak borer is not 
available to its native predator(s)? Will the effects on gold spotted oak 
borer, and its natural predator(s), be monitored by APHIS or another 
agency or academic institution?  
 
No biological control agent has ever completely eliminated its host.  
Therefore, it is expected that the emerald ash borer will always be 
available for S. galinae.  As discussed on pages 14 and 18 of this EA, 
based on host specificity testing conducted, S. galinae only attacked one 
species other than the emerald ash borer, and that was the gold spotted oak 
borer, Agrilus auroguttatus, in red oak.  Parasitism attack rates on A. 
auroguttatus were approximately half the levels seen for A. planipennis.  
It is possible that S. galinae will occasionally attack a few non-target 
Agrilus species, but host specificity testing predicts minimal impact. Even 
under no choice test conditions, S. galinae rejected four other Agrilus 
species, and these are the species they are more likely to encounter in the 
eastern United States where the majority of the ash resource occurs.  In 
host specificity testing, S. galinae was even more host specific than the 
previous biological control organisms released for emerald ash borer 
control.   
 
Researchers intend to monitor the impacts of S. galinae on non-target 
species.  They have been collecting data on impacts of previously 
introduced emerald ash borer parasitoids on ash phloem feeding insects 
(clear wing moths and redheaded ash borer) and Agrilus species (A. anxius 
and A. bilineatus) in
Text Len: 1552
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 monitor the impacts of S. galinae on non-target 
species.  They have been collecting data on impacts of previously 
introduced emerald ash borer parasitoids on ash phloem feeding insects 
(clear wing moths and redheaded ash borer) and Agrilus species (A. anxius 
and A. bilineatus) in both Michigan and Maryland, and have observed 
limited parasitism of these non-target insects by previously introduced 
parasitoids (one bronze birch borer was parasitized by Spathius agrili; this 
was not unexpected based on the host-specificity testing that was 
 28 
conducted for that agent). The researchers plan to do the same with S. 
galinae when it is released. 
 
The possibility of risk of the potential S. galinae introduction to some non-
target Agrilus species in North America needs to be balanced against the 
potential benefit that could result from successful biological control of the 
emerald ash borer. Emerald ash borer has now spread to 25 U.S. states and 
two Canadian provinces and killed tens of millions of North American ash 
trees along with the spread.  It has been estimated that eight billion ash 
trees in U.S. forests and woodlands are vulnerable to the emerald ash 
borer.  Uncontrolled spread of emerald ash borer in the United States will 
have adverse impacts on many non-target species and there are no 
methods available to control it at this time. The loss of ash over large 
geographical areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air resources.     
 
2. One commenter questioned the sting/venom/allergic potential of S. 
galinae.

geographical areas will adversely affect water, soil, and air resources.     
 
2. One commenter questioned the sting/venom/allergic potential of S. 
galinae. 
  
As stated on page 13 of this EA, S. galinae is an obligate parasitoid of 
wood boring larvae, specifically emerald ash borer.  As such, it will rarely 
come into contact with humans or other vertebrates, and if it does, it is 
incapable of stinging or biting.  Braconid wasps have no known adverse 
impacts on humans or other vertebrates. 
 
3. One commenter asked whether S. galinae requires a very warm climate. 
 
As described on pages 4 to 7 of this EA, S. galinae does not require a very 
warm climate. 
 
4. One commenter asked what the sensitivities are to various insecticides 
present in the emerald ash borer infested region.  
 
Although it was unclear as to what insecticide sensitivity the commenter 
was referring to, it was interpreted as human sensitivity.  As described on 
page 3 of this EA, several systemic and protective cover insecticides are 
used against emerald ash borers. A portion of the human population is 
sensitive to insecticides, although the percentage of sensitivities to the 
insecticides used against emerald ash borer in the infested area of the 
United States is not known.  Regardless of whether the commenter was 
referring to human sensitivity to insecticides or the sensitivity of other 
organisms to insecticides, the release

 portion of the human population is 
sensitive to insecticides, although the percentage of sensitivities to the 
insecticides used against emerald ash borer in the infested area of the 
United States is not known.  Regardless of whether the commenter was 
referring to human sensitivity to insecticides or the sensitivity of other 
organisms to insecticides, the release of S. galinae is expected to reduce 
the need for the use of insecticides against the emerald ash borer, thus 
having a beneficial effect to any organisms with insecticide sensitivity.    
 
5. Was the use of native woodpeckers considered as a control method in 
combination with other options? A third alternative, which evaluates a

multi-factorial approach combining control methods, such as native 
woodpeckers, along with selective chemical control, would help illustrate 
why the preferred method was selected. This discussion should include 
relative costs and risks in greater detail than is currently provided.  
 
The use of woodpeckers as a control method is beyond the scope of this 
EA, and does not meet the purpose and need for the proposed action, 
although woodpeckers are a significant source of mortality of emerald ash 
borer (Cappaert et al., 2005).  The proposed action is the permitting of S. 
galinae, not a general control program for the emerald ash borer. Although 
other methods of control are discussed in the EA for informational 
purposes, these are beyond the purview of the APHIS-PPB Permit Unit.  
The Plant Protection Act of 2000 provides the PPB Permit Unit with the

other methods of control are discussed in the EA for informational 
purposes, these are beyond the purview of the APHIS-PPB Permit Unit.  
The Plant Protection Act of 2000 provides the PPB Permit Unit with the 
authority to issue permits for release of biological control agents as 
requested by permit applicants.  The preferred alternative was selected 
because of the host specificity of S. galinae and its potential as a stand-
alone method for control of emerald ash borer, regardless of any other 
methods of control that are being used.  The only decision available to the 
PPB Permit Unit is whether or not to issue the permit to release S. galinae.   
 
The alternatives could be potentially infinite if the PPB Permit Unit 
analyzed all of the possible emerald ash borer control tools and their 
combinations.  If the PPB Permit Unit were analyzing a proposed control 
program for the emerald ash borer, these alternatives (or a selected suite of 
them) would be appropriate, but not for the decision to issue a permit for 
the environmental release of a biological control organism.  
 
6. What is the plan of control in the event that S. galinae moves from the 
target (emerald ash borer) to other non-target Agrilus species? If 
establishment occurs, but does not lead to control, what species will S. 
galinae be preying upon, what are the potential negative impacts of those 
relationships, and how will the S. galinae population be controlled? 
What are the costs associated with that control?

 what species will S. 
galinae be preying upon, what are the potential negative impacts of those 
relationships, and how will the S. galinae population be controlled? 
What are the costs associated with that control?  
  
As stated in the response to comment 1, S. galinae is expected to only 
occasionally attack some non-target Agrilus species. Even under no choice 
test conditions, S. galinae rejected four Agrilus species, and these are 
species that S. galinae is likely to encounter in the eastern United States 
where the majority of the ash resource occurs. In host specificity testing, 
S. galinae was even more host specific than the previous biological control 
organisms released for emerald ash borer control. Emerald ash borers are 
abundant in the environment, while native Agrilus species are less 
abundant and difficult for S. galinae to locate.  If S. galinae establishes but 
does not control the emerald ash borer, it would still continue to parasitize 
it as its preferred host.  There would be no negative impacts expected from 
this other than the emerald ash borer would continue to spread unabated.

However, if extensive non-target effects are observed, APHIS would not 
issue any more permits for releases or interstate movement of S. galinae, 
although the organism would continue to spread naturally if it became 
established.  There would not likely be a control program implemented 
against S. galinae even if extensive non-target impacts were observed.

although the organism would continue to spread naturally if it became 
established.  There would not likely be a control program implemented 
against S. galinae even if extensive non-target impacts were observed.   
 
7. Specific details concerning costs of other control measures would be 
helpful to evaluate various control options and how they could possibly be 
used in combination with other methods.  Additionally, a discussion of 
potential costs associated with the unbridled increase of S. galinae should 
be discussed.  
 
The cost of other control measures for emerald ash borer is beyond the 
scope of this EA.  However, APHIS alone has spent $300 million to 
combat the emerald ash borer since 2002 when it was first detected here. 
This does not include spending by other Federal agencies or the costs to 
states, towns, or homeowners for emerald ash borer control, tree removal, 
and replanting.  Kovacs et al. (2010) used simulations of emerald ash 
borer spread and infestation for 2009-2019 to estimate the cost of ash 
treatment, removal, and replacement on developed land in a 25-state study 
area.  They estimated that 38 million ash trees occur on this land base and 
predict that it would require treatment, removal, and replacement of more 
than 17 million ash trees with a mean discounted cost of $10.7 billion 
(Kovacs et al., 2010).  In contrast, to collect, test, and rear S. galinae, the 
cost to the permit applicant was approximately $500,000.  If S. galinae 
establishes and spreads, it becomes self-perpetuating and there is no 
additional cost besides monitoring costs.

8. EPA recommends adding any correspondence between APHIS and U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regarding this issue as an appendix to 
the EA.  In particular, we recommend that APHIS obtain and document 
concurrence from USFWS on APHIS’ preliminary determination of no 
effect on the valley elderberry longhorned beetle.   
 
APHIS made a no effect determination for the valley elderberry 
longhorned beetle, and justified that determination based on the 
unrelatedness of the longhorned beetle to the emerald ash borer and the 
inability of S. galinae to oviposit in valley elderberry longhorned beetle 
larvae because the ovipositor is too short. Therefore, APHIS is not 
required to consult with or receive concurrence from the USFWS.   
 
9.  EPA recommends USDA analyze the potential for the anticipated loss 
of ash trees, 2.6 percent as estimated by the U.S. Forest Service, to 
contribute to climate change. Alternatively, analysis of the average 
anticipated loss of ash at a more localized geographical level may be more 
 31 
informative. 
 
It has been estimated that eight billion ash trees in U.S. forests and 
woodlands are vulnerable to the emerald ash borer.  Although the impact

It has been estimated that eight billion ash trees in U.S. forests and 
woodlands are vulnerable to the emerald ash borer.  Although the impact 
of the loss of ash trees on climate change is an important issue, it is 
beyond the scope of this EA.  However, the release and establishment of S. 
galinae is expected to reduce the loss of ash trees and thus, will help to 
reduce the effects of tree loss on climate change.   
 
10. EPA recommends APHIS discuss whether the ash flower gall could 
interfere with the efficacy of S. galinae. 
 
The ash flower gall would have no effect on S. galinae.  Spathius galinae 
does not use ash flowers.  There is no plausible reason to believe that ash 
flower gall would interfere with S. galinae.  
 
11. EPA recommends USDA advise states and communities impacted by 
EAB to replant using a variety of tree species native to the respective 
ecoregion of the country, thereby diversifying urban tree plantings.  
 
APHIS works with State cooperators to detect, control and prevent the 
human-assisted spread of the pest in order to safeguard America’s ash 
trees. Strategies to manage the pest focus on biological control, survey, 
and regulatory activities, combined with public outreach and education 
initiatives to promote program support and compliance. APHIS continues 
work to identify effective tools to manage and control EAB populations.
