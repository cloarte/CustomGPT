Polypodium cambricumL. - Southern Polypody  -Polypodiaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)The rarest member of thePolypodium vulgaregroup. It has the narrowest requirements of any of the three species of this group, being restricted to base-rich rock outcrops. It is therefore most abundant on the limestones of Cos Antrim and Fermanagh. The leaf has a characteristic broad-triangular shape, broader than any other species. The most reliable identification features are only visible under the microscope. The species is a diplod which means it has two sets of chromosomes, 74 altogether (the other species in thePolypodium vulgarecomplex have four or six sets of chromosomes).All names:Polypodium cambricumL.;Polypodium australeFee;Polypodium vulgare ssp. serrulatumF.Schultz ex Arcang.;Polypodium vulgareauct.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
