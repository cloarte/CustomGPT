Siberian wheatgrass
Gramineae, Poaceae
Agropyron sibiricum
(Willd.) Beauv.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a drought-resistant bunchgrass introduced from Russia in 1934.It is generally similar to crested wheatgrass but appears to do better thancrested on poor sites or under other adverse conditions. For this reason itis replacing crested in some areas. The stems are finer and heads more narrow than in crested. Nutritive value and palatability are similar to those of crested.
