Several species of
Boronia
(Rutaceae) are endemic to the southwest ofWestern Australia.  They grow in wet or seasonally wet low-lying areas and areusually associated with jarrah (
Eucalyptus marginata
Sm.) forests,paperbark (
Melaleuca parviflora
Lindl.) flats, and creeks.  Two speciesare commercially exploited;
B. megastigma
Nees. (brown boronia) for itsessential oils and
B. heterophylla
F. Muell. (red boronia, kalgan) forcut flowering stems (Plummer 1995).  In the past total production was fromplant material harvested from natural stands.  With increasing demand and theneed to improve quality these industries have shifted to harvesting cultivatedplants.

B. megastigma
plants bear a profusion of strongly scented bell-likeflowers (
Fig. 1
).  Petals are yellow on the inside, while outer petal colorvaries from yellow (cv Lutea) through red to dark brown.  Outer petal color maybe solid or in vertical red (cv Harlequin) or brown stripes (Plummer 1995).Essential oils are extracted from the flowers with hexane to yield about0.4%-0.8% concrete.  Concrete is washed with alcohol or distilled to yield 60%boronia absolute (Guenther 1949; Penfold and Willis 1954).  Boronia absolute isvalued at between US$4,000 to $10,000/kg, depending on quality and purity.  Itcan be used in perfumes, cosmetics, and as a food flavoring where it enhancesmost fruit essences (Davies and Menary 1984; Weyerstahl et al. 1994).  Thereare over 150 compounds in boronia concrete.  ß-Ionone is by far the mostimportant, but other compounds such as dodecyl acetate enhance the perfume.The monoterpene hydrocarbons,
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonenedetract from the aroma.  Three cultivated genotypes have been shown to have ahigh degree of variability in their essential oil components (Davies and Menary1984) but the diversity within the species has not been examined.

B. heterophylla
is an upright shrub which produces aspectacular display of vibrant pink bell-shaped flowers each about 1 cm long inearly spring.  Cultivated plants can yield 8-12 stems 12-15 months fromplanting, 20-30 stems in the third year, and 30-60 stems in the fourth yearwith a commercial life of 5-6 years.  Stems are usually 60 cm long and arepicked with >50% of the flowers open (Plummer 1995).  Although demandcurrently exceeds supply, the limited flowering season (1-2 weeks) and lack offlower color options are obstacles to future expansion.
Demand for both boronia absolute from
B. megastigma
and cut floweringstems of
B. heterophylla
is increasing.  The export market potential issubstantial and is likely to continue its rapid growth.  Exports from WesternAustralia alone are expected to increase by 20% per annum.  Boronia exportsfrom Western Australia were valued at US$46,000 FOB (freight on board) in1992/93 while the total value of boronia exports from Australia was US$180,000FOB in the same year (Anon. 1994).  Current wholesale prices for
B.heterophylla
range from US$2.00 to $3.50 per bunch, depending on supply.Wholesale prices for

Commercial production of both species is dependent on a few cultivars andselection of superior genotypes would be beneficial.  The aim of this study wasto investigate variation in the content of essential oil components of
B.megastigma
within and between populations, and over different seasons, andto extend the color range and production period of
B. heterophylla
.
METHODOLOGY
Boronia megastigma
For plant sampling in Aug. to Sept. 1993
B. megastigma
flowers werecollected from plants in 13 natural populations and from a yellow floweringselection
growing in cultivation.  In Aug. to Sept. 1994 flowers werecollected from 16 natural populations.  Flowers from 25 randomly selectedplants were collected from the majority of populations, but where numbers offlowering plants were limited, fewer plants were sampled (n = 24 for theWalpole-2 and Palgarup-1 populations; n = 20 for the Yallingup population; n =22 for the Barlee population).
Details of flower color, plant age, and plant vigor were collected for allplants.  Plant age was determined using the number of years since the last fireor major soil disturbance as an approximate age.  Seedlings were determined asless than 1 year old, young plants 1-2 years, mature plants 2 to 6 years andold plants greater than 6 years.  Plant vigor was determined by the density ofleaves and flowers on each plant.  Weak plants had

 age was determined using the number of years since the last fireor major soil disturbance as an approximate age.  Seedlings were determined asless than 1 year old, young plants 1-2 years, mature plants 2 to 6 years andold plants greater than 6 years.  Plant vigor was determined by the density ofleaves and flowers on each plant.  Weak plants had few flowers and littlefoliage, average plants had moderate amounts of foliage and flowers, andvigorous plants had abundant flowers and lush green foliage.  Oil componentcontents within each category were compared using analysis of variance andmeans were separated using Fisher's PLSD.  The amount of shading by surroundingvegetation was determined for 273 of the plants sampled in 1993 using a Model-Aforest densiometer (Lemmon 1957).
Seven to 10 plants from 12 natural populations initially sampled in 1993 werere-sampled in 1994 in order to investigate the quantity of oil componentsproduced by individual plants over successive years.  Comparisons were madeusing paired 2-tailed t-test.
For oil analysis 12 flowers collected from each plant were extracted withabsolute ethanol (10 ml).  Collection vials were weighed before and afterflower collection and the difference used to determine flower fresh weight.Flowers were extracted for at least 24 h before oil analysis.  An aliquot (4ml) of the extract was analysed without further purification or concentrationusing a gas liquid chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890A) fitted with dualcolumns (50 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter BPX70 from SGE Internationaland 50 m length, 0.2 mm internal diameter ULTRA1 from Hewlett Packard)connected to a single injection port and twin ionization detectors.  Theinjector and detector temperatures were set at 275°C

Theinjector and detector temperatures were set at 275°C.  An initial oventemperature of 60°C was held for 5 minutes and then increased at a rate of8°C min

to a final temperature of 260°C which was held for10 min.  Ethyl un-decanoate (1 µg ml

fresh weight of flowers) of
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, limonene,
a

Principal components analyses were performed on the oil data.  The firstanalysis used the oil data from all individuals sampled to plot the orthogonalfactor scores and determine the relationship between the different oilcomponents.  The second analysis used the mean data for each oil component fromeach population to determine the relationship between different populations interms of the 5 oil components.

New populations of

were sought in 1994.  Plants weretagged and their flowering period, flower density, flower color, and plantvigor were determined.  Cutting material was taken from plants to assess theirease of propagation and subsequent growth and flowering in cultivation.
RESULTS
Boronia megastigma
The 29
B. megastigma
populations identified cover most of the remainingnatural range of the species however, much of this region is now agriculturalland (
Fig. 2
).  Flowers from all plants contained ß-ionone.
a
-Ionone was either absent or present in undetectable amounts and wastherefore excluded from further analysis.  ß-Pinene was absent from halfof the plants,
a
-pinene from about a quarter of plants and limonene anddodecyl acetate were absent from only a few plants.  Oil contents were used torank each oil component (
Table 1
).  Ranking was determined by a fixedpercentage of plants whose oil component quantity fell within the stated range.The extremely high ß-ionone producers (those in the top 5%) contained803 to 1787 µg g
-1
of ß-ionone.  ß-Ionone was themajor essential oil component, followed by dodecyl acetate.
a
-Pineneand limonene were often present in similar quantities, and ß-pinene wasusually the least abundant of the oil components examined.

The mean quantity of oil components varied considerably between populations.
a
-pinene, ß-pinene and limonene were commonly absent fromindividual plants, but each of these compounds was present in at least oneplant in each population.  Location had some influence on the content of themonoterpene hydrocarbons.  Southeastern populations had quite highconcentrations of
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene, whilenorthern populations all had low concentrations.  Location was not always agood indicator of the content of oil components.  In the Jarrahwood area,Jarrahwood-3 produced more than twice the amount of
a
-pinene andß-pinene as Jarrahwood-2 and Jarrahwood-4, even though the threepopulations are only a short distance apart.  Location did not influenceß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  The highest mean ß-ionone contentfor a population was 736 µg g
-1
at Albany-1 and the lowest was 227µg g
-1
at Porongurup-1.
The quantity of oil components from plants within populations variedconsiderably.  The Walpole-1 population sampled in 1993 was typical of thevariation in ß-ionone content within populations.  ß-Iononeconcentration ranged from very low (175 µg g

The quantity of oil components from plants within populations variedconsiderably.  The Walpole-1 population sampled in 1993 was typical of thevariation in ß-ionone content within populations.  ß-Iononeconcentration ranged from very low (175 µg g
-1
) to extremely high(1342 µg g
-1
).
The relationship between oil components based on their quantitative presence inplants was investigated using principal components analysis.  Results indicatedthat ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate were closely related and quitedistinct from the monoterpene hydrocarbons.  The was also a close relationshipamong the monoterpene hydrocarbons.
a
-Pinene and ß-pinene, andto a lesser extent, limonene were closely related.
Principal components analysis was also used to investigate the relationshipbetween
B. megastigma
populations based on the mean content of oilcomponents at each site.  Results failed to show any distinct relationshipsbetween populations.  However, among the populations sampled in each year therewere certain populations which were closely related in terms of the meancontent of the 5 oil components.  Some populations in close proximity to eachother were similar in oil composition, but others were distinct.  Boyup Brook,Palgarup-1 and Palgarup-2 were within 33 km of each other and were closelyrelated (1993 data).  Jarrahwood-2 and Jarrahwood-4 were closely related, butJarrahwood-3 was quite distinct (1994 data).

Canopy cover above

plants affected concentrations of themonoterpene hydrocarbons but not ß-ionone (y = 0.6x + 365; r

= 0.005) and dodecyl acetate (y = 0.8x + 273; r
2
= 0.009).  Plantsshaded by higher densities of canopy cover produced lower concentrations of-pinene (y = -3x + 267; r
2
= 0.09), ß-pinene (y =-2.2x + 156; r
2
= 0.09), and limonene (y = -2.1x + 160;r
2
= 0.09).
Plant age, plant vigor, and flower color each affected the concentration of atleast one of the five essential oil components investigated.  Similar trendsoccurred in both years but only 1993 data is presented.  Age affected fouressential oil components (
Table 2
).  Young plants contained lessalpha-pinene and limonene than mature plants and less ß-pinene thanseedlings, mature and old plants.  Old plants had the most dodecyl acetate.Seedlings had more ß-pinene and limonene, and less ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate than older plants but, due to the low sample size of seedlings,the differences were not significant.  Vigorous plants tended to produce moreß-pinene and limonene than weak plants (

).  Red flowers containedthe lowest concentrations of ß-ion

onene, and less ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate than older plants but, due to the low sample size of seedlings,the differences were not significant.  Vigorous plants tended to produce moreß-pinene and limonene than weak plants (
Table 3
).  Red flowers containedthe lowest concentrations of ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate (
Table 4
).There was a tendency for red/brown flowers to have less ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate than brown flowers.  Yellow flowers contained noß-pinene.
In plants sampled in both years ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate contentdiffered between the 1993 and 1994 sampling.  The mean quantity ofß-ionone and dodecyl acetate was higher in 1994 than 1993, while
a
-pinene, ß-pinene and limonene content did not differ (
Table 5
).  The mean quantity of the majority of oil components for each populationsampled in 1994 was the same as for 1993.  Where differences did occur, theycould be attributed to either large differences in an individual plant, ornumerous small differences in several plants within the population.
Twenty six plants were found to have no
a
-pinene in at least 1 of theyears sampled.  Of the plants found to have no
a
-pinene present ineither the 1993 or 1994 analysis, 69% were found to have no
a
-pinene inboth years.  No ß-pinene was found in 53 plants in at least 1 of theyears sampled.  Of these plants, 85% had no ß-pinene in both years.  Ofthe plants lacking limonene, only 21% had no limonene in both years.

Ofthe plants lacking limonene, only 21% had no limonene in both years.  Manyplants consistently had two or more of the hydrocarbon monoterpenes absent, andseveral were lacking all three.
Boronia heterophylla
Seven populations of
B. heterophylla
were located.  A number of knownsites no longer contained boronias or they had been recently burnt out byfires.  Plants bearing flowers with a wide range of pink tones were identifiedbut white flowers proved elusive.  Most petals had solid color but somepresented either vertical or horizontal bands of deeper color.  Somepopulations had uniform plants with consistent pink colored flowers whilstothers showed considerable variation in both plant form and petal color.Flowering period was very uniform with nearly all plants flowering in earlySept. (early spring, southern hemisphere).  The exceptions were one plant whichflowered two weeks earlier and others which flowered up to several weeks laterthan the general population.  Some plants proved easier than others topropagate from cuttings.  The resulting plants will be assessed in cultivationduring their first flowering season in Sept. 1996.
DISCUSSION
Considerable diversity was identified both within and between populations of
B. megastigma
and

Considerable diversity was identified both within and between populations of
B. megastigma
and
B. heterophylla
.  In
B. megastigma
flowers, ß-ionone was the major oil component followed by dodecylacetate.  These two compounds impart much of the desirable perfume of boroniaabsolute and their close association following principle components analysis ispromising for the selection of genotypes with very high yields of bothcompounds.  The monoterpene hydrocarbons,
a
-pinene, ß-pinene,and limonene are undesirable in boronia absolute.  These components were alsolinked but were quite distinct from ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  Theserelationships indicate that selection of genotypes which produce very highquality oil with abundant ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate and little or nomonoterpenes is possible.
The relationships between ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate and
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene is supported by the work ofBussell et al. (1995) on volatile oil ontogeny in
B. megastigma
.  Thestigma, stamen, and staminode tissue contained dodecanol, ß-ionone,dodecyl acetate, and heptadecene among the principal components.ß-Ionone and dodecyl acetate concentrations were highest in the stigmaextracts.  Extracts of the combined ovary, nectary, and receptacle tissuecontained primarily
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene.  The petaltissue contained relatively low concentrations of all of the above-mentionedvolatile compounds.

a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene.  The petaltissue contained relatively low concentrations of all of the above-mentionedvolatile compounds.
The recorded characteristics of
B. megastigma
and
B. heterophylla
varied considerably between populations.  Although current populations werequite isolated from one another, this is likely to be a recent event due to anumber of factors, such as over-picking, frequent fires, and land clearing foragriculture.  Boronia flowers are pollinated by an unidentified small moth(Bussell et al. 1995).  It is possible that as populations have become moreisolated, the movement of pollinators could be restricted to individualpopulations or a few close populations.  This would result in distantpopulations becoming more genetically isolated over time.  For example
B.megastigma
populations in the southeastern area of their range had quitehigh concentrations of
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene whilenorthern populations all had low concentrations.
Populations in close proximity may remain genetically similar not only due topollen transfer but also water flow which could wash seeds down river from onepopulation to another.  Populations within the same water catchment area, e.g.(
B. megastigma
) Jarrahwood-2 and Jarrahwood-4, appeared closely related,while nearby populations located within different catchment areas e.g.Jarrahwood-3 were occasionally quite distinct.  However, location did notalways explain the differences between populations.  There are manyenvironmental factors which may affect flower color

However, location did notalways explain the differences between populations.  There are manyenvironmental factors which may affect flower color, oil content, and plantvigor.
Canopy cover was used as a crude measure of shading levels.  In open conditionswith little canopy cover and shade,
B. megastigma
produced high amountsof
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene.  In dense forest wherecanopy cover and shade levels were high, monoterpene hydrocarbons were producedin lower quantities.  A number of essential oil species have decreased yieldswhen they are grown under shade.  In peppermint (
Mentha piperita
) highoil yield, including the production of limonene, results from high lightintensity (Clark and Menary 1980).  Reduced oil production occurs under lowradiation in Japanese mint (
Mentha arvensis
) (Duriyaprapan and Britten1982).  In contrast to our results, experiments by Bussell (1996) showed that70% shade cloth (30% of ambient light) had no effect on
a
-pinene andlimonene concentrations (ß-pinene was not tested) in three clones of
B. megastigma
and ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate concentrationsincreased.  Although the genetic material used by Bussel (1996) was different,the shade levels much higher and the plants grown under cultivation, thesedifferences highlight the need to further investigate the influence of shading.Light may also affect flower color in

and ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate concentrationsincreased.  Although the genetic material used by Bussel (1996) was different,the shade levels much higher and the plants grown under cultivation, thesedifferences highlight the need to further investigate the influence of shading.Light may also affect flower color in
B. heterophylla
.  Anthocyaninscontribute to red flower color and anthocyanin production in many species ismodified by light quality and intensity.  Flowers of
B. heterophylla
areknown to fade during senescence (Plummer 1995) but the influence of light onpigment intensity remains unknown.
Plant age, vigor, and flower color affected the concentration of oil componentsin
B. megastigma
.  Unfortunately concentrations of oil componentsproduced by seedlings was not a good indication of production in the adultplant.  This reduces the possibility of screening seedling material for highquality oil in a breeding program.  Red-flowering plants are unlikely to beused in commercial production of oil as they produced low amounts of thefavorable compounds, ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  Plants with yellowflowers produced very little limonene and no ß-pinene but relativelyhigh levels of ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  Bussell (1996) also foundß-pinene to be absent from yellow flowering
B. megastigma

Some differences in oil content were detected between 1993 and 1994.  Theconcentrations of the undesirable oil components,
a
-pinene,ß-pinene, and limonene were fairly consistent which permits geneticselection for low or no production.  The change in ß-ionone and dodecylacetate content was only marginal but offers the possibility of environmentalmanipulation, such as site selection, to increase yield.
Boronia heterophylla
plants with a range of solid and striped flowercolors, and plants which flower outside the usual two-week flowering periodwere identified.  Most of these plants could be propagated successfully.Plants will need to be examined in cultivation to determine if thesecharacteristics are genetically controlled.  Plants will also need to beassessed for their ability to produce numerous high quality stems and withstandthe substantial pruning at harvest.  Selected plants with these attributes willincrease the colour range and harvest period.
Although many of the original populations of
B. megastigma
and
B.heterophylla
no longer exist much variation exists in the remaining plants.Natural pollination of boronias requires the presence of a pollinator moth andher movements tend to ensure out-crossing.  Thus the remaining plants probablycontain most of the original genetic diversity.  Boronias can be manually selfand cross pollinated (Plummer and Considine 1995) and a breeding program hascommenced.

Currently boronia absolute is only used in the foodflavoring sector and development of new uses will require expanded production.

plants with a range of pink flower tones and differentflowering periods were identified.  Although these characteristics will need tobe confirmed under conditions of commercial cultivation they show promise forthe improvement of product quality and the expansion of production of these newcrops.

Several species of
Boronia
(Rutaceae) are endemic to the southwest ofWestern Australia.  They grow in wet or seasonally wet low-lying areas and areusually associated with jarrah (
Eucalyptus marginata
Sm.) forests,paperbark (
Melaleuca parviflora
Lindl.) flats, and creeks.  Two speciesare commercially exploited;
B. megastigma
Nees. (brown boronia) for itsessential oils and
B. heterophylla
F. Muell. (red boronia, kalgan) forcut flowering stems (Plummer 1995).  In the past total production was fromplant material harvested from natural stands.  With increasing demand and theneed to improve quality these industries have shifted to harvesting cultivatedplants.

 to improve quality these industries have shifted to harvesting cultivatedplants.
B. megastigma
plants bear a profusion of strongly scented bell-likeflowers (
Fig. 1
).  Petals are yellow on the inside, while outer petal colorvaries from yellow (cv Lutea) through red to dark brown.  Outer petal color maybe solid or in vertical red (cv Harlequin) or brown stripes (Plummer 1995).Essential oils are extracted from the flowers with hexane to yield about0.4%-0.8% concrete.  Concrete is washed with alcohol or distilled to yield 60%boronia absolute (Guenther 1949; Penfold and Willis 1954).  Boronia absolute isvalued at between US$4,000 to $10,000/kg, depending on quality and purity.  Itcan be used in perfumes, cosmetics, and as a food flavoring where it enhancesmost fruit essences (Davies and Menary 1984; Weyerstahl et al. 1994).  Thereare over 150 compounds in boronia concrete.  ß-Ionone is by far the mostimportant, but other compounds such as dodecyl acetate enhance the perfume.The monoterpene hydrocarbons,
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonenedetract from the aroma.  Three cultivated genotypes have been shown to have ahigh degree of variability in their essential oil components (Davies and Menary1984) but the diversity within the species has not been examined.

Cut flowering stems of

have been exported from Australiato Japan for 7 years and markets are growing in southeast Asia, Europe, andCanada.
B. heterophylla
is an upright shrub which produces aspectacular display of vibrant pink bell-shaped flowers each about 1 cm long inearly spring.  Cultivated plants can yield 8-12 stems 12-15 months fromplanting, 20-30 stems in the third year, and 30-60 stems in the fourth yearwith a commercial life of 5-6 years.  Stems are usually 60 cm long and arepicked with >50% of the flowers open (Plummer 1995).  Although demandcurrently exceeds supply, the limited flowering season (1-2 weeks) and lack offlower color options are obstacles to future expansion.
Demand for both boronia absolute from
B. megastigma
and cut floweringstems of
B. heterophylla
is increasing.  The export market potential issubstantial and is likely to continue its rapid growth.  Exports from WesternAustralia alone are expected to increase by 20% per annum.  Boronia exportsfrom Western Australia were valued at US$46,000 FOB (freight on board) in1992/93 while the total value of boronia exports from Australia was US$180,000FOB in the same year (Anon. 1994).  Current wholesale prices for
B.heterophylla
range from US$2.00 to $3.50 per bunch, depending on supply.Wholesale prices for
B. megastigma
blossom for essential oil productionrange from US$10 to $15/kg.

range from US$2.00 to $3.50 per bunch, depending on supply.Wholesale prices for
B. megastigma
blossom for essential oil productionrange from US$10 to $15/kg.
Commercial production of both species is dependent on a few cultivars andselection of superior genotypes would be beneficial.  The aim of this study wasto investigate variation in the content of essential oil components of
B.megastigma
within and between populations, and over different seasons, andto extend the color range and production period of
B. heterophylla
.
METHODOLOGY
Boronia megastigma
For plant sampling in Aug. to Sept. 1993
B. megastigma
flowers werecollected from plants in 13 natural populations and from a yellow floweringselection
growing in cultivation.  In Aug. to Sept. 1994 flowers werecollected from 16 natural populations.  Flowers from 25 randomly selectedplants were collected from the majority of populations, but where numbers offlowering plants were limited, fewer plants were sampled (n = 24 for theWalpole-2 and Palgarup-1 populations; n = 20 for the Yallingup population; n =22 for the Barlee population).
Details of flower color, plant age, and plant vigor were collected for allplants.  Plant age was determined using the number of years since the last fireor major soil disturbance as an approximate age.  Seedlings were determined asless than 1 year old, young plants 1-2 years, mature plants 2 to 6 years andold plants greater than 6 years.  Plant vigor was determined by the density ofleaves and flowers on each plant.  Weak plants had

 age was determined using the number of years since the last fireor major soil disturbance as an approximate age.  Seedlings were determined asless than 1 year old, young plants 1-2 years, mature plants 2 to 6 years andold plants greater than 6 years.  Plant vigor was determined by the density ofleaves and flowers on each plant.  Weak plants had few flowers and littlefoliage, average plants had moderate amounts of foliage and flowers, andvigorous plants had abundant flowers and lush green foliage.  Oil componentcontents within each category were compared using analysis of variance andmeans were separated using Fisher's PLSD.  The amount of shading by surroundingvegetation was determined for 273 of the plants sampled in 1993 using a Model-Aforest densiometer (Lemmon 1957).
Seven to 10 plants from 12 natural populations initially sampled in 1993 werere-sampled in 1994 in order to investigate the quantity of oil componentsproduced by individual plants over successive years.  Comparisons were madeusing paired 2-tailed t-test.
For oil analysis 12 flowers collected from each plant were extracted withabsolute ethanol (10 ml).  Collection vials were weighed before and afterflower collection and the difference used to determine flower fresh weight.Flowers were extracted for at least 24 h before oil analysis.  An aliquot (4ml) of the extract was analysed without further purification or concentrationusing a gas liquid chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890A) fitted with dualcolumns (50 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter BPX70 from SGE Internationaland 50 m length, 0.2 mm internal diameter ULTRA1 from Hewlett Packard)connected to a single injection port and twin ionization detectors.  Theinjector and detector temperatures were set at 275°C

Theinjector and detector temperatures were set at 275°C.  An initial oventemperature of 60°C was held for 5 minutes and then increased at a rate of8°C min
-1
to a final temperature of 260°C which was held for10 min.  Ethyl un-decanoate (1 µg ml

fresh weight of flowers) of
a

Principal components analyses were performed on the oil data.  The firstanalysis used the oil data from all individuals sampled to plot the orthogonalfactor scores and determine the relationship between the different oilcomponents.  The second analysis used the mean data for each oil component fromeach population to determine the relationship between different populations interms of the 5 oil components.

RESULTS
Boronia megastigma
The 29
B. megastigma
populations identified cover most of the remainingnatural range of the species however, much of this region is now agriculturalland (
Fig. 2
).  Flowers from all plants contained ß-ionone.
a
-Ionone was either absent or present in undetectable amounts and wastherefore excluded from further analysis.  ß-Pinene was absent from halfof the plants,
a
-pinene from about a quarter of plants and limonene anddodecyl acetate were absent from only a few plants.  Oil contents were used torank each oil component (
Table 1
).  Ranking was determined by a fixedpercentage of plants whose oil component quantity fell within the stated range.The extremely high ß-ionone producers (those in the top 5%) contained803 to 1787 µg g
-1
of ß-ionone.  ß-Ionone was themajor essential oil component, followed by dodecyl acetate.
a
-Pineneand limonene were often present in similar quantities, and ß-pinene wasusually the least abundant of the oil components examined.

a
-Pineneand limonene were often present in similar quantities, and ß-pinene wasusually the least abundant of the oil components examined.
The mean quantity of oil components varied considerably between populations.
a
-pinene, ß-pinene and limonene were commonly absent fromindividual plants, but each of these compounds was present in at least oneplant in each population.  Location had some influence on the content of themonoterpene hydrocarbons.  Southeastern populations had quite highconcentrations of
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene, whilenorthern populations all had low concentrations.  Location was not always agood indicator of the content of oil components.  In the Jarrahwood area,Jarrahwood-3 produced more than twice the amount of
a
-pinene andß-pinene as Jarrahwood-2 and Jarrahwood-4, even though the threepopulations are only a short distance apart.  Location did not influenceß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  The highest mean ß-ionone contentfor a population was 736 µg g
-1
at Albany-1 and the lowest was 227µg g
-1
at Porongurup-1.
The quantity of oil components from plants within populations variedconsiderably.  The Walpole-1 population sampled in 1993 was typical of thevariation in ß-ionone content within populations.  ß-Iononeconcentration ranged from very low (175 µg g

The quantity of oil components from plants within populations variedconsiderably.  The Walpole-1 population sampled in 1993 was typical of thevariation in ß-ionone content within populations.  ß-Iononeconcentration ranged from very low (175 µg g
-1
) to extremely high(1342 µg g
-1
).
The relationship between oil components based on their quantitative presence inplants was investigated using principal components analysis.  Results indicatedthat ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate were closely related and quitedistinct from the monoterpene hydrocarbons.  The was also a close relationshipamong the monoterpene hydrocarbons.
a
-Pinene and ß-pinene, andto a lesser extent, limonene were closely related.
Principal components analysis was also used to investigate the relationshipbetween
B. megastigma
populations based on the mean content of oilcomponents at each site.  Results failed to show any distinct relationshipsbetween populations.  However, among the populations sampled in each year therewere certain populations which were closely related in terms of the meancontent of the 5 oil components.  Some populations in close proximity to eachother were similar in oil composition, but others were distinct.  Boyup Brook,Palgarup-1 and Palgarup-2 were within 33 km of each other and were closelyrelated (1993 data).  Jarrahwood-2 and Jarrahwood-4 were closely related, butJarrahwood-3 was quite distinct (1994 data).

Canopy cover above

= 0.005) and dodecyl acetate (y = 0.8x + 273; r
2
= 0.009).  Plantsshaded by higher densities of canopy cover produced lower concentrations of-pinene (y = -3x + 267; r
2
= 0.09), ß-pinene (y =-2.2x + 156; r
2
= 0.09), and limonene (y = -2.1x + 160;r
2
= 0.09).
Plant age, plant vigor, and flower color each affected the concentration of atleast one of the five essential oil components investigated.  Similar trendsoccurred in both years but only 1993 data is presented.  Age affected fouressential oil components (
Table 2
).  Young plants contained lessalpha-pinene and limonene than mature plants and less ß-pinene thanseedlings, mature and old plants.  Old plants had the most dodecyl acetate.Seedlings had more ß-pinene and limonene, and less ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate than older plants but, due to the low sample size of seedlings,the differences were not significant.  Vigorous plants tended to produce moreß-pinene and limonene than weak plants (
Table 3
).  Red flowers containedthe lowest concentrations of ß-ion

onene, and less ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate than older plants but, due to the low sample size of seedlings,the differences were not significant.  Vigorous plants tended to produce moreß-pinene and limonene than weak plants (
Table 3
).  Red flowers containedthe lowest concentrations of ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate (
Table 4
).There was a tendency for red/brown flowers to have less ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate than brown flowers.  Yellow flowers contained noß-pinene.
In plants sampled in both years ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate contentdiffered between the 1993 and 1994 sampling.  The mean quantity ofß-ionone and dodecyl acetate was higher in 1994 than 1993, while
a
-pinene, ß-pinene and limonene content did not differ (
Table 5
).  The mean quantity of the majority of oil components for each populationsampled in 1994 was the same as for 1993.  Where differences did occur, theycould be attributed to either large differences in an individual plant, ornumerous small differences in several plants within the population.
Twenty six plants were found to have no
a
-pinene in at least 1 of theyears sampled.  Of the plants found to have no
a
-pinene present ineither the 1993 or 1994 analysis, 69% were found to have no
a
-pinene inboth years.  No ß-pinene was found in 53 plants in at least 1 of theyears sampled.  Of these plants, 85% had no ß-pinene in both years.  Ofthe plants lacking limonene, only 21% had no limonene in both years.

were located.  A number of knownsites no longer contained boronias or they had been recently burnt out byfires.  Plants bearing flowers with a wide range of pink tones were identifiedbut white flowers proved elusive.  Most petals had solid color but somepresented either vertical or horizontal bands of deeper color.  Somepopulations had uniform plants with consistent pink colored flowers whilstothers showed considerable variation in both plant form and petal color.Flowering period was very uniform with nearly all plants flowering in earlySept. (early spring, southern hemisphere).  The exceptions were one plant whichflowered two weeks earlier and others which flowered up to several weeks laterthan the general population.  Some plants proved easier than others topropagate from cuttings.  The resulting plants will be assessed in cultivationduring their first flowering season in Sept. 1996.
DISCUSSION
Considerable diversity was identified both within and between populations of
B. megastigma
and
B. heterophylla
.  In
B. megastigma
flowers, ß-ionone was the major oil component followed by dodecylacetate.  These two compounds impart much of the desirable perfume of boroniaabsolute and their close association following

Considerable diversity was identified both within and between populations of
B. megastigma
and
B. heterophylla
.  In
B. megastigma
flowers, ß-ionone was the major oil component followed by dodecylacetate.  These two compounds impart much of the desirable perfume of boroniaabsolute and their close association following principle components analysis ispromising for the selection of genotypes with very high yields of bothcompounds.  The monoterpene hydrocarbons,
a
-pinene, ß-pinene,and limonene are undesirable in boronia absolute.  These components were alsolinked but were quite distinct from ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  Theserelationships indicate that selection of genotypes which produce very highquality oil with abundant ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate and little or nomonoterpenes is possible.
The relationships between ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate and
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene is supported by the work ofBussell et al. (1995) on volatile oil ontogeny in
B. megastigma
.  Thestigma, stamen, and staminode tissue contained dodecanol, ß-ionone,dodecyl acetate, and heptadecene among the principal components.ß-Ionone and dodecyl acetate concentrations were highest in the stigmaextracts.  Extracts of the combined ovary, nectary, and receptacle tissuecontained primarily
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene.  The petaltissue contained relatively low concentrations of all of the above-mentionedvolatile compounds.

 dodecyl acetate concentrations were highest in the stigmaextracts.  Extracts of the combined ovary, nectary, and receptacle tissuecontained primarily
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene.  The petaltissue contained relatively low concentrations of all of the above-mentionedvolatile compounds.
The recorded characteristics of
B. megastigma
and
B. heterophylla
varied considerably between populations.  Although current populations werequite isolated from one another, this is likely to be a recent event due to anumber of factors, such as over-picking, frequent fires, and land clearing foragriculture.  Boronia flowers are pollinated by an unidentified small moth(Bussell et al. 1995).  It is possible that as populations have become moreisolated, the movement of pollinators could be restricted to individualpopulations or a few close populations.  This would result in distantpopulations becoming more genetically isolated over time.  For example
B.megastigma
populations in the southeastern area of their range had quitehigh concentrations of
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene whilenorthern populations all had low concentrations.
Populations in close proximity may remain genetically similar not only due topollen transfer but also water flow which could wash seeds down river from onepopulation to another.  Populations within the same water catchment area, e.g.(
B. megastigma
) Jarrahwood-2 and Jarrahwood-4, appeared closely related,while nearby populations located within different catchment areas e.g.Jarrahwood-3 were occasionally quite distinct.  However, location did notalways explain the differences between populations.  There are manyenvironmental factors which may affect flower color

However, location did notalways explain the differences between populations.  There are manyenvironmental factors which may affect flower color, oil content, and plantvigor.
Canopy cover was used as a crude measure of shading levels.  In open conditionswith little canopy cover and shade,
B. megastigma
produced high amountsof
a
-pinene, ß-pinene, and limonene.  In dense forest wherecanopy cover and shade levels were high, monoterpene hydrocarbons were producedin lower quantities.  A number of essential oil species have decreased yieldswhen they are grown under shade.  In peppermint (
Mentha piperita
) highoil yield, including the production of limonene, results from high lightintensity (Clark and Menary 1980).  Reduced oil production occurs under lowradiation in Japanese mint (
Mentha arvensis
) (Duriyaprapan and Britten1982).  In contrast to our results, experiments by Bussell (1996) showed that70% shade cloth (30% of ambient light) had no effect on
a
-pinene andlimonene concentrations (ß-pinene was not tested) in three clones of
B. megastigma
and ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate concentrationsincreased.  Although the genetic material used by Bussel (1996) was different,the shade levels much higher and the plants grown under cultivation, thesedifferences highlight the need to further investigate the influence of shading.Light may also affect flower color in

and ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate concentrationsincreased.  Although the genetic material used by Bussel (1996) was different,the shade levels much higher and the plants grown under cultivation, thesedifferences highlight the need to further investigate the influence of shading.Light may also affect flower color in
B. heterophylla
.  Anthocyaninscontribute to red flower color and anthocyanin production in many species ismodified by light quality and intensity.  Flowers of
B. heterophylla
areknown to fade during senescence (Plummer 1995) but the influence of light onpigment intensity remains unknown.
Plant age, vigor, and flower color affected the concentration of oil componentsin
B. megastigma
.  Unfortunately concentrations of oil componentsproduced by seedlings was not a good indication of production in the adultplant.  This reduces the possibility of screening seedling material for highquality oil in a breeding program.  Red-flowering plants are unlikely to beused in commercial production of oil as they produced low amounts of thefavorable compounds, ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  Plants with yellowflowers produced very little limonene and no ß-pinene but relativelyhigh levels of ß-ionone and dodecyl acetate.  Bussell (1996) also foundß-pinene to be absent from yellow flowering
B. megastigma

Some differences in oil content were detected between 1993 and 1994.  Theconcentrations of the undesirable oil components,
a
-pinene,ß-pinene, and limonene were fairly consistent which permits geneticselection for low or no production.  The change in ß-ionone and dodecylacetate content was only marginal but offers the possibility of environmentalmanipulation, such as site selection, to increase yield.
Boronia heterophylla
plants with a range of solid and striped flowercolors, and plants which flower outside the usual two-week flowering periodwere identified.  Most of these plants could be propagated successfully.Plants will need to be examined in cultivation to determine if thesecharacteristics are genetically controlled.  Plants will also need to beassessed for their ability to produce numerous high quality stems and withstandthe substantial pruning at harvest.  Selected plants with these attributes willincrease the colour range and harvest period.
Although many of the original populations of
B. megastigma
and
B.heterophylla
no longer exist much variation exists in the remaining plants.Natural pollination of boronias requires the presence of a pollinator moth andher movements tend to ensure out-crossing.  Thus the remaining plants probablycontain most of the original genetic diversity.  Boronias can be manually selfand cross pollinated (Plummer and Considine 1995) and a breeding program hascommenced.
B. megastigma
plants with high yields of ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate and low or no monoterpene production were identified.

B. megastigma
plants with high yields of ß-ionone anddodecyl acetate and low or no monoterpene production were identified.Collection from natural stands is inadequate to meet demand and expansion ofcultivation is underway.  Currently boronia absolute is only used in the foodflavoring sector and development of new uses will require expanded production.
B. heterophylla
plants with a range of pink flower tones and differentflowering periods were identified.  Although these characteristics will need tobe confirmed under conditions of commercial cultivation they show promise forthe improvement of product quality and the expansion of production of these newcrops.
