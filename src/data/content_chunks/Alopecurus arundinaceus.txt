Creeping foxtail
Gramineae
Alopecurus arundinaceus
Poir.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a cool-season, sod-forming grass from Eurasia. It resembles meadowfoxtail but has more vigorous rhizomes and broader leaves. It is used to alimited extent for hay, pasture and erosion control on moist sites in theNorthern Great Plains, Intermountain Area, and Pacific Northwest. Forage ispalatable and nutritious.
