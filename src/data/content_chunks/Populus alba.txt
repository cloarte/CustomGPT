 Invasion: The crown is broad and rounded, or pyramidal in var.pyramidalis. At maturity, it can reach a height of 30 m and a stem diameter in excess 100 cm, and the smooth, greenish-white bark becomes dark and rough on older trees. The trunk is straight, at times sinuous, with large branches inserted irregularly, which often bifurcate. The root system is lateral, shallow but expansive; the bark is grey-white, rough at the base in older trees only. It tends to produce abundant root suckers. It can live to 300-400 years old (Allegri, 1971). Leaves of long shoots are 6-12 cm long, relatively deeply lobed and palmate, the 3-5 lobes are coarsely dentate, the base is rounded-cordate, dark green above and white tomentose beneath; leaves of short shoots are smaller, oval-elliptic, sinuately dent

Petioles are rounded and pubescent, 3-4 cm long. The staminate catkins are usually reddish, 5-8 cm long with 10-20 stamens; the fruiting catkins are 10-15 cm long; the capsules are bivalved; the pedicels are slender, 3-5 cm long.

P. alba has some desirable characteristics, such as tolerance to drought, salt and borers, and easy vegetative propagation, justifying its introduction in several breeding programmes, particularly in Mediterranean regions and Western and Central Asia.

Collection and selection of natural clones has been carried out in Spain ( Alba, 1992 ) and Hungary ( Toth, 1996 ), and of drought tolerant clones of vars. hickeliana , subintegerrima and microphylla in Morocco, and a fastigiate and frost resistant cultivar in Russia ( Sekawin, 1975 ). The cultivars ‘Kabudeh Schirazih’&apos; and ‘Kabudeh Bumi’ are cultivated in Iran, the cultivar ‘Ankara AT’ in Turkey and ‘Villafranca’ in Italy and Hungary. P. alba var. pyramidalis ‘Bolleana’ has been cultivated in Western Europe and in Argentina ( Jobling, 1990 ). P. alba can hybridize with all species of section Populus , sometimes spontaneously, for example the grey poplar P. canescens is considered to be a natural hybrid of P. alba and P. tremula , occurring where the range of the two species overlaps. Hybridization with species of other sections of Populus is also possible ( Sekawin, 1975 ). P. alba has been the subject of intensive selection, artificial hybridisation, cloning and genetic modification. P. alba is a deciduous, dioecious tree. Flowering begins in early spring, before leaf emergence, and fruits mature 6-8 weeks later. Seeds germinate better when not covered with soils. For propagation and raising of planting stock, refer to Stanton and Villar (1996) . P. alba can also be vegetatively propagated using stem cuttings 30-35 cm long ( Dragomir and Duran, 1959 ).

P. alba can also be vegetatively propagated using stem cuttings 30-35 cm long ( Dragomir and Duran, 1959 ). In countries where the species is cultivated P. alba is planted in soil which is not suitable for other poplar species (such as P. canadensis ): for example, where the water table is inaccessible or the soil is poor or saline. Plantation density depends on the product to be obtained; 10,000 trees/ha for biomass energy ( Facciotto and Schenone, 1998 ), 400-1000 trees/ha for pulpwood and sawlogs, and P. alba can tolerate a higher density than other poplar species, with fewer and smaller branches, but thinning is necessary, and pruning is essential to avoid stem forking ( Facciotto, 1999 ). A normal rotation of P. alba is 18-25 years with a final density of 300-400 trees/ha, yielding 10-15 cubic metres/ha/year or 18-22 cubic metres/ha/year on optimal sites ( Gambi, 1979 ). P. alba grows in warm temperate zones with bimodal or uniform rainfall regime, with mean annual rainfall is in the range 300-1000 mm with only a short dry season. It is thermophile and light demanding, and can tolerate dry summers ( Sekawin, 1975 ). It performs well in warm temperate and subtropical regions where water is available in the soil. In cool temperate zones it finds less favourable conditions, suffering from excessive moisture conditions, low temperature and frost and in this zone the hybrid between P. alba and aspen ( P. tremula ) is preferable.

P. alba can tolerate dry, saline and calcareous soils, but prefers neutral, well-textured soil and good water availability (Os’kina and Bespalov, 1992; Rédei, 1998 ).
