USDA Symbol:  **  ;
Plant Notes:  Camphorweed is a native herbaceous annual in the Sunflower family (Asteraceae). It occurs on dunes, on roadsides, in fields, along railroad tracks, and in waste areas. Flowers are produced in heads. Both the ray and disc flowers are yellow. The flowering period extends from summer until the first hard freeze. This species has greatly expanded its range, moving into disturbed areas along roads and railroads. Two varieties are recognized: Common Camphorweed (Heterotheca subaxillaris (Lamarck) Britton & Rusby ssp. latifolia (Buckley) J.C. Semple) and Dune Camphorweed (Heterotheca subaxillaris (Lamarck) Britton & Rusby ssp. subaxillaris). Common Camphorweed occurs throughout the state. It lacks a cluster of coarse hairs on the tips of the phyllaries (the bracts subtending the heads). Dune Camphorweed occurs on the lower coastal plain, especially near the coast. Both subspecies are drought tolerant and thrive in poor soils in full sun. Seeds are sometimes available from wildflower seed companies. These plants produce large amounts of seed, and tend to be very weedy. They are a favorite nectar plant for insects late in the year when little else is in flower. --A. Diamond
