IMPACT ON PREVENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW BACTERIAL PATHOGEN   
ISSUE :   
• Ralstonia solancearum is a Federal Select Agent and is 
not established in the US. 
• In spring of 2020, the Michigan State University Plant & 
Pest Diagnostics identified Ralstonia solancearum in a 
geranium sample that originated outside of the US.   
• The pathogen was further identified as race 3 biovar 2 
and resulted in significant regulatory action. 
• This pathogen can cause disease in geraniums as well as 
tomato and potato crops. 
• Michigan’s bedding plant sales and potato industries are 
valued at almost $550 million and $2.53 billion, 
respectively.   
 
APPROACH :  
• NPDN training programs focused on detection methods and regulatory communication 
protocols prepare diagnosticians for pathogen detection. 
• Because of this training, susceptible hosts with wilt symptoms can be quickly screened for R. 
solancearum 
• The MSU PPD and Michigan’s Department of Agriculture worked closely together to 
quickly communicate results and develop action plans when needed. 
• Samples of concern were submitted to the USDA APHIS confirmatory diagnostic lab. 
RESULTS:  
• Work done at MSU Plant & Pest Diagnostic (PPD) lab protects agriculture and horticulture 
industries by providing early detection, which facilitates rapid remediation steps. 
• This work maintained Michigan’s greenhouse industry, a valuable component of Michigan’s 
economy.

IMPACTS:  
Michigan State University’s Plant & Pest Diagnostics 
program is one of 72 labs across the country in the 
National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN) that is 
prepared to screen plants for pests and pathogens and take 
actions which can prevent unintended pest introductions 
and subsequent losses. 
 
 
 
 
 
MDARD pest response specialists often seek advice from MSU experts on 
pest and disease response situations.  They help to inform many of our 
pest detection efforts and are crucial to the success of those 
efforts.  Michigan has been a pioneer in this type of collaboration,” said 
Robin Rosenbaum, former Plant Health Section Manager and State Plant 
Regulatory Official at MDARD. 
 
“The detection of Ralstonia in 2020 was a fantastic example of how MSU’s 
early detection impacted the spread of a major plant disease” Robin 
Rosenbaum, former Plant Health Section Manager and State Plant 
Regulatory Official at MDARD.
