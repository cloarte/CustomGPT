hemorrhagic disease (EHD). Infection with orthobunyaviruses, Simbu serogroup has replaced Akabane 
virus. 
Definitions: 
Notifiable Diseases 
• Notifiable diseases and conditions consist of emergency incidents, emerging disease incidents, and 
regulated disease incidents. Immediate reporting by Animal Health Professionals. 
Monitored Diseases 
• Monitored diseases are those that are endemic in the United States. Monthly reporting by State Animal 
Health Officials and Laboratories. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) uses data 
gathered to monitor changes in disease occurrence over time. 
Terrestrial 
• Animals that live predominantly or entirely on land. 
Aquatic 
• Animals which live predominantly or entirely in the water. 
Animal Health Professional 
• An Animal Health Professional is an individual, corporate entity, or animal health organization with 
formal training in the diagnosis or recognition of animal diseases and/or pests of livestock. Examples of 
animal health professionals include, but are not limited to, veterinary medical professionals, diagnostic 
laboratorians, biomedical researchers, public health officials, animal health officials, trained 
technicians, zoo personnel, and wildlife personnel with such training. 
1 Diseases are organized by primary species affected; however, listed diseases are reportable regardless of host species. Please refer to disease case definitions for 
additional clarification on reporting criteria.
