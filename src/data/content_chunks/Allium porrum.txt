 Reproduccion: A. porrum is a biennial, onion-like plant. Rather than forming a tight bulb like the onion, leek produces a long cylinder of bundled leaf sheaths. If left into their second summer, leeks produce spherical clusters of purple, pink or white flowers on cylindrical stalks. Leek grows out of the cotyledon within the seed. Upon germination the cotyledon becomes the first embryonic leaf. The under part of the cotyledon is the basal plate. The other leaves and, in the second year, the flower grows out of the apical meristem of the basal plate. Every new leaf is formed out of a ring-shaped meristem inside the previous leaf sheath. Every leaf meristem gives birth to a leaf and a leaf sheath. The proportion of leaf length/leaf sheath length increases from the outer part to the centre of the sheath ( Van der Meer and Hanelt, 1990 ). A flower can be formed when the vegetative growth is nearly complete, in the second growth year. A flower grows through the sheath out of the apical meristem. The stem of the flower has one screen with a couple of hundred flowers. The flowers flourish protandric. Plants of the genus Allium ampeloprasum all show different ploidy levels (2n = 24, 32, 40, 48 or 56), but all commercially available leek cultivars are tetraploids (Meer and Hanelt, 1990). One of the most remarkable characteristics of leek is the strong inbreeding depression after self-fertilization. Even after one inbred generation, the plant weight is reduced by 24-62% ( Gagnebin and Bonnet, 1979 ). Leek is a cross-pollinator with a self-pollination of up to 20%. The heterogeneity

The heterogeneity of open pollinated cultivars can be explained by this inbred depression due to self-fertilization ( Berninger and Buret, 1967 ).
