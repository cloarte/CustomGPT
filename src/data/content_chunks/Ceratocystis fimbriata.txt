 Invasion: C. fimbriata grows readily on most agar media. Mycelium is hyaline at first, later turning dark greenish-brown. Within a few days there are usually abundant conidiophores that produce chains of hyaline conidia, sometimes called endoconidia, characteristic of the anamorph genus Chalara. However, Chalara species are anamorphs of discomycetes, and the genus Thielaviopsis is now used for anamorphs of Ceratocystis species (Paulin et al., 2002). Endoconidia are cylindrical and may vary in size from 11 to 16 mm long by 4 to 5 mm wide (all measurements are fromHunt, 1956). Specialized conidiophores give rise to thick-walled, pigmented aleurioconidia (sometimes called chlamydospores), probably a survival spore. Aleurioconidia are typically 9-16 mm long and 6-13 mm wide, borne singly or in short chains. Endoconidia may also darken

 5 mm wide (all measurements are fromHunt, 1956). Specialized conidiophores give rise to thick-walled, pigmented aleurioconidia (sometimes called chlamydospores), probably a survival spore. Aleurioconidia are typically 9-16 mm long and 6-13 mm wide, borne singly or in short chains. Endoconidia may also darken and become thick walled chlamydospores, thus resembling aleurioconidia. Endoconidia, chlamydospores formed from endoconidia, and aleurioconidia may be produced on and within the substratum.The teleomorph of the fungus is well adapted to insect dispersal. The fungus has two mating types, and MAT-1 isolates can only produce perithecia when paired with MAT-2 isolates. However, MAT-2 isolates are self-fertile due to uni-directional mating type switching (Harrington and McNew, 1997;Witthuhn et al., 2000). Most field isolates are MAT-2 and self-fertile, producing many fruiting bodies (ascomata) on the surface of the host or in culture, often within one week. Ascomata are dark brown to black and globose, 130-200 µm diameter with a long, thin neck up to 800 µm long, through which the ascospores are exuded. The opening at the tip of the neck has 8 to 15 ostiolar hyphae ranging in length from 50 to 90 µm. Ascospores are small, hyaline and hat-shaped, 4.5-8 µm long by 2.5-5.5 µm wide, and accumulate in a sticky matrix at the tip of the ascomatal neck, where they appear as a cream to pink ball or coil.

 Reproduccion: Although outcrossing is possible, most isolates are self-fertile due to unidirectional mating type switching ( Webster and Butler, 1967a , b; Harrington and McNew, 1997 ; Witthuhn et al., 2000 ). Fruiting bodies (perithecia) are produced from the mycelium in culture in about a week. The fungus may be dispersed as fragments of mycelium, conidia, aleurioconidia or ascospores. Aleurioconidia are probably the most common survival units because they are thick-walled and durable, and they probably facilitate survival in soil ( Accordi, 1989 ) and in insect frass ( Iton, 1960 ). The fungus may survive in wood fragments in river water ( Grosclaude et al., 1991a ) and in the soil ( Accordi, 1989 ) for at least 3 months in the winter. C. fimbriata produces a strong fruity odour that varies with the medium. This has been assumed to be an adaptation for dispersal by insects, which are attracted to diseased plants and can become covered with sticky spores if the fungus is sporulating (see Means of Movement and Dispersal).Wounds, either natural or from human activities, are important infection courts for all members of the genus Ceratocystis, including C. fimbriata. Inoculum may reach an open wound by being blown in the wind in insect frass ( Iton, 1960 ) or by being carried by insects that visit the wound

 sporulating (see Means of Movement and Dispersal).Wounds, either natural or from human activities, are important infection courts for all members of the genus Ceratocystis, including C. fimbriata. Inoculum may reach an open wound by being blown in the wind in insect frass ( Iton, 1960 ) or by being carried by insects that visit the wound. Nitidulid beetles that feed on fungi and plant sap may be important vectors ( Moller and DeVay, 1968b ). Cultivation practices such as pruning may also provide infection courts ( Teviotdale and Harper, 1991 ).C. fimbriata usually grows best at temperatures from 18 to 28°C and is able to produce ascospores within a week. The fungus probably survives adverse conditions as mycelium within the plant host, or as aleurioconidia in the soil or in plant hosts or debris. The disease in Theobroma has been thought to be most severe during periods of abiotic stresses, particularly drought stress ( Spence, 1958 ), or excessive rain ( Malaguti, 1952a ). On Ipomoea, attack by C. fimbriata may be enhanced by boron deficiency in the soil ( Hu et al., 1999 ).
 Sintomas: C. fimbriata is primarily a xylem pathogen. On trees (Theobroma, Mangifera, Prunus, etc.), infection typically occurs through fresh wounds ( Giraldo, 1957 ; Viégas, 1960; Moller et al., 1969 ), although root infections are also common ( Ribeiro et al., 1986 ; Rossetto and Ribeiro, 1990 ; Laia et al., 2000 ). Mycelium and spores enter wounds and move through the xylem in water-conducting cells and into ray parenchyma cells. The fungus causes dark reddish-brown to purple to deep-brown or

 al., 1969 ), although root infections are also common ( Ribeiro et al., 1986 ; Rossetto and Ribeiro, 1990 ; Laia et al., 2000 ). Mycelium and spores enter wounds and move through the xylem in water-conducting cells and into ray parenchyma cells. The fungus causes dark reddish-brown to purple to deep-brown or black staining in the xylem. This staining may extend several metres from the roots, up the trunk of the tree, and into branches. When affected branches or trunks are cut in cross-section, the staining along the rays gives a distinctive wedge-shaped or starburst-like pattern ( Sinclair et al., 1987 ). On the surface of the trunk or branches, cankers may develop over areas of xylem discoloration, and the cankers may exude gum. Branch and trunk cankers are particularly common on Populus, Prunus, Platanus ( Sinclair et al., 1987 ) and Eucalyptus ( Laia et al., 2000 ), though wilting may also occur in the absence of canker development. Wilted leaves typically become dry and curled rather suddenly but remain attached to the tree for several weeks. On Platanus, individual leaves of affected branches often show interveinal chlorosis and necrosis, perhaps associated with fungal-produced phytotoxins ( Ake et al., 1992 ; Alami et al., 1998 ; Pazzagli et al., 1999 ).Infection of many trees (Theobroma, Mangifera, Punica and others) is often accompanied by secondary attack by various ambrosia beetles (such as Xyleborus and Hypocryphalus species), which bore into the xylem of the diseased trunk and produce copious amounts of frass (wood particles mixed with faeces) ( Iton, 1959 , 1960; Rossetto and de Medeiros

Frass may cling to the gallery entrance holes in long strands or accumulate on the bark or at the base of the tree. Aleurioconidia may be present in such frass and may be an important source of inoculum. Frass containing C. fimbriata may be dispersed by wind or rainsplash.On rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis), C. fimbriata attacks the tapping panel, causing a pale-grey mould on the surface of the panel and dark discoloration in the wood under the surface ( Martin, 1949 ; Silveira et al., 1994 ).On herbaceous plants (Colocasia, Ipomoea, etc.), C. fimbriata may attack through wounded roots or stems, causing a root rot or seedling rot, or it can travel through the xylem, causing rapid wilting of the plant and extensive dark discoloration of the vascular system. It may also occur as a black, sunken rot on the surface of storage roots or corms of Ipomoea and Araceae such as Colocasia and Xanthosoma, either before or after harvest ( Clark and Moyer, 1988 ).The fungus has also been reported as a superficial pathogen of harvested cocoa pods, causing soft, brown, rotted lesions ( Malaguti, 1958 ), especially during rainy periods ( Siller, 1958 ). However, a related fungus, Ceratocystis paradoxa, is more common on rotten cocoa pods, most probably

On Platanus, individual leaves of affected branches often show interveinal chlorosis and necrosis, perhaps associated with fungal-produced phytotoxins ( Ake et al., 1992 ; Alami et al., 1998 ; Pazzagli et al., 1999 ).Infection of many trees (Theobroma, Mangifera, Punica and others) is often accompanied by secondary attack by various ambrosia beetles (such as Xyleborus and Hypocryphalus species), which bore into the xylem of the diseased trunk and produce copious amounts of frass (wood particles mixed with faeces) ( Iton, 1959 , 1960; Rossetto and de Medeiros

 Mangifera, Punica and others) is often accompanied by secondary attack by various ambrosia beetles (such as Xyleborus and Hypocryphalus species), which bore into the xylem of the diseased trunk and produce copious amounts of frass (wood particles mixed with faeces) ( Iton, 1959 , 1960; Rossetto and de Medeiros, 1967 ; Somasekhara, 1999 ). Frass may cling to the gallery entrance holes in long strands or accumulate on the bark or at the base of the tree. Aleurioconidia may be present in such frass and may be an important source of inoculum. Frass containing C. fimbriata may be dispersed by wind or rainsplash.On rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis), C. fimbriata attacks the tapping panel, causing a pale-grey mould on the surface of the panel and dark discoloration in the wood under the surface ( Martin, 1949 ; Silveira et al., 1994 ).On herbaceous plants (Colocasia, Ipomoea, etc.), C. fimbriata may attack through wounded roots or stems, causing a root rot or seedling rot, or it can travel through the xylem, causing rapid wilting of the plant and extensive dark discoloration of the vascular system. It may also occur as a black, sunken rot on the surface of storage roots or corms of Ipomoea and Araceae such as Colocasia and Xanthosoma, either before or after harvest ( Clark and Moyer, 1988 ).The fungus has also been reported as a superficial pathogen of harvested cocoa pods, causing soft, brown, rotted lesions ( Malaguti, 1958 ), especially during rainy periods ( Siller, 1958 ). However, a related fungus, Ceratocystis paradoxa, is more common on rotten cocoa pods, most probably

oma, either before or after harvest ( Clark and Moyer, 1988 ).The fungus has also been reported as a superficial pathogen of harvested cocoa pods, causing soft, brown, rotted lesions ( Malaguti, 1958 ), especially during rainy periods ( Siller, 1958 ). However, a related fungus, Ceratocystis paradoxa, is more common on rotten cocoa pods, most probably as a secondary invader ( Thorold, 1975 ).
 Organos afectados: Acacia decurrens (green wattle), Fabaceae, Main, 
 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Although outcrossing is possible, most isolates are self-fertile due to unidirectional mating type switching ( Webster and Butler, 1967a , b; Harrington and McNew, 1997 ; Witthuhn et al., 2000 ). Fruiting bodies (perithecia) are produced from the mycelium in culture in about a week. The fungus may be dispersed as fragments of mycelium, conidia, aleurioconidia or ascospores. Aleurioconidia are probably the most common survival units because they are thick-walled and durable, and they probably facilitate survival in soil ( Accordi, 1989 ) and in insect frass ( Iton, 1960 ). The fungus may survive in wood fragments in river water ( Grosclaude et al., 1991a ) and in the soil ( Accordi, 1989 ) for at least 3 months in the winter. C. fimbriata produces a strong fruity odour that varies with the medium. This has been assumed to be an adaptation for dispersal by insects, which are attracted to diseased plants and can become covered with sticky spores if the fungus is sporulating (see Means of Movement and Dispersal).Wounds, either natural or from human activities, are important infection courts for all members of the genus Ceratocystis, including C

 odour that varies with the medium. This has been assumed to be an adaptation for dispersal by insects, which are attracted to diseased plants and can become covered with sticky spores if the fungus is sporulating (see Means of Movement and Dispersal).Wounds, either natural or from human activities, are important infection courts for all members of the genus Ceratocystis, including C. fimbriata. Inoculum may reach an open wound by being blown in the wind in insect frass ( Iton, 1960 ) or by being carried by insects that visit the wound. Nitidulid beetles that feed on fungi and plant sap may be important vectors ( Moller and DeVay, 1968b ). Cultivation practices such as pruning may also provide infection courts ( Teviotdale and Harper, 1991 ).C. fimbriata usually grows best at temperatures from 18 to 28°C and is able to produce ascospores within a week. The fungus probably survives adverse conditions as mycelium within the plant host, or as aleurioconidia in the soil or in plant hosts or debris. The disease in Theobroma has been thought to be most severe during periods of abiotic stresses, particularly drought stress ( Spence, 1958 ), or excessive rain ( Malaguti, 1952a ). On Ipomoea, attack by C. fimbriata may be enhanced by boron deficiency in the soil ( Hu et al., 1999 ).
