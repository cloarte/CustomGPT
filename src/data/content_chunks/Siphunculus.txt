SiphunculusAlso known as cornicles, one of the defining features of aphidsSiphunculi are structures located on thedorsumof the sixthabdominalsegmentof aphids. They all have an opening or pore from which pheromones are emitted, often as liquid globules. Siphunculi come in a great diversity of forms, from long cylinders to short cones to mere pores, and are absent in some species.
Long cylindrical siphunculusSome siphunculi are extremely long and conspicuous, especially in many species of the tribe Macrosiphini. Note that siphunculi are never perfectly cylindrical, but if they are notswollen(with adistalsection thicker than abasalsection), or notbroadly conical, they are considered cylindrical.The aphid's left siphunculus is circled. Note also thepostsiphuncular scleriteand the flange at the tip.Short cylindrical siphunculusA siphunculus can be long or short. Note that siphunculi are never perfectly cylindrical, but if they are notswollen(with adistalsection thicker than abasalsection), or notbroadly conical, they are considered cylindrical.Its length is measured as the shortest straight distance between its base where it is attached to the aphid abomen, and the extreme distal end (black arrows). The white arrows show the measurement of the basal diameter and the diameter at the approximate mid-point of the siphunculus.Swollen siphunculusSome siphunculi are visibly swollen.Length measurement is from base to tip (black arrows). The white arrows highlight measuring the diameter of the siphunculus at its sub-swelling constriction and the point of maximum swelling.Swollen siphunculusSome siphunculi can be extremely swollen.Length measurement is from base to tip (
