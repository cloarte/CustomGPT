Likely mode of entry 
This banana disease is readily transmitted in planting material 
(suckers or rhizome pieces) and infected soil, as well as on farming 
equipment (knives, etc.), vehicles, machinery, and animals. Local 
transmission may occur in drainage water. 
Symptoms (Figures 1–2) 
Leaves turn yellow and become necrotic progressively from the 
oldest to the youngest leaves. The plants wilt and most die before 
they can produce any fruit, although sometimes fruiting or 
environmental stress such as wet, dry, or extremely hot conditions 
will promote the appearance of disease symptoms. The pseudostem 
(banana tree trunk) discolours yellow, red, or brown in concentric 
rings (visible when cut through) before an extensive brown rot 
develops. 
Host range 
This pathogen attacks most varieties of bananas, including the main 
commercial variety, Cavendish. Some weeds and grasses can also be 
infected without disease symptoms. 
Biology (Figures 1–2) 
Fusarium wilt is caused by a fungus which produces different spore 
types including a resting spore that can remain viable in the soil for 
decades. Spores infect the roots and the fungus spreads up through 
the plant causing lesions in the pseudostem, restricting circulation of 
water and nutrients within the plant. The plant develops leaf 
symptoms, wilts and eventually dies, usually without producing any 
fruit.

Fusarium odoratissimum , was until recently referred to as F. 
oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4, and is often called Panama 
disease. 
Distribution 
There are several banana-infecting Fusarium species throughout the 
banana-producing regions of the world. Fusarium odoratissimum is 
present in Asia, the Middle East, and parts of South America and 
Africa. Outbreaks are under quarantine containment in the Northern 
Territory and Far North Queensland but are considered not 
eradicable. 
 
What to do if you find suspect fusarium wilt of banana 
Department officers: Contain the risk, collect plant specimens 
double-bagged into zip-lock plastic bags and deliver to a 
department plant pathologist immediately. 
Industry and the public: SEE. SECURE. REPORT. 
Secure the goods to limit movement and immediately report your 
detection to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry 
on 1800 798 636.  
Fig. 1 Fusarium wilt of banana symptoms include 
discoloured rings in the cut pseudostem (Jeff Daniells, 
QDAF). 
Fig. 2 Late symptoms of fusarium wilt include wilting and 
death (J. Henderson QDPIF).
