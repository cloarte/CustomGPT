Breadcrumb Home Trade Imports Plant and Plant Product Imports File a Lacey Act Declaration Special Use Designations Special Use Designations Last Modified:  October 23, 2024 The proper use of a special use designation (SUD) in a Lacey Act declaration fulfills the requirements of the Lacey Act regarding the declaration of the scientific name (genus/species). A declaration that uses a SUD to identify the scientific name must include all other information required by the Lacey Act. If the importer uses the SUDs listed in the below tables properly—truthfully, accurately, completely, and appropriately pursuant to this guidance—in a Lacey Act declaration that is otherwise in compliance with the act's requirements, APHIS will not refer for prosecution or take any other enforcement action for failing to provide the scientific name of the plant product in a declaration. Current List of SUDs APHIS may remove or add new SUDs to the list of options below. Please check back for updates. There is no SUD for the country of harvest field. If the country of harvest of the plant or plant product is unknown or is believed to be from more than one country, importers must provide the name of all countries from which the plant material may have been harvested (the country in which the plant was cut, logged, or removed).

 LOPM species grouping includes the following species groupings: Western larch ( Larix occidentalis ) Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziensii ) These two groups each contain only two species that are similar and not easily distinguished one from another. They also contain common grades of lumber manufactured from varying proportions, commingled, and commonly traded together in individual shipments. Identifying the quantity of each particular species in individual shipments for these would be difficult, costly, and/or time consuming. For shipments of these groupings (AATH and LOPM), the importer may declare the genus as “TEMP” and the species as either “AATH” or “LOPM” to represent the species that may be present in products, including pallets, that contain these species. Enter the SUD into the “genus” and “species” field(s) for the declaration as shown in this example: 11. HTS Number 12. Entered Value 13. Article/Component 14. Scientific Name Genus/Species 15.

Once this is operational, importers and brokers can use the following permanent SUDs to report declaration information: Genus: SPECIAL Species: AATH or LOPM Spruce Pine Fir (SPF) Spruce, pine, fir (SPF) is a common grade of lumber manufactured from varying proportions of spruce, pine, or fir species. SPF imports are a combination of several distinct species but identifying the particular species in any individual shipment would be difficult, costly, and/or time consuming. For the purposes of the Lacey Act declaration (PPQ Form 505), the SPF species grouping includes the following species groupings: Abies balsamea Abies lasiocarpa Picea engelmannii Picea glauca Picea mariana Picea rubens Picea sitchensis Pinus banksiana Pinus contorta Pinus resinosa For shipments of SPF, the importer may declare the genus as “Special” and the species as “SPF” to represent that the specific species are unknown, but the SPF species grouping represents all possible species that may be present in the product. However, if a species of wood contained in the shipment does not fall under the species grouping list above, the SPF grouping may not be used in the declaration to identify the genus and species of the plant or plant product being imported.

Composite, Recycled, and Reclaimed On October 1, 2009, APHIS began enforcement of the declaration requirements for plant products in certain Harmonized Tariff Schedule chapters that are composed in whole or in part of composite materials, such as medium density fiberboard, particle board, or paperboard; or recycled, reused, or reclaimed (including driftwood) material. For the purposes of the Lacey Act declaration, importers of such materials may have difficulty identifying the scientific name (genus/species) of the plant products they import. If an importer of such materials is unable through the exercise of due care to determine the scientific name for the plant materials, the importer may use the applicable SUD. By using the SUD, the importer is representing that it is not possible through the exercise of due care to determine the scientific name of such plant materials. If a product is not composed entirely of composite, recycled, reused, and/or reclaimed materials, the importer must indicate the scientific name for all other plant product components. In an effort to simplify the SUD policy, APHIS has combined the SUDs for composite products into one designation (“Composite”) and for reused and reclaimed into another designation (“Reclaimed”). The importer should use the appropriate designation for their product in the "Scientific Name" fields. Importers must also identify the type of product in the article description field. APHIS has not made

The importer should use the appropriate designation for their product in the "Scientific Name" fields. Importers must also identify the type of product in the article description field. APHIS has not made any changes to the SUD for recycled material. For purposes of the Lacey Act declaration, APHIS uses the following definitions for the terms “Composite,” “Recycled,” and “Reused and/or Reclaimed:” Composite— These are materials made of small fibers of more than one kind of plant that are bonded together chemically and include medium density fiberboard (MDF), high density fiberboard (HDF), oriented strand board (OSB), particle board, paper, paperboard, and cardboard. Recycled— These are materials derived from highly processed waste material and include recycled paper and recycled paperboard. Reclaimed and/or Reused— These are materials that have initially been processed by another company for a difference purpose and are then repurposed to create new products. The plant materials include construction debris, reclaimed lumber or wood salvaged from old buildings, furniture or ships. Driftwood could be considered either natural or reused. 11. HTS Number 12.
