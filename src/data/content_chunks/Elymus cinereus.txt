This is a cool season, slightly spreading grass found throughout the WesternStates--particularly on alkaline soils. It is a tall, coarse grower, sometimesreaching to 10 feet. It is relatively low in palatability and is not plantedcommercially but affords emergency summer or winter pasturage where present.
