Testing for Senecavirus A in Biological Products 
 
Background 
Senecavirus A (SVA), also known as Seneca valley virus, is a positive single stranded RNA 
virus belonging to Picornaviridae family. The virus causes disease in young pigs. The 
pathological lesions in infected animals are similar to reportable diseases such as foot and mouth 
disease, vesicular stomatitis, swine vesicular disease, and vesicular exanthema. Disease 
outbreaks have been reported in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, China, and Canada. Outbreaks 
have increased in the United States rapidly over the last few years.  
At the 2017 annual meeting of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV), a 
biologics company reported SVA contamination in two lots of porcine-derived trypsin. The 
identification was made by whole genome sequencing and virus isolation. The finding raised 
concerns with pork industry representatives regarding the possibility of SVA contamination in 
veterinary biological products, including those already licensed and in commerce. In response, 
the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) immediately initiated testing vaccine samples 
available in the CVB repository that were known to be manufactured using porcine-derived 
ingredients. The repository contains samples of all vaccines on the market that have current 
expiration dates.  
Selection of Biological Product Samples  
CVB prioritized the highest risk biologics for testing. Those included biologics used in swine 
and manufactured using swine serum and swine-derived trypsin. For their initial testing, CVB 
selected forty-two (42) samples of high risk biologic serials from the repository.

Selection of Biological Product Samples  
CVB prioritized the highest risk biologics for testing. Those included biologics used in swine 
and manufactured using swine serum and swine-derived trypsin. For their initial testing, CVB 
selected forty-two (42) samples of high risk biologic serials from the repository.   
Testing Procedure  
CVB included trypsin lots routinely used, including the two trypsin lots identified as 
contaminated during the AASV meeting. For positive controls, CVB used trypsin and vaccine 
samples spiked with control plasmids or with SVA. For subsequent testing, CVB incorporated 
thirty-five (35) CVB repository available serials of inactivated autogenous and mycoplasma 
bacterins.  
CVB screened multiple cell lines. For the biologics sample testing, they chose the fast growing 
and easily available chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell culture substrate for SVA isolation. 
They adopted the sensitive Fowler real-time rt-qPCR testing method for amplification and 
screening of viral RNA. RNA was extracted directly from the biologics samples, serum and 
trypsin samples, and the infected CEF cell cultures. Independent confirmatory testing was 
completed at Iowa State University (ISU) laboratory in Ames, Iowa and VS’ Foreign Animal 
Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) in Plum Island, New York.   
Results and Discussion 
The testing results are summarized in the Tables below. CVB testing found all biologics samples 
screened negative except for two vaccine serials manufactured by one firm that was positive for 
2 
 
SVA nucleic acid. Both of the vaccine serials tested positive

 (FADDL) in Plum Island, New York.   
Results and Discussion 
The testing results are summarized in the Tables below. CVB testing found all biologics samples 
screened negative except for two vaccine serials manufactured by one firm that was positive for 
2 
 
SVA nucleic acid. Both of the vaccine serials tested positive in confirmatory testing at the ISU 
laboratory as well as at FADDL. Of the several trypsin and swine serum samples screened, CVB 
only found one serum lot positive by rt-qPCR. ISU and FADDL confirmed this result. This 
serum lot was used during the manufacturing of the two serials that were identified as SVA 
contaminated in the initial CVB screening. All control samples performed as expected. To date, 
CVB has not found vaccine serials, serum, or trypsin samples positive for SVA contamination 
during screening. 
CVB further characterized the SVA present in two PCR positive vaccine serials and one PCR 
positive serum sample found during their initial screening. The quality of both the cDNA 
necessary for nucleic acid library preparation, and the viral RNA for direct sequencing was 
compromised because the contaminated serum used in the preparation of the two serials was 
inactivated by gamma irradiation at 47kGy. Thus, the whole genome sequencing (WGS) method 
failed to detect SVA in any of these three positive samples. However, PCR amplification and 
Sanger Sequencing attempts were useful in successfully generating an SVA-specific 1.8kb 
nucleic acid fragment. This SVA nucleic acid fragment was similar to the SVA-OH2 strain 
isolated in 2015 and available at GenBank with identification #KU058183.1

of the samples tested.

Conclusions 
CVB could not reproduce the results presented at AASV meeting.  CVB tested 77 biologics 
samples with the highest risk of contamination with SVA. CVB found two vaccine serials, which 
were manufactured by a single firm using the same lot of swine serum, positive for SVA nucleic 
acid. CVB testing did not detect viable virus in any of the samples, and testing supports that 
the serum had been adequately irradiated to inactivate the virus. CVB found none of the 
screened porcine-derived trypsin samples positive for SVA. Based on CVB’s testing, it is 
reasonable to conclude that there is no evidence to suggest viable SVA is present as an 
extraneous agent in any of the vaccines that were evaluated. Further, it is very unlikely that 
SVA was spread by contaminated vaccines. 
The CVB has implemented SVA contamination screening for all incoming Master Seeds, 
incoming Master Cells, and materials with animal origin ingredients. The CVB published a draft 
notice recommending biologics manufacturers implement SVA contamination screening of all

Also, the CEF cell culture system is non-permissive to FMD virus amplification. Plans are 
underway at the CVB to use lamb kidney and BHK21 cells for standardizing a test for viable 
SVA contamination detection, which will also detect FMD in animal origin ingredients. CVB is 
working with industry to review all testing of animal origin ingredients regulations and will 
propose updated guidance in the near future.
