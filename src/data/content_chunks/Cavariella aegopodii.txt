Previous|NextCavariella aegopodiiis a widespresd temperate species that feeds mostly on umbells.Common names.Willow-carrot aphid.Distribution.This aphid is globally distributed in temperate and warm temperate regions of the world.Host associations.It feeds on many species of nearly 10 plant families. These including umbells (Apiaceae) as secondary hosts, andSalix(Salicaceae) in the sexual phase of the aphid's life cycle.Economic importance.It is particularly important on cultivated carrots, dill, parsley, celery, fennel, but also attacks a broad range of other wild umbelliferous plants. It has been implicated in the transmission of at least 15 plant viruses.See also.Taxonomy at Aphid Species File.Aphids on the World's Plants.Literature references.AllLifeHabitusHeadAbdomen
