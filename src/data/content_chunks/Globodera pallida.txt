The oesophageal gland lobes are often displaced into a forward position as the large paired ovaries expand in the body cavity. The excretory pore is located at the base of the neck. The vulval slit of the female is found in the vulval basin, a round depression at the opposite pole of the body to the neck. The vulval slit is surrounded by a translucent area of thin cuticle which bears papillae.CystThe tough, hardened cuticle of the dead female tans to a deep brown colour and acts as a protective bag around the embryonated eggs, which will form the next generation ofG. pallida. The dimensions of the cyst are almost identical to those of the female, although the head is usually lost. The features of the cyst fenestrae are important in morphologically-based identification. The fenestrae have normally been lost by the mature cyst stage so that only a hole remains. The anus is generally conspicuous. New cysts may retain the remnants of a thin subcrystalline layer. AllGloboderaspecies are abullate, but occasionally small rounded brown pigmented bodies are found, and these are termed vulval bodies.Cyst measurements: width = 534 ± 66 µm; length, excluding neck = 579 ± 70 µm; neck length = 188 ± 20 µm; mean fenestral diameter = 24.5 ± 5.0 µm; anus to fenestra distance = 50 ± 13.4 µm; Granek's ratio (Granek, 1955) = 2.2 ± 1.0.MaleThe male is vermiform and usually assumes an open C shape upon death and fixation, the short rounded tail twisting through 90-

The body annules are regular along the body and there are three bands in the lateral field, which narrows both posteriorly and anteriorly. The head skeleton of the male is heavily sclerotised and hexaradiate, and the head is offset and bears 6 or 7 annules. The anterior cephalids are located at head annules 2 and 4 and posteriorly at annules 6 to 9. The stylet is strong with backward sloping knobs. The median bulb is rounded and the crescentic valve strong. The oesophagus is encircled by the nerve ring. The dorsal oesophageal gland nucleus is the most prominent of the three gland nuclei and the lobe itself extends almost to the excretory pore. The hemizonid is two body annules wide and two body annules behind the excretory pore. There is a single testis which extends for about 60% of the body length. The arcuate spicules have single points and some workers have separated the speciesG. pallidaandG. rostochiensisusing spicule measurements (Behrens, 1975). The gubernaculum is small and without ornamentation.Male measurements: body length = 1200 ± 100 µm; body width at excretory pore = 28.4 ± 1.0 µm; head width at base = 12.3 ± 0.5µm; head length = 6 ± 0.3µm; stylet length = 27.5 ± 1

The juveniles ofG. pallidaandG. rostochiensisare very alike, butG. pallidajuveniles are generally larger: the body length is greater and the stylet is longer and more robust, with anteriorly facing stylet knobs as opposed to those ofG. rostochiensis, which have smaller, backward-sloping knobs. The juvenile is folded four times within the egg and the tail tapers to a rounded point. The body cavity extends half way along the tail, ending at the anus.

 Reproduccion: A cyst of G. pallida (PCN) contains as many as 500 eggs, which will form the next generation. The eggs can remain viable for many years before gradually deteriorating. Factors affecting hatching are very similar to those that affect Globodera rostochiensis . Soil moisture content has an important effect on both the movement of the second-stage juveniles and, consequently, their use of lipids; adequate soil moisture and lipid levels are both necessary for root infection. Various hatching stimuli are known, for example, root diffusate ( Perry and Beane, 1988 ) and certain organic and inorganic chemical compounds ( Clarke and Hennessy, 1987 ). G. pallida hatches at around 10°C or less and is adapted to develop at cool temperatures between 10 and 18°C, whereas G. rostochiensis seems to be adapted to a temperature range of 15 to 25°C ( Franco, 1979 ). Day length also influences egg hatching, which is faster where the host has continuous light rather than prolonged hours of darkness (

 ). G. pallida hatches at around 10°C or less and is adapted to develop at cool temperatures between 10 and 18°C, whereas G. rostochiensis seems to be adapted to a temperature range of 15 to 25°C ( Franco, 1979 ). Day length also influences egg hatching, which is faster where the host has continuous light rather than prolonged hours of darkness ( Hominick, 1986 ). As with other cyst nematodes, the second-stage juvenile is the infective stage and, upon hatching, invades the host just behind the root tip. The juveniles move up or down the root until they receive a specific signal, which is likely to be of a chemical nature, to set up a feeding site in the form of a syncytium. The ultrastructure of the feeding site and nematode interaction with the syncytium have been studied intensively ( Wyss and Zunke, 1986 ; Golinowski et al., 1997 ; Endo, 1998 ). The life cycle takes around 45 days to complete, during which time the second-stage juvenile develops into a male or a female whose survival depends on environmental factors such as available nutrients. Juveniles that penetrate the pericycle cells of the plant are more likely to become males, whereas those that penetrate the procambial cells tend to become females ( Golinowski et al., 1997 ). Studies of G. rostochiensis juveniles have shown that, after a few hours of inactivity, the juvenile probes the selected cell and inserts its stylet into it while remaining motionless for several hours; the stylet is withdrawn and re-inserted into the same cell. A secretory product from the oesophageal glands is injected via the stylet into the selected cell. The initial syncytial cell is altered to provide large amounts of nutrients to the developing nematode. The syncytium undergoes major changes, for example

 while remaining motionless for several hours; the stylet is withdrawn and re-inserted into the same cell. A secretory product from the oesophageal glands is injected via the stylet into the selected cell. The initial syncytial cell is altered to provide large amounts of nutrients to the developing nematode. The syncytium undergoes major changes, for example lysis of inner cell walls, formation of cell wall ingrowths next to plant conductive tissue, formation of numerous lipid bodies and enlarged amoeboid nuclei are present. Some of these events are still not fully understood. In resistant plants, the juvenile may try to form a syncytial feeding site but the walls of cells involved usually thicken and cells may die. This prevents the ready movement of nutrients to the juvenile ( Rice et al., 1986 ; Robinson et al., 1988 ). Males are relatively more abundant when environmental conditions are poor as they require less food than females and do not feed during the free-living stage ( Evans, 1970 ). The vermiform male has a short life span of ten days or so and, during this time, it will mate with as many available females as possible. At this point in the life cycle, the white or cream females have become obese and broken through the root cortex, exposing their genitalia. The females secrete pheromones which attract males ( Green and Miller, 1969 ; Green and Plumb, 1970 ; Mugniery, 1979 ; Mugniery et al., 1992). Numerous studies on the biochemistry of both G. rostochiensis and G. pallida have been published since isoelectric focusing was first used to display different protein profiles for G. rostochiensis and G. pallida (Fleming and Marks, 1983).

 G. rostochiensis and G. pallida have been published since isoelectric focusing was first used to display different protein profiles for G. rostochiensis and G. pallida (Fleming and Marks, 1983). This is a quick, dependable and relatively inexpensive method of identification of the species of potato cyst nematodes. Other techniques are capable of greater discrimination, such as pathotypes within a population ( Hinch et al., 1998 ). Monoclonal antibodies have also been used to develop diagnostic procedures based on ELISA ( Curtis et al., 1998 ). DNA-based techniques are used routinely with a range of methods and species-specific primers (Mullholland et al., 1996; Fullaondo et al., 1999 ) now being used with diagnostics applications such as RAPD, RFLPS, AFLPS and multiplex PCR, which have become less expensive and more user friendly. With the many kits now designed to help with the methodology, even greater discrimination is possible. Sequencing of DNA is now undertaken in many laboratories not only to identify to species, but also in studying plant-nematode interactions with a view to developing better control methods ( Perry and Jones, 1998 ). Disruption of the nematode life cycle may be possible through the insertion of genetic constructs coding, for example, enzyme inhibitors into the plant by genetic engineering ( Burrows, 1996 ; Burrows and De Waele, 1997 ). Studies have also been made of nematode secretions and their function and interaction within the host plant ( Jones and Robertson, 1997 ; Jones and Harrower, 1998 ). The role of cuticular secretions in plant parasitic nematodes is not yet fully understood ( Forrest et al., 1989 ; Jones et al., 1997).

Changes occur in the cuticle of second-stage juveniles when they begin to feed: in addition to changes associated with natural growth patterns and the onset of moulting, changes occur that appear to be linked to interaction with the plant host ( Jones and Robertson, 1997 ). Molecular techniques have now advanced so far as to enable the functions of individual genes to be studied. Gp-FAR-1 has been identified from the surface of G. pallida and  is considered to be involved in eluding the defence system of the host plant ( Prior et al., 2001 ). More recent studies on other genes identified from G. rostochiensis have highlighted the complexity of host penetration and the function of pectate lyases utilised by PCN for parasitism ( Kudla et al., 2007 ). RNA interference (RNAi)  has been used in a range of studies and a recent review of progress in this area ( Lilley et al., 2007 ) provides details of target genes in plant parasitic nematodes including PCN. Other biochemical studies have investigated the action of nematode proteinases and their possible involvement in extracellullar digestion ( Koritsas and Atkinson, 1994 ; Lilley et al., 1996 ). Proteinase genes have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Sarkis et al., 1988 ) and Haemonchus contortus ( Pratt et al., 1990 ). Proteinase inhibitors expressed in plants may have the potential to control nematodes ( Hepher and Atkinson, 1992 ).

 Sintomas: Potato cyst nematodes, in common with other cyst nematodes, do not cause specific symptoms of infection. Initially, crops display patches of poor growth and affected plants may show chlorosis and wilting, with poor top growth. Good top growth is essential for photosynthesis and production of sufficient nutrients for the health of the plant and production of new tubers. Affected plants suffer yield loss and tubers are smaller. To be confident that these symptoms are caused by potato cyst nematode and to give an indication of population density, soil samples must be taken or the females or cysts must be observed directly on the host roots.

There is never a golden or yellow stage as inGlobodera rostochiensis. The head bears one to two annules and the neck is covered in ridges between which tubercles are found when viewed by SEM. The head skeleton is hexaradiate and weak. The stylet is equally proportioned (50% conus and 50% shaft), and the basal knobs reflex in an anterior direction. The median bulb is very well developed and has a large crescentic pump. The oesophageal gland lobes are often displaced into a forward position as the large paired ovaries expand in the body cavity.

The oesophageal gland lobes are often displaced into a forward position as the large paired ovaries expand in the body cavity. The excretory pore is located at the base of the neck. The vulval slit of the female is found in the vulval basin, a round depression at the opposite pole of the body to the neck. The vulval slit is surrounded by a translucent area of thin cuticle which bears papillae.CystThe tough, hardened cuticle of the dead female tans to a deep brown colour and acts as a protective bag around the embryonated eggs, which will form the next generation ofG. pallida. The dimensions of the cyst are almost identical to those of the female, although the head is usually lost. The features of the cyst fenestrae are important in morphologically-based identification. The fenestrae have normally been lost by the mature cyst stage so that only a hole remains. The anus is generally conspicuous. New cysts may retain the remnants of a thin subcrystalline layer. AllGloboderaspecies are abullate, but occasionally small rounded brown pigmented bodies are found, and these are termed vulval bodies.Cyst measurements: width = 534 ± 66 µm; length, excluding neck = 579 ± 70 µm; neck length = 188 ± 20 µm; mean fenestral diameter = 24.5 ± 5.0 µm; anus to fenestra distance = 50 ± 13.4 µm; Granek's ratio (Granek, 1955) = 2.2 ± 1.0.MaleThe male is vermiform and usually assumes an open C shape upon death and fixation, the short rounded tail twisting through 90-

The body annules are regular along the body and there are three bands in the lateral field, which narrows both posteriorly and anteriorly. The head skeleton of the male is heavily sclerotised and hexaradiate, and the head is offset and bears 6 or 7 annules. The anterior cephalids are located at head annules 2 and 4 and posteriorly at annules 6 to 9. The stylet is strong with backward sloping knobs. The median bulb is rounded and the crescentic valve strong. The oesophagus is encircled by the nerve ring. The dorsal oesophageal gland nucleus is the most prominent of the three gland nuclei and the lobe itself extends almost to the excretory pore. The hemizonid is two body annules wide and two body annules behind the excretory pore. There is a single testis which extends for about 60% of the body length. The arcuate spicules have single points and some workers have separated the speciesG. pallidaandG. rostochiensisusing spicule measurements (Behrens, 1975).

The juveniles ofG. pallidaandG. rostochiensisare very alike, butG. pallidajuveniles are generally larger: the body length is greater and the stylet is longer and more robust, with anteriorly facing stylet knobs as opposed to those ofG. rostochiensis, which have smaller, backward-sloping knobs. The juvenile is folded four times within the egg and the tail tapers to a rounded point. The body cavity extends half way along the tail, ending at the anus.

 Reproduccion: A cyst of G. pallida (PCN) contains as many as 500 eggs, which will form the next generation. The eggs can remain viable for many years before gradually deteriorating. Factors affecting hatching are very similar to those that affect Globodera rostochiensis . Soil moisture content has an important effect on both the movement of the second-stage juveniles and, consequently, their use of lipids; adequate soil moisture and lipid levels are both necessary for root infection. Various hatching stimuli are known, for example, root diffusate ( Perry and Beane, 1988 ) and certain organic and inorganic chemical compounds ( Clarke and Hennessy, 1987 ). G. pallida hatches at around 10°C or less and is adapted to develop at cool temperatures between 10 and 18°C, whereas G. rostochiensis seems to be adapted to a temperature range of 15 to 25°C ( Franco, 1979 ). Day length also influences egg hatching, which is faster where the host has continuous light rather than prolonged hours of darkness (

 ). G. pallida hatches at around 10°C or less and is adapted to develop at cool temperatures between 10 and 18°C, whereas G. rostochiensis seems to be adapted to a temperature range of 15 to 25°C ( Franco, 1979 ). Day length also influences egg hatching, which is faster where the host has continuous light rather than prolonged hours of darkness ( Hominick, 1986 ). As with other cyst nematodes, the second-stage juvenile is the infective stage and, upon hatching, invades the host just behind the root tip. The juveniles move up or down the root until they receive a specific signal, which is likely to be of a chemical nature, to set up a feeding site in the form of a syncytium. The ultrastructure of the feeding site and nematode interaction with the syncytium have been studied intensively ( Wyss and Zunke, 1986 ; Golinowski et al., 1997 ; Endo, 1998 ). The life cycle takes around 45 days to complete, during which time the second-stage juvenile develops into a male or a female whose survival depends on environmental factors such as available nutrients. Juveniles that penetrate the pericycle cells of the plant are more likely to become males, whereas those that penetrate the procambial cells tend to become females ( Golinowski et al., 1997 ). Studies of G. rostochiensis juveniles have shown that, after a few hours of inactivity, the juvenile probes the selected cell and inserts its stylet into it while remaining motionless for several hours; the stylet is withdrawn and re-inserted into the same cell. A secretory product from the oesophageal glands is injected via the stylet into the selected cell. The initial syncytial cell is altered to provide large amounts of nutrients to the developing nematode. The syncytium undergoes major changes, for example

 while remaining motionless for several hours; the stylet is withdrawn and re-inserted into the same cell. A secretory product from the oesophageal glands is injected via the stylet into the selected cell. The initial syncytial cell is altered to provide large amounts of nutrients to the developing nematode. The syncytium undergoes major changes, for example lysis of inner cell walls, formation of cell wall ingrowths next to plant conductive tissue, formation of numerous lipid bodies and enlarged amoeboid nuclei are present. Some of these events are still not fully understood. In resistant plants, the juvenile may try to form a syncytial feeding site but the walls of cells involved usually thicken and cells may die. This prevents the ready movement of nutrients to the juvenile ( Rice et al., 1986 ; Robinson et al., 1988 ). Males are relatively more abundant when environmental conditions are poor as they require less food than females and do not feed during the free-living stage ( Evans, 1970 ). The vermiform male has a short life span of ten days or so and, during this time, it will mate with as many available females as possible. At this point in the life cycle, the white or cream females have become obese and broken through the root cortex, exposing their genitalia. The females secrete pheromones which attract males ( Green and Miller, 1969 ; Green and Plumb, 1970 ; Mugniery, 1979 ; Mugniery et al., 1992). Numerous studies on the biochemistry of both G. rostochiensis and G. pallida have been published since isoelectric focusing was first used to display different protein profiles for G. rostochiensis and G. pallida (Fleming and Marks, 1983).

 G. rostochiensis and G. pallida have been published since isoelectric focusing was first used to display different protein profiles for G. rostochiensis and G. pallida (Fleming and Marks, 1983). This is a quick, dependable and relatively inexpensive method of identification of the species of potato cyst nematodes. Other techniques are capable of greater discrimination, such as pathotypes within a population ( Hinch et al., 1998 ). Monoclonal antibodies have also been used to develop diagnostic procedures based on ELISA ( Curtis et al., 1998 ). DNA-based techniques are used routinely with a range of methods and species-specific primers (Mullholland et al., 1996; Fullaondo et al., 1999 ) now being used with diagnostics applications such as RAPD, RFLPS, AFLPS and multiplex PCR, which have become less expensive and more user friendly. With the many kits now designed to help with the methodology, even greater discrimination is possible. Sequencing of DNA is now undertaken in many laboratories not only to identify to species, but also in studying plant-nematode interactions with a view to developing better control methods ( Perry and Jones, 1998 ). Disruption of the nematode life cycle may be possible through the insertion of genetic constructs coding, for example, enzyme inhibitors into the plant by genetic engineering ( Burrows, 1996 ; Burrows and De Waele, 1997 ). Studies have also been made of nematode secretions and their function and interaction within the host plant ( Jones and Robertson, 1997 ; Jones and Harrower, 1998 ). The role of cuticular secretions in plant parasitic nematodes is not yet fully understood ( Forrest et al., 1989 ; Jones et al., 1997).

Changes occur in the cuticle of second-stage juveniles when they begin to feed: in addition to changes associated with natural growth patterns and the onset of moulting, changes occur that appear to be linked to interaction with the plant host ( Jones and Robertson, 1997 ). Molecular techniques have now advanced so far as to enable the functions of individual genes to be studied. Gp-FAR-1 has been identified from the surface of G. pallida and  is considered to be involved in eluding the defence system of the host plant ( Prior et al., 2001 ). More recent studies on other genes identified from G. rostochiensis have highlighted the complexity of host penetration and the function of pectate lyases utilised by PCN for parasitism ( Kudla et al., 2007 ). RNA interference (RNAi)  has been used in a range of studies and a recent review of progress in this area ( Lilley et al., 2007 ) provides details of target genes in plant parasitic nematodes including PCN. Other biochemical studies have investigated the action of nematode proteinases and their possible involvement in extracellullar digestion ( Koritsas and Atkinson, 1994 ; Lilley et al., 1996 ). Proteinase genes have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Sarkis et al., 1988 ) and Haemonchus contortus ( Pratt et al., 1990 ). Proteinase inhibitors expressed in plants may have the potential to control nematodes ( Hepher and Atkinson, 1992 ).

There are marked differences in the secretions from the two species of potato cyst nematodes, namely G. pallida and G. rostochiensis ( Duncan et al., 1997 ) and lectin blotting with WGA (wheat germ agglutinin) shows further differences: there were no differences between populations of G. rostochiensis , but there were between populations of G. pallida .
 Sintomas: Potato cyst nematodes, in common with other cyst nematodes, do not cause specific symptoms of infection. Initially, crops display patches of poor growth and affected plants may show chlorosis and wilting, with poor top growth. Good top growth is essential for photosynthesis and production of sufficient nutrients for the health of the plant and production of new tubers. Affected plants suffer yield loss and tubers are smaller. To be confident that these symptoms are caused by potato cyst nematode and to give an indication of population density, soil samples must be taken or the females or cysts must be observed directly on the host roots.
