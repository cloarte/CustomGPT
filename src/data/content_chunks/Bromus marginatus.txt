Mountain brome is a bunchgrass native to the Rocky Mountain and PacificCoast regions. Plants grow to 4 feet, with leaves up to 12 inches long andabout 0.25 inch wide. Leaf blades are flat, and haily underneath. Growth startsearly in the spring, producing much leafy forage relished by livestock. Because of rapid seedling growth and a well-branched, deep root system, mountain brome is excellent where a rapid cover development is needed. This grass is frequently seeded with alfalfa or sweet clover in the Pacific Northwest. The mixture is ideal both for prevention of erosion and as a well balanced animal diet. Stands of mountain brome grass are readily established by seeding.
