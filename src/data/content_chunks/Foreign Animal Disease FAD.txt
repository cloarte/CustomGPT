In the Infected Zone (which is 
part of the Control Area), there 
are movement controls and sur-
veillance activities. Infected Prem-
ises are quarantined.  
In the Buffer Zone (which is part 
of the Control Area), there are 
movement controls and surveil-
lance activities. 
In the Surveillance Zone (which 
is part of the Free Area), target-
ed poultry surveillance may be 
conducted (i.e. commercial prem-
ises). 
In the Free Area (which includes 
the Surveillance Zone), routine 
or program surveillance may occur 
(i.e. NPIP and wild birds).  
Zone/Area Definition 
Infected Zone (IZ) Zone that immediately surrounds an Infected Premises. 
Buffer Zone (BZ) Zone that immediately surrounds an Infected Zone or a Contact Premises.

Ready Reference Guide—Overview of Zones 
In an FAD outbreak, the Incident Commander will work with the Operations  
Section and Planning Section to  determine the appropriate designa tions.  
Infected, Contact, and Suspect Premises are subject to individual premises quarantine. 
At-Risk and Monitored Premises are subject to movement control restrictions.
