DA-2022-34

This Federal Order expands the existing imported fire ant (IFA) quarantine areas in Arkansas and 
Tennessee. 
 
This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the regulatory authority provided by the Plant Protection 
Act of June 20, 2000, as amended, Section 412 (a), 7 U.S.C. 7712 (a). The Act authorizes the 
Secretary of Agriculture to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate commerce of any plant, 
plant part, or article if the Secretary determines the prohibition or restriction is necessary to 
prevent the dissemination of a plant pest within the United States. This Federal Order is likewise 
issued pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection Act found at 7 CFR § 
301.81. 
 
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is adding the 
following to the quarantine areas in the respective states for red and black IFAs (S. invicta and S. 
richteri, respectively), and hybrids of these species: 
 
• Arkansas: Extends the IFA quarantine area to the entire county for Cross, Franklin, 
Johnson, Lee, Monroe, St. Francis, and Woodruff Counties. 
• Tennessee: Extends

 the respective states for red and black IFAs (S. invicta and S. 
richteri, respectively), and hybrids of these species: 
 
• Arkansas: Extends the IFA quarantine area to the entire county for Cross, Franklin, 
Johnson, Lee, Monroe, St. Francis, and Woodruff Counties. 
• Tennessee: Extends the IFA quarantine area to the entire county for Fentress, Morgan, 
and Union Counties. 
 
This action is in response to the new detections in portions of the states of Arkansas and 
Tennessee described in the attached document. APHIS finds it necessary to quarantine these 
areas to prevent the spread of IFA. Effective immediately, all interstate movement of IFA 
regulated articles from the listed areas must be done in accordance with the regulations 
promulgated pursuant to the Plant Protection Act and found at 7 CFR § 301.81 et seq. and in the 
Federal Orders, which are located at the following APHIS website:

and-diseases/imported-fire-ants/ct_regulations 
Section 7 CFR § 301.81-3(a) allows the designation of less than an entire State as an IFA 
quarantined area only when the Administrator of APHIS has determined that the designation of 
less than an entire State as a quarantined IFA area is adequate to prevent the interstate spread of 
infestations of this pest. In addition, 7 CFR § 301.81-3(b) requires that the State enforces an 
intrastate IFA quarantine equivalent to the Federal IFA regulations

intrastate IFA quarantine equivalent to the Federal IFA regulations. The States have established 
intrastate quarantines for the areas listed that mirror the Federal regulatory requirements as 
specified in 7 CFR § 301.81. 
 
Previous Federal Orders pertaining to the expansion of quarantined areas in the IFA regulations 
have been necessary due to the ongoing delimitation of the IFA infestation in various states. This 
Federal Order further expands the quarantined areas as described in the IFA domestic 
regulations. 
 
For additional information on the Federal IFA regulatory program, please contact the IFA Acting 
National Policy Manager, Benjamin Slager, at 810-844-2704. 
 
We appreciate the cooperative relationships with the affected states in our effort to prevent the 
spread of IFA.
