I.  Summary 
 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and its state and industry partners are 
approaching their goal of eradicating brucellosis and pseudorabies from the national cattle and 
commercial swine herds respectively.  With that goal nearing, APHIS held discussions with 
stakeholders and the public regarding the need for continued production and use of vaccine after 
eradication has been declared, changes in the availability of diagnostic reagents and test kits, and 
possible changes to the biosecurity level assigned to

 from the national cattle and 
commercial swine herds respectively.  With that goal nearing, APHIS held discussions with 
stakeholders and the public regarding the need for continued production and use of vaccine after 
eradication has been declared, changes in the availability of diagnostic reagents and test kits, and 
possible changes to the biosecurity level assigned to the causative agents for both diseases.  
These discussions allowed stakeholders to identify issues and concerns they believed APHIS 
should consider before making any new biologics or biosecurity policies concerning brucellosis 
and pseudorabies.   
 
 
II. Background 
 
In October 2002, at a meeting held in St. Louis, MO, APHIS met with representatives of the 
veterinary biologics industry, producer groups, and animal disease researchers.  Participants 
compiled a list of issues this group believed APHIS should consider when developing 
regulations and/or policy concerning the use of vaccine after the end of eradication programs for 
diseases such as brucellosis and pseudorabies.  The group also suggested that APHIS seek 
additional input from state animal health officials, producer groups, and other interested persons 
prior to determining final policy.  
 
To obtain additional input from these groups and other interested parties, the USDA APHIS 
Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) held a public meeting on June 10, 2005, in Des Moines, 
IA.  Approximately 50 individuals from APHIS (staff, field, and laboratory personnel), the 
biologics industry, and various livestock producer groups attended.  APHIS program staff 
presented brief updates concerning past and present vaccine use in the brucellosis and 
pseudorabies programs.  Individuals

 on June 10, 2005, in Des Moines, 
IA.  Approximately 50 individuals from APHIS (staff, field, and laboratory personnel), the 
biologics industry, and various livestock producer groups attended.  APHIS program staff 
presented brief updates concerning past and present vaccine use in the brucellosis and 
pseudorabies programs.  Individuals from the following organizations provided comments for the 
record:  National Pork Board, Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, Texas Animal Health Commission, 
National Institute for Animal Agriculture Brucellosis Eradication Task Force, Idaho Department 
of Agriculture, Animal Health Institute, and Association for Veterinary Biologics Companies.  
Representatives from the following biologics manufacturers provided comments:  Colorado 
Serum Company, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Schering Plough Animal Health, and Boehringer 
Ingelheim Vetmedica.  In addition, five letters from livestock officials were read for the record at 
the request of the sender.  The letters were from the State of Oklahoma Department of 
Agriculture, Food, and Forestry; South Dakota Animal Industry Board; California Department of 
Food and Agriculture; National Cattleman’s Beef Association; and the United States Animal 
Health Association.   
 
The issues identified at the June 10, 2005, public meeting were essentially the same as those 
raised by the focus group invited to the 2002 St. Louis meeting.

III. Issues Identified 
 
A.  Brucellosis 
All individuals who specifically addressed the issue of brucellosis vaccines (and each of the 
letters received from livestock officials) asked that APHIS make no changes to the current 
vaccine strategy for brucellosis.  They believed vaccination should continue for the next several 
years.  Reasons cited included: 
• Wildlife reservoirs serve as a source of infection for domestic cattle herds in several 
states. 
• Borders are porous and infected animals may be imported. 
• The RB-51 vaccine is safe (no animal or human health risk). 
• The vaccine does not interfere with serological tests used for surveillance. 
• Maintaining immunity of the national herd is more important to producers than a 
questionable “free without vaccination” export provision. 
• Vaccine is cost effective for producers that use it. 
• A vaccine bank may not be cost effective because of short shelf life of the current 
product. 
• APHIS has adequate controls in place governing vaccine use. 
 
B.  Pseudorabies  
These issues included requests that APHIS: 
• Allow production of pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine in the U.S. for the purpose of 
export following any decision to discontinue domestic use. 
• Create a PRV vaccine stockpile. 
• Allow widespread use and availability of diagnostics for detection of PRV. 
• Work with the OIE to gain acceptance of the G1-deleted differential ELISA as an official 
test. 
• Continue surveillance of feral swine as potential reservoirs of disease. 
 
C.  Biosecurity

 Allow widespread use and availability of diagnostics for detection of PRV. 
• Work with the OIE to gain acceptance of the G1-deleted differential ELISA as an official 
test. 
• Continue surveillance of feral swine as potential reservoirs of disease. 
 
C.  Biosecurity 
Recommendations regarding biosecurity of declared eradicated agents were mixed.  One 
representative of an agricultural organization asked that any agent, once eradicated, be placed on 
the select agent list and be subject to all biosecurity laws. 
 
Representatives from the biologics industry asked that agents, once eradicated, not be 
automatically classified as select agents, but that each agent is considered separately based on 
risk.  In regards to PRV, biologics industry representatives expressed the opinion that the virus 
not be placed on the select agent list because it is not a human health risk. 
 
Another speaker advocated some controls on PRV, but emphasized that he did not believe it 
needed to be declared a select agent.  This speaker suggested that APHIS determine who held the 
virus, track inventories, encourage disposal of unneeded virus stocks and samples after archiving 
useful isolates, and allow future movement only under permit. 
 
Several speakers asked that APHIS continue to exclude the Brucella abortus vaccine strains 
from select agent requirements.

D. Production of Vaccine after Domestic Use is Discontinued 
If a decision is made to discontinue vaccination for a particular disease, biologics manufacturers 
and several livestock officials stated the industry should be allowed to continue to manufacture 
products in the U.S. for export.  The rationale for this request was as follows:

D. Production of Vaccine after Domestic Use is Discontinued 
If a decision is made to discontinue vaccination for a particular disease, biologics manufacturers 
and several livestock officials stated the industry should be allowed to continue to manufacture 
products in the U.S. for export.  The rationale for this request was as follows:  
• The marketplace is global and products produced for export create domestic jobs. 
• Vaccine production infrastructure would be maintained. 
• Vaccine exported is of benefit to our trading partners and world animal health. 
• In the event of an outbreak, vaccine production could be increased immediately, or serials 
diverted to domestic use. 
• Imported vaccine may not be of the same quality as vaccine licensed by USDA. 
• Adequate controls exist to prevent release of seed or challenge material from 
manufacturer’s facilities; manufacturers have a good safety record. 
• Adequate controls exist to prevent the domestic use of prohibited vaccine. 
 
 
IV. Regulations and Guidelines 
 
The Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913, as Amended in 1985, the Code of Federal Regulations (9 
CFR) Parts 101-118, and Veterinary Services Memoranda, address the regulations for 
preparation, sale, and licenses of biologics and vaccines used in animals.  Part 105 addresses the 
circumstances under which biologics licenses may be revoked or terminated. 
 
The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and 9 CFR 
Part 121, Possession, Use, and Transfer of Biological Agents and Toxins, address the regulation 
of certain listed agents (select agents) that have been determined to have the potential to pose a 
severe threat to
Text Len: 1701
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 licenses may be revoked or terminated. 
 
The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and 9 CFR 
Part 121, Possession, Use, and Transfer of Biological Agents and Toxins, address the regulation 
of certain listed agents (select agents) that have been determined to have the potential to pose a 
severe threat to human or animal health or to animal products.  The purpose of these regulations 
is to ensure the safe handling of such agents and to protect against the unlawful use of these 
agents. 
 
CVB Notice No. 02-21, dated September 11, 2002, informed U.S. biologics licensees, 
permittees, and applicants that the CVB would accept license applications for the domestic 
manufacture of biologics for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of animal disease that are 
foreign to this country, as long as the biologic does not contain any infectious components that 
might endanger U.S. animals. 
 
A National Center for Animal Health Programs (NCAHP) memorandum dated August 14, 2005, 
outlines the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services’ animal health policy in relation to wildlife.  This 
policy states that VS will seek measures to keep wildlife and livestock apart and to eradicate the 
disease from all potential reservoirs when eradication is deemed technically feasible.  If eradication 
is currently not technically feasible, VS will seek to maintain separation of wildlife and livestock 
through cooperative efforts with wildlife agencies until research efforts can develop improved 
procedures to eliminate the disease from the wildlife/feral populations.

V.  Current Status   
 
A.  Biologics Use:  Brucellosis Program 
Vaccination has been an integral part of the brucellosis eradication program since the first 
approved vaccine made its appearance in 1941.  The current National Brucellosis Vaccination 
Policy, developed in 1996, supports proper calf-hood vaccination in high-risk herds and areas 
and supports the elimination of mandatory vaccination in all states.  Also, the Brucellosis 
Emergency Action Plan (1997) recommends whole herd vaccination in herds considered at risk 
for exposure (e.g. those adjacent to known infected herds).  In addition, the States set their own 
regulations on the mandatory use of vaccination in their native cattle and/or cattle imported into 
the state.  These state regulations and policies vary considerably according to circumstances and 
risk to their herds. 
 
B.  Biologics Use:  Pseudorabies Program 
Data collected by the CVB indicate approximately 26.6 million doses of gene-deleted PRV 
vaccine were produced during FY 2005.  The CVB does not track the number of doses of PRV 
vaccine exported, however sources at the manufacturers claim approximately 90 percent was 
exported.  Additionally, a significant number of companion diagnostic test kits were produced 
and distributed both domestically and internationally in FY 2005.   
 
The APHIS National Center for Animal Health Programs staff does not track domestic use of the 
PRV vaccine.  They do know that some producers in a few states, including Iowa

 manufacturers claim approximately 90 percent was 
exported.  Additionally, a significant number of companion diagnostic test kits were produced 
and distributed both domestically and internationally in FY 2005.   
 
The APHIS National Center for Animal Health Programs staff does not track domestic use of the 
PRV vaccine.  They do know that some producers in a few states, including Iowa, Minnesota and 
North Carolina, continue to use the vaccine.  This could explain the approximately 2.5 million 
doses manufacturers sell domestically.  
 
C.  Vaccine Reserve 
Producers, state agriculture and APHIS Program officials all recognize the need for ready access 
to vaccine to control outbreaks of brucellosis and pseudorabies that may occur in the future.  No 
decisions have been made to address the stockpile issue for either of these diseases.   
 
D.  Biosecurity (Select Agent Status) 
Brucella abortus, the etiologic agent of bovine and human brucellosis, is currently classed as a 
select agent and those who possess, use, or transfer the agent are subject to regulations described 
in 9 CFR 121.  B. abortus was deemed a select agent because it is highly infectious and easily 
transmitted by aerosol and thus could be used as an incapacitating agent.  All biologics firms and 
research facilities that possess the agent are registered with either APHIS or the Centers for 
Disease Control.    Select agent program oversight ensures adequate biosecurity for this agent.  
 
The B. abortus vaccine strains (strain 19 and strain RB-51) are currently excluded from the 
requirements of the select agent regulations because the strains are attenuated.   
 
The PRV is used in

Disease Control.    Select agent program oversight ensures adequate biosecurity for this agent.  
 
The B. abortus vaccine strains (strain 19 and strain RB-51) are currently excluded from the 
requirements of the select agent regulations because the strains are attenuated.   
 
The PRV is used in human and animal disease research.  Therefore, stocks of virus exist in 
human and animal medical research facilities in addition to animal disease diagnostic 
laboratories.  An APHIS permit is required for the transfer of the virus from one facility to

another.  
 
Pseudorabies virus is not currently classified as a select agent.  
 
E.  Biologics Use in Wildlife 
Brucellosis is endemic in wild bison and elk in the Greater Yellowstone area and affects cattle 
herds in Wyoming and Idaho.  USDA has ongoing projects to mitigate the disease by 
vaccination.  Strain RB-51 was used to vaccinate a few bison calves and yearlings corralled in 
Yellowstone Park.  This effort will need to be expanded before any effects can be determined.  
The vaccine strain RB-51 has been determined to have poor efficacy in elk..   
 
Eradication of pseudorabies virus in feral swine is not technically feasible at this time.   Vaccines 
used in domestic swine have been shown to be useful in controlling pseudorabies in hunting 
reserve situations where the feral swine can be captured and vaccinated.  However, there is no 
delivery system available to vaccinate free-roaming feral swine.

used in domestic swine have been shown to be useful in controlling pseudorabies in hunting 
reserve situations where the feral swine can be captured and vaccinated.  However, there is no 
delivery system available to vaccinate free-roaming feral swine.  
 
F.  Domestic Production of FAD Biologics 
Historical Perspective:  A generation ago, biologics manufacturers voluntarily surrendered their 
licenses for classical swine fever (CSF) products and domestic manufacture of those products 
ceased.   Master seeds used to produce CSF vaccine and antisera were also surrendered.  These 
actions were appropriate at that time because of safety concerns with the live-virus CSF vaccines 
and the ability of the CSF virus to cause devastating outbreaks if it were accidentally released.   
 
Current Situation:  Vaccine production within the U.S. may be restricted or prohibited by the 
Secretary in order to protect the public health or safety or to prevent the sale of worthless, 
dangerous or harmful biological products.  For example, this authority is used to prohibit the 
domestic manufacture of biologics for certain exotic diseases (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease).   
 
Domestic manufacture of biologics for exotic diseases is allowed as long as the biologic does not 
contain any infectious components that might endanger U.S. animals.  
 
 
VI. Future Expectations and Strategies 
 
A.  Brucellosis Program

feasible in the next five years.  Therefore, it is expected that vaccination will be used to control 
any final outbreaks and to protect cattle herds exposed to wildlife reservoirs in the Greater

VI. Future Expectations and Strategies 
 
A.  Brucellosis Program 
While the ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for vaccination of livestock, it is probably not 
feasible in the next five years.  Therefore, it is expected that vaccination will be used to control 
any final outbreaks and to protect cattle herds exposed to wildlife reservoirs in the Greater 
Yellowstone Area for as long as those reservoirs exist.  Vaccine will also play a role in the 
control and eradication of brucellosis from those wildlife reservoirs. 
 
The future program, beyond eradication of brucellosis in the national cattle and swine herds and 
the elimination of the disease in wildlife will be one of preparedness.  A ready supply of vaccine 
will be needed in the event of outbreaks in cattle or the reappearance of brucellosis in wildlife 
reservoirs that again place cattle at risk.  
 
 
 
 
6
 
B.  Pseudorabies Program 
It is expected that vaccine could also be used to control future outbreaks of pseudorabies.  Since 
the virus exists in feral swine populations throughout the United States, sporadic outbreaks in 
commercial swine may occur.  Producers and state animal health officials will need prompt 
access to vaccine to quickly control such outbreaks. 
 
Licensed diagnostic test kits that differentiate vaccine titers from natural exposure will be needed 
for as long as vaccine is used whatever the circumstances.  Diagnostics will also be needed long-
term for surveillance testing. 
 
C.  Vaccine Reserve 
In the future when domestic vaccine use is discontinued, vaccine needs for outbreaks could be 
met by APHIS maintaining a bank or stockpile of either vaccine or antigen.  The need could also 
be met by contracts with one or more
Text Len: 1740
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 whatever the circumstances.  Diagnostics will also be needed long-
term for surveillance testing. 
 
C.  Vaccine Reserve 
In the future when domestic vaccine use is discontinued, vaccine needs for outbreaks could be 
met by APHIS maintaining a bank or stockpile of either vaccine or antigen.  The need could also 
be met by contracts with one or more manufacturers requiring that firm to maintain a specified 
number of doses that could be immediately diverted to domestic use.  The latter method assumes 
that manufacturers will not be prevented from producing vaccine for export after domestic use is 
discontinued.     
 
D.  Biosecurity Issues 
As previously stated, Brucella abortus is currently classified as a select agent and the vaccine 
strains (RB-51 and Strain 19) are excluded from the select agent regulations.  This is not 
expected to change.   If additional vaccine strains are developed, it is expected that they, too, 
would be excluded from regulation if data are available to show that the new strain is not a 
severe threat to human health. 
 
No decision has been made to classify PRV as a select agent.  There are reasonable arguments 
for and against adding PRV to the select agent list.  On one hand, at some point PRV will be 
eradicated and there is a reasonable expectation on the part of producer groups that APHIS will 
implement some controls to prevent misuse or unintended release of the virus from facilities that 
could cause an outbreak.  Placing the virus on the select agent list would provide a mechanism 
for APHIS to control possession and use of the virus.  On the other hand, PRV does not appear to 
meet the criteria used to place other agents on the select agent list.  The virus

 controls to prevent misuse or unintended release of the virus from facilities that 
could cause an outbreak.  Placing the virus on the select agent list would provide a mechanism 
for APHIS to control possession and use of the virus.  On the other hand, PRV does not appear to 
meet the criteria used to place other agents on the select agent list.  The virus is not a threat to 
human health.  Pseudorabies is primarily a disease of newborn pigs; it does not cause devastating 
disease in all ages of swine.  Therefore, the virus is unlikely to be used as a terror threat. 
Vaccines and diagnostics are available to control outbreaks. In addition, no documented reports 
of accidental release from a research, diagnostic, or manufacturing facility causing an outbreak 
in swine, indicate that standard biosecurity procedures are adequate for PRV. 
 
If PRV is classified as a select agent, it is reasonable to assume that the gene-deleted vaccine 
strains would be excluded from the regulations because they pose no threat to human or animal 
health. 
 
A decision to classify PRV as a select agent could be made when the disease is declared 
eradicated from domestic swine or at some time in the future after the virus is eliminated from 
feral swine populations.

E.  Wildlife Issues 
The National Animal Disease Center and APHIS VS are conducting a study to evaluate a 
genetically engineered RB-51 vaccine strain that may prove more efficacious in elk.  While it 
appears theoretically possible to eradicate brucellosis from wildlife, the effort is expected to take 
many years.

 APHIS VS are conducting a study to evaluate a 
genetically engineered RB-51 vaccine strain that may prove more efficacious in elk.  While it 
appears theoretically possible to eradicate brucellosis from wildlife, the effort is expected to take 
many years.     
 
Eradication of pseudorabies in swine is more problematic.  Because of the difficulty in catching 
and restraining feral swine, there is a need to develop an oral PRV vaccine delivery method that 
is effective and environmentally safe.  It may be decades before commercial swine operations are 
free from the risk of outbreaks from feral swine. 
 
Measures that keep the wildlife (and feral animals) separate and apart from domestic livestock 
will continue until eradication of brucellosis and pseudorabies from these reservoirs is 
accomplished.  If eradication of brucellosis and/or pseudorabies from these reservoirs is not 
deemed feasible, measures that keep the wildlife (and feral animals) separate and apart from 
domestic livestock must continue indefinitely and be included as part of the state’s disease 
management program. 
 
F.  Domestic Production of Brucellosis and Pseudorabies Vaccines after Eradication 
To meet the need for some level of biologics use, APHIS will consider allowing biologics 
manufacturers to continue, with certain stipulations to ensure biosecurity, to manufacture 
products for prevention and diagnosis of Brucella abortus and PRV after eradication in domestic 
animals in the United States has been accomplished.  This would provide continued availability 
of licensed biologics in the event of a disease outbreak without presenting significant risk to the 
animal or human populations, and without significantly affecting the manufacturers’ desire to

products for prevention and diagnosis of Brucella abortus and PRV after eradication in domestic 
animals in the United States has been accomplished.  This would provide continued availability 
of licensed biologics in the event of a disease outbreak without presenting significant risk to the 
animal or human populations, and without significantly affecting the manufacturers’ desire to 
pursue a global market for these products. 
 
G.  Other Agents 
Decisions concerning vaccine production and use for diseases that are eradicated in the future 
will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 
VII. Timeline 
 
Near Term Actions (Next 6 months):   
• Decision to allow domestic production for export of brucellosis and PRV biologics. 
• Communication of decision to biologics manufacturers. 
 
Intermediate Term Actions (Next 1-3 years or at time PRV is eradicated from commercial 
swine): 
• Decision on select agent status of PRV following eradication from the national herd; 
development of biosecurity requirements for non-biologics facilities. 
• Development of guidelines on domestic production of PRV vaccines (biosecurity 
requirements) and license restrictions.  
 
 
 
 
8
 
Long Term Actions (Next 4-20 years or until such time as brucellosis and PRV are eradicated 
from wildlife): 
• Continue cooperative vaccine projects with the goal of eradicating brucellosis and PRV 
from wildlife and/or feral animals.  
 
Upon successful eradication from wildlife reservoirs: 
• Revisit biosecurity requirements and/or select agent status of PRV.

I.  Summary 
 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and its state and industry partners are 
approaching their goal of eradicating brucellosis and pseudorabies from the national cattle and 
commercial swine herds respectively.  With that goal nearing, APHIS held discussions with 
stakeholders and the public regarding the need for continued production and use of vaccine after 
eradication has been declared, changes in the availability of diagnostic reagents and test kits, and

 from the national cattle and 
commercial swine herds respectively.  With that goal nearing, APHIS held discussions with 
stakeholders and the public regarding the need for continued production and use of vaccine after 
eradication has been declared, changes in the availability of diagnostic reagents and test kits, and 
possible changes to the biosecurity level assigned to the causative agents for both diseases.  
These discussions allowed stakeholders to identify issues and concerns they believed APHIS 
should consider before making any new biologics or biosecurity policies concerning brucellosis 
and pseudorabies.   
 
 
II. Background 
 
In October 2002, at a meeting held in St. Louis, MO, APHIS met with representatives of the 
veterinary biologics industry, producer groups, and animal disease researchers.  Participants 
compiled a list of issues this group believed APHIS should consider when developing 
regulations and/or policy concerning the use of vaccine after the end of eradication programs for 
diseases such as brucellosis and pseudorabies.  The group also suggested that APHIS seek 
additional input from state animal health officials, producer groups, and other interested persons 
prior to determining final policy.  
 
To obtain additional input from these groups and other interested parties, the USDA APHIS 
Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) held a public meeting on June 10, 2005, in Des Moines, 
IA.  Approximately 50 individuals from APHIS (staff, field, and laboratory personnel), the

the request of the sender.  The letters were from the State of Oklahoma Department of 
Agriculture, Food, and Forestry; South Dakota Animal Industry Board; California Department of 
Food and Agriculture; National Cattleman’s Beef Association; and the United States Animal 
Health Association.   
 
The issues identified at the June 10, 2005, public meeting were essentially the same as those 
raised by the focus group invited to the 2002 St. Louis meeting.

III. Issues Identified 
 
A.  Brucellosis 
All individuals who specifically addressed the issue of brucellosis vaccines (and each of the 
letters received from livestock officials) asked that APHIS make no changes to the current 
vaccine strategy for brucellosis.  They believed vaccination should continue for the next several 
years.  Reasons cited included: 
• Wildlife reservoirs serve as a source of infection for domestic cattle herds in several 
states. 
• Borders are porous and infected animals may be imported. 
• The RB-51 vaccine is safe (no animal or human health risk). 
• The vaccine does not interfere with serological tests used for surveillance. 
• Maintaining immunity of the national herd is more important to producers than a 
questionable “free without vaccination” export provision. 
• Vaccine is cost effective for producers that use it. 
• A vaccine bank may not be cost effective because of short shelf life of the current 
product. 
• APHIS has adequate controls in place governing vaccine use. 
 
B.  Pseudorabies  
These issues included requests that APHIS: 
• Allow production of pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine in the U.S. for the purpose of 
export following any decision to discontinue domestic use. 
• Create a PRV vaccine stockpile. 
• Allow widespread use and availability of diagnostics for detection of PRV. 
• Work with the OIE to gain acceptance of the G1-deleted differential ELISA as an official 
test. 
• Continue surveillance of feral swine as potential reservoirs of disease. 
 
C.  Biosecurity

 Allow widespread use and availability of diagnostics for detection of PRV. 
• Work with the OIE to gain acceptance of the G1-deleted differential ELISA as an official 
test. 
• Continue surveillance of feral swine as potential reservoirs of disease. 
 
C.  Biosecurity 
Recommendations regarding biosecurity of declared eradicated agents were mixed.  One 
representative of an agricultural organization asked that any agent, once eradicated, be placed on 
the select agent list and be subject to all biosecurity laws. 
 
Representatives from the biologics industry asked that agents, once eradicated, not be 
automatically classified as select agents, but that each agent is considered separately based on 
risk.  In regards to PRV, biologics industry representatives expressed the opinion that the virus 
not be placed on the select agent list because it is not a human health risk. 
 
Another speaker advocated some controls on PRV, but emphasized that he did not believe it 
needed to be declared a select agent.  This speaker suggested that APHIS determine who held the 
virus, track inventories, encourage disposal of unneeded virus stocks and samples after archiving 
useful isolates, and allow future movement only under permit. 
 
Several speakers asked that APHIS continue to exclude the Brucella abortus vaccine strains 
from select agent requirements.

D. Production of Vaccine after Domestic Use is Discontinued 
If a decision is made to discontinue vaccination for a particular disease, biologics manufacturers 
and several livestock officials stated the industry should be allowed to continue to manufacture 
products in the U.S. for export.  The rationale for this request was as follows:

D. Production of Vaccine after Domestic Use is Discontinued 
If a decision is made to discontinue vaccination for a particular disease, biologics manufacturers 
and several livestock officials stated the industry should be allowed to continue to manufacture 
products in the U.S. for export.  The rationale for this request was as follows:  
• The marketplace is global and products produced for export create domestic jobs. 
• Vaccine production infrastructure would be maintained. 
• Vaccine exported is of benefit to our trading partners and world animal health. 
• In the event of an outbreak, vaccine production could be increased immediately, or serials 
diverted to domestic use. 
• Imported vaccine may not be of the same quality as vaccine licensed by USDA. 
• Adequate controls exist to prevent release of seed or challenge material from 
manufacturer’s facilities; manufacturers have a good safety record. 
• Adequate controls exist to prevent the domestic use of prohibited vaccine. 
 
 
IV. Regulations and Guidelines 
 
The Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913, as Amended in 1985, the Code of Federal Regulations (9 
CFR) Parts 101-118, and Veterinary Services Memoranda, address the regulations for 
preparation, sale, and licenses of biologics and vaccines used in animals.  Part 105 addresses the 
circumstances under which biologics licenses may be revoked or terminated. 
 
The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and 9 CFR 
Part 121, Possession, Use, and Transfer of Biological Agents and Toxins, address the regulation 
of certain listed agents (select agents) that have been determined to have the potential to pose a 
severe threat to

 licenses may be revoked or terminated. 
 
The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and 9 CFR 
Part 121, Possession, Use, and Transfer of Biological Agents and Toxins, address the regulation 
of certain listed agents (select agents) that have been determined to have the potential to pose a 
severe threat to human or animal health or to animal products.  The purpose of these regulations 
is to ensure the safe handling of such agents and to protect against the unlawful use of these 
agents. 
 
CVB Notice No. 02-21, dated September 11, 2002, informed U.S. biologics licensees, 
permittees, and applicants that the CVB would accept license applications for the domestic 
manufacture of biologics for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of animal disease that are 
foreign to this country, as long as the biologic does not contain any infectious components that 
might endanger U.S. animals. 
 
A National Center for Animal Health Programs (NCAHP) memorandum dated August 14, 2005, 
outlines the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services’ animal health policy in relation to wildlife.  This 
policy states that VS will seek measures to keep wildlife and livestock apart and to eradicate the 
disease from all potential reservoirs when eradication is deemed technically feasible.  If eradication 
is currently not technically feasible, VS will seek to maintain separation of wildlife and livestock 
through cooperative efforts with wildlife agencies until research efforts can develop improved 
procedures to eliminate the disease from the wildlife/feral populations.

V.  Current Status   
 
A.  Biologics Use:  Brucellosis Program 
Vaccination has been an integral part of the brucellosis eradication program since the first 
approved vaccine made its appearance in 1941.  The current National Brucellosis Vaccination 
Policy, developed in 1996, supports proper calf-hood vaccination in high-risk herds and areas 
and supports the elimination of mandatory vaccination in all states.  Also, the Brucellosis 
Emergency Action Plan (1997) recommends whole herd vaccination in herds considered at risk 
for exposure (e.g. those adjacent to known infected herds).  In addition, the States set their own 
regulations on the mandatory use of vaccination in their native cattle and/or cattle imported into 
the state.  These state regulations and policies vary considerably according to circumstances and 
risk to their herds. 
 
B.  Biologics Use:  Pseudorabies Program 
Data collected by the CVB indicate approximately 26.6 million doses of gene-deleted PRV 
vaccine were produced during FY 2005.  The CVB does not track the number of doses of PRV 
vaccine exported, however sources at the manufacturers claim approximately 90 percent was 
exported.  Additionally, a significant number of companion diagnostic test kits were produced 
and distributed both domestically and internationally in FY 2005.

 manufacturers claim approximately 90 percent was 
exported.  Additionally, a significant number of companion diagnostic test kits were produced 
and distributed both domestically and internationally in FY 2005.   
 
The APHIS National Center for Animal Health Programs staff does not track domestic use of the 
PRV vaccine.  They do know that some producers in a few states, including Iowa, Minnesota and 
North Carolina, continue to use the vaccine.  This could explain the approximately 2.5 million 
doses manufacturers sell domestically.  
 
C.  Vaccine Reserve 
Producers, state agriculture and APHIS Program officials all recognize the need for ready access 
to vaccine to control outbreaks of brucellosis and pseudorabies that may occur in the future.  No 
decisions have been made to address the stockpile issue for either of these diseases.   
 
D.  Biosecurity (Select Agent Status) 
Brucella abortus, the etiologic agent of bovine and human brucellosis, is currently classed as a 
select agent and those who possess, use, or transfer the agent are subject to regulations described 
in 9 CFR 121.  B. abortus was deemed a select agent because it is highly infectious and easily 
transmitted by aerosol and thus could be used as an incapacitating agent.  All biologics firms and 
research facilities that possess the agent are registered with either APHIS or the Centers for 
Disease Control.    Select agent program oversight ensures adequate biosecurity for this agent.  
 
The B. abortus vaccine strains (strain 19 and strain RB-51) are currently excluded from the 
requirements of the select agent regulations because the strains are attenuated.   
 
The PRV is used in

The B. abortus vaccine strains (strain 19 and strain RB-51) are currently excluded from the 
requirements of the select agent regulations because the strains are attenuated.   
 
The PRV is used in human and animal disease research.  Therefore, stocks of virus exist in 
human and animal medical research facilities in addition to animal disease diagnostic 
laboratories.  An APHIS permit is required for the transfer of the virus from one facility to

another.  
 
Pseudorabies virus is not currently classified as a select agent.  
 
E.  Biologics Use in Wildlife 
Brucellosis is endemic in wild bison and elk in the Greater Yellowstone area and affects cattle 
herds in Wyoming and Idaho.  USDA has ongoing projects to mitigate the disease by 
vaccination.  Strain RB-51 was used to vaccinate a few bison calves and yearlings corralled in 
Yellowstone Park.  This effort will need to be expanded before any effects can be determined.  
The vaccine strain RB-51 has been determined to have poor efficacy in elk..   
 
Eradication of pseudorabies virus in feral swine is not technically feasible at this time.   Vaccines 
used in domestic swine have been shown to be useful in controlling pseudorabies in hunting 
reserve situations where the feral swine can be captured and vaccinated.  However, there is no 
delivery system available to vaccinate free-roaming feral swine.

reserve situations where the feral swine can be captured and vaccinated.  However, there is no 
delivery system available to vaccinate free-roaming feral swine.  
 
F.  Domestic Production of FAD Biologics 
Historical Perspective:  A generation ago, biologics manufacturers voluntarily surrendered their 
licenses for classical swine fever (CSF) products and domestic manufacture of those products 
ceased.   Master seeds used to produce CSF vaccine and antisera were also surrendered.  These 
actions were appropriate at that time because of safety concerns with the live-virus CSF vaccines 
and the ability of the CSF virus to cause devastating outbreaks if it were accidentally released.   
 
Current Situation:  Vaccine production within the U.S. may be restricted or prohibited by the 
Secretary in order to protect the public health or safety or to prevent the sale of worthless, 
dangerous or harmful biological products.  For example, this authority is used to prohibit the 
domestic manufacture of biologics for certain exotic diseases (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease).   
 
Domestic manufacture of biologics for exotic diseases is allowed as long as the biologic does not 
contain any infectious components that might endanger U.S. animals.  
 
 
VI. Future Expectations and Strategies 
 
A.  Brucellosis Program

feasible in the next five years.  Therefore, it is expected that vaccination will be used to control 
any final outbreaks and to protect cattle herds exposed to wildlife reservoirs in the Greater

VI. Future Expectations and Strategies 
 
A.  Brucellosis Program 
While the ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for vaccination of livestock, it is probably not 
feasible in the next five years.  Therefore, it is expected that vaccination will be used to control 
any final outbreaks and to protect cattle herds exposed to wildlife reservoirs in the Greater 
Yellowstone Area for as long as those reservoirs exist.  Vaccine will also play a role in the 
control and eradication of brucellosis from those wildlife reservoirs. 
 
The future program, beyond eradication of brucellosis in the national cattle and swine herds and 
the elimination of the disease in wildlife will be one of preparedness.  A ready supply of vaccine 
will be needed in the event of outbreaks in cattle or the reappearance of brucellosis in wildlife 
reservoirs that again place cattle at risk.

B.  Pseudorabies Program 
It is expected that vaccine could also be used to control future outbreaks of pseudorabies.  Since 
the virus exists in feral swine populations throughout the United States, sporadic outbreaks in 
commercial swine may occur.  Producers and state animal health officials will need prompt 
access to vaccine to quickly control such outbreaks. 
 
Licensed diagnostic test kits that differentiate vaccine titers from natural exposure will be needed 
for as long as vaccine is used whatever the circumstances.  Diagnostics will also be needed long-
term for surveillance testing. 
 
C.  Vaccine Reserve 
In the future when domestic vaccine use is discontinued, vaccine needs for outbreaks could be 
met by APHIS maintaining a bank or stockpile of either vaccine or antigen.  The need could also 
be met by contracts with one or more

 whatever the circumstances.  Diagnostics will also be needed long-
term for surveillance testing. 
 
C.  Vaccine Reserve 
In the future when domestic vaccine use is discontinued, vaccine needs for outbreaks could be 
met by APHIS maintaining a bank or stockpile of either vaccine or antigen.  The need could also 
be met by contracts with one or more manufacturers requiring that firm to maintain a specified 
number of doses that could be immediately diverted to domestic use.  The latter method assumes 
that manufacturers will not be prevented from producing vaccine for export after domestic use is 
discontinued.     
 
D.  Biosecurity Issues 
As previously stated, Brucella abortus is currently classified as a select agent and the vaccine 
strains (RB-51 and Strain 19) are excluded from the select agent regulations.  This is not 
expected to change.   If additional vaccine strains are developed, it is expected that they, too, 
would be excluded from regulation if data are available to show that the new strain is not a 
severe threat to human health. 
 
No decision has been made to classify PRV as a select agent.  There are reasonable arguments 
for and against adding PRV to the select agent list.  On one hand, at some point PRV will be 
eradicated and there is a reasonable expectation on the part of producer groups that APHIS will 
implement some controls to prevent misuse or unintended release of the virus from facilities that 
could cause an outbreak.  Placing the virus on the select agent list would provide a mechanism 
for APHIS to control possession and use of the virus.  On the other hand, PRV does not appear to 
meet the criteria used to place other agents on the select agent list.  The virus

 controls to prevent misuse or unintended release of the virus from facilities that 
could cause an outbreak.  Placing the virus on the select agent list would provide a mechanism 
for APHIS to control possession and use of the virus.  On the other hand, PRV does not appear to 
meet the criteria used to place other agents on the select agent list.  The virus is not a threat to 
human health.  Pseudorabies is primarily a disease of newborn pigs; it does not cause devastating 
disease in all ages of swine.  Therefore, the virus is unlikely to be used as a terror threat. 
Vaccines and diagnostics are available to control outbreaks. In addition, no documented reports 
of accidental release from a research, diagnostic, or manufacturing facility causing an outbreak 
in swine, indicate that standard biosecurity procedures are adequate for PRV. 
 
If PRV is classified as a select agent, it is reasonable to assume that the gene-deleted vaccine 
strains would be excluded from the regulations because they pose no threat to human or animal 
health. 
 
A decision to classify PRV as a select agent could be made when the disease is declared 
eradicated from domestic swine or at some time in the future after the virus is eliminated from 
feral swine populations.

E.  Wildlife Issues 
The National Animal Disease Center and APHIS VS are conducting a study to evaluate a 
genetically engineered RB-51 vaccine strain that may prove more efficacious in elk.  While it 
appears theoretically possible to eradicate brucellosis from wildlife, the effort is expected to take 
many years.

appears theoretically possible to eradicate brucellosis from wildlife, the effort is expected to take 
many years.     
 
Eradication of pseudorabies in swine is more problematic.  Because of the difficulty in catching 
and restraining feral swine, there is a need to develop an oral PRV vaccine delivery method that 
is effective and environmentally safe.  It may be decades before commercial swine operations are 
free from the risk of outbreaks from feral swine. 
 
Measures that keep the wildlife (and feral animals) separate and apart from domestic livestock 
will continue until eradication of brucellosis and pseudorabies from these reservoirs is 
accomplished.  If eradication of brucellosis and/or pseudorabies from these reservoirs is not 
deemed feasible, measures that keep the wildlife (and feral animals) separate and apart from 
domestic livestock must continue indefinitely and be included as part of the state’s disease 
management program. 
 
F.  Domestic Production of Brucellosis and Pseudorabies Vaccines after Eradication 
To meet the need for some level of biologics use, APHIS will consider allowing biologics 
manufacturers to continue, with certain stipulations to ensure biosecurity, to manufacture 
products for prevention and diagnosis of Brucella abortus and PRV after eradication in domestic 
animals in the United States has been accomplished.  This would provide continued availability 
of licensed biologics in the event of a disease outbreak without presenting significant risk to the 
animal or human populations, and without significantly affecting the manufacturers’ desire to
