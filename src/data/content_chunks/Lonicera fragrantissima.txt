Overview
Appearance
Lonicera fragrantissima
is a multi-stemmed, upright, deciduous (evergreen in the South) shrub that grows from 6-10 ft. (1.8-3 m) tall. The stems are solid and continuous, white pith, has stringy, tan bark and are often purple when young.
Foliage
Leaves are opposite, round, 1-3 in. (2.5-7.6 cm) long and wide and usually persist into winter.
Flowers
Flowering occurs in the late winter, when fragrant, tubular, 0.5 in. (1.5 cm) long, white to red or yellow, thin-petaled flowers develop in pairs in the leaf axils.
Fruit
The abundant berries are 0.3 in. (8.5 mm) in diameter and ripen to orange or red in the mid-summer and often persist throughout winter.
Ecological Threat
Several species of exotic bush honeysuckles occur and distinguishing different species can be difficult. However, all have similar effects.
Lonicera fragrantissima
readily invades open woodlands, old fields and other disturbed sites. Its rapid spread is attributed to birds and mammals dispersing the seeds. It can form a dense understory thicket which can restrict native plant growth and tree seedling establishment.
Lonicera fragrantissima
is native to eastern Asia and was first introduced into North America in the late 1800s. It has been planted widely as an ornamental and for wildlife food and cover.
