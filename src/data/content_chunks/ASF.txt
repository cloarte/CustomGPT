Introduction 
This document provides a brief overview of the new ASF Response Plan: The Red Book (April 2020). The ASF Response Plan provides 
the best known strategic guidance for USDA APHIS and responders at all levels in the event of an ASF outbreak occurring in 
domestic or feral swine. Please see the full ASF Response Plan for further information, located at www.aphis.usda.gov/fadprep.  
 Goals of a ASF Response 
The goals of an ASF response are to 
1. detect, control, and contain ASF in swine as quickly as possible; 
2. eradicate ASF using strategies that seek to stabilize animal agriculture, the food 
supply, the economy, and to protect public health and the environment ; and 
3. provide science- and risk-based approaches and systems to facilitate con�nuity of 
business for non-infected animals and non-contaminated animal products. 
Achieving these three goals will allow individual swine facilities, States, Tribes, regions, and industries to resume normal production 
as quickly as possible. The objective is to allow the United States to regain disease-free status without the response effort causing 
more disruption and damage than the disease outbreak itself.

 The objective is to allow the United States to regain disease-free status without the response effort causing 
more disruption and damage than the disease outbreak itself.  
Four Epidemiological Principals of Response 
Four basic epidemiological principles form the foundation to contain, control, and eradicate ASF in the U.S. swine population: 
1. Prevent contact between ASF virus (ASFV) and swine. This is accomplished through  
a. quaran�ne of infected swine and movement controls in the Control Area (Infected Zone [IZ] + Buﬀer Zone [BZ]),  
b. u�liza�on of Network-Based Controls (NBCs), and 
c. enhanced biosecurity procedures that include preven�ng contact between feral swine and domes�c swine.  
2. Stop the production of ASFV by infected or exposed swine. This is accomplished by mass depopula�on (and disposal) of 
infected and poten�ally infected swine; priori�za�on may increase eﬀec�veness.  
3. Stop the transmission of ASFV by vectors. 
4. Prevent ASFV from becoming established in feral swine populations. 
Response Strategies 
The United States’ primary control and eradication strategy for ASF in swine is the establishment of quarantines and movement 
controls with eradication by stamping-out. There is currently no effective vaccine available for ASFV in domestic swine. APHIS 
acknowledges that there may be significant challenges to eradicate ASF, depending on the outbreak (e.g., if feral swine are 
infected). The following table provides an overview of the primary response strategies for both domestic and feral swine.

Authorization for Response Activities 
When the criteria for a presumptive positive ASF case have been met, the APHIS Administrator or VS Deputy Administrator can 
authorize APHIS personnel—in conjunction with State, Tribal, and unified Incident Command personnel—to initiate certain 
response activities of the index case (Infected Premises or Infected Pig), including an epidemiological investigation of Contact 
Premises.  
Upon ASFV confirmation by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, the 
Secretary of Agriculture will 
 take immediate steps to declare an Extraordinary Emergency;  
 issue a National Movement Standstill of at least 72 hours with a detec tion in domestic or feral swine; 
 authorize depopulation of Infected Premises; and 
 authorize payment for virus elimination at a uniform, flat rate, based on the size of the affected premises.

Coordinated Public Awareness Campaign 
In an ASF outbreak, a public awareness campaign must be effectively coordinated with audience -appropriate information both 
created and distributed. This supports the response strategy by 
 engaging and leveraging stakeholder relationships to provide unified public messages for all audiences;  
 addressing the issues and concerns relating to food safety, public health, and anim al welfare; 
 addressing issues and concerns related to interstate commerce, continuity of business, and international trade; and 
 widely disseminating key communication messages to consumers and producers.  
Movement Controls 
A temporary hold order, a quarantine and/or some type of stop movement will be immediately issued on a premises by State 
authority, or Tribal authority, upon strong suspicion of ASF on a premises. Each State’s animal health emergency response plan 
should describe implementation along with considerations for the highly -integrated swine industry.  
National Movement Standstill 
A National Movement Standstill is a complete stop in live swine movement across the United States. It 
is intended to allow States, Tribes, and industry to gather initial critical information for a unified 
approach to an ASF response, while inhibiting further virus transmission before effective disease 
control measures can be successfully implemented. A National Movement Standstill  
 is issued by USDA upon confirmation of ASF in commercial swine for at least 72 hours, 
 is effective only if all parties involved understand the reasons and goals, and have planned for it.

Network Based Controls 
Network Based Controls (NBCs) are designed to be used in combination with traditional Control Areas to assist in limiting the  
spread of ASFV. NBCs will target response resources to high risk epidemiologically -linked premises in an effort to rapidly detect new 
cases. All premises that are tracked/linked to an Infected Premises are subject to Control Area restrictions and diagnostic t esting.  
What Else Will Occur During an ASF Response? 
Critical activities and tools must be implemented to execute and support any response strategy. These activities and tools must 
support a science- and risk-based approach that protects public health, animal health, the environment, and stabilizes animal 
agriculture and the economy. Some of the critical activities that will be employed are as follows:

 Surveillance 
 Epidemiological Investigation and Tracing 
 Quarantine and Movement Control 
 Continuity of Business (Secure Pork Supply Plan) 
 Information Management 
 Public Communication and Messaging Campaign 
 Health and Safety 
 Biosecurity 
 3D (Depopulation, Disposal, Decontamination) Activities 
 Wildlife Management & Vector Control
