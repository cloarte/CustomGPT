1. Reagent Name: Clostridium chauvoei Flagella-specific (7D11/YD7) Monoclonal 
Antibody (MAb) 
2. Strain or Source: 7D11 and YD7 hybridomas 
3. Lot Number: IRP 608 
4. Fill Date: January 23, 2014 
5. Expiration Date: April 30, 2026 
6. Intended Use: IRP 608 is for use in a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) as described in CVB-PRO-0005, Potency Testing of Clostridium chauvoei Bacterins 
using an ELISA Procedure for potency testing of C. chauvoei bacterins. 
7. Instructions for Use: The MAb murine ascites fluid is provided undiluted in 100 µL 
amounts. For use in the ELISA, the ascites fluid should be diluted approximately 1:1000 in 
carbonate coating buffer. For detailed instructions see CVB-PRO-0005. 
8. Test of Reagent: 
Signal to Noise test – This was conducted to determine the optimum use dilution for this reagent. 
The specificity of the MAb was demonstrated by ELISA using partially purified C. chauvoei 
flagella and whole cell antigens of Clostridium haemolyticum, Clostridium perfringens, and 
other clostridial species. 
Precautions: There

 determine the optimum use dilution for this reagent. 
The specificity of the MAb was demonstrated by ELISA using partially purified C. chauvoei 
flagella and whole cell antigens of Clostridium haemolyticum, Clostridium perfringens, and 
other clostridial species. 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
Sterility test – This reagent was tested for sterility and found to be free of viable bacteria and 
fungi. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 100 µL aliquots in 0.5 mL screw cap plastic 
vials. 
10. Storage Conditions: Store at -20°C or lower. Once the ascites fluid has been thawed, 
store at 2°- 7ºC.
