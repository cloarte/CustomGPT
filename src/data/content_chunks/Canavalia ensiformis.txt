This bean is grown in Southern U.S. mainly for stock feed, but young pods canbe used as snap beans. The plant is vining. Pods reach 10 to 14 inches inlength, but are harvested at half that size for eating. Seeds are large, 1/2 to3/4 inch long, and nearly as broad, and are sometimes used as coffeesubstitute. jack beans are not grown as a commercial food crop in thiscountry.
