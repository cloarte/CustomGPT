 Invasion: Xanthomonas phaseolipv.phaseoliandXanthomonas citripv.fuscans(Xpp-Xcf) are non-spore-forming, Gram-negative aerobic bacteria. They are rod-shaped with a single polar flagellum (Bradbury, 1986).Darrasse et al. (2013), however, isolatedXanthomonas citripv.fuscansvariants that were non-motile. Colonies are yellow, convex and slimy on glucose-containing media. The slimy appearance is due to the production of an extracellular polysaccharide, xanthan gum, on media containing glucose. Thefuscansvariety can be distinguished by the production of a dark-brown diffusible pigment in media containing tyrosine and certain other media. The non-fuscous strains can also produce low levels of diffusible brown pigments if high levels of tyrosine are added to the culture media (Goodwin and Sopher, 1994a).

 Reproduccion: Sources of inoculum Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. phaseoli and X. citri pv. fuscans (Xpp-Xcf) can survive in seed, infected plant debris and epiphytically on host and non-host plants ( Saettler, 1991 ; Karavina et al., 2011 ). Infection of flower buds and young pods can result in the transmission of Xpp-Xcf through the vascular system to the seed, leading to internal infection ( Aggour et al., 1989 ). Infected crop residues and other susceptible hosts are also sources of inoculum for Xpp-Xcf ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ; Khlaif and Qadous, 1995 ). Conflicting reports exist on the ability of Xpp-Xcf to survive in infested soil and plant debris ( Schuster and Coyne, 1976 ; Saettler et al., 1986 ; Gilbertson et al., 1990 ). Gilbertson et al. (1990) found that Xpp-Xcf populations overwinter in bean debris on no-tillage plots. Non-pathogenic pectolytic strains of X. campestris were also consistently isolated. Experiments conducted in the Dominican Republic indicated that Xpp-Xcf survived up to 7 months on infected debris on the soil surface, but not in buried debris after 30 days ( Arnaud-Santana et al., 1991 ). Xpp-Xcf survival studies conducted over 10 years in Michigan indicated that infected crop debris is not the primary inoculum source for CBB ( Saettler et al., 1986 ). Infected bean debris may be more important as an inoculum source in tropical and sub-tropical than in temperate areas (

 debris after 30 days ( Arnaud-Santana et al., 1991 ). Xpp-Xcf survival studies conducted over 10 years in Michigan indicated that infected crop debris is not the primary inoculum source for CBB ( Saettler et al., 1986 ). Infected bean debris may be more important as an inoculum source in tropical and sub-tropical than in temperate areas ( Gilbertson et al., 1990 ) and in warmer climates where several susceptible crops can be planted in 1 year ( Saettler, 1989 ). However, Xpp-Xcf populations will drop sharply in plant debris as other micro-organisms colonize and break down the material ( Saettler, 1991 ). If infected bean debris is tilled into the soil, it will greatly increase the rate of decay of the tissue and enhance the decline in Xpp-Xcf populations since it appears to be unable to survive for long in soil as free bacteria. Xpp-Xcf can grow on the surface of both host and non-host plants ( Cafati and Saettler, 1980a ). Growth on host-plant surfaces may provide a sizeable population with the potential to infect under appropriate conditions. The importance of epiphytic populations on non-host plants is not clear. Karavina et al. (2011) isolated epiphytic pathogen populations from Amaranthus hybridus and Zea mays that were pathogenic which may have an influence in a bean-maize rotation system. Xpp-Xcf also survives on weeds and other host plants (Cafati and Saettler, 1980a; Angeles-Ramos et al., 1991 ; Opio et al., 1995 ). Certain weed species may harbour the pathogen for up to 6 months ( Opio et al., 1995 ). Angeles-Ramos et al.

ati and Saettler, 1980a; Angeles-Ramos et al., 1991 ; Opio et al., 1995 ). Certain weed species may harbour the pathogen for up to 6 months ( Opio et al., 1995 ). Angeles-Ramos et al. (1991) isolated epiphytic, pectolytic xanthomonads from symptomless weeds but found that weeds may not be an important source of Xpp-Xcf inoculum because the pectolytic xanthomonads isolated were non-pathogenic to beans. Survival of Xpp-Xcf is greater under dry conditions ( Schuster and Coyne, 1977 ) as bacteria decline rapidly under moist conditions ( Allen et al., 1998 ). Sabet and Ishag (1969) reported that Xpp-Xcf survived in press-dried bean leaves for more than 18 months in the laboratory, while Gilbertson et al. (1988) found X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli [ X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli ] to remain viable in dry-leaf inoculum after 6 years. The longer survival under laboratory conditions as opposed to that in the field could be attributed to the presence of antagonists, such as protozoa, in the soil ( Habte and Alexander, 1975 ). Epiphytic colonies survive on a wide range of plant species in the families Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Commelinaceae, Oxalidaceae, Poaceae and Portulacaeae, in addition to various legumes ( Allen et al., 1998 ). Epiphytic Xpp-Xcf populations are important in the epidemiology of CBB on dry beans ( Ishimaru et al., 1991 ) and are differentially affected in hosts of different genotypes ( Cafati and Saettler, 1980b ).

., 1998 ). Epiphytic Xpp-Xcf populations are important in the epidemiology of CBB on dry beans ( Ishimaru et al., 1991 ) and are differentially affected in hosts of different genotypes ( Cafati and Saettler, 1980b ). Infection Epiphytic growth of Xpp-Xcf on the plant surface usually represents the asymptomatic phase, prior to infection. These epiphytic populations are clustered in biofilms that offer protection against stresses and stimulate growth ( Jacques et al., 2005 ). As soon as the environmental conditions are favourable, the bacteria penetrate the host tissue through openings such as stomata, hydathodes or wounds due to hail or insect feeding. Once inside the plant, Xpp-Xcf multiplies rapidly in the intercellular spaces, and it can take as little as 10-14 days from initial infection until secondary spread occurs ( Saettler, 1991 ). The optimal temperatures for disease development are 28-32°C with relative humidity above 80% ( Saettler, 1989 ; Chen et al., 2021 ). Relatively high populations, 100,000 to 1,000,000 c.f.u./g of host tissue, are required before symptoms become visible ( Gilbertson and Maxwell, 1992 ). Plants appear to be more susceptible in the reproductive stage than in the vegetative stage. As the bacterial population increases, it can ooze onto the leaf surface and be spread further by water. The polysaccharide covering of the bacteria helps to prevent desiccation ( Wilson et al., 1965 ; Büttner and Bonas, 2010 ) and may assist the bacteria to attach to plant surfaces. The bacteria can also enter the vascular system of many varieties of beans and then spread systemically in the plant ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ). Wilting can result from vascular infection. Bacteria in the vascular system can also enter the developing pods and pass into the

The bacteria can also enter the vascular system of many varieties of beans and then spread systemically in the plant ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ). Wilting can result from vascular infection. Bacteria in the vascular system can also enter the developing pods and pass into the seeds ( Aggour et al., 1989 ). Transmission Primary spread of Xpp-Xcf usually occurs when planting infected seed. Plants grown from infected seed usually show lesions on the cotyledon or primary leaves ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ). Bacteria in lesions, infected plant debris and epiphytic populations can be spread by splashing or wind-blown rain. Overhead irrigation can be very effective in secondary spread of the bacteria. Surface irrigation water may also spread the bacteria ( Steadman et al., 1975 ). Xpp-Xcf can be disseminated on the bodies of insects, such as Diaprepes abbreviatus and Cerotoma ruficornis , which may create wounds by feeding, thus producing favourable sites for infection ( Kaiser and Vakili, 1978 ). Whiteflies ( Bemisia tabaci ), grasshoppers ( Melanoplus sp.), Mexican bean beetles ( Epilachna varivestis ) and leaf miners have been reported to transmit Xpp-Xcf ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ; Sabet and Ishag, 1969 ). Long distance spread of CBB can result from humans transporting and exchanging infected seed ( Chen et al., 2021 ).

 Sintomas: Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. phaseoli and X. citri pv. fuscans (Xpp-Xcf) produces identical symptoms on leaves, pods, stems and seeds and causes similar damage. Small water-soaked spots are the first symptoms observed on leaves and appear within 4 to 10 days after infection. These spots enlarge and the centre turns necrotic and brown. Areas around the lesion may become flaccid ( Goodwin and Sopher, 1994b ), and severe infections can cause defoliation and plant death ( Chen et al., 2021 ). The lesion is surrounded by a narrow band of bright yellow tissue. However, yellowed tissue is occasionally absent. Stem infection is less common. It begins as a water-soaked spot, which becomes a reddish-brown lesion, usually without chlorosis. Stem girdling may develop at the cotyledonary node. The bacteria can invade the xylem, and wilting may occur if sufficient bacterial numbers develop in the xylem. Pod lesions begin as water-soaked spots which become sunken and dark to red brown. Under humid conditions, a yellowish bacterial ooze will develop from the lesion. Severely infected seed may be shrivelled and show poor germination or produce weakened plants. On white-seeded varieties, yellow or brown spots may appear on the seed coat, particularly near the hilum area. On dark-seeded varieties, this discolouration is not visible. Infected seeds may also be symptomless ( Yoshii, 1980 ).

 Reproduccion: Sources of inoculum Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. phaseoli and X. citri pv. fuscans (Xpp-Xcf) can survive in seed, infected plant debris and epiphytically on host and non-host plants ( Saettler, 1991 ; Karavina et al., 2011 ). Infection of flower buds and young pods can result in the transmission of Xpp-Xcf through the vascular system to the seed, leading to internal infection ( Aggour et al., 1989 ). Infected crop residues and other susceptible hosts are also sources of inoculum for Xpp-Xcf ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ; Khlaif and Qadous, 1995 ). Conflicting reports exist on the ability of Xpp-Xcf to survive in infested soil and plant debris ( Schuster and Coyne, 1976 ; Saettler et al., 1986 ; Gilbertson et al., 1990 ). Gilbertson et al. (1990) found that Xpp-Xcf populations overwinter in bean debris on no-tillage plots. Non-pathogenic pectolytic strains of X. campestris were also consistently isolated. Experiments conducted in the Dominican Republic indicated that Xpp-Xcf survived up to 7 months on infected debris on the soil surface, but not in buried debris after 30 days ( Arnaud-Santana et al., 1991 ). Xpp-Xcf survival studies conducted over 10 years in Michigan indicated that infected crop debris is not the primary inoculum source for CBB ( Saettler et al., 1986 ). Infected bean debris may be more important as an inoculum source in tropical and sub-tropical than in temperate areas (

Xpp-Xcf survival studies conducted over 10 years in Michigan indicated that infected crop debris is not the primary inoculum source for CBB ( Saettler et al., 1986 ). Infected bean debris may be more important as an inoculum source in tropical and sub-tropical than in temperate areas ( Gilbertson et al., 1990 ) and in warmer climates where several susceptible crops can be planted in 1 year ( Saettler, 1989 ). However, Xpp-Xcf populations will drop sharply in plant debris as other micro-organisms colonize and break down the material ( Saettler, 1991 ). If infected bean debris is tilled into the soil, it will greatly increase the rate of decay of the tissue and enhance the decline in Xpp-Xcf populations since it appears to be unable to survive for long in soil as free bacteria. Xpp-Xcf can grow on the surface of both host and non-host plants ( Cafati and Saettler, 1980a ). Growth on host-plant surfaces may provide a sizeable population with the potential to infect under appropriate conditions. The importance of epiphytic populations on non-host plants is not clear. Karavina et al. (2011) isolated epiphytic pathogen populations from Amaranthus hybridus and Zea mays that were pathogenic which may have an influence in a bean-maize rotation system. Xpp-Xcf also survives on weeds and other host plants (Cafati and Saettler, 1980a; Angeles-Ramos et al., 1991 ; Opio et al., 1995 ). Certain weed species may harbour the pathogen for up to 6 months ( Opio et al., 1995 ). Angeles-Ramos et al.

(1991) isolated epiphytic, pectolytic xanthomonads from symptomless weeds but found that weeds may not be an important source of Xpp-Xcf inoculum because the pectolytic xanthomonads isolated were non-pathogenic to beans. Survival of Xpp-Xcf is greater under dry conditions ( Schuster and Coyne, 1977 ) as bacteria decline rapidly under moist conditions ( Allen et al., 1998 ). Sabet and Ishag (1969) reported that Xpp-Xcf survived in press-dried bean leaves for more than 18 months in the laboratory, while Gilbertson et al. (1988) found X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli [ X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli ] to remain viable in dry-leaf inoculum after 6 years. The longer survival under laboratory conditions as opposed to that in the field could be attributed to the presence of antagonists, such as protozoa, in the soil ( Habte and Alexander, 1975 ). Epiphytic colonies survive on a wide range of plant species in the families Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Commelinaceae, Oxalidaceae, Poaceae and Portulacaeae, in addition to various legumes ( Allen et al., 1998 ). Epiphytic Xpp-Xcf populations are important in the epidemiology of CBB on dry beans ( Ishimaru et al., 1991 ) and are differentially affected in hosts of different genotypes ( Cafati and Saettler, 1980b ).

Epiphytic Xpp-Xcf populations are important in the epidemiology of CBB on dry beans ( Ishimaru et al., 1991 ) and are differentially affected in hosts of different genotypes ( Cafati and Saettler, 1980b ). Infection Epiphytic growth of Xpp-Xcf on the plant surface usually represents the asymptomatic phase, prior to infection. These epiphytic populations are clustered in biofilms that offer protection against stresses and stimulate growth ( Jacques et al., 2005 ). As soon as the environmental conditions are favourable, the bacteria penetrate the host tissue through openings such as stomata, hydathodes or wounds due to hail or insect feeding. Once inside the plant, Xpp-Xcf multiplies rapidly in the intercellular spaces, and it can take as little as 10-14 days from initial infection until secondary spread occurs ( Saettler, 1991 ). The optimal temperatures for disease development are 28-32°C with relative humidity above 80% ( Saettler, 1989 ; Chen et al., 2021 ). Relatively high populations, 100,000 to 1,000,000 c.f.u./g of host tissue, are required before symptoms become visible ( Gilbertson and Maxwell, 1992 ). Plants appear to be more susceptible in the reproductive stage than in the vegetative stage. As the bacterial population increases, it can ooze onto the leaf surface and be spread further by water. The polysaccharide covering of the bacteria helps to prevent desiccation ( Wilson et al., 1965 ; Büttner and Bonas, 2010 ) and may assist the bacteria to attach to plant surfaces. The bacteria can also enter the vascular system of many varieties of beans and then spread systemically in the plant ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ). Wilting can result from vascular infection. Bacteria in the vascular system can also enter the developing pods and pass into the

The bacteria can also enter the vascular system of many varieties of beans and then spread systemically in the plant ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ). Wilting can result from vascular infection. Bacteria in the vascular system can also enter the developing pods and pass into the seeds ( Aggour et al., 1989 ). Transmission Primary spread of Xpp-Xcf usually occurs when planting infected seed. Plants grown from infected seed usually show lesions on the cotyledon or primary leaves ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ). Bacteria in lesions, infected plant debris and epiphytic populations can be spread by splashing or wind-blown rain. Overhead irrigation can be very effective in secondary spread of the bacteria. Surface irrigation water may also spread the bacteria ( Steadman et al., 1975 ). Xpp-Xcf can be disseminated on the bodies of insects, such as Diaprepes abbreviatus and Cerotoma ruficornis , which may create wounds by feeding, thus producing favourable sites for infection ( Kaiser and Vakili, 1978 ). Whiteflies ( Bemisia tabaci ), grasshoppers ( Melanoplus sp.), Mexican bean beetles ( Epilachna varivestis ) and leaf miners have been reported to transmit Xpp-Xcf ( Zaumeyer and Thomas, 1957 ; Sabet and Ishag, 1969 ). Long distance spread of CBB can result from humans transporting and exchanging infected seed ( Chen et al., 2021 ).

 Sintomas: Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. phaseoli and X. citri pv. fuscans (Xpp-Xcf) produces identical symptoms on leaves, pods, stems and seeds and causes similar damage. Small water-soaked spots are the first symptoms observed on leaves and appear within 4 to 10 days after infection. These spots enlarge and the centre turns necrotic and brown. Areas around the lesion may become flaccid ( Goodwin and Sopher, 1994b ), and severe infections can cause defoliation and plant death ( Chen et al., 2021 ). The lesion is surrounded by a narrow band of bright yellow tissue. However, yellowed tissue is occasionally absent. Stem infection is less common. It begins as a water-soaked spot, which becomes a reddish-brown lesion, usually without chlorosis. Stem girdling may develop at the cotyledonary node. The bacteria can invade the xylem, and wilting may occur if sufficient bacterial numbers develop in the xylem. Pod lesions begin as water-soaked spots which become sunken and dark to red brown. Under humid conditions, a yellowish bacterial ooze will develop from the lesion. Severely infected seed may be shrivelled and show poor germination or produce weakened plants. On white-seeded varieties, yellow or brown spots may appear on the seed coat, particularly near the hilum area. On dark-seeded varieties, this discolouration is not visible. Infected seeds may also be symptomless ( Yoshii, 1980 ).
