Purpose of the Khapra Beetle Program Manual
The APHIS PPQ Khapra Beetle Program Manual is intended to provide 
information to guide PPQ Field Operations and cooperators in the following 
areas:
Survey and sampling to detect isolated infestations at low population 
levels
Eradication efforts on isolated infestations
Prevention of human assisted spread of khapra beetle to non-infested 
areas
Background
The khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium Everts (Coleoptera: Dermestidae), 
is a destructive pest of grain, seeds, and stored food products. Additionally, 
food products infested by khapra beetle pose a threat to humans as hairs and 
cast skins from larvae are known allergens and a respiratory hazard. Originally 
native to the Indian subcontinent, it has expanded into other parts of Asia, 
Africa, and Europe. Khapra beetle and associated host material are regulated 
by the USDA under authority of 7 CFR 319.75. While khapra beetle is no t 
known to occur in the United States, interceptions at ports of entry are common 
and the pest risk potential of khapra beetle is high. If khapra beetle were to 
become established in the United States, it

ra beetle and associated host material are regulated 
by the USDA under authority of 7 CFR 319.75. While khapra beetle is no t 
known to occur in the United States, interceptions at ports of entry are common 
and the pest risk potential of khapra beetle is high. If khapra beetle were to 
become established in the United States, it would pose a significant threat to 
the domestic grain industry in terms of yield losses, but more consequentially it 
would impact the $10+ billion United States grain export market. The goal of 
routine survey efforts is to monitor high risk areas for detection of isolated 
populations to help ensure the United States remains free from khapra beetle.
Biology and Ecology
Lifecycle
Khapra beetle has four life stages; egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Females may lay 
up to 100 eggs during their lifetime. Eggs are very small and translucent, 
making them difficult to detect. Eggs usually hatch in 3-10 days, depending on 
temperature and humidity.
Khapra beetle spends most of its life in the larval stage and nearly all of its 
feeding occurs during this stage. The number of larval instars is indeterminate, 
as development is influenced by temperature, food availability, and crowding. 
Under favorable conditions, the larval period is 20-40 days. However, khapra 
beetle frequently enter dormancy during later stages of larval development.

During dormancy, development is paused in response to adverse conditions 
such as overcrowding, low temperature, low food quality, and/or lack of food.

Introduction
Biology and Ecology

During dormancy, development is paused in response to adverse conditions 
such as overcrowding, low temperature, low food quality, and/or lack of food. 
The dormancy of khapra beetle larvae is usually referred to as a facultative 
diapause, where molting and feeding occur sporadically, but development to 
the pupal stage does not occur. In the absence of food, diapausing larvae have 
been observed to survive for several years.
The pupation period usually lasts 4-6 days. The adult is short lived, typically 
for 1-2 weeks. One to ten generations of khapra beetle may occur per year. 
Under favorable conditions, khapra beetle can complete development in as 
little as 26 days. Under less favorable conditions, diapause in the late larval 
stage is common though larvae may resume development and pupate when 
favorable conditions return.
Khapra beetle is best suited to hot and dry climates, but they are tolerant of 
both extreme cold and heat. Optimal temperature for development is around 
30 °C. At temperatures below 20 °C or above 35 °C development is halted. 
Khapra beetle endures adverse conditions as late stage larvae in diapause. 
Diapausing larvae are less susceptible to fumigation treatments due to reduced 
metabolic activity. They can also be difficult to control with contact 
insecticides as they frequently seek refuge in cracks or crevices that are hard to 
reach.
Infestations
Khapra beetles live in stored grains and other plant and animal products. Hairy 
larval skins (exuviae) found in grain can indicate that there is

metabolic activity. They can also be difficult to control with contact 
insecticides as they frequently seek refuge in cracks or crevices that are hard to 
reach.
Infestations
Khapra beetles live in stored grains and other plant and animal products. Hairy 
larval skins (exuviae) found in grain can indicate that there is an infestation. 
Live insects are usually in the top 50 cm of the grain pile. Larvae tend to 
aggregate in cracks, corners, and other tight spaces in storage facilities, 
shipping containers, or other structures without large available food sources.
Khapra beetles can feed on a wide variety of dried plant and animal products. 
This includes important commercially traded grains and other commodities 
such as wheat, barley, rice, peanut, cowpea, dried distillers grain, and sorghum. 
Khapra beetles may also feed on processed products such as dog food, protein 
drink mix, ground grains, tapioca, dried fruits, pasta, and cereal among others. 
Animal products like powdered milk, dried blood, dried animal skins, and fish 
meal are also known to serve as food sources.
Khapra beetle population growth is dependent upon host food, as well as 
environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) and crowding. Larval 
development is usually faster when foods with higher protein content are 
available. For example, population growth is typically higher on wheat 
compared to barley or rice. Similarly, processed foods such as dog food or 
protein shake mix can provide excellent food sources for khapra beetle.

Introduction
Pathways of Introduction and Dispersal
1-4 Khapra Beetle Program Manual  05/2023-02
Pathways of Introduction and Dispersal
Khapra beetle has been intercepted at ports of entry in mail, stores, general 
cargo, and permit cargo; however, the majority are found in passenger 
baggage. In recent years, the number of detections of khapra beetle has 
increased, prompting greater concern for the potential of establishment. This is 
due to an increase in the number of travelers from countries where khapra 
beetle is present, along with efforts to train inspectors and improve targeting of 
inspections. 
Khapra beetle adults are flightless, and the movement of adults and larvae is 
limited to short distances. Infestation of grain stores or other products from the 
surrounding environment is unlikely. Therefore, the spread of khapra beetle to 
new areas typically occurs through the movement of host commodities. Spread 
at a local level may occur on items such as bags, clothing, or in stored 
products. Over long distances, the pest is spread mostly by humans in 
commerce and trade, through household moves, and in personal baggage 
containing dried food products. Movement of grain and seed products or 
contaminated machinery can also spread khapra beetle. These infestations 
present the greatest risk for spread into the domestic grain supply where trade 
could be impacted.

Introduction
This chapter provides instruction on how to complete surveys for khapra 
beetle. Early detection surveys are necessary to find small khapra beetle 
populations in a timely manner. This ensures that PPQ is able to eradicate the 
infestation before khapra beetle becomes established locally and ensures trade 
is not impacted. Delimiting surveys are used to define the extent of infestation 
and to guide programmatic response. Monitoring surveys are used to determine 
if treatment is successful and to ensure that the location remains free of khapra 
beetle for an established amount of time after the initial find.
To ensure that khapra beetle surveys 1) detect early populations and 2) provide 
reliable negative survey data, it is critical that the surveyor follows the 
guidance in this chapter and the Identification chapter. This chapter provides 
guidance on how to properly plan and conduct a khapra beetle survey
.
Selecting Survey Locations
Use the following information to select the highest risk locations to survey in 
your state. Since staffing resources are often limited, you may need to rotate 
surveys through different locations each year.

Use locally available resources to assist you in identifying high risk sites of 
introduction/interception. Local PPQ Smuggling Interdiction and Trade 
Compliance (SITC) staff are a good resource to identify high risk products, as 
well as importers, distributors, and retailers in the area. Your local U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) contacts can assist with finding high 
risk locations as well. In addition, you may want to include locations that have 
received Emergency Action Notifications (EANs) for khapra beetle.
Use the following list as a starting point to identify areas of potential risk in 
your state in conjunction with the input from your local SITC and CBP 
counterparts:
A commercial location that is the known, intended destination for a 
shipment of host material that CBP found to be infested by live khapra 
beetle at the port of entry. Previous shipments from the same supplier are 
possible and may have entered without inspection.
Air cargo warehouses at international airports. These warehouses belong 
to individual airlines that service that airport. The warehouses often 
receive household goods and other materials that may be a pathway.
Coffee roasters that import coffee beans in used burlap bags from khapra 
beetle countries
Distribution warehouses for companies that sell high-risk merchandise
Express consignment facilities (DHL, FedEx, UPS, etc.) or other facilities 
where potentially infested materials may pass through
Grain dealers. If there is a known pathway for introduction of khapra 
beetle, or if in proximity to a known

Express consignment facilities (DHL, FedEx, UPS, etc.) or other facilities 
where potentially infested materials may pass through
Grain dealers. If there is a known pathway for introduction of khapra 
beetle, or if in proximity to a known or possible pathway, then these sites 
may be considered much higher risk.
Importers of brassware or other products from khapra beetle countries 
packaged in burlap bags
Importers of bulk grains and spices from khapra beetle countries. 
Importers who repackage these products within the warehouse for retail 
distribution are highest risk. Examples include but are not limited to dried 
chickpeas, cracked corn, cracked or bulghur wheat, and hibiscus.
Importers of manufactured, processed, or otherwise pre-packaged host 
material that is ready for retail sale from khapra beetle countries
Military facilities where returning luggage or household goods are stored
Retail markets selling materials outlined above
Transload facilities, locations where container cargo is transferred from 
one load unit to another. When a container is transloaded, it usually 
occurs at a facility that is close to a port terminal. A container will be 
taken into a facility and transferred to a domestic container or truckload.

Trap Placement
Survey a new facility with a company representative, if possible, to identify 
locations before placing traps. Check exit and entry areas, as well as any 
storage locations on the premises. Observe the movement of products, 
containers, and/or people handling products which could have been exposed to 
khapra beetle.
Be alert for cartons, burlap or jute sacks, debris, woodwork, cracks, loose 
plaster, loose paint, and other such hiding places. Carefully inspect rodent bait 
stations and other such traps with grain or cereal. Khapra beetle are attracted to 
dirty grain and storage or handling facilities; conversely, sanitary conditions 
are a deterrent. Areas of low light are also favorable for khapra beetle.
In empty bins and warehouses, larvae are likely to be in or on ledges, cracks in 
the floor or walls, old cartons, rags, sacks, newspapers, scrap lumber, or other 
debris. Elevator tunnels also serve as hiding places for khapra beetle larvae. 
When inspecting sacked material, the ears and seams of bags are common 
hiding places for the beetle and should be inspected. In bulk storage where 
heavy infestations may occur, larvae tend to congregate in the surface grain 
and on or near the walls. Look for cast larval skins as a sign of an active 
infestation.
When to Trap
Conduct surveys when average temperatures are above 70 ºF in the trapping 
environment. Survey outdoor areas throughout the warm season.

When to Trap
Conduct surveys when average temperatures are above 70 ºF in the trapping 
environment. Survey outdoor areas throughout the warm season. 
Environmental conditions may be less severe than prevailing weather 
conditions in areas immediately surrounding ports and grain processing and 
storage facilities. Use practical judgment to determine if temperatures are 
warm enough. In more temperate areas, conduct surveys from mid-May 
through mid-September. In heated warehouses, food storage and processing 
areas, dwellings, and other moderated environments, surveys with traps are 
appropriate at any time of year.
Trapping Supplies

complete a khapra beetle survey. The kit includes:
Six khapra beetle wall-mounted traps (Figure 2-1)
Seven khapra beetle pheromone lures (Figure 2-2)

One decoy sticky trap (Figure 2-5)
The wall mount traps may be re-used.
Use the decoy aerial trap to capture warehouse beetle, T
rogoderma variabile 
Ballion adults and minimize their numbers in khapra beetle wall traps. The 
warehouse beetle is often present in warehouses and it is difficult to distinguish 
between warehouse beetle and khapra beetle. Since both species are attracted 
to the same pheromone lure, warehouse beetles may overwhelm khapra beetle 
traps. However, since the warehouse beetle is a strong flyer, unlike khapra 
beetle, which does not fly, use the aerial decoy trap to minimize or exclude 
warehouse beetles collected in khapra beetle wall traps.
Fit the decoy aerial trap with one of the khapra beetle lures and hang it high in 
the open head space of the building. Use one aerial trap for every five to six 
khapra beetle wall-mounted traps.

Trap Set Up
Follow the instructions from the manufacturer that are included with the trap 
kit to assemble the traps. Use a permanent marker to label each trap with a 
unique identification number, for instance County Code-Facility Code-Trap 
Number. Use the wall mount trap inside and outside structures. Place traps 
around the inside of exterior walls and along interior walls of structures under 
investigation (Figure 2-6).

unique identification number, for instance County Code-Facility Code-Trap 
Number. Use the wall mount trap inside and outside structures. Place traps 
around the inside of exterior walls and along interior walls of structures under 
investigation (Figure 2-6). Pay special attention to cracks in the walls and 
walls made of porous materials like cement blocks. Cracks may serve as 
pathways for ins
ect movement. If possible, place a trap over a wall crack if one 
is found.
Clean the wall thoroughly before attaching the trap to the wall. An alcohol prep 
pad or paper towel soaked with ethanol works well to clean the wall. Allow the 
wall to dry before affixing the trap to the wall. You may use any locally 
available double-sided foam tape (Gorilla brand, 3M, double-sided foam tape, 
etc.). Duct tape does not work well for this purpose. Replacing the tape is often

necessary when servicing traps. Do not cover the entry holes on the back of the 
trap. Use an opened paper clip to open the side tabs, which may not be 
perforated completely. When attaching the trap to the wall, make sure that all 
four back entry tabs are in contact with the wall and that the trap is also 
attached loosely enough so that entry holes are not closed (Figure 2-7). These 
are the places where the larvae will enter the trap.

four back entry tabs are in contact with the wall and that the trap is also 
attached loosely enough so that entry holes are not closed (Figure 2-7). These 
are the places where the larvae will enter the trap.
Be aware that the trap adhesive or tape (if used) may remove some paint from 
walls when the trap or tape is removed. Let the facility know this. 
You may 
need to choose a less prominent location.
Fill the plastic collection tray with wheat germ (Figure 2-3). Fill the dish only 
1/4 to 1/3 full, being careful no
t to spill wheat germ in the trap, and keeping it 
vertically oriented after assembly through attachment to the wall.
Areas to Avoid
Areas exposed to human activities such as sweeping, foot traffic, or frequent 
use of mechanized equipment may lead to trap loss. Placement in very oily or 
damp locations will lead to trap damage or poor adhesion. Slippery surfaces, 
such as metal, plastic, glossy painted concrete, or glass walls may inhibit 
khapra beetle movement.
Height
Mount traps as low as possible to maximize captures. However, in most cases, 
to avoid trap loss from maintenance activities, mount the traps at least above 
broom height. Look for locations up to about 2 feet off the floor where they can 
be easily serviced.

Density
Allow 25 to 40 feet between traps or base the placement of traps on the layout 
of buildings. The more traps that are set, the greater the chance of finding 
khapra beetle, if present. However, if there are too many buildings and travel is 
a problem, half of the locations can be trapped in alternate years. This way, a 
building can be more intensively trapped, thus increasing the chances of 
finding khapra beetle.
Survey Supply Procurement
Order all traps and lures through the IPHIS Survey Supply Ordering System. 
Follow the national guidance for procuring traps and lures during the two 
ordering open periods each year. If you need immediate assistance, contact 
Laurie Morales at laurie.m.morales@usda.gov or 970-494-7535 or Darrell 
Bays at darrell.a.bays@usda.gov or 919-500-9959.
When ordering the trap kits, be sure to order additional lures so that you can 
change out the lures during the trapping season.

Trap Servicing and Sample Collection
Check traps every 1-2 weeks. When inspecting the trap, dump the contents of 
the plastic collection tray (including the wheat germ and any insects) into a 
resealable plastic bag. Inspect the trap for any other larvae that have not yet 
reached the collection tray. You can do this by tapping the tray into the plastic 
bag and using a fine paintbrush to dislodge any insects into the tray. Place a 
label on or inside each bag with a unique trap identification number, date of 
location, and facility name. Place the bag in a cooler with ice packs.
Refill the plastic collection tray with fresh wheat germ. Do not dispose of used 
wheat germ onsite. Even if there are no visible insects present in the wheat

When checking a trap for the last time and removing it, place the complete trap 
in a resealable plastic bag. Place a label inside the bag with a unique trap 
identification number, date, and facility name.
Before leaving each facility, wipe down any tubs or containers that you 
brought into the facility with a lab wipe or paper towel soaked with ethanol. 
Clean your boots and clothing well before traveling in the government owned 
vehicle to avoid tracking khapra beetle life stages to other locations.
Sample Preparation and Storage
Keep specimens as cool as possible. Transport samples back to the lab in a 
cooler. At the lab, if samples cannot be sorted and screened immediately, store 
the samples in a freezer. Place the entire plastic bag with the trap contents in 
the freezer. For samples taken from the last trap servicing of the season, freeze 
the entire trap inside a plastic bag. This will prevent sample degradation and 
also the potential for larvae or adults to escape into the lab. Larvae otherwise 
may degrade to the point where they are difficult to find within sweepings or 
food baits. Such precautions will also help with potential visual or molecular 
identification. 
Refer to the Identification chapter for instructions on sample sorting, sample 
screening, specimen routing, and taxonomic guidelines.

Introduction
This chapter provides guidance for individuals who will process trap 
collections and submit samples of suspected khapra beetles for identification. 
In addition, the chapter provides information for specimen routing and results 
reporting.
Sorting and Screening
Sort and screen trap collections before submitting specimens for identification. 
Sorting raw trap samples requires familiarity with insect groups and 
experience in examining specimens. Sorting is the first level of activity that 
assures samples submitted are of the correct target group of pests being 
surveyed. Sorting samples in a khapra beetle survey involves removal of non-
beetle specimens.
Screening is removing obvious beetle larvae or adults not fitting the general

 requires familiarity with insect groups and 
experience in examining specimens. Sorting is the first level of activity that 
assures samples submitted are of the correct target group of pests being 
surveyed. Sorting samples in a khapra beetle survey involves removal of non-
beetle specimens.
Screening is removing obvious beetle larvae or adults not fitting the general 
descriptions of dermestid or similar-looking beetle families. Screening in a 
khapra beetle survey involves removal of non-dermestid beetles before 
specimens are submitted to a PPQ Identifier.
Freeze samples according to the directions outlined in the Survey and Trapping 
Chapter
. Pour the frozen contents of the trap onto a lab tray. Remove wheat 
germ and other debris. Remove insects that are not beetles. To the best of your 
ability, remove any beetles that are not in the Dermestidae family. When in 
doubt, keep the insect in the final sample to be submitted.
NOTICE
Microscopes with 10X–15X magnification are recommended for sorting and
screening.

 trap is removed and replaced, such as during the last trap 
servicing of the season, thoroughly inspect for larvae that may be hidden 
inside. Gently dismantle the trap and inspect the corrugated cardboard and the 
entire interior of the trap. Khapra beetle larv
ae are attracted to the corrugated 
cardboard, and specimens may be found within the folds of the cardboard. 
Separate the corrugated cardboard to examine for larvae within the folds. Use a 
fine paintbrush to dislodge any insects from the cardboard. If the specimen is 
caught in adhesive, cut the insect out of the trap with scissors so that only a 
small piece of trap backing remains.
The following resources are useful guides for identification of suspect 
specimens from sorted or screened samples:
Dermestidae Adults Self-tutorial 
Dermestidae Larvae Self-tutorial 
If th
e trap was not previously frozen, place the entire trap in a freezer for 15 
days before disposal or reuse after the trap has been inspected. The majority of 
household freezers maintain temperatures from -9 °F to 0 °F.
Likewise, freeze any used wheat germ for 15 days before disposal, even if 
suspect specimens are not found.
Place insect larvae and adults in vials with non-denatured 95% or higher ethyl 
alcohol.
NOTICE
A small paintbrush moistened with alcohol is useful for moving suspect specimens 
from the sample to a vial without damaging the specimens.

Specimen Routing and Taxonomic Guidelines
Identification of dermestid beetle larvae or adults recovered from khapra beetle 
survey traps is difficult and requires specialized training. State or PPQ offices 
given the responsibility for this survey should consider the ability, experience, 
and expertise of those assigned to the various steps of sorting, screening, and 
identification of trap samples to ensure quality data is collected.
Qualified state, county, or cooperating university personnel can screen and 
perform tentative identification of suspected khapra beetle specimens. The 
specimens must be forwarded with a completed PPQ Form 391 to a PPQ 
domestic identifier. (Many PPQ port identifiers are skilled at identifying 
Trogoderma granarium, but their workloads normally do not allow processing 
of domestic samples). Suspect Trogoderma spp. going to a domestic identifier 
should be entered into the Agricultural Risk Management system (ARM) by 
those who have access. 
The domestic identifiers can also enter these records if 
necessary for samples going forward for final confirmation.
The domestic identifiers listed below will accept specimens for possible 
dissection, forwarding to the USDA Systematic Entomology Laboratory for 
final confirmation, and logging into the ARM database.

The domestic identifiers can also enter these records if 
necessary for samples going forward for final confirmation.
The domestic identifiers listed below will accept specimens for possible 
dissection, forwarding to the USDA Systematic Entomology Laboratory for 
final confirmation, and logging into the ARM database.
Before initiating delimiting surveys and/or control activities in the United 
States, a specialist recognized by USDA-APHIS-PPQ National Identification 
Services (NIS) must confirm the specimen is khapra beetle. All Trogoderma 
species that are not khapra beetle will be recorded as Trogoderma sp. (not T. 
granarium). All specimens that NIS morphologically confirm as khapra beetle 
collected during domestic surveys require molecular confirmation.
For confirmatory identification, follow the steps here: Request Official 
Confirmation of Preliminary Pest Identifications of Domestic Samples
Prior to each survey season (fall/winter), confirm by phone or email with the 
identifier that they have the capacity to process your sample(s). Include the 
following information:
Expected number of samples for the survey season
Name and email of person who will be submitting samples

Purpose of the Khapra Beetle Program Manual
The APHIS PPQ Khapra Beetle Program Manual is intended to provide 
information to guide PPQ Field Operations and cooperators in the following 
areas:
Survey and sampling to detect isolated infestations at low population 
levels
Eradication efforts on isolated infestations
Prevention of human assisted spread of khapra beetle to non-infested 
areas
Background
The khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium Everts (Coleoptera: Dermestidae), 
is a destructive pest of grain, seeds, and stored food products. Additionally, 
food products infested by khapra beetle pose a threat to humans as hairs and 
cast skins from larvae are known allergens and a respiratory hazard. Originally 
native to the Indian subcontinent, it has expanded into other parts of Asia, 
Africa, and Europe. Khapra beetle and associated host material are regulated 
by the USDA under authority of 7 CFR 319.75. While khapra beetle is no t 
known to occur in the United States, interceptions at ports of entry are common 
and the pest risk potential of khapra beetle is high. If khapra beetle were to 
become established in the United States, it

ra beetle and associated host material are regulated 
by the USDA under authority of 7 CFR 319.75. While khapra beetle is no t 
known to occur in the United States, interceptions at ports of entry are common 
and the pest risk potential of khapra beetle is high. If khapra beetle were to 
become established in the United States, it would pose a significant threat to 
the domestic grain industry in terms of yield losses, but more consequentially it 
would impact the $10+ billion United States grain export market. The goal of 
routine survey efforts is to monitor high risk areas for detection of isolated 
populations to help ensure the United States remains free from khapra beetle.
Biology and Ecology
Lifecycle
Khapra beetle has four life stages; egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Females may lay 
up to 100 eggs during their lifetime. Eggs are very small and translucent, 
making them difficult to detect. Eggs usually hatch in 3-10 days, depending on 
temperature and humidity.
Khapra beetle spends most of its life in the larval stage and nearly all of its 
feeding occurs during this stage. The number of larval instars is indeterminate, 
as development is influenced by temperature, food availability, and crowding. 
Under favorable conditions, the larval period is 20-40 days. However, khapra 
beetle frequently enter dormancy during later stages of larval development. 
Introduction
Biology and Ecology

During dormancy, development is paused in response to adverse conditions 
such as overcrowding, low temperature, low food quality, and/or lack of food. 
The dormancy of khapra beetle larvae is usually referred to as a

Introduction
Biology and Ecology
05/2023-02 Khapra Beetle Program Manual 1-3
During dormancy, development is paused in response to adverse conditions 
such as overcrowding, low temperature, low food quality, and/or lack of food. 
The dormancy of khapra beetle larvae is usually referred to as a facultative 
diapause, where molting and feeding occur sporadically, but development to 
the pupal stage does not occur. In the absence of food, diapausing larvae have 
been observed to survive for several years.
The pupation period usually lasts 4-6 days. The adult is short lived, typically 
for 1-2 weeks. One to ten generations of khapra beetle may occur per year. 
Under favorable conditions, khapra beetle can complete development in as 
little as 26 days. Under less favorable conditions, diapause in the late larval 
stage is common though larvae may resume development and pupate when 
favorable conditions return.
Khapra beetle is best suited to hot and dry climates, but they are tolerant of 
both extreme cold and heat. Optimal temperature for development is around 
30 °C. At temperatures below 20 °C or above 35 °C development is halted. 
Khapra beetle endures adverse conditions as late stage larvae in diapause. 
Diapausing larvae are less susceptible to fumigation treatments due to reduced 
metabolic activity. They can also be difficult to control with contact 
insecticides as they frequently seek refuge in cracks or crevices that are hard to 
reach.
Infestations
Khapra beetles live in stored grains and other plant and animal products. Hairy 
larval skins (exuviae) found in grain can indicate that there is

metabolic activity. They can also be difficult to control with contact 
insecticides as they frequently seek refuge in cracks or crevices that are hard to 
reach.
Infestations
Khapra beetles live in stored grains and other plant and animal products. Hairy 
larval skins (exuviae) found in grain can indicate that there is an infestation. 
Live insects are usually in the top 50 cm of the grain pile. Larvae tend to 
aggregate in cracks, corners, and other tight spaces in storage facilities, 
shipping containers, or other structures without large available food sources.
Khapra beetles can feed on a wide variety of dried plant and animal products. 
This includes important commercially traded grains and other commodities 
such as wheat, barley, rice, peanut, cowpea, dried distillers grain, and sorghum. 
Khapra beetles may also feed on processed products such as dog food, protein 
drink mix, ground grains, tapioca, dried fruits, pasta, and cereal among others. 
Animal products like powdered milk, dried blood, dried animal skins, and fish 
meal are also known to serve as food sources.
Khapra beetle population growth is dependent upon host food, as well as 
environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) and crowding. Larval 
development is usually faster when foods with higher protein content are 
available. For example, population growth is typically higher on wheat 
compared to barley or rice. Similarly, processed foods such as dog food or 
protein shake mix can provide excellent food sources for khapra beetle.

Introduction
Pathways of Introduction and Dispersal
1-4 Khapra Beetle Program Manual  05/2023-02
Pathways of Introduction and Dispersal
Khapra beetle has been intercepted at ports of entry in mail, stores, general 
cargo, and permit cargo; however, the majority are found in passenger 
baggage. In recent years, the number of detections of khapra beetle has 
increased, prompting greater concern for the potential of establishment. This is 
due to an increase in the number of travelers from countries where khapra 
beetle is present, along with efforts to train inspectors and improve targeting of 
inspections. 
Khapra beetle adults are flightless, and the movement of adults and larvae is 
limited to short distances. Infestation of grain stores or other products from the 
surrounding environment is unlikely. Therefore, the spread of khapra beetle to 
new areas typically occurs through the movement of host commodities. Spread 
at a local level may occur on items such as bags, clothing, or in stored 
products. Over long distances, the pest is spread mostly by humans in 
commerce and trade, through household moves, and in personal baggage 
containing dried food products. Movement of grain and seed products or 
contaminated machinery can also spread khapra beetle. These infestations 
present the greatest risk for spread into the domestic grain supply where trade 
could be impacted.

Introduction
This chapter provides instruction on how to complete surveys for khapra 
beetle. Early detection surveys are necessary to find small khapra beetle 
populations in a timely manner. This ensures that PPQ is able to eradicate the 
infestation before khapra beetle becomes established locally and ensures trade 
is not impacted. Delimiting surveys are used to define the extent of infestation 
and to guide programmatic response. Monitoring surveys are used to determine 
if treatment is successful and to ensure that the location remains free of khapra 
beetle for an established amount of time after the initial find.
To ensure that khapra beetle surveys 1) detect early populations and 2) provide 
reliable negative survey data, it is critical that the surveyor follows the 
guidance in this chapter and the Identification chapter. This chapter provides 
guidance on how to properly plan and conduct a khapra beetle survey
.
Selecting Survey Locations
Use the following information to select the highest risk locations to survey in 
your state. Since staffing resources are often limited, you may need to rotate 
surveys through different locations each year.

Use locally available resources to assist you in identifying high risk sites of 
introduction/interception. Local PPQ Smuggling Interdiction and Trade 
Compliance (SITC) staff are a good resource to identify high risk products, as 
well as importers, distributors, and retailers in the area. Your local U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) contacts can assist with finding high 
risk locations as well. In addition, you may want to include locations that have 
received Emergency Action Notifications (EANs) for khapra beetle.
Use the following list as a starting point to identify areas of potential risk in 
your state in conjunction with the input from your local SITC and CBP 
counterparts:
A commercial location that is the known, intended destination for a 
shipment of host material that CBP found to be infested by live khapra 
beetle at the port of entry. Previous shipments from the same supplier are 
possible and may have entered without inspection.
Air cargo warehouses at international airports. These warehouses belong 
to individual airlines that service that airport. The warehouses often 
receive household goods and other materials that may be a pathway.
Coffee roasters that import coffee beans in used burlap bags from khapra 
beetle countries
Distribution warehouses for companies that sell high-risk merchandise
Express consignment facilities (DHL, FedEx, UPS, etc.) or other facilities 
where potentially infested materials may pass through
Grain dealers. If there is a known pathway for introduction of khapra 
beetle, or if in proximity to a known

Express consignment facilities (DHL, FedEx, UPS, etc.) or other facilities 
where potentially infested materials may pass through
Grain dealers. If there is a known pathway for introduction of khapra 
beetle, or if in proximity to a known or possible pathway, then these sites 
may be considered much higher risk.
Importers of brassware or other products from khapra beetle countries 
packaged in burlap bags
Importers of bulk grains and spices from khapra beetle countries. 
Importers who repackage these products within the warehouse for retail 
distribution are highest risk. Examples include but are not limited to dried 
chickpeas, cracked corn, cracked or bulghur wheat, and hibiscus.
Importers of manufactured, processed, or otherwise pre-packaged host 
material that is ready for retail sale from khapra beetle countries
Military facilities where returning luggage or household goods are stored
Retail markets selling materials outlined above
Transload facilities, locations where container cargo is transferred from 
one load unit to another. When a container is transloaded, it usually 
occurs at a facility that is close to a port terminal. A container will be 
taken into a facility and transferred to a domestic container or truckload.

Trap Placement
Survey a new facility with a company representative, if possible, to identify 
locations before placing traps. Check exit and entry areas, as well as any 
storage locations on the premises. Observe the movement of products, 
containers, and/or people handling products which could have been exposed to 
khapra beetle.
Be alert for cartons, burlap or jute sacks, debris, woodwork, cracks, loose 
plaster, loose paint, and other such hiding places. Carefully inspect rodent bait 
stations and other such traps with grain or cereal. Khapra beetle are attracted to 
dirty grain and storage or handling facilities; conversely, sanitary conditions 
are a deterrent. Areas of low light are also favorable for khapra beetle.
In empty bins and warehouses, larvae are likely to be in or on ledges, cracks in 
the floor or walls, old cartons, rags, sacks, newspapers, scrap lumber, or other 
debris. Elevator tunnels also serve as hiding places for khapra beetle larvae. 
When inspecting sacked material, the ears and seams of bags are common 
hiding places for the beetle and should be inspected. In bulk storage where 
heavy infestations may occur, larvae tend to congregate in the surface grain 
and on or near the walls. Look for cast larval skins as a sign of an active 
infestation.
When to Trap
Conduct surveys when average temperatures are above 70 ºF in the trapping 
environment. Survey outdoor areas throughout the warm season.

When to Trap
Conduct surveys when average temperatures are above 70 ºF in the trapping 
environment. Survey outdoor areas throughout the warm season. 
Environmental conditions may be less severe than prevailing weather 
conditions in areas immediately surrounding ports and grain processing and 
storage facilities. Use practical judgment to determine if temperatures are 
warm enough. In more temperate areas, conduct surveys from mid-May 
through mid-September. In heated warehouses, food storage and processing 
areas, dwellings, and other moderated environments, surveys with traps are 
appropriate at any time of year.
Trapping Supplies
The Khapra Beetle Wall Mount Trap Kit contains all supplies necessary to 
complete a khapra beetle survey. The kit includes:
Six khapra beetle wall-mounted traps (Figure 2-1)
Seven khapra beetle pheromone lures (Figure 2-2)
Or
ganic wheat germ (the food bait for the beetle) (Figure 2-3)

The wall mount traps may be re-used.
Use the decoy aerial trap to capture warehouse beetle, T
rogoderma variabile 
Ballion adults and minimize their numbers in khapra beetle wall traps. The 
warehouse beetle is often present in warehouses and it is difficult to distinguish 
between warehouse beetle and khapra beetle. Since both species are attracted 
to the same pheromone lure, warehouse beetles may overwhelm khapra beetle 
traps. However, since the warehouse beetle is a strong flyer, unlike khapra 
beetle, which does not fly, use the aerial decoy trap to minimize or exclude 
warehouse beetles collected in khapra beetle wall traps.
Fit the decoy aerial trap with one of the khapra beetle lures and hang it high in 
the open head space of the building. Use one aerial trap for every five to six 
khapra beetle wall-mounted traps.

Trap Set Up
Follow the instructions from the manufacturer that are included with the trap 
kit to assemble the traps. Use a permanent marker to label each trap with a 
unique identification number, for instance County Code-Facility Code-Trap 
Number. Use the wall mount trap inside and outside structures. Place traps 
around the inside of exterior walls and along interior walls of structures under 
investigation (Figure 2-6).

kit to assemble the traps. Use a permanent marker to label each trap with a 
unique identification number, for instance County Code-Facility Code-Trap 
Number. Use the wall mount trap inside and outside structures. Place traps 
around the inside of exterior walls and along interior walls of structures under 
investigation (Figure 2-6). Pay special attention to cracks in the walls and 
walls made of porous materials like cement blocks. Cracks may serve as 
pathways for ins
ect movement. If possible, place a trap over a wall crack if one 
is found.
Clean the wall thoroughly before attaching the trap to the wall. An alcohol prep 
pad or paper towel soaked with ethanol works well to clean the wall. Allow the 
wall to dry before affixing the trap to the wall. You may use any locally 
available double-sided foam tape (Gorilla brand, 3M, double-sided foam tape, 
etc.). Duct tape does not work well for this purpose. Replacing the tape is often

necessary when servicing traps. Do not cover the entry holes on the back of the 
trap. Use an opened paper clip to open the side tabs, which may not be 
perforated completely. When attaching the trap to the wall, make sure that all 
four back entry tabs are in contact with the wall and that the trap is also 
attached loosely enough so that entry holes are not closed (Figure 2-7). These 
are the places where the larvae will enter the trap.

four back entry tabs are in contact with the wall and that the trap is also 
attached loosely enough so that entry holes are not closed (Figure 2-7). These 
are the places where the larvae will enter the trap.
Be aware that the trap adhesive or tape (if used) may remove some paint from 
walls when the trap or tape is removed. Let the facility know this. 
You may 
need to choose a less prominent location.
Fill the plastic collection tray with wheat germ (Figure 2-3). Fill the dish only 
1/4 to 1/3 full, being careful no
t to spill wheat germ in the trap, and keeping it 
vertically oriented after assembly through attachment to the wall.
Areas to Avoid
Areas exposed to human activities such as sweeping, foot traffic, or frequent 
use of mechanized equipment may lead to trap loss. Placement in very oily or 
damp locations will lead to trap damage or poor adhesion. Slippery surfaces, 
such as metal, plastic, glossy painted concrete, or glass walls may inhibit 
khapra beetle movement.
Height
Mount traps as low as possible to maximize captures. However, in most cases, 
to avoid trap loss from maintenance activities, mount the traps at least above 
broom height. Look for locations up to about 2 feet off the floor where they can 
be easily serviced.

Density
Allow 25 to 40 feet between traps or base the placement of traps on the layout 
of buildings. The more traps that are set, the greater the chance of finding 
khapra beetle, if present. However, if there are too many buildings and travel is 
a problem, half of the locations can be trapped in alternate years. This way, a 
building can be more intensively trapped, thus increasing the chances of 
finding khapra beetle.
Survey Supply Procurement
Order all traps and lures through the IPHIS Survey Supply Ordering System. 
Follow the national guidance for procuring traps and lures during the two 
ordering open periods each year. If you need immediate assistance, contact 
Laurie Morales at laurie.m.morales@usda.gov or 970-494-7535 or Darrell 
Bays at darrell.a.bays@usda.gov or 919-500-9959.
When ordering the trap kits, be sure to order additional lures so that you can 
change out the lures during the trapping season.

Trap Servicing and Sample Collection
Check traps every 1-2 weeks. When inspecting the trap, dump the contents of 
the plastic collection tray (including the wheat germ and any insects) into a 
resealable plastic bag. Inspect the trap for any other larvae that have not yet 
reached the collection tray. You can do this by tapping the tray into the plastic 
bag and using a fine paintbrush to dislodge any insects into the tray. Place a 
label on or inside each bag with a unique trap identification number, date of 
location, and facility name. Place the bag in a cooler with ice packs.
Refill the plastic collection tray with fresh wheat germ. Do not dispose of used 
wheat germ onsite. Even if there are no visible insects present in the wheat

When checking a trap for the last time and removing it, place the complete trap 
in a resealable plastic bag. Place a label inside the bag with a unique trap 
identification number, date, and facility name.
Before leaving each facility, wipe down any tubs or containers that you 
brought into the facility with a lab wipe or paper towel soaked with ethanol. 
Clean your boots and clothing well before traveling in the government owned 
vehicle to avoid tracking khapra beetle life stages to other locations.
Sample Preparation and Storage
Keep specimens as cool as possible. Transport samples back to the lab in a 
cooler. At the lab, if samples cannot be sorted and screened immediately, store 
the samples in a freezer. Place the entire plastic bag with the trap contents in 
the freezer. For samples taken from the last trap servicing of the season, freeze 
the entire trap inside a plastic bag. This will prevent sample degradation and 
also the potential for larvae or adults to escape into the lab. Larvae otherwise 
may degrade to the point where they are difficult to find within sweepings or 
food baits. Such precautions will also help with potential visual or molecular 
identification. 
Refer to the Identification chapter for instructions on sample sorting, sample 
screening, specimen routing, and taxonomic guidelines.

Introduction
This chapter provides guidance for individuals who will process trap 
collections and submit samples of suspected khapra beetles for identification. 
In addition, the chapter provides information for specimen routing and results 
reporting.
Sorting and Screening
Sort and screen trap collections before submitting specimens for identification. 
Sorting raw trap samples requires familiarity with insect groups and 
experience in examining specimens. Sorting is the first level of activity that 
assures samples submitted are of the correct target group of pests being 
surveyed. Sorting samples in a khapra beetle survey involves removal of non-
beetle specimens.
Screening is removing obvious beetle larvae or adults not fitting the general

 requires familiarity with insect groups and 
experience in examining specimens. Sorting is the first level of activity that 
assures samples submitted are of the correct target group of pests being 
surveyed. Sorting samples in a khapra beetle survey involves removal of non-
beetle specimens.
Screening is removing obvious beetle larvae or adults not fitting the general 
descriptions of dermestid or similar-looking beetle families. Screening in a 
khapra beetle survey involves removal of non-dermestid beetles before 
specimens are submitted to a PPQ Identifier.
Freeze samples according to the directions outlined in the Survey and Trapping 
Chapter
. Pour the frozen contents of the trap onto a lab tray. Remove wheat 
germ and other debris. Remove insects that are not beetles. To the best of your 
ability, remove any beetles that are not in the Dermestidae family. When in 
doubt, keep the insect in the final sample to be submitted.
NOTICE
Microscopes with 10X–15X magnification are recommended for sorting and
screening.

 trap is removed and replaced, such as during the last trap 
servicing of the season, thoroughly inspect for larvae that may be hidden 
inside. Gently dismantle the trap and inspect the corrugated cardboard and the 
entire interior of the trap. Khapra beetle larv
ae are attracted to the corrugated 
cardboard, and specimens may be found within the folds of the cardboard. 
Separate the corrugated cardboard to examine for larvae within the folds. Use a 
fine paintbrush to dislodge any insects from the cardboard. If the specimen is 
caught in adhesive, cut the insect out of the trap with scissors so that only a 
small piece of trap backing remains.
The following resources are useful guides for identification of suspect 
specimens from sorted or screened samples:

If th
e trap was not previously frozen, place the entire trap in a freezer for 15 
days before disposal or reuse after the trap has been inspected. The majority of 
household freezers maintain temperatures from -9 °F to 0 °F.
Likewise, freeze any used wheat germ for 15 days before disposal, even if 
suspect specimens are not found.
Place insect larvae and adults in vials with non-denatured 95% or higher ethyl 
alcohol.
NOTICE
A small paintbrush moistened with alcohol is useful for moving suspect specimens 
from the sample to a vial without damaging the specimens.

Specimen Routing and Taxonomic Guidelines
Identification of dermestid beetle larvae or adults recovered from khapra beetle 
survey traps is difficult and requires specialized training. State or PPQ offices 
given the responsibility for this survey should consider the ability, experience, 
and expertise of those assigned to the various steps of sorting, screening, and 
identification of trap samples to ensure quality data is collected.
Qualified state, county, or cooperating university personnel can screen and 
perform tentative identification of suspected khapra beetle specimens. The 
specimens must be forwarded with a completed PPQ Form 391 to a PPQ 
domestic identifier. (Many PPQ port identifiers are skilled at identifying 
Trogoderma granarium, but their workloads normally do not allow processing 
of domestic samples). Suspect Trogoderma spp. going to a domestic identifier 
should be entered into the Agricultural Risk Management system (ARM) by 
those who have access. 
The domestic identifiers can also enter these records if 
necessary for samples going forward for final confirmation.
The domestic identifiers listed below will accept specimens for possible 
dissection, forwarding to the USDA Systematic Entomology Laboratory for 
final confirmation, and logging into the ARM database.

The domestic identifiers can also enter these records if 
necessary for samples going forward for final confirmation.
The domestic identifiers listed below will accept specimens for possible 
dissection, forwarding to the USDA Systematic Entomology Laboratory for 
final confirmation, and logging into the ARM database.
Before initiating delimiting surveys and/or control activities in the United 
States, a specialist recognized by USDA-APHIS-PPQ National Identification 
Services (NIS) must confirm the specimen is khapra beetle. All Trogoderma 
species that are not khapra beetle will be recorded as Trogoderma sp. (not T. 
granarium). All specimens that NIS morphologically confirm as khapra beetle 
collected during domestic surveys require molecular confirmation.
For confirmatory identification, follow the steps here: Request Official 
Confirmation of Preliminary Pest Identifications of Domestic Samples
Prior to each survey season (fall/winter), confirm by phone or email with the 
identifier that they have the capacity to process your sample(s). Include the 
following information:
Expected number of samples for the survey season
Name and email of person who will be submitting samples
