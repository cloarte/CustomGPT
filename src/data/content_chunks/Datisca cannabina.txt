Datiscaceae MOHAMMAD AMIN SIDDIQI Department of Botany, Gordon College, Rawalpindi. Datisca cannabina Illustration Credit: M.Y. Saleem Tall, glabrous, dioecious, perenuial herbs. Leaves alternate, exstipulate, imparipinnate. Flowers in axillary or terminal racemes bearing clusters intermixed with simple leaves. Male flowers: calyx divided into 3-4(-5) unequal lobes; petals absent; stamens 8-12(-25), filaments short, anthers two-celled, membranous, dehiscing longitudinally. Female flowers: calyx 3-8-Iobed; petals absent; gynoecium inferior, 3-4(-5)-carpellary, syncarpous, with 3-4(-5) parietal placentae, ovules many; styles 3-4(-5), free, deeply bifid; stigmas equal to the number of the placentae and opposite the lobes of calyx. Fruit a pedicelled, narrowly oblong, pendulous, 3-4(-5)-ribbed, coriaceous capsule, opening at the top between the styles. Seeds numerous, minute, exalbuminous. A family of a single genus with only 2 species, distributed over S.E. Europe, W. Asia and N. America. Represented by only 1 species in W. Pakistan. Previously 3 genera were included in this family, namely Datisca, Tetrameles and Octomeles, but in most recent treatments the last 2 genera are separated from Datiscaceae and included in Tetramelaceae. The plants now included in Datiscaceae are exclusively perennial tall herbs with imparipin¬nate glabrous leaves, whereas those included in Tet

 3 genera were included in this family, namely Datisca, Tetrameles and Octomeles, but in most recent treatments the last 2 genera are separated from Datiscaceae and included in Tetramelaceae. The plants now included in Datiscaceae are exclusively perennial tall herbs with imparipin¬nate glabrous leaves, whereas those included in Tetramelaceae are always large trees, often buttressed, with simple leaves which are lepidote-mealy, hairy or tomentose below. The Datiscaceae is placed near Begoniaceae, Cactaceae and Haloragidaceae by some authors.
