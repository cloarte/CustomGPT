 Invasion: Schiefer and Bright (2004)provide a thorough detailed description of the female. The males are relatively scarce. In comparison with other members of the tribe Xyleborini,X. mutilatusis relatively large at 3.46-3.88 mm long (Schiefer and Bright, 2004). The adult beetles are black, with reddish-brown legs and antennae. The elytra are 0.78 times longer than they are wide (Schiefer and Bright, 2004) and appear shorter than the pronotum, making them readily recognisable (Thomas, 2007). In dorsal view, the head is completely hidden by the pronotum, which is 0.86 times longer than it is wide and 1.11 times longer than the elytra (Schiefer and Bright, 2004;Coyle, 2006). The antennal club is round and appears to be obliquely cut (Coyle, 2006;Thomas, 2007). The body is generally smooth and shining (Coyle, 2006), with a long, golden and moderately dense pubescence on the abdomen (Schiefer and Bright, 2004).

 Habitat: Managed forests, plantations and orchards, Disturbed areas, Natural forests, Riverbanks, Wetlands
 Reproduccion: X. mutilatus is univoltine. Adult females make dispersal flights from June to August, seeking small diameter hosts in which to establish a gallery in the wood. Reported host plants in its natural range include Acer spp., Acer sieboldianum , Albizia spp., Benzoin [ Lindera ] spp., Camellia spp., Carpinus laxiflora, Castanea spp., Cinnamomum camphora , Cornus spp., Cryptomeria japonica , Fagus crenata , Lindera erythrocarpa , Lindera triloba , Machilus thunbergii [ Persea thunbergii ], Ormosia hosiei , Osmanthus fragrans , Parabenzoin praecox [ Lindera praecox ], Platycarya spp., and Swieitenia macrophylla ( Schiefer and Bright, 2004 ). In North America its reported hosts thus far include Acer rubrum , Acer saccharum , Acer palmatum , Carya spp., Liriodendron tulipifera , Liquidambar styraciflua , Melia azedarach , Ostrya virginiana , Pinus taeda , Prunus serotina , Prunus americana , Ulmus

The gallery system excavated in the xylem is inoculated with spores of several species of ambrosia fungi ( Kajimura and Hijii, 1992 ; Stone et al., 2005 ) carried in mycangia, a pair of dorsally located pits between the pronotum and mesonotum. As many as 38 eggs (average is 10) are laid per gallery. The female guards the gallery entrance and will block the entrance hole with her body as a defence against enemies. However, little has been reported about the nature and importance of natural enemies of X. mutilatus . Egg hatch begins about 7 days post oviposition and the larvae feed on the mycelia of the ambrosia fungi. Larvae are c-shaped and cream colored, without legs. Pupation occurs 2-3 weeks later, and adults emerge after about 1 week ( Rabaglia, 2003 ; Schiefer and Bright 2004 ). As is typical of many ambrosia beetles, X. mutilatus has inbred polygamy. Mating occurs within the gallery immediately after eclosion. Only one to three males develop in each gallery where they remain and mate with their sisters. Males die after mating, and the females overwinter within the natal gallery ( Rabaglia, 2003 ; Schiefer and Bright, 2004 ).
