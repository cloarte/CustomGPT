Plant Notes:  Harperella is a native herbaceous annual or biennial in the Carrot family (Apiaceae). Harperella is known to occur from Maryland to Alabama along the east coast and in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma. In Alabama it occurs in northeast and north-central portions of the state. Harperella occurs on rocky sandbars and in cracks in rocks of swift-flowing streams, in wet savanna’s and around cypress ponds, and in pools on granite outcrops. Harperella has a fibrous root system and branched, hollow stems from 1-3 feet in height. The stems are green or reddish in color, ribbed, and glabrous. Leaves are alternate, reduced to hollow, quill-like structures with cross partitions, and glabrous. The leaves have broadly clasping bases. Small plantlets can form in the axils of the leaves. All parts of the plant are weakly aromatic when injured and have an odor similar to Dill. Flowers are produced in terminal umbels. The flowers have 5 white petals. Each umbel contains both perfect and male flowers. The fruit is a schizocarp this is elliptical in outline and slightly laterally compressed. Harperella is named in honor of Roland M. Harper, who first collected an unknown plant from a shallow coastal plain pond in Schley County, Georgia in 1902. In 1905 he collected a similar plant from

Harperella is named in honor of Roland M. Harper, who first collected an unknown plant from a shallow coastal plain pond in Schley County, Georgia in 1902. In 1905 he collected a similar plant from along Little River in DeKalb County Alabama.  These were named Harperella nodosa and Harperella fluviatilis respectively. The species were later transferred to the genus Ptilimnium. Dr. Robert Kral observed that P. fluviatile is shorter and develops roots at the nodes probably due to being toppled by flood waters, but was otherwise nearly identical to P nodosum. He synonymized the two under the older name (Ptilimnium nodosum). Harperella was re-separated from Ptilimnium in 2008. Harperella is listed as a S1 species in Alabama and globally as a G2 species. It was listed as an Endangered Species on October 28th, 1988.—A. Diamond  ;
Taxonomic Notes:  Listed asFederally Endangeredas of 28 Oct 1988.The name used at the time of listing was Ptilimnium nodosum.  ;
