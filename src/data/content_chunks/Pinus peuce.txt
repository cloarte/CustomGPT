. Branches level in lower crown, becoming erect in upper crown and at ends of branches; high altitude trees tend to have more erect branches than at lower altitudes. Shoots uni-nodal, green at first, grey-brown by end of first year, smooth, glabrous. Leaves five per fascicle, 4.5-10 cm long (not over 7 cm on treeline trees), slender, 0.7-0.8 mm thick, glossy green on outer face with white stomatal lines on inner faces, margins minutely serrulate; persistent 2-5 years; sheath 10-15 mm, deciduous by end of first autumn. Cones pendulous, (5-) 9-18 (-20) cm long (stunted, 5-13 cm, at treeline), cylindric, straight to slightly curved, green ripening orange-brown, scales adpressed to slightly incurved when cone closed; scales large, thin, and fragile, apophysis smoothly rounded, 20 mm; umbo terminal, 2-3 mm, dark grey, unarmed. Cone peduncle 1 cm, grey, 6-8 mm thick. Seeds grey-brown, 7-8 mm with an adnate 14-22 mm wing (Frankis, 1998;Earle, 2023).

 Reproduccion: Physiology and Phenology Pinus peuce is pollinated by wind. The cones have a two-year cycle of development. In the beginning, they are green with their scales closed and covered with resin granules. They mature in September-October of the second year. The seeds shed as soon as cones mature in September-October, 17-18 months after pollination ( Alexandrov

ion: Physiology and Phenology Pinus peuce is pollinated by wind. The cones have a two-year cycle of development. In the beginning, they are green with their scales closed and covered with resin granules. They mature in September-October of the second year. The seeds shed as soon as cones mature in September-October, 17-18 months after pollination ( Alexandrov and Andonovski, 2011 ). Longevity Pinus peuce is a perennial, long-lived tree that under exceptional conditions can reach the age of 675 years, but generally trees live between 200-300 years ( Zafirov et al., 2020 ). Activity Patterns Pinus peuce growth is positively influenced by high temperatures at the end of the previous growing season and negatively affected by cold winters. In some areas, trees may be negatively impacted by drought during the hottest summer months (especially in August; Zafirov et al., 2020 ). Population Size and Density Only 17-20 subpopulations of P. peuce remain in the wild across the Balkans ( Farjon, 2017 ). Associations Across its native range, P. peuce can be found associated with Picea abies , Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica . At the upper tree line in the Balkans, it can form mixed forest stands with Pinus heldreichii ( Janković et al., 1987 ; Stevanović et al., 1995 ; Alexandrov and Andonovski, 2011 ). Environmental Requirements Pinus peuce is adapted to grow at high elevations (range: 600 m - 2300 m), in areas characterized by cold and high humidity mountain climate. It is well adapted to grow on a variety of soil types, including limestone, dolomite, silicate and carbonate soils, as well as soils poor in nutrients. In Albania and Serbia, it is also found growing on serpentine. This species shows relatively high shade tolerance,

It is well adapted to grow on a variety of soil types, including limestone, dolomite, silicate and carbonate soils, as well as soils poor in nutrients. In Albania and Serbia, it is also found growing on serpentine. This species shows relatively high shade tolerance, and it is very tolerant of severe winter cold, hardy down to at least -45°C ( Janković et al., 1987 ; Fern, 2016 ; Farjon, 2017 ; Mandžukovski et al., 2022 ; Earle, 2023 ).
