Inflorescence of (1-)2(-3) racemes arising together at culm apex; racemes 2-5 cm, usually closely approximate when young, later spreading; spikelets single, in 2 rows; rachis 1-2 mm wide. Spikelets pale brownish green, narrowly lanceolate-oblong, strongly flattened, 3.5-4 mm, acute; lower glume absent or rarely a tiny vestige; upper glume thinly papery, weakly 5-veined, midvein often suppressed, glabrous; lower lemma resembling upper glume; upper lemma pale green, 2.5-3 mm, shorter than spikelet, cartilaginous, apex minutely pubescent.

 Reproduccion: According to IPCN (2016) , the chromosome number of P. vaginatum is 2n=20, but Lonard et al. (2015) report that tetraploidy (2n=40), hexaploidy (2n=60) and aneuploidy (2n=18) may also occur. A range of 69 accessions of P. vaginatum showed three main genetic clusters. Those from Hawaii showed the least variability and those from Africa the highest, with those from North America intermediate ( Chen et al., 2005 ). A comprehensive transcriptone analysis has been reported by Jia et al. (2014) . A total of 81,220 unigenes containing 8,7542,503 bp sequence information were formed by initial sequence splicing, with an average read length of 1,077 bp. Seed viability is apparently low and few were found in a seed bank in a densely-infested site in Lousiana, USA ( Lonard et al., 2015 ). This may be partly attributed to the self-incompatibility reported by Carpenter (1958) , who found that only one of four Australian and South African populations studied was self-fertile. Lonard et al. (2015) reported that a germination rate of less than 5% at room temperature was improved by a constant 35°C temperature or by an alternating temperature regime of 25°C to 35°C.

Liu et al . (2012) conclude that the high salinity tolerance in P. vaginatum could be associated with a high abundance of proteins involved in ROS detoxification and energy metabolism.

P. vaginatum tolerates a wide range of environmental soil and climatic conditions, especially being highly tolerant of salinity, up to 600 mM NaCl, (35 ppt salinity) the natural level in undiluted sea water and even hyper-saline conditions (up to 50 ppt) although growth may be inhibited at these levels. Its growth is best at low salinity levels (Lonard, 2016). In Australia Barrett-Lennard et al , (2013) found the optimum salinity level for P. vaginatum to be 6-16 dS/m (seawater has 50 dS/M). Gaetani et al. (2013) also found it to grow best at about 2/3 rd the full salinity of sea water in Italy. It enjoys water-logged conditions and survives a water table at or above soil level for at least 10 months of the year. It also tolerates seasonal flooding to a depth of 50 cm or more for at least 45 days ( Lonard et al., 2015 ). Some turf-grass varieties can tolerate drought, but Barrett-Lennard et al.

P. vaginatum tolerates a wide range of environmental soil and climatic conditions, especially being highly tolerant of salinity, up to 600 mM NaCl, (35 ppt salinity) the natural level in undiluted sea water and even hyper-saline conditions (up to 50 ppt) although growth may be inhibited at these levels. Its growth is best at low salinity levels (Lonard, 2016). In Australia Barrett-Lennard et al , (2013) found the optimum salinity level for P. vaginatum to be 6-16 dS/m (seawater has 50 dS/M). Gaetani et al. (2013) also found it to grow best at about 2/3 rd the full salinity of sea water in Italy. It enjoys water-logged conditions and survives a water table at or above soil level for at least 10 months of the year. It also tolerates seasonal flooding to a depth of 50 cm or more for at least 45 days ( Lonard et al., 2015 ). Some turf-grass varieties can tolerate drought, but Barrett-Lennard et al. (2013) found that its growth increased many-fold as the watertable depth rose from 1.3 to 0.9 m below the soil surface. It can also tolerate temporary freezing conditions.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics According to IPCN (2016) , the chromosome number of P. vaginatum is 2n=20, but Lonard et al. (2015) report that tetraploidy (2n=40), hexaploidy (2n=60) and aneuploidy (2n=18) may also occur. A range of 69 accessions of P. vaginatum showed three main genetic clusters. Those from Hawaii showed the least variability and those from Africa the highest, with those from North America intermediate ( Chen et al., 2005 ). A comprehensive transcriptone analysis has been reported by Jia et al. (2014) . A total of 81,220 unigenes containing 8,7542,503 bp sequence information were formed by initial sequence splicing, with an average read length of 1,077 bp. Reproductive Biology Seed viability is apparently low and few were found in a seed bank in a densely-infested site in Lousiana, USA ( Lonard et al., 2015 ). This may be partly attributed to the self-incompatibility reported by Carpenter (1958) , who found that only one of four Australian and South African populations studied was self-f

,077 bp. Reproductive Biology Seed viability is apparently low and few were found in a seed bank in a densely-infested site in Lousiana, USA ( Lonard et al., 2015 ). This may be partly attributed to the self-incompatibility reported by Carpenter (1958) , who found that only one of four Australian and South African populations studied was self-fertile. Lonard et al. (2015) reported that a germination rate of less than 5% at room temperature was improved by a constant 35°C temperature or by an alternating temperature regime of 25°C to 35°C. Shin et al. (2006) and Shim et al. (2008) also found alternating 25/35°C to be optimal, together with KNO 3 , but also found benefit from light. Serena et al. (2012) report that germination is unaffected by salinity levels up to 12.5 dS.m -1 . Physiology and Phenology P. vaginatum has C 4 photosynthesis. Shonubi (2010) describes how P. vaginatum is able to accumulate salt in older leaves and store water to keep salinity to tolerable levels in the younger ones – not demonstrated in the related Paspalum scrobiculatum. Liu et al . (2012) conclude that the high salinity tolerance in P. vaginatum could be associated with a high abundance of proteins involved in ROS detoxification and energy metabolism. Sexual reproductive phases occur during the summer, autumn and early winter throughout southwest USA.

. P. vaginatum Flowers and fruits from June to September ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2016 ). Longevity No specific information has been seen but established swards are likely to persist for many years. No information on seed longevity has been found. Nutrition In studies in Egypt, P. vaginatum was highly responsive to nitrogen as nitrate (but not as ammonium), showing increased growth up to the maximum 17.5 g/m 2 (El-Maadawy et al. , 2006). For turf, the optimal dose of nitrogen is about 150 kg/ha per annum ( Gates, 2003 ; Shadow, 2016 ). However, P. vaginatum is also tolerant of infertile conditions. Associations Lonard et al. (2015) provide extensive lists of species associated with P. vaginatum in a range of territories in North and South America and in West Africa. They also note that there is commonly an association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Garcia and Mendoza (2008) further confirmed that greatest arbuscular colonization was associated with the highest nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in plant tissue, suggesting a correspondence with increases in the rate of nutrient transfer between the symbiotic partners. Graeme and Kendall (2001) also describe a wide range of plant associations in New Zealand including mangrove, saltmarsh and backswamp communities involving Juncus krausii subsp. australiensis , Leptocarpus similis ( Apodasmia similis ), Sarcocornia quinqueflora , Suaeda novae-zealandiae , Samolus repens , Selliera radicans, Leptinella spp., Triglochin striata, Isolepis cernua, Schoenus nitens, Plagianthus divaricatus, Baumea juncea (Machaerina juncea) , Coprosma prop
