17.Linnaeaceae北极花科 bei ji hua keAuthors:Qiner Yang&Sven LandreinShrubs, erect or creeping. Leaves opposite, sometimes whorled, simple, estipulate, with an interpetiolar line. Inflorescence terminal or axillary; flowers in 3-flowered cymes, paired or single; bracts leaflike or reduced and located at base of ovary and forming an "epicalyx." Flowers bisexual, ± zygomorphic. Perianth 4- or 5-merous. Corolla imbricate in bud; nectary consisting of ± compact glandular hairs, inside corolla tube (nectaria trichomalia). Stamens 4, alternating with corolla lobes; filaments adnate from 1/3-1/2 with corolla tube. Ovary inferior, 3- or 4-loculed, placentation axile; 1 or 2 locules with a single fertile ovule and 2 locules with numerous sterile ovules; style long, stigmas capitate. Fruit an achene crowned with persistent sepals (deciduous inLinnaea). Seeds 1 or 2; embryo small, straight; endosperm copious.Seven genera and 19 species (including one cultivated hybrid): Afghanistan, China, India, Japan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Uzbekistan, and in Europe and North America; six genera (two endemic) and 15 species (eight endemic, one cultivated hybrid) in China.Hu Jia-qi. 1988.
