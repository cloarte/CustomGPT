 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for H. annuus is 2 n = 34 ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2018 ). This species was domesticated in North America, and during the last 3000 years, Native American Indians increased the seed size by approximately 1000 percent. They gradually changed the genetic composition of the plant by repeatedly selecting the largest seeds ( USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Gene flow among wild and domesticated H. annuus has been recorded ( Burke et al., 2002 ; Gutierrez et al., 2014 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Wild H. annuus is self-incompatible and mostly an obligate allogamous species. Plants rely on insects, mainly honeybees, bumblebees and flies, for cross-pollination. However, in the absence of cross-pollination, it has the capability to self-pollinate allowing ‘late self-pollination’ ( Gutierrez et al., 2014 ; PFAF, 2018 ). Current commercial varieties of H. annuus are self-compatible ( Snow et al., 1998 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ).

In the USA and Canada, H. annuus has been recorded flowering from July to November (summer to fall; Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2018 ). In China, it flowers from July to September and fruits are produced from August to October ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ). In Mexico, this species produces flowers irregularly across the year ( Vibrans, 2011 ). In H. annuus , the growth cycle is usually about 4 months, but it ranges from 75-180 days, depending on the environment and genotype. Sowing to seedling emergence takes 5-10 days, emergence to floral initiation 15-20 days, floral initiation to first flowering 20-90 days, flowering 5-15 days and flowering to seed maturity 30-45 days. Pronounced heliotropism is a characteristic of sunflowers. Young heads and leaves face east in the morning and then they follow the movement of the sun to face west in the evening. Anthesis progresses from the periphery of the head inwards at 1-4 rows of florets per day. Anthesis of a floret starts early in the morning and the stigma becomes fully extended and receptive the following morning. Fertilization is complete by the evening of the second day. At physiological maturity (30-40 days after last anthesis) the head becomes yellow, the bracts brown and about 75% of the leaves are desiccated. During the following 10 days, the seed will dry to 10-12% moisture content. Seeds of H. annuu s show dormancy. Some seeds will germinate in the next growing season, but others may remain up to 3 years buried in the soil waiting for suitable environmental conditions ( Duke, 1983 ; Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; PROTA

The seeds of H. annuus are of outstanding value to wildlife in natural habitats across North America ( Martin et al., 1951 ). Birds reported eating the seeds include: Wilson snipes, doves, grouse, ring-necked pheasants, quail, blackbirds, bobolinks, lazuli buntings, black-capped chickadees, cowbirds, white-winged crossbills, crows, house finches, goldfinches, purple grackles, horned larks, longspurs, meadowlarks, white-breasted nuthatches, ravens, sparrows and tufted titmice. Small mammals that relish the seeds include the least chipmunk, Eastern pocket gopher, ground squirrels, lemmings, meadow mice, pocket mice, white-footed mice, prairie dogs and kangaroo rats. Muskrats eat the stems and foliage and antelope, deer and moose browse on the plants ( USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Helianthus annuus is able to grow in a wide range of habitat types, but it is cultivated primarily in relatively cool temperate to warm subtropical climates. In the tropics, it can be grown in the drier regions, but it is unsuitable for humid and very humid climates.

In the tropics, it can be grown in the drier regions, but it is unsuitable for humid and very humid climates. This species thrives in areas with annual temperatures ranging from 6° to 28°C and annual precipitation of 200 to 2000 mm. Water requirement is 300-700 mm during the growing period, depending on cultivar, soil type and climate ( Duke, 1983 ; Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; PROTA, 2018 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). The optimal temperature for seed germination is 15°C and should not be below 4°-6°C, while maximum temperatures during growth should not be above 40°C ( Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; Presotto et al., 2014 ). It may withstand short periods of frost down to -5°C. It does not tolerate shade. As sunflowers have highly efficient root systems, plants are quite drought-resistant except during flowering. This species is adapted to grow on a wide range of soil types, including sandy, clay and loamy soils with pH ranging from 5.7 to 8.1. H. annuus is slightly tolerant to saline soils but does not tolerate waterlogged soils ( Duke, 1983 ; Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; PFAF, 2018 ; PROTA, 2018 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics The chromosome number reported for H. annuus is 2 n = 34 ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2018 ). This species was domesticated in North America, and during the last 3000 years, Native American Indians increased the seed size by approximately 1000 percent. They gradually changed the genetic composition of the plant by repeatedly selecting the largest seeds ( USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Gene flow among wild and domesticated H. annuus has been recorded ( Burke et al., 2002 ; Gutierrez et al., 2014 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Reproductive Biology Wild H. annuus is self-incompatible and mostly an obligate allogamous species. Plants rely on insects, mainly honeybees, bumblebees and flies, for cross-pollination. However, in the absence of cross-pollination, it has the capability to self-pollinate allowing ‘late self-pollination’ ( Gutierrez et al., 2014 ; PFAF, 2018 ). Current commercial varieties of H. annuus are self-compatible ( Snow et al., 1998 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Physiology and Phenology In the USA and Canada, H. annuus has been recorded flowering from July to November (summer to fall; Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2018 ). In China, it flowers from July to September and fruits are produced from August to October ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ). In Mexico, this species produces flowers irregularly across the year ( Vibrans, 2011 ). Activity Patterns In H. annuus , the growth cycle is usually about 4 months, but it ranges from 75-180 days, depending on the environment and genotype. Sowing to seedling emergence takes 5-10 days, emergence to floral initiation 15-20 days, floral initiation to

 2018 ). In Mexico, this species produces flowers irregularly across the year ( Vibrans, 2011 ). Activity Patterns In H. annuus , the growth cycle is usually about 4 months, but it ranges from 75-180 days, depending on the environment and genotype. Sowing to seedling emergence takes 5-10 days, emergence to floral initiation 15-20 days, floral initiation to first flowering 20-90 days, flowering 5-15 days and flowering to seed maturity 30-45 days. Pronounced heliotropism is a characteristic of sunflowers. Young heads and leaves face east in the morning and then they follow the movement of the sun to face west in the evening. Anthesis progresses from the periphery of the head inwards at 1-4 rows of florets per day. Anthesis of a floret starts early in the morning and the stigma becomes fully extended and receptive the following morning. Fertilization is complete by the evening of the second day. At physiological maturity (30-40 days after last anthesis) the head becomes yellow, the bracts brown and about 75% of the leaves are desiccated. During the following 10 days, the seed will dry to 10-12% moisture content. Seeds of H. annuu s show dormancy. Some seeds will germinate in the next growing season, but others may remain up to 3 years buried in the soil waiting for suitable environmental conditions ( Duke, 1983 ; Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; PROTA, 2018 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Associations The seeds of H. annuus are of outstanding value to wildlife in natural habitats across North America ( Martin et al., 1951 ). Birds reported eating the seeds include: Wilson snipes, doves, grouse, ring-necked pheasants, quail, blackbirds, bobolinks, lazuli buntings, black-capped chickadees

Birds reported eating the seeds include: Wilson snipes, doves, grouse, ring-necked pheasants, quail, blackbirds, bobolinks, lazuli buntings, black-capped chickadees, cowbirds, white-winged crossbills, crows, house finches, goldfinches, purple grackles, horned larks, longspurs, meadowlarks, white-breasted nuthatches, ravens, sparrows and tufted titmice. Small mammals that relish the seeds include the least chipmunk, Eastern pocket gopher, ground squirrels, lemmings, meadow mice, pocket mice, white-footed mice, prairie dogs and kangaroo rats. Muskrats eat the stems and foliage and antelope, deer and moose browse on the plants ( USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). Environmental Requirements Helianthus annuus is able to grow in a wide range of habitat types, but it is cultivated primarily in relatively cool temperate to warm subtropical climates. In the tropics, it can be grown in the drier regions, but it is unsuitable for humid and very humid climates. This species thrives in areas with annual temperatures ranging from 6° to 28°C and annual precipitation of 200 to 2000 mm. Water requirement is 300-700 mm during the growing period, depending on cultivar, soil type and climate ( Duke, 1983 ; Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; PROTA, 2018 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). The optimal temperature for seed germination is 15°C and should not be below 4°-6°C, while maximum temperatures during growth should not be above 40°C ( Vossen and Umali

 period, depending on cultivar, soil type and climate ( Duke, 1983 ; Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; PROTA, 2018 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ). The optimal temperature for seed germination is 15°C and should not be below 4°-6°C, while maximum temperatures during growth should not be above 40°C ( Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; Presotto et al., 2014 ). It may withstand short periods of frost down to -5°C. It does not tolerate shade. As sunflowers have highly efficient root systems, plants are quite drought-resistant except during flowering. This species is adapted to grow on a wide range of soil types, including sandy, clay and loamy soils with pH ranging from 5.7 to 8.1. H. annuus is slightly tolerant to saline soils but does not tolerate waterlogged soils ( Duke, 1983 ; Vossen and Umali, 2001 ; PFAF, 2018 ; PROTA, 2018 ; USDA-NRCS, 2018 ).
