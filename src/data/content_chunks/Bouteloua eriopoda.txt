Black grama is a major native grass of the semiarid to arid areas fromWest Texas westward to California. The stems, when in contact with soil, formroots at the nodes to form other nearby plants. Stems are slender and wiry, upto 2 feet. Plants are leafy and highly palatable with good feeding value bothsummer and winter. They are highly drought resistant.
