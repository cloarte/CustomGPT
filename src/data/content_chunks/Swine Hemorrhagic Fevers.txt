Swine Hemorrhagic Fever Surveillance 
Evaluation Brief 
 September 2023 
INTRODUCTION 
African swine fever (ASF) continues to spread across the globe as classical swine fever (CSF) 
remains present in the Caribbean and South America. The United States Department of Agriculture’s 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has an integrated surveillance plan that 
maintains vigilance for swine hemorrhagic fever diseases and improves the country’s emergency 
preparedness. APHIS recently used a RISKSUR framework to evaluate the effectiveness and 
implementation of this surveillance plan over the past 3 years in the continental United States.  
APHIS expanded surveillance activities in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2021, after 
detection of ASF on the island of Hispaniola. APHIS performed a separate evaluation for surveillance 
activities in those territories and will report those findings separately. 
SURVEILLANCE PLAN GOALS 
To strengthen ASF and CSF detection 
capabilities and enhance outbreak 
preparedness  
by testing high-volume sample 
collection, laboratory capacity, and 
data management capacities prior to 
an outbreak scenario, and establishing 
a baseline of disease absence through 
timely and consistent surveillance. 
Support claims of ASF and CSF disease freedom 
by the diagnostic testing of ASF and CSF in targeted 
subpopulations of swine     collected via five surveillance 
components: 
• Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) Investigations
• Sick Pig Veterinary Diagnostic Lab (VDL) Component
• Slaughter & Aggregation Point Component
• Higher Risk Component

components: 
• Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) Investigations

• Slaughter & Aggregation Point Component
• Higher Risk Component
• Feral Swine Component
SAMPLING 
The evaluation included specimens collected from June 1, 2020, to May 31, 2023, from three 
targeted swine populations: 
• Commercial swine are domestic swine raised primarily for food production and confined to a
housing facility designed to prevent exposure to feral swine.
• Higher risk swine are swine raised in non-commercial settings, such as waste feeders,
outdoor raised swine, swine with known or suspected feral swine exposure, and show swine.
• Feral swine are free-roaming swine with an increased risk of exposure to ASF and CSF.
During the past three years, APHIS’ Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) and 
National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratories tested approximately 43,533 
specimens for ASF and CSF and 23,524 specimens for CSF only (Figure 1). An average of 1,864 
specimens were tested per month throughout the three-year period. Of note, the average monthly 
specimen counts increased each year, rising from 1,111 specimens in year one of the evaluation 
period to 2,638 specimens in year three.

EFFECTIVENESS METRICS 
Sample collection over time is displayed in Figure 2. In fall of 2021, the overall number of 
specimens tested increased dramatically. The number of specimens tested in the sick pig VDL 
component increased due to increased stakeholder awareness and engagement with this 
component. APHIS’ 
addition of four states to 
the feral swine ASF 
surveillance in summer 
2022 increased the 
amount of testing that had 
been occurring in those 
states. Two significant 
events––the COVID-19 
pandemic and the 2022–
2023 highly pathogenic 
avian influenza outbreak––
impacted federal, state, 
and industry resources, but 
no appreciable negative 
impacts were observed in 
the number of specimens 
tested nationally.  
An effective, targeted surveillance system ensures samples represent the different production types 
and associated risks, as well as the geographic distribution of at-risk populations. Geographic 
representativeness was evaluated through an analysis of the number of specimens tested compared 
to sampling target numbers and state swine populations.  
APHIS provides targets for annual specimen collection to 10 states for the higher risk component 
and 17 states for the

 samples represent the different production types 
and associated risks, as well as the geographic distribution of at-risk populations. Geographic 
representativeness was evaluated through an analysis of the number of specimens tested compared 
to sampling target numbers and state swine populations.  
APHIS provides targets for annual specimen collection to 10 states for the higher risk component 
and 17 states for the slaughter & aggregation point component. Figure 3 shows the proportion of 
these states that met or exceeded 75 percent of their target. APHIS continues to evaluate and 
adjust target sample numbers to reflect potential changes in swine populations and associated 
risks, and to identify where increased sampling may best support surveillance objectives.

To achieve geographic representation, the distribution of animals sampled for the sick pig VDL and 
slaughter & aggregation point components should be proportional to the population distribution of 
commercial U.S. swine. Comparison of the swine population by state (Figure 4a) and the total 
specimens tested from the sick pig VDL and slaughter & aggregation point components (Figure 4b) 
shows that, in general, APHIS, states, and private veterinarians are collecting the most specimens 
from animals originating from those states with larger swine populations.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Surveillance among feral swine is risk-based. States with the heaviest feral swine invasions are 
included in CSF surveillance. Enhancements to feral swine surveillance for ASF were implemented 
in select counties in Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia in 2022, due to increased risks of 
disease introduction. Evaluation of sample collection by state (Figure 5) shows that surveillance is 
being carried out across the invaded range of feral swine. APHIS will continue to target surveillance 
sampling in feral swine populations most at risk for a disease incursion.

FUNCTIONAL METRICS 
The ease of sampling protocol adoption, variety of accepted sample types, and robust data 
collection system contribute to the overall functionality of this surveillance plan. Laboratory 
engagement is demonstrated through the involvement of 12 NAHLN laboratories, 4 of which were 
added during the 3-year evaluation period. The addition of approved sample types for ASF and 
CSF surveillance has also increased acceptability and engagement. For example, whole blood was 
added for the higher risk component, which led to increased specimen volume.

CSF surveillance has also increased acceptability and engagement. For example, whole blood was 
added for the higher risk component, which led to increased specimen volume.  
During the last evaluation in 2020, 5.2 percent of specimens were unable to be matched to field 
data and were therefore not reportable. Since then, plan partners invested significant time and 
resources to develop tools to support matching processes to address this gap successfully. At the 
end of this evaluation period, only 0.2 percent (n=569) of specimens were not matched and there 
are clear processes to quickly get unmatched specimens resolved. Efforts are underway to build out 
additional capability to link field data to laboratory results and improve the functional metrics. 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CHALLENGES 
The evaluation identified program successes and areas for improvement as outlined below.  
Accomplishments: 
• Increased awareness and engagement with the sick pig VDL component, resulting in a  
fivefold increase in the number of case-compatible specimens tested per month.  
• Added 3 sample types to improve sample collection flexibility and efficiency. 
• Increased availability of flexible, scalable, and timely surveillance through the addition of 
four NAHLN laboratories to active surveillance programs. 
• Increased data fidelity through automated identification and management of duplicate 
records, pooled specimens, and other factors impacting data quality. 
• Provided consistent sampling from all targeted surveillance components across time and 
location though effective coordination of federal, state, and industry partners. 
• Maintained stable testing rates in the face of significant stresses on personnel and 
resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022–2023 highly

records, pooled specimens, and other factors impacting data quality. 
• Provided consistent sampling from all targeted surveillance components across time and 
location though effective coordination of federal, state, and industry partners. 
• Maintained stable testing rates in the face of significant stresses on personnel and 
resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022–2023 highly pathogenic avian 
influenza outbreaks. 
Challenges: 
• Limitations among data collection systems to consistently capture clinical signs, 
age/production type, and premises identification number have been an ongoing challenge 
since the plan’s inception in 2019. Accurate and consistent availability of these data would 
better support surveillance evaluations and other epidemiologic analysis. 
• Data quality issues occasionally delayed linking laboratory results with epidemiologic 
information gathered by specimen submitters. 
• Geographic representativeness could be improved through participation of additional 
premises and a re-evaluation of state-level sample targets to best support current needs 
and animal movement patterns.

COLLABORATIVE GOALS FOR IMPROVING THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM 
Ongoing success of the surveillance plan requires continued collaboration among federal, state, 
and industry partners, particularly in the following focus areas:    
1. Enhance risk-based targeting of swine subpopulations through ongoing disease introduction 
risk analyses. 
2. Re-evaluate state sample target numbers, encourage sample collection from 
underrepresented states, and identify resource needs to efficiently execute geographically 
representative disease surveillance.  
3. Continue to develop and expand the use of tools to capture and share electronic information 
through all surveillance components and through all stages of specimen collection, 
processing, and reporting. 
CONCLUSION

CONCLUSION 
The Swine Hemorrhagic Fevers Integrated Surveillance Plan continues to meet its goals by providing 
ongoing active surveillance for hemorrhagic fevers among the most at-risk animals and populations. 
By adding approved sample types, expanding surveillance within the NAHLN, and improving data 
systems, this surveillance plan continues to provide timely and accurate surveillance. For the most 
recent year assessed, the system tested more than double the number of specimens for ASF and/or 
CSF when compared to the first year of implementation. The investment in electronic data collection 
and management systems has allowed real-time monitoring and analysis of surveillance data. Finally, 
the risk-based, targeted nature of the surveillance system continues to provide an efficient means of 
achieving the objectives of supporting disease freedom, strengthening detection capabilities, and 
improving outbreak preparedness.

• Geographic representativeness could be improved through participation of additional 
premises and a re-evaluation of state-level sample targets to best support current needs 
and animal movement patterns.

COLLABORATIVE GOALS FOR IMPROVING THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM 
Ongoing success of the surveillance plan requires continued collaboration among federal, state, 
and industry partners, particularly in the following focus areas:    
1. Enhance risk-based targeting of swine subpopulations through ongoing disease introduction 
risk analyses. 
2. Re-evaluate state sample target numbers, encourage sample collection from 
underrepresented states, and identify resource needs to efficiently execute geographically 
representative disease surveillance.  
3. Continue to develop and expand the use of tools to capture and share electronic information 
through all surveillance components and through all stages of specimen collection, 
processing, and reporting.

CONCLUSION 
The Swine Hemorrhagic Fevers Integrated Surveillance Plan continues to meet its goals by providing 
ongoing active surveillance for hemorrhagic fevers among the most at-risk animals and populations. 
By adding approved sample types, expanding surveillance within the NAHLN, and improving data 
systems, this surveillance plan continues to provide timely and accurate surveillance. For the most 
recent year assessed, the system tested more than double the number of specimens for ASF and/or 
CSF when compared to the first year of implementation. The investment in electronic data collection 
and management systems has allowed real-time monitoring and analysis of surveillance data. Finally, 
the risk-based, targeted nature of the surveillance system continues to provide an efficient means of 
achieving the objectives of supporting disease freedom, strengthening detection capabilities, and 
improving outbreak preparedness.
