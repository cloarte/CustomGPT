 Reproduccion: A single ploidy level of 2 n = 24 was reported for D. innoxia in Mexico ( Palomino et al., 1988 ). Different levels of ploidy (2 n , 4 n , 6 n ) were reported by Badea and Raicu (1983) , and haploid, diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid cytotypes by Gupta et al. (1984) . The reproductive biology of D. innoxia is described by Henderson (2001) and Parsons and Cuthbertson (1992) . In Mexico, D. innoxia has white, tubular, nectar- and scent-producing, crepuscular flowers

, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid cytotypes by Gupta et al. (1984) . The reproductive biology of D. innoxia is described by Henderson (2001) and Parsons and Cuthbertson (1992) . In Mexico, D. innoxia has white, tubular, nectar- and scent-producing, crepuscular flowers that are self-compatible and pollinated by hawkmoth species mostly within the genera Manduca and Hyles ( Jiménez-Lobato and Núñez-Farfán, 2012 ). Hummingbirds sometimes also visit the flowers of several Datura species but are affected by the alkaloids in the nectar and must limit their consumption, whereas honeybees are apparently unaffected. Datura innoxia can produce flowers and fruit throughout the year in some environments but only from July to September in India ( Parrotta, 2001 ) and September through November in Nicaragua ( Stevens et al., 2001 ). In North America, it has been recorded flowering from March to December in the United States and from April to August in Mexico ( Vibrans, 2009 ). In China, it has been recorded with flowers and fruit from June to September ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ). Germination in D. innoxia is slow, poor and variable due to the presence of an inhibitor in the seed coat ( Singh, 1974 ). In the tropics, D. innoxia often grows as a perennial species, but it will behave as an annual in temperate regions ( USDA-NRCS, 2018 ) . Datura innoxia grows in tropical and temperate climates. It can be found on a wide variety of soils but prefers well-drained soils, on both igneous and sedimentary parent materials. In Puerto Rico, the species grows naturally in areas with 750-1000 mm mean annual precipitation, and from near sea level up to

ate regions ( USDA-NRCS, 2018 ) . Datura innoxia grows in tropical and temperate climates. It can be found on a wide variety of soils but prefers well-drained soils, on both igneous and sedimentary parent materials. In Puerto Rico, the species grows naturally in areas with 750-1000 mm mean annual precipitation, and from near sea level up to an altitude of 900 m ( Stevens et al., 2001 ). In a study of the effects of temperature and light on germination, maximum germination was obtained under continuous light at alternating temperatures of 20° and 30°C. Germination was reduced under continuous darkness ( Barakat et al., 2013 ).
