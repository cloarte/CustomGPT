Subject:  APHIS Reduces Karnal Bunt ( Tilletia indica) Regulated Areas in Pinal County in 
               Arizona  
 
To:   State, Tribal, and Territory Agricultural Regulatory Officials 
  
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is reducing the  
Karnal bunt regulated areas in Pinal County, Arizona. This follows a review of the results of the 
Spring 2024 survey of Karnal bunt-regulated areas in Arizona.  
 
Specifically, APHIS is removing four fields in Pinal County from the list of regulated areas  
because these fields meet the five-year cumulative tillage requirement included in the criteria for 
deregulation listed in 7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 301.89-3(e)(2). Release of these four 
fields from quarantine, including all fields regulated by proximity, will result in the deregulation of 
842 field acres (36 fields). None of this acreage is on Tribal land. With this change, the new total 
regulated area in Arizona is 4,990 field acres.  
 
Accordingly, there are no more restrictions on the interstate movement of Karnal bunt-regulated 
articles from these areas; however, other portions of Maricopa and Pinal Counties in Arizona remain 
regulated. The Arizona Department of Agriculture (AZDA) has established a parallel state quarantine.

Domestic Quarantine Reduction in Pinal County, Arizona for 
Karnal Bunt (Tilletia indica) 
 
DA-2024-41 
October 11, 2024 
 
 
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is reducing the  
total regulated area in Pinal County, Arizona by 842 field acres (36 fields). Accordingly, there are 
no more restrictions on the interstate movement of Karnal bunt-regulated articles from these 
areas; however, other portions of Maricopa and Pinal Counties remain regulated. None of this 
acreage is on Tribal land. With this change, the new total regulated area in Arizona is 4,990 field 
acres.  
 
This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the authority provided by the Plant Protection Act of  
June 20, 2000, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture 
to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant part, or article if  
the Secretary determines the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the dissemination  
of a plant pest within the United States. The regulatory authority provided by 7 U.S.C. 7754  
allows the Secretary to issue orders to carry out this provision of the Plant Protection Act. This  
Federal Order is also issued pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection  
Act for Karnal bunt found at 7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 301.89 et seq.

confirmed by the State Plant Regulatory Official for Arizona. Additionally, the APHIS 
Administrator determined that designating less than an entire state will prevent the spread of 
Karnal bunt.  
 
Following a review of the results of the Spring 2024 survey of Karnal bunt-regulated areas in 
Arizona, APHIS is reducing the regulated area. Specifically, APHIS is removing four fields in 
Pinal County from the list of regulated areas because these fields meet APHIS’ requirements and 
criteria for deregulation. 7 CFR § 301.89-3(e) provides for the release from regulation of fields  
previously infected with Karnal bunt if the field is tilled at least once per year for a total of 5  
years (the years need not be consecutive). After tilling, the field may be planted with a crop or  
left fallow. If the field is planted with a host crop, the crop must test negative, through the 
absence of bunted kernels, for Karnal bunt.

Subject: APHIS Reduces Karnal Bunt (Tilletia indica) Regulated Areas in Maricopa and Pinal 
              Counties in Arizona  
 
To: State, Tribal, and Territory Agricultural Regulatory Officials 
  
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is reducing the  
Karnal bunt regulated areas in Maricopa and Pinal Counties, Arizona. This is following a review 
of the results of the 2023 survey of Karnal bunt-regulated areas in Arizona.  
 
Specifically, APHIS is removing three fields in Pinal County from the list of regulated areas 
because these fields meet the five-year cumulative tillage requirement included in the criteria for 
deregulation listed in 7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 301.89-3(e)(2). 
 
In addition, APHIS is reducing the three-mile buffer area around positive fields in Maricopa and 
Pinal Counties to 0.2 miles based on an analysis APHIS completed on January 26, 2015. The 
analysis determined that a reduced buffer distance of 0.2 miles will provide the desired level of 
phytosanitary protection from Karnal bunt’s causal agent, Tilletia indica. APHIS did not 
implement the reduced buffer in 2015 because it was not operationally and administratively 
feasible to do so based on the number of fields regulated at the time. With the significant 
decrease in the number of infested fields since 2015, APHIS and the Arizona Department of

growers from quarantine requirements and relieve APHIS of continued monitoring in buffer 
fields that never had a positive Karnal bunt detection, without compromising safeguards against

Arizona from Karnal bunt regulation: 15,361 field acres (379 fields) in Maricopa County and 
21,621 field acres (456 fields) in Pinal County, including 11,717 field acres (228 fields) on Ak-
Chin Indian Community tribal land and 6,830 field acres (162 fields) on Salt River Pima-
Maricopa Indian Community tribal lands. Accordingly, there are no more restrictions on the

This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the authority provided by the Plant Protection Act of

however, other portions of Maricopa and Pinal Counties remain regulated. 
 
Section 7 CFR § 301.89-3(b) allows the designation of less than an entire state as a Karnal bunt 
regulated area only when the APHIS Administrator has determined, as in this case, that the 
designation of less than an entire state as a quarantined-Karnal bunt area is adequate is to prevent 
the intrastate spread of Karnal bunt. In addition, 7 CFR § 301.89-3(b)(1)(i) requires that the state 
enforce an intrastate Karnal bunt quarantine equivalent to the federal regulations. The state plant 
regulatory official for Arizona confirmed the establishment of an intrastate quarantine for the 
regulated area that mirrors the Federal Regulatory requirements as specified in CFR § 301.89 et 
seq. 
 
Following a review of the results of the 2023 survey of Karnal bunt-regulated areas in Arizona,

phytosanitary protection from Karnal bunt’s causal agent, Tilletia indica. APHIS did not 
implement the reduced buffer in 2015 because it was not operationally and administratively 
feasible to do so based on the number of fields regulated at the time. With the significant 
decrease in the number of infested fields since 2015, APHIS and the Arizona Department of

e to the above changes, APHIS is removing a total of 36,982 field acres (835 fields) in 
Arizona from Karnal bunt regulation: 15,361 field acres (379 fields) in Maricopa County and 
21,621 field acres (456 fields) in Pinal County, including 11,717 field acres (228 fields) on Ak-
Chin Indian Community tribal land and 6,830 field acres (162 fields) on Salt River Pima-
Maricopa Indian Community tribal lands. Accordingly, there are no more restrictions on the 
interstate movement of Karnal bunt-regulated articles from these areas; however, other portions 
of Maricopa and Pinal Counties remain regulated. AZDA has established a parallel state 
quarantine. 
 
Karnal bunt is a fungal pest that affects wheat quality. APHIS regulates this plant disease because 
many trading partners require that U.S. wheat be certified as grown in areas free of Karnal bunt.

FEDERAL ORDER 
 
Domestic Quarantine for 
Karnal Bunt (Tilletia indica) 
 
DA-2024-05 
February 14, 2024 
 
This Federal Order reduces the Karnal bunt-regulated areas in Maricopa and Pinal Counties in 
Arizona.  
 
This Federal Order is issued pursuant to the authority provided by the Plant Protection Act of  
June 20, 2000, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture  
to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate commerce of any plant, plant part, or article if 
the Secretary determines the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the dissemination 
of a plant pest within the United States. The regulatory authority provided by 7 U.S.C. 7754  
allows the Secretary to issue orders to carry out this provision of the Plant Protection Act. This  
Federal Order is also issued pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection 
Act found at 7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 301.89 et seq.  
 
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is reducing the 
total regulated area in Arizona by 36,982 field acres (835 fields): 15,361 field acres (379 fields) 
in Maricopa County and 21,621 field acres (456 fields) in Pinal County, including 11,717 field 
acres (228 fields) on Ak-Chin Indian Community tribal land and 6,830 field acres (162 fields) on 
Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community tribal lands. Accordingly, there are no more 
restrictions on the interstate movement of Karnal bunt regulated articles from these areas;

 in Pinal County, including 11,717 field 
acres (228 fields) on Ak-Chin Indian Community tribal land and 6,830 field acres (162 fields) on 
Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community tribal lands. Accordingly, there are no more 
restrictions on the interstate movement of Karnal bunt regulated articles from these areas; 
however, other portions of Maricopa and Pinal Counties remain regulated. 
 
Section 7 CFR § 301.89-3(b) allows the designation of less than an entire state as a Karnal bunt 
regulated area only when the APHIS Administrator has determined, as in this case, that the 
designation of less than an entire state as a quarantined-Karnal bunt area is adequate is to prevent 
the intrastate spread of Karnal bunt. In addition, 7 CFR § 301.89-3(b)(1)(i) requires that the state 
enforce an intrastate Karnal bunt quarantine equivalent to the federal regulations. The state plant 
regulatory official for Arizona confirmed the establishment of an intrastate quarantine for the 
regulated area that mirrors the Federal Regulatory requirements as specified in CFR § 301.89 et 
seq. 
 
Following a review of the results of the 2023 survey of Karnal bunt-regulated areas in Arizona, 
APHIS is reducing the regulated area. Specifically, APHIS is removing three fields in Pinal 
County from the list of regulated areas because these fields meet APHIS’ requirements and 
criteria for deregulation. 7 CFR § 301.89-3(e) provides for the release from regulation of fields 
previously infected with Karnal bunt if the field is tilled at least once per year for a total of 5 
years

County from the list of regulated areas because these fields meet APHIS’ requirements and 
criteria for deregulation. 7 CFR § 301.89-3(e) provides for the release from regulation of fields 
previously infected with Karnal bunt if the field is tilled at least once per year for a total of 5 
years (the years need not be consecutive). After tilling, the field may be planted with a crop or 
left fallow. If the field is planted with a host crop, the crop must test negative, through the 
absence of bunted kernels, for Karnal bunt. 
 
In addition, on January 26, 2015, APHIS completed an analysis that determined that a reduced 
buffer distance of 0.2 miles will provide the desired level of phytosanitary protection from 
Karnal bunt’s causal agent, Tilletia indica. Accordingly, APHIS is reducing the three-mile buffer 
area around positive fields in Maricopa and Pinal Counties to 0.2 miles. APHIS did not 
implement the reduced buffer in 2015 because it was not operationally and administratively 
feasible to do so because of the number of fields regulated at the time. With the significant 
decrease in the number of infested fields since 2015, APHIS and the Arizona Department of 
Agriculture (AZDA) are now instituting the 0.2-mile buffer. The buffer reduction frees multiple 
growers from quarantine requirements and relieves APHIS of continued monitoring in buffer 
fields that never had a positive Karnal bunt detection, without compromising safeguards against 
the spread of T. indica. This action to reduce the buffer is consistent with the regulations at 7 
CFR 301.89-

fields that never had a positive Karnal bunt detection, without compromising safeguards against 
the spread of T. indica. This action to reduce the buffer is consistent with the regulations at 7 
CFR 301.89-3(c) that provide for the temporary designation of regulated areas and the 
termination of the temporary designation provided that the owner or person in possession of, or, 
in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for 
which the designation is terminated is given written notice of the termination by APHIS.  
 
Regulated areas § 301.89-3(a):  
 
Arizona – regulated portions of the State: 
 
Maricopa County:  
(1) Scottsdale: Sections 28, 29, 32 and 33 of Township 2 North and Range 5 East. 
 
(2) Palo Verde: Sections 7, and 17 through 20 of Township 1 South and Range 4 West; and 
Sections 12 and 13 of Township 1 South and Range 5 West. 
 
Pinal County: 
(1) Maricopa: Section 34 of Township 4 South and Range 3 East; Sections 3, 11, and 14 of 
Township 5 South and Range 3 East. 
 
In accordance with 7 CFR § 301.89-3(a), this Federal Order replaces Federal Order DA-2023-05 
issued April 24, 2023, and a list of the revised Karnal bunt regulated areas is published on the 
APHIS Karnal Bunt webpage. APHIS will follow this action by publishing a notice in the 
Federal Register.
