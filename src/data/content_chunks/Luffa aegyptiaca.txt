 Invasion: Sponge gourd is a vigorous-growing vine comprising five angled stems with tendrils on the axils of leaves to facilitate climbing. The leaves are broadly ovate to reniform, dark green with silvery patches on the topside, 5–7 deep lobes, dentate, scabrous, 6–25 x 8–27 cm, apex acute, base cordate, petiole hispid and 5–10 cm long (Purseglove, 1976). The flowers are monoecious, produced on leaf axils, and consist of five petals of a conspicuous yellow colour, 5–10 cm across, united below in a bell-shaped corolla, open in early morning. The staminate flowers are produced in racemes of 4–20 and contain five free stamens. The pistillate flowers are borne either singly on a separate node or in association with staminate inflorescence. The lower nodes usually bear only staminate inflorescence, middle nodes both staminate inflorescence and pistillate flowers, and terminal nodes only pistillate flowers (Omini and Hossain, 1987). The female flowers have three stigmas and a smooth, cylindrical ovary. The fruits are green with longitudinal marked lines, up to 61 cm long and 7.6 cm in diameter, shaped like a large cylindrical pepo (berry). The endocarp is the edible portion of the fruit that later becomes fibrous and spongy. The seeds are borne with parietal placentation. The dry, mature fruit is composed of an outer hard shell and an inner dense network of cellulose fibre (sponge) containing hundreds of flat, smooth, black seeds (Shah et al., 1980). The fruit is essentially an inferior berry, even though it is called a pepo because of its hard, tough rind

 Reproduccion: Sponge gourd has an annual growth habit. It is propagated by seeds obtained from ripe fruits. The plant is a vine with tendrils bearing monoecious flowers. The pistillate flowers are pollinated by insects. Although sponge gourd is considered a cross pollinated crop, the absence of self-incompatibility permits natural self pollination taking place within the same plant. As insects do not differentiate flowers from the same or different plants, 20–40% self pollination can be expected. To ensure the visit of pollinating insects, the flowers are showy in colour, large in size and staminate flowers are produced in greater abundance than pistillate ones ( Seshadri, 1999 ). Smooth luffa produces fruits that are grouped as pepo. Each fruit contains hundreds of flat, smooth, black seeds. Sponge gourd tolerates a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires warm summer temperatures and a long, frost-free growing season for maximum yield. The average temperature should be around 30–35°C. It grows best at altitudes below 500 m. Sponge gourd seeds require warm soil to germinate. The growing season can be extended by using transplants grown under glass earlier in the season. Well distributed rainfall during the growing season is needed for optimum crop growth and both growth and yield

The growing season can be extended by using transplants grown under glass earlier in the season. Well distributed rainfall during the growing season is needed for optimum crop growth and both growth and yield are substantially reduced under water stress. Soil moisture of at least 10–15% above the permanent wilting point is required to maintain growth ( Seshadri, 1999 ). Excessive rainfall during the flowering and fruiting period can damage yield and lower fruit quality ( Tindall, 1983 ). Sponge gourd will grow on many soil types but well-drained sandy loams are preferred. It is sensitive to acid soils; the optimal soil pH is 6.0–6.8.
