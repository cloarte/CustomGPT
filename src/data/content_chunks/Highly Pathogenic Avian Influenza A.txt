APHIS Recommendations for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 Virus in Livestock 
For Workers 
April 12, 2024 
 
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus is an emerging disease in cattle. While it is unclear 
exactly how virus is being moved around, the virus is shed in milk at high concentrations; therefore, 
anything that comes in contact with unpasteurized milk, spilled milk, etc. may spread the virus including 
humans, other animals, vehicles, and other objects or materials. This continues to be a rapidly evolving 
situation. USDA and Federal and State partners will continue to share additional updates as soon as 
information becomes available. 
Specific Farm Worker Safety Recommendations (Contributed by CDC) 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends: 
• Persons working with or around cattle, including those working with or disposing of milk waste, 
that are suspected or confirmed with H5N1 virus infection should wear personal protective 
equipment (PPE) when in direct or close contact (within about 6 feet) with sick or dead animals, 
animal feces, litter, milk, or materials known to be or potentially contaminated with H5N1 viruses. 
• Recommended PPE includes properly fitted unvented or indirectly vented safety goggles or a face 
shield (if there is risk of liquid splash onto the respirator), disposable gloves, boots or boot covers, 
a NIOSH Approved®* particulate respirator (e.g., N95® filtering facepiece respirator) *, disposable 
fluid-resistant coveralls, and disposable head cover or hair cover. Perform thorough hand washing 
before putting on and taking off PPE.

 the respirator), disposable gloves, boots or boot covers, 
a NIOSH Approved®* particulate respirator (e.g., N95® filtering facepiece respirator) *, disposable 
fluid-resistant coveralls, and disposable head cover or hair cover. Perform thorough hand washing 
before putting on and taking off PPE. 
o For younger children, it is important to remember that respirators are designed primarily 
to be used by adults in workplaces. The risks and benefits of children using them are not 
yet fully known. Additionally, for a respirator to be most effective, it must form a seal to 
the face to keep particles from leaking around the edges. Some respirators may be too big 
for younger children’s faces. 
• Persons working with or around cattle, even if not in close contact, should avoid eating, 
drinking, smoking, chewing gum, and other such activities in potentially contaminated areas; 
avoid rubbing or touching the eyes, as it can result in conjunctivitis (pink eye). They should 
perform thorough handwashing regularly, especially before eating, smoking, touching your face, 
and leaving work (including breaks), and before and after wearing PPE or going to the 
bathroom. 
• People exposed to H5N1 virus-infected cattle (including people wearing recommended PPE) 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness beginning after their 
first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Signs and symptoms in people can 
include: 
o Mild illness (e.g., cough, sore throat, eye redness or eye discharge such as conjunctivitis, 
fever or feeling feverish, rhinorrhea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache) 
o People exposed to H5

 10 days after their last exposure. Signs and symptoms in people can 
include: 
o Mild illness (e.g., cough, sore throat, eye redness or eye discharge such as conjunctivitis, 
fever or feeling feverish, rhinorrhea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache) 
o People exposed to H5N1 virus-infected cattle (including people wearing recommended 
PPE) should be monitored for signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness beginning 
after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Signs and symptoms in 
people can include: 
o Moderate to severe illness: (e.g., shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, altered 
mental status, seizures) 

2  
o Complications: pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
multi-organ failure (respiratory and kidney failure), sepsis, meningoencephalitis 
• If any person exposed to H5N1 virus infected cattle develops acute respiratory illness symptoms (see 
above) during the monitoring period, the person should seek medical attention and isolate.
