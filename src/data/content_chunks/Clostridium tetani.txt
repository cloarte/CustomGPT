1. Reagent Name: Clostridium tetani Antitoxin 5.0 AU/mL (guinea pig origin) 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 466 
4. Fill Date: August 10, 2010 
5. Expiration Date: August 31, 2028 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: To serve as the positive control serum when determining the antitoxin 
titer of guinea pig serum by ELISA, as outlined in Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) 217. 
7. Instructions for Use: Use according to SAM 217. 
8. Test of Reagent: The antitoxin titer of IRP 466 was quantitated by ELISA and the 
guinea pig toxin-antitoxin neutralization test as described in SAM 217, and title 9, Code of 
Federal Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.451, respectively. The serum contains 5.0 American 
antitoxin units per mL (AU/mL). The serum has been tested for the presence of viable bacteria 
and fungi as described in 9 CFR 113.26. No viable bacteria or fungi were found in the test vials. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 
240 µL. 
10. Storage Conditions: Store IRP 466 at -20°C or lower. After thawing, store at 2°- 7°C. 
Repeated freezing and thawing is not recommended.
