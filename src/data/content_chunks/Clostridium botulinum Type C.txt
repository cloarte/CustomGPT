P. O. Box 844 
Ames, IA 50010 ATTENTION: 
Select Agent shipping 
requirements must be 
met for >10 vials 1. Reagent Name: Clostridium botulinum Type C Toxin 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 583 
4. Fill Date: January 24, 2012 
5. Expiration Date: No expiration date has been assigned to this product because 
C. botulinum type C toxin has demonstrated over time to be very stable if properly stored. 
Precautions: Exposure to the toxin of C. botulinum is a primary hazard. The toxin may be 
absorbed after ingestion or following contact with the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes, 
including the respiratory tract. 
6. Intended Use: To serve as the standard toxin for potency testing of C. botulinum type C 
bacterin-toxoids. 
7. Instructions for Use: C. botulinum type C toxin IRP 583 diluted 1:10 is considered the 
standard toxin dilution when conducting potency tests in mink as outlined in title 9, Code of 
Federal Regulations (9 CFR), part 113.110. Prepare the dilution by adding 1.0 mL of IRP 583 to 
9.0 mL of sterile Phosphate buffer saline (PBS)

 C toxin IRP 583 diluted 1:10 is considered the 
standard toxin dilution when conducting potency tests in mink as outlined in title 9, Code of 
Federal Regulations (9 CFR), part 113.110. Prepare the dilution by adding 1.0 mL of IRP 583 to 
9.0 mL of sterile Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 0.2% gelatin, pH 7.2.IRP 583 diluted 1:10 
contains 104.0 mouse minimum lethal dose (MLD) per 0.5 mL. 
8. Test of Reagent: 
Determination of MLD - White female mice weighing 16-23 grams were injected in the 
intraperitoneal cavity with 0.5 mL of toxin diluted in PBS with 0.2% gelatin. The toxin was 
found to contain 104.0 mouse minimum lethal dose (MLD) per 0.5 mL when diluted 1:10. 
LD50 Determination -White female mice weighing 16-23 grams were injected in the 
intraperitoneal cavity with 0.5 mL of toxin diluted in PBS with 0.2% gelatin. The toxin was 
found to contain 1:230,000 LD50 per 0.5 mL dose. 
Sterility test - The toxin was tested for sterility and found to be free of viable bacteria and fungi.

12. Origin and Passage History: C. botulinum type C (African strain) 203A was used to 
produce IRP 583. It was obtained in June 1968 from Fromm Laboratories, 703 Lakeshore Road, 
Grafton, WI 53024. 
13. Method of Preparation: Dialysis membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 12,000-
14,000 daltons were filled with PBS and suspended in 1-liter trypsinizing flasks containing 
proteose peptone-trypticase-yeast extract media with dextrose. The flasks were autoclaved at 
121ºC for 25 minutes, cooled, and incubated at 35ºC in an atmosphere containing 5% carbon 
dioxide, 10% hydrogen, and 85% nitrogen. Approximately 0.5 mL of actively growing culture 
203A was aseptically added to the inside of each dialysis membrane and incubated for 120 hours 
in an anaerobic atmosphere as previously described. The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 x g 
for 60 minutes. The culture supernatant was adjusted to pH 6.8 and passed through a Millipore 
filtration unit containing a 0.22-µm membrane. The toxin was diluted 1:2.5 with 1X Phosphate 
buffered saline
