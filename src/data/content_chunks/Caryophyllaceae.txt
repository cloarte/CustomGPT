Placentation free, central, rarely basal; ovules (1 or) few or numerous, campylotropous. Styles (1 or)2--5, sometimes united at base. Fruit usually a capsule, with pericarp crustaceous, scarious, or papery, dehiscing by teeth or valves 1 or 2 × as many as styles, rarely berrylike with irregular dehiscence or an achene. Seeds 1 to numerous, reniform, ovoid, or rarely dorsiventrally compressed, abaxially grooved, blunt, or sharply pointed, rarely fimbriate-pectinate; testa granular, striate or tuberculate, rarely smooth or spongy; embryo strongly curved and surrounding perisperm or straight but eccentric; perisperm mealy.Between 75 and 80 genera and ca. 2000 species: widespread but mainly of temperate or warm-temperate occurrence in the N hemisphere, with principal centers of distribution in the Mediterranean region and W Asia to W China and the Himalayas, fewer species in Africa S of the Sahara, America, and Oceania; 30 genera (two endemic) and 390 species (193 endemic) in China.Arenaria,Silene,andStellariacontain over half the species in the family in China.

The main uses of this family are medicinal and ornamental.Dianthus superbus,Pseudostellaria heterophylla,Stellaria dichotomavar.lanceolata,andVaccaria hispanicaare commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Some species ofArenaria,Dianthus,Gypsophila,Psammosilene,andSileneare used as medicinal herbs among the people or are habitually used in local Chinese medicine. Many species ofDianthus,Gypsophila,Lychnis,Saponaria,andSileneare grown as ornamentals.Atocion armeria(Linnaeus) Rafinesque (Silene armeriaLinnaeus), native to Russia and Europe, is also cultivated in China. It differs fromSilenein having a corymbose inflorescence and obscure calyx veins.
