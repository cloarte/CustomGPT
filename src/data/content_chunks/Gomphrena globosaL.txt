Plant Notes:  Common Globe Amaranth is an introduced annual herb in the Amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). It is native to Central America, but is widely cultivated around the world. In Alabama it has been collected as a waif in the central and northern portions of the state. Common Globe Amaranth grows on roadsides, in vacant lots, and on other disturbed sites. It is an erect herb from 1-3 feet in height with fibrous roots. The stems are branched, green or reddish in color, pubescent, with slightly inflated nodes. Leaves are opposite, petiolate, obovate or oblong in outline, ciliate along the undulate margins, and pubescent. Flowers are produced in terminal heads. The heads are globose or cylindric in outline and white, purple, or pink in color. The individual flowers have their filaments united into a tube, 5-parted at the apex, and are subtended by a colored bract. The fruit is an utricle. Common Globe Amaranth is a popular garden plant for its long-lasting flowers which retain their color when dried.-- A. Diamond.  ;
