2024 Spending Plan for the Wild Cervid Chronic Wasting Disease 
Management and Response Activities 2024 Cooperative Agreements 
 
USDA APHIS WS is awarding $5,500,000 through Cooperative Agreements to seventeen State Departments 
of Wildlife (totaling approximately $3,076,511), one State Department of Agriculture (totaling 
approximately $184,745), ten universities (totaling approximately $2,140,204) and one Tribal government 
(totaling approximately $98,539). These projects will allow recipients to further develop and implement 
CWD management, response, and research activities in wild cervids, including surveillance and testing. 
Funded projects are listed below.
