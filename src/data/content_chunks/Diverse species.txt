23 rd Meeting of the Panel on Diagnostics in Bacteriology Teleconference 2020-05-12/15 The EPPO Panel on Diagnostics in Bacteriology met by videoconference. Only selected points of the agenda prepared for the original meeting (before it needed to be changed to a teleconference) were considered. The composition of the EPPO Panel on Diagnostics in Bacteriology can be found on the EPPO website. Participants Revised EPPO Diagnostic Protocols reviewed during the meeting The Panel reviewed 8 revised Diagnostic Protocols. PM 7/020 E rwinia amylovora A revised version of the Diagnostic Protocol prepared by a drafting team composed of experts from AGES (AT), INIAV (PT), NIB (SI), IPN (PT) was discussed. The Panel agreed with most of the changes made to the protocol by the drafting team including the removal of some tests and the inclusion of new validation data obtained from a test performance study (TPS) organized within the framework of the EU-funded project VALITEST. The flow diagram was also discussed and modified to be consistent with other diagnostic protocols. The new version of the Diagnostic Protocol will be sent for country consultation if possible, during summer 2020. PM 7/021 Ralstonia solanacearum, R. pseudosolanacearum and R. syzygii ( Ralstonia solanacearum species complex) A proposed revision of the Diagnostic Protocol prepared by the EPPO Secretariat following the revision of the Diagnostic Protocol for Clavibacter sepedonicus was discussed by the Panel. The Panel agreed on the addition of the NYtor real-time TaqMan PCR test that can be used in multiplex to detect and identify C. sepedonicus, R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum in asymptomatic potato tubers.

 Diagnostic Protocol for Clavibacter sepedonicus was discussed by the Panel. The Panel agreed on the addition of the NYtor real-time TaqMan PCR test that can be used in multiplex to detect and identify C. sepedonicus, R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum in asymptomatic potato tubers. The Panel decided to revise the flow diagram to make it more comprehensive. The Diagnostic Protocol will be revised by a group of experts and sent for country consultation during summer 2020. PM 7/059 Clavibacter sepedonicus The comments received during country consultation and some modifications suggested by the drafting team to address these comments were reviewed. The flow diagram will be revised to make it more comprehensive as for PM 7/021. The Diagnostic Protocol will be finalized and sent for the final approval (formal objection) stage during summer 2020. PM 7/064 Xanthomonas arboricola pv . pruni The comments received during country consultation and modifications suggested by the drafting team to address these comments were reviewed. The Diagnostic Protocol will be finalized and sent for the final approval (formal objection) during summer 2020. PM 7/096 Xylophilus ampelinus The Panel discussed the discrepancy of results obtained with the tests from Dreo et al. (2007) and Manceau et al. (2005); the test from Botha et al . (2001) was presented as a possible new test to be added to the diagnostic protocol. The Panel agreed that more validation data was needed to decide which tests to recommend in the EPPO Diagnostic Protocol. The TPS organised in the framework of VALITEST and additional validation to be undertaken in Slovenia may provide useful information. The revision will be considered at the next meeting of the Panel.

PM 7/099 Clavibacter insidiosus (formerly Clavibacter michiganensis subsp . insidiosus ) A revised protocol prepared by a drafting team composed of experts from Anses (FR), Fera (GB), INIAV (PT) and UNIMORE (IT) was presented to the Panel. The Panel discussed the tests to be maintained in the protocol noting that only a few laboratories in the region perform tests for C. insidiosus . Validation data provided by Anses (FR) has been added to the protocol. The Panel noted that a conventional PCR and a real-time PCR (Marefat et al ., 2007) are described in a book chapter recently published for seed testing and recommended that contact should be made with the authors of this chapter to try to obtain validation data. The drafting group will meet again in early July 2020 to finalize the document and prepare it for country consultation after circulation to the Panel. PM 7/120 Pseudomonas syringae pv . actinidiae A revision of this EPPO Diagnostic Protocol prepared by experts from CREA-DC (IT), IPN (PT), UNIMORE (IT) and ZHAW (CH) was presented. The revision was initiated incorporate the outcome of a Euphresco project ‘ Pseudomonas syringae pv . actinidiae (PSA): diagnosis, detection, identification and study of epidemiological aspects ( PSADID )’. Based on performance characteristics, the list of tests recommended has been adjusted. The new version of the Diagnostic Protocol that takes into account the discussions of the Panel

Based on performance characteristics, the list of tests recommended has been adjusted. The new version of the Diagnostic Protocol that takes into account the discussions of the Panel and that includes a new flow diagram will be sent for country consultation during summer 2020. PM 7/121 ' Candidatus Liberibacter africanus’, ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter americanus’ and ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ A revision of this EPPO Diagnostic Protocol was prepared by an expert from Anses (FR). The revision was initiated to consider the results of the Euphresco project ‘Comparison of multiple real-time PCR & real-time LAMP detection methods for the plant pathogen ' Candidatus Liberibacter spp.’ causing the Huanglongbing disease on Citrus spp. ( HLBVALID )’. A new version of the Diagnostic Protocol will be prepared to take into account the discussions during the meeting, it will be sent to the Panel for approval and then for country consultation during summer 2020. Plans for future new diagnostic protocols to be presented at the next meeting PM 7/NEW Dickeya and Pectobacterium spp. A first draft of the Diagnostic Protocol has been prepared by a drafting team composed of experts from AGES (AT), ILVO (BE), GVA (ES), FN3PT (FR), Fera (GB), SASA (GB), UNIMORE (IT) and NAK (NL). The drafting team will continue to work on the Diagnostic Protocol in the next months and the new draft will be sent to the Panel by the end of 2020. Other topics Euphresco
