Fruit a capsule, sometimes enclosed by fleshy sepals, dehiscent to indehiscent; seeds usually angular, arillate, often muricate, ridged or reticulate with a punctiform or linear scar, usually with copious mealy endosperm and minute embryo beneath an embryotega (disc-like structure). The family has c. 37 genera and nearly 600 species, chiefly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions; represented in Pakistan by 6 genera and 14 species.
