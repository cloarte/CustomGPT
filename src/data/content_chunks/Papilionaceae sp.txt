Leaf rarely simple, mostly compound, unifoliolate, pinnately or palmately compound; stipels sometimes present. Inflorescence solitary, racemose, paniculate or umbellate, capitate or spicate. Flower zygomorphic. Calyx gamosepalous. Corolla polypetalous or sometimes united, vexillary imbricate, differentiated into the upper bigger outermost petal or vexillum, the two lateral wings, and the 2 innermost, sometimes united along the margin, forming the carina or keel. Stamens 10, rarely fewer, free or fused, mostly the adaxial stamen free or nearly so and the 9 united together, anthers uniform or dimorphic, basifixed or dorsifixed. Ovary unicarpellary, mostly unilocular, many-1 ovules on the adaxial suture. Fruit dehiscent by 2 or 1 sutures or indehiscent, or jointed and breaking up into 1-seeded parts.
