Lycium sp.- Duke of Argyll's tea plant  -Solanaceae© Paul Hackney© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)A scrambling deciduous shrub, often spiny, with oval or elliptical leaves and small purple flowers with yellow stamens. It is particularly frequent around the coast where it is found in hedges, normally close to a house. It is an introduction from China. Two species (Lycium barbarumandL. chinense) are grouped together here - they are not easily separated, and it is doubtful if they are really specifically distinct.The curious common name is of 19th century origin and strictly speaking applies only toLycium barbarum. It refers to the 3rd Duke of Argyll who received this plant and a tea plant (Camellia sinensis) with their labels mixed up, and so grew it under the wrong label at his home in Middlesex, England.
