Plant Notes:  Spring Sneezeweed is a native herbaceous perennial in the Sunflower family (Asteraceae). It occurs in the southern third of Alabama. Spring Sneezeweed occurs in Pitcher Plant Bogs, in seeps, in pine flatwoods, and on wet roadsides. It is a perennial from a short rhizome. Leaves form a basal rosette, and a few occur on the scape. The basal leaves are obovate to oblanceolate in outline, sessile or with a winged petiole, glabrous, and entire. Stem leaves are lanceolate in outline, sessile, with entire margins. The stem leaves are decurrent on the stem (the blade tissue of the leaf extends down the stem forming wings). Stems are 1-1 ½ feet tall, usually unbranched, slightly winged, and glabrous or slightly pubescent. Each scape usually has a single head of flowers. The heads are composed of 100-800 yellow disc flowers and 13-30 yellow ray flowers. The fruit is a glabrous achene. Spring Sneezeweed is listed as an S2 species in Alabama (typically 6 to 20 occurrences, few remaining individuals, acres, or miles of stream, or factors demonstrably making it very vulnerable in the state), and globally as a G4 species (imperiled globally because of rarity (6 - 20 occurrences, or few remaining acres
