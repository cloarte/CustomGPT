Dear Mr. Carlesco: 
We have reviewed your request for correction made pursuant to the Data Quality 
Act (DQA), dated December 20, 2017. Your request claims that the USDA Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), inappropriately relies on the 
University of California, Coop. Ext. Serv. Bulletin 1872 publication, Connolly, 
G.E. and W.M. Longhurst, 1975, The Effects of Control on Coyote Populations: A 
Simulation Model (“Connolly and Longhurst”).  Your request included three 
recommendations for correction:  
1. Retract from current and future agency usage the USDA-funded study: 
Connolly, G.E., and W.M. Longhurst, 1975, The effects of control on coyote 
populations: A simulation model, University of California, Division of 
Agricultural Sciences Bulletin, Volume 1872, 37 pp. 
2. Issue a public statement explaining the reasons for this retraction. 
3. Send a letter to other relevant USDA offices, the Department of Interior, and 
all state game agencies requesting that they refrain from relying on this 
retracted study for any regulatory or public health purpose.   
APHIS disagrees with your characterization of Connolly and Longhurst, and

3. Send a letter to other relevant USDA offices, the Department of Interior, and 
all state game agencies requesting that they refrain from relying on this 
retracted study for any regulatory or public health purpose.   
APHIS disagrees with your characterization of Connolly and Longhurst, and the 
agency is not persuaded that a correction is warranted.  First we’d like to address 
the claim that Connolly and Longhurst is inaccurate and unreliable. Although the 
DQA establishes that peer-reviewed studies are considered scientifically objective, 
the inverse that non-peer reviewed are by default biased and not objective is a false 
premise. At the time it was authored, Connolly and Longhurst used state of the art 
computing power to develop coyote population models that were innovative for 
their time. Despite shortcomings which were acknowledged by the authors 
themselves, subsequent population modeling published in peer-reviewed sources 
since have substantiated the original findings of Connolly and Longhurst.  For 
instance, Pitt et al. (2001), A new approach to understanding canid populations 
using an individual-based computer model: preliminary results, used a different 
approach to model coyote populations but similarly found that the removal of at 
least 60% of the population each year for 50 years would be necessary to affect a 
population level change.  These results are consistent with Connolly and 
Longhurst, and revisited by Connolly (1995), which indicated that coyote 
populations could withstand an annual removal of up to 70% of their numbers and

still maintain a viable population.  Connolly and Longhurst’s use of a deterministic single-
population model was an important step in increasing our understanding of coyote 
population dynamics with and without management.  This and subsequent efforts have 
resulted in the effective management of coyote depredation through both non-lethal and 
lethal methods, while coyote populations have remained robust and have been expanding in 
North America.  
Second, your letter mischaracterizes the underlying purpose of APHIS’s integrated wildlife 
damage management approach to manage coyote depredation on livestock.  Specifically, 
you state: “The Connolly and Longhurst study lacks utility for USDA’s intended purpose of 
evaluating and authorizing large-scale coyote extermination.” Your request repeatedly refers 
to “eradication,” “extermination,” or wide-scale control. In fact, APHIS Wildlife Services’ 
mission is to provide Federal leadership for science-based wildlife – human conflict 
management to other wildlife management professionals, the public, external organizations, 
and research institutions that is both accountable and transparent.

mission is to provide Federal leadership for science-based wildlife – human conflict 
management to other wildlife management professionals, the public, external organizations, 
and research institutions that is both accountable and transparent.  When APHIS conducts 
coyote damage management activities, its goal is to reduce livestock depredation while 
minimizing impacts on coyote populations. APHIS’s annual coyote take must be put in 
context with the continental scale of the population, and the relatively small geographic 
extent of APHIS coyote damage management activities. APHIS does not rely on Connolly 
and Longhurst to justify maximum allowable take levels, but rather to demonstrate that 
APHIS’s targeted removal is dramatically below levels that could be expected to impact 
coyote populations.   
Third, your request implies that APHIS relies solely on Connolly and Longhurst in reaching 
conclusions that our actions do not threaten the long term viability of coyote populations 
and healthy ecosystems. In fact, APHIS National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
documents rely upon an extensive body of scientific evidence in the decision making 
process.  Coyote damage management is undertaken after completion of an Environmental 
Assessment, which includes a public comment period and, if appropriate, issuance of a 
subsequent Finding of No Significant Impact.      
Therefore, after careful consideration of your claims, APHIS has determined that correction 
is not warranted, and it will not adopt the recommendations proposed in your request.  
APHIS will ensure that future environmental analyses clearly reference the entire relevant 
body of work related to coyote population
