 Reproduccion: V. marina has a chromosome number of 2n=22 ( Maréchal et al., 1978 ). It has been reported that it can from fertile hybrids with the closely related species V. luteola. V. marina reproduces by producing seeds and based on flower colour and shape, this short-lived perennial is likely to be pollinated by bees. However, it is capable of self-pollination ( Chankaew et al., 2013 ). Seeds are produced in non-shattering pods and disperse on ocean currents; the seeds can withstand salt water ( Smith, 1991 ; Chankaew et al., 2013 ). Germination of seeds is improved by chemical and mechanical scarification ( Lilleeng-Rosenberger, 2006 ). The plant is a halophile (salt tolerant) ( Chankaew et al., 2013 ). It can produce flowers and fruit all year round

It can produce flowers and fruit all year round ( Useful Tropical Plants, 2016 ). V. marina is a short lived plant (living less than five years) ( Staples et al., 2005 ). V. marina is a legume and as such can fix nitrogen from the air using bacteria present in root nodules. This converts atmospheric nitrogen into a form which is useable by plants ( Elanchezhian et al., 2009 ). V. marina requires annual rainfall of at last 500 mm and is sensitive to frost ( Useful Tropical Plants, 2016 ). It is salt tolerant and can grow in poorly drained soils. As such, it naturally grows at sea level on sea shores, coastal lagoons and river mouths.
