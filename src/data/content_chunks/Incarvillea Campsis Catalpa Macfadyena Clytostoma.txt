Bignoniaceae YASIN J. NASIR National Herbarium, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, Islamabad. Trees or shrubs, often climbers, rarely herbs. Leaves usually opposite, simple or compound, often modified into tendrillar organs, exstipulate. Flowers showy, bisexual, ± irregular, hypogynous. Calyx campanulate, truncate or 5-lobed. Corolla broad campanulate or tubular, 2-lipped; upper lip 2-lobed. Stamens 4—5. epipetalous, didynamous; staminodes present or not; anthers bilocular, dehiscing longitudinally. Disk present or absent. Ovary 2(-1)-locular with many ovlues on axile placentas. Fruit a capsule or sometimes a berry (Kigelia). Seeds winged (not in Kigelia). A family of c. 120 genera and c. 800 species; mostly tropical South America, but also in the tropics and subtropics of the old world. Represented in Pakistan by 3 native genera and 13 frequently cultivated species. Some additional cultivated taxa not included in the key, are mentioned below. Additional TaxaMany other species of Bignoniceae are cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Some of these are now finding their way into local Horticultural Catalogues but as yet appear to be rarely grown in Pakistan. These are:1. Pandorea jasminoides (Lindl.)
