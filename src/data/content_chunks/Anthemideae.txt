, orange, or red. Disk florets bisexual or male, tubular or funnel-shaped, usually yellow, rarely whitish, purplish, or red, usually 4- or 5-lobed. Anthers mostly rounded, rarely shortly tailed at base, apical appendage ovate or triangular to subulate. Pollen with or without spines. Style base slender or bulbous; style branches usually free (rarely fused in functionally male florets), usually linear, rarely wider, with apex truncate, penicillate. Achenes often obovoid, obconical, or cylindric, sometimes dorsiventrally flattened, apex rounded or truncate, true pappus absent, sometimes with a pappuslike corona of rather few scarious or bristlelike scales, or with an auricle, usually adaxial.About 110 genera and ca. 1,750 species: worldwide, mainly concentrated in C Asia, the Mediterranean region, and S Africa; 29 genera (two endemic, four introduced) and 364 species (138 endemic, ten introduced) in China.This tribe includes well-known vegetables (Glebionis carinata,G. coronaria, andG. segetum) and famous ornamental plants (most notably"Chrysanthemum grandiflorum"; see note underChrysanthemum). Insecticides are extracted from some species (e.g.,Tanacetum (Pyrethrum) cinerariifolium). Other species are very important medicinally (e.g.,Artemisia annua, the source of the important anti-malarial drug artemisinin) while some are significant forage plants in dry regions.The generic sequence follows Oberprieler et al. (in Kadereit & C. Jeffrey, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 8: 342-373. 2007).
