1. Reagent Name: Clostridium botulinum Type C Antitoxin 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 428 
4. Fill Date: April 10, 1995 
5. Expiration Date: No expiration date has been assigned to this product because 
C. botulinum type C antitoxin has demonstrated over time to be very stable if properly stored. 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: To serve as the standard antitoxin when conducting C. botulinum type C 
toxin neutralization tests in mice. 
7. Instructions for Use: Clostridium botulinum type C antitoxin IRP 428 contains 48 
antitoxin units per mL (AU/mL). Dilutions of 1:1200, 1:2400, 1:4800, and 1:9600 contain 0.04 
AU/mL, 0.02 AU/mL, 0.01 AU/mL, and 0.005 AU/mL, respectively. One and five-tenths mL of 
each dilution mixed with 1.5 mL of C. botulinum type C toxin IRP 421 diluted 1:40,000 provides 
results in which one group of mice all live and one group of mice all die when

02 AU/mL, 0.01 AU/mL, and 0.005 AU/mL, respectively. One and five-tenths mL of 
each dilution mixed with 1.5 mL of C. botulinum type C toxin IRP 421 diluted 1:40,000 provides 
results in which one group of mice all live and one group of mice all die when mice are injected 
intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of the mixture. 
8. Test of Reagent: 
Determination of antitoxin titer – The antitoxin titer was determined by injecting mice in the 
intraperitoneal cavity with 0.5 mL of diluted antitoxin mixed with a known amount of 
C. botulinum type C toxin. The antitoxin titer was confirmed by comparing the results of mice 
injected with toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing IRP 428 with toxin-antitoxin mixtures 
containing C. botulinum type C International antitoxin. 
Sterility test – Four vials of IRP 428 were tested for sterility by inoculating the antitoxin in tubes 
of sterile fluid thioglycollate medium and soybean-casein digest medium. No detectable growth 
appeared in any tubes of medium. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: Two-mL glass vials with 1.2 mL of 
antitoxin.

10. Storage Conditions: Store at -20oC or lower. Antitoxin that has been thawed should be 
stored at 2º- 7oC. Repeated freezing and thawing is not recommended.

12. Origin and Passage History: The serum was obtained from young adult goats 
immunized with antigen prepared from C. botulinum type C culture 203A (African strain). 
13. Method of Preparation: The antitoxin was produced by vaccinating goats with 
C. botulinum type C toxoid, followed by a series of injections with C. botulinum type C toxin. 
Serum obtained from the goats was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and the dissolved 
precipitate dialyzed against 0.01 M PBS. The dialyzed material was passed through a sterile 
Millipore filter unit with a 0.22-µm membrane. No preservatives were added to the antitoxin. 
14. Other: None
