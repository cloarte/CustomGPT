1. Reagent Name: Rabies challenge, fox salivary gland origin 
2. Strain or Source: New York City (NYC) street rabies 
3. Lot Number: 92-5A 
4. Fill Date: April 1, 1992 
5. Expiration Date: Not applicable 
Precautions: This is a street rabies strain that is potentially infectious for humans. Handle in a 
manner consistent with the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and 
National Institutes of Health (NIH). This reagent should be handled only by those individuals 
currently vaccinated against rabies. Inactivate contents and container prior to discarding. 
6. Intended Use: For use as a challenge virus in multiple species of animals. 
7. Instructions for Use: Material in each vial is considered undiluted (100); dilutions are 
made in NIH rabies diluent. The recommended route of inoculation is 0.5 mL intramuscular in 
each masseter muscle. This reagent was tested in mice and the corresponding mouse lethal dose 
50 % (MLD50) is 7.9 per mL. This reagent has not been tested or validated in other animal 
species.

50 % (MLD50) is 7.9 per mL. This reagent has not been tested or validated in other animal 
species. 
8. Test of Reagent: Lot 92-5A, is negative for bacterial, fungal, and mycoplasma as tested 
by title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.27, and mycoplasma by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR). The virus is free of the following viruses: bovine viral diarrhea, infectious 
bovine rhinotracheitis, parainfluenza 3, bovine respiratory syncytial, bovine adenovirus 1 and 5, 
bovine enterovirus, bovine parvovirus, and bluetongue, equine herpes 1 and 4, feline 
panleukopenia, feline infectious peritonitis, canine distemper, reovirus, feline viral 
rhinotracheitis, feline calicivirus, infectious canine hepatitis, and canine parvovirus when 
examined for cytopathic effect or fluorescent antibody technique. The nucleotide sequence of the 
N gene (Genbank) was used to confirm identity of this reagent. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 0.75 mL in 3.5-mL glass serum vials.

12. Origin and Passage History: The NYC strain of rabies virus was originally obtained 
from Norden Laboratories, Lincoln, Neb. It has been passed once in a skunk and 3 times in foxes 
since 1976. 
13. Method of Preparation: Salivary glands from foxes inoculated with previous passes of 
the NYC strain of rabies were removed and frozen. Tissues were ground with a mortar and
