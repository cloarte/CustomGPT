Ulex galliiPlanchon - Western Gorse  -Leguminosae / Fabaceae© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)This is similar at first sight to the common gorseUlex europaeus, but a closer look shows that it is generally a smaller, more compact shrub, with smaller spines. The most obvious difference is in time of main flowering - spring forU. europaeusand late summer to autumn forU. gallii. Although called western gorse, in N. Ireland its principal areas of occurrence include Co Down in the south-east of the Province, especially in the Mourne and Slieve Croob areas. It is very common within these areas.All names:Ulex galliiPlanchonNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
