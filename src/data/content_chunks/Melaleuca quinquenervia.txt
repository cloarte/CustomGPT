Overview
Appearance
Melaleuca quinquenervia
is a tall (up to 80 ft. [24.4 m]), evergreen tree in the eucalyptus family that invades wetland habitats in southern Florida. The bark is papery, layered, brownish-white and peeling.
Foliage
The alternate leaves are gray-green, oval, 1-4 in. (2.5-10.2 cm) long and smell of camphor when crushed.
Flowers
Flowering occurs throughout the year. The brush-like spikes of flowers are white in color.
Fruit
Flowers give way to small, woody, seed capsules. Seeds are spread by wind and water.
Ecological Threat
Melaleuca quinquenervia
aggressively invades a variety of wetland habitats including sawgrass marshes, wet prairies, and aquatic sloughs. It often forms impenetrable thickets, reduces biodiversity, displaces native vegetation and reduces the value of these habitats for wildlife. It also accelerates the loss of groundwater due to increased evapotranspiration.
Melaleuca quinquenervia
is native to Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia and was first introduced into the United States in southern Florida in the early 1900s for landscaping and “swamp drying” purposes.
Melaleuca quinquenervia
a resembles red bottlebrush (
Callistemon citrinus
), but the flowers of
C. citrinus
are red.
