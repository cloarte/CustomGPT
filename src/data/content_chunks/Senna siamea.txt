 Invasion: S. siameais a medium-size tree rarely exceeding 20 m in height, more usually 10 to 12 m, but which can attain 30 m under exception circumstances. It has a dense, round, evergreen crown and a short bole with smooth, grey bark, slightly fissured longitudinally (Heinsleigh and Holaway, 1988). It has a shallow root system, which can easily be uprooted by strong winds. Leaves alternate, (10-) 15-30 (-35) cm long, pinnately compound with 6-14 pairs of leaflets which are oblong, 3-7 cm long, 12-20 mm wide, dark green, with midrib ending in a bristle. Flowers are

Leaves alternate, (10-) 15-30 (-35) cm long, pinnately compound with 6-14 pairs of leaflets which are oblong, 3-7 cm long, 12-20 mm wide, dark green, with midrib ending in a bristle. Flowers are bright yellow and borne in numerous large pyramidal panicles up to 60 cm long at the ends of branches (Heinsleigh and Holaway, 1988), peduncles 15-25 mm long; pedicels 15-20 (-35) mm long; bracts subpersistent, petals (10-) 15-25 mm long, fertile stamens 7 or 10 (with 3 large staminodes); filaments unequal, the lateral abaxial ones 7-12 mm long, the others 2.5-5.5 mm long; anthers subequal, weakly beaked, 5-8 mm long. Pods are flat, 15-25 cm long, soft and ribbon-like when young, brown when ripe, indented between the seeds; there are 20-30 seeds per pod. Seeds are bean-shaped, shiny dark-brown, 8 mm long. There are between 35,000 and 41,000 seeds per kilogram (Sosef et al., 1998).

 Reproduccion: The plants begin to bear seed annually at the age of 2-3 years. It regenerates naturally by seed, and seeds may lie dormant on the ground for many years until favourable conditions occur for germination. It has spread naturally in the dry deciduous forests of southern India, and is reported to regenerate naturally in West Bengal. In India, the trees are never leafless, though a new flush of leaves is produced in February-March. The flowers appear mainly in the hot season, but the flowering period is comparatively long and flowers may appear in other seasons ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). In Java, for example, it flowers throughout the year ( Backer and Van den Brink, 1963 ). In Bihar, India, it flowers in September-December and in West Bengal from June to January. The pods ripen towards the end of the hot season and hang in clusters on the tree. Pods are indehiscent. S. siamea is very fast growing, but is short-lived, and old trees are rare. If subject to insect attack, or if grown on shallow or poorly-drained soils, it tends to become stag-headed and less vigorous. Brittle branches are liable to break during rainy periods. It is suitable for both coppicing and pollarding, and these properties, combined with rapid growth, make it suitable for fuelwood production. It coppices vigorously, and continues to yield well over 4 or 5 rotations. Experiments in Tanzania indicated that coppicing gave better results than pollarding in plantations ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). It is now well accepted that although a member

Experiments in Tanzania indicated that coppicing gave better results than pollarding in plantations ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). It is now well accepted that although a member of the Fabaceae (legume family), S. siamea does not fix nitrogen through Rhizobium symbiosis in nodules, although there is some evidence that nitrogen-fixing activity may occur in the warty, lenticellate bark ( Gutteridge, 1997 ). S. siamea is capable of growing under a wide variety of climatic conditions ranging from humid through to arid, but it cannot tolerate low temperatures <10°C) and will be killed outright by even the slightest frost. It has been grown in regions with low rainfall (500 mm in Cyprus) and high rainfall (2800 mm), and can endure a dry season which may last 4 to 6 months. In India, a minimum of 1000 mm rainfall is recommended for good development ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). In semiarid environments with mean annual rainfall of 500-700 mm it will grow only where its roots have access to groundwater and where the dry season does not exceed 4-6 months ( Hassain, 1999 ). S. siamea is a strong light demander. When mature, it is drought-resistant, but seedlings cannot withstand prolonged drought, and are also susceptible to fire. In its natural habitat, the absolute maximum shade temperature varies from 24-36°C. It can grow at altitudes of up to 1380 m (Von Carlowitz, 1991). Mean annual temperature is within the range 20-28°C ( Heinsleigh and Holaway, 1988 ). A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this

Mean annual temperature is within the range 20-28°C ( Heinsleigh and Holaway, 1988 ). A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). S. siamea is not exacting in soil requirements, but prefers moist soils with good drainage ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ), a soil pH of 5.5-7.5 ( Gutteridge, 1997 ), and is sensitive to poor drainage. In West Bengal, it has been grown in lateric soil after deep soil working. It tolerates denuded shallow soils (Hocking, 1993), but its growth will stagnate in dry areas, with the tree becoming stunted after 4 to 5 years; coppice growth will also be reduced. S. siamea is suitable for use on vertisols, xerosol/calcisols, aerisol/alisols, ferrasols, and nitosol/nitisols (FAO classification). It flourishes on both flat terrain and hill slopes.

Mean annual temperature is within the range 20-28°C ( Heinsleigh and Holaway, 1988 ).A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO (see Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). S. siamea is not exacting in soil requirements, but prefers moist soils with good drainage ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ) and a soil pH of 5.5-7.5 ( Gutteridge, 1997 ). In West Bengal, it has been grown in lateric soil after deep soil working. It tolerates denuded shallow soils (Hocking, 1993), but its growth will stagnate in dry areas, with the tree becoming stunted after 4 to 5 years; coppice growth will also be reduced. S. siamea is suitable for use on vertisols, xerosol/calcisols, aerisol/alisols, ferrasols, and nitosol/nitisols (FAO classification). It flourishes on both flat terrain and hill slopes,

It regenerates naturally by seed, and seeds may lie dormant on the ground for many years until favourable conditions occur for germination. It has spread naturally in the dry deciduous forests of southern India, and is reported to regenerate naturally in West Bengal. Physiology and Phenology In India, the trees are never leafless, though a new flush of leaves is produced in February-March. The flowers appear mainly in the hot season, but the flowering period is comparatively long and flowers may appear in other seasons ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). In Java, for example, it flowers throughout the year ( Backer and Van den Brink, 1963 ). In Bihar, India, it flowers in September-December and in West Bengal from June to January. The pods ripen towards the end of the hot season and hang in clusters on the tree. Pods are indehiscent. S. siamea is very fast growing, but is short-lived, and old trees are rare. If subject to insect attack, or if grown on shallow or poorly-drained soils, it tends to become stag-headed and less vigorous. Brittle branches are liable to break during rainy periods. It is suitable for both coppicing and pollarding, and these properties, combined with rapid growth, make it suitable for fuelwood production. It coppices vigorously, and continues to yield well over 4 or 5 rotations. Experiments in Tanzania indicated that coppicing gave better results than pollarding in plantations ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). Associations It is now well accepted that although a member of the Fabaceae (legume family), S. siamea does not fix nitrogen through Rhizobium symbiosis in nodules, although there is some evidence that nitrogen-fixing activity may occur in the warty,

Associations It is now well accepted that although a member of the Fabaceae (legume family), S. siamea does not fix nitrogen through Rhizobium symbiosis in nodules, although there is some evidence that nitrogen-fixing activity may occur in the warty, lenticellate bark ( Gutteridge, 1997 ). Environmental Requirements S. siamea is capable of growing under a wide variety of climatic conditions ranging from humid through to arid, but it cannot tolerate low temperatures <10°C) and will be killed outright by even the slightest frost. It has been grown in regions with low rainfall (500 mm in Cyprus) and high rainfall (2800 mm), and can endure a dry season which may last 4 to 6 months. In India, a minimum of 1000 mm rainfall is recommended for good development ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). In semiarid environments with mean annual rainfall of 500-700 mm it will grow only where its roots have access to groundwater and where the dry season does not exceed 4-6 months ( Hassain, 1999 ). S. siamea is a strong light demander. When mature, it is drought-resistant, but seedlings cannot withstand prolonged drought, and are also susceptible to fire. In its natural habitat, the absolute maximum shade temperature varies from 24-36°C. It can grow at altitudes of up to 1380 m (Von Carlowitz, 1991). Mean annual temperature is within the range 20-28°C ( Heinsleigh and Holaway, 1988 ).

S. siamea is not exacting in soil requirements, but prefers moist soils with good drainage ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ), a soil pH of 5.5-7.5 ( Gutteridge, 1997 ), and is sensitive to poor drainage. In West Bengal, it has been grown in lateric soil after deep soil working. It tolerates denuded shallow soils (Hocking, 1993), but its growth will stagnate in dry areas, with the tree becoming stunted after 4 to 5 years; coppice growth will also be reduced.
