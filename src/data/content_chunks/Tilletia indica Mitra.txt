Introduction
Karnal bunt (sometimes called partial bunt), caused by
the fungus Tilletia indicaMitra, seldom results in sig-
nificant yield losses to wheat in the field. The fungus
does not produce any toxic compounds in leaf, stem
tissue, or seed that pose health risks when consumed
(Bonde). Because the fungus poses no risk to human
health, the U.S. Government does not have any food
safety regulations concerning Karnal bunt. However,
Karnal bunt affects flour quality if more than 3 percent
of the grains are bunted because it produces trimethy-
lamine, which gives off a fishy odor. Pasta products
made with flour contaminated with Karnal bunt can
have an unacceptable color. 
Many U.S. trading partners will not accept U.S. wheat
exports unless the wheat is certified to be from areas
where Karnal bunt is not known to occur. USDA’s
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
imposes quarantines in an attempt to contain the
spread of Karnal bunt in the United States and con-
ducts an annual voluntary survey of grain delivered to
elevators to check for Karnal bunt across the country.
The use of quarantines and the survey are the basis
upon which APHIS is able to issue a certificate that is
accepted by countries importing U.S. wheat.
Some have proposed that the Karnal bunt quarantine
regulations and surveys be ended, suggesting that
USDA should consider contaminated wheat a quality
issue and establish tolerances for contamination
(Combs). This paper analyzes the market effects of
abruptly ending the issuance of certificates stating that
U.S. wheat is from areas where Karnal bunt is not

The Incidence of Karnal Bunt
Karnal bunt is geographically isolated, limited to the
Indian subcontinent, a small area of Mexico, and the
southwestern United States (Murray and Brennan).
Karnal bunt is so named because it was discovered in
1931 on wheat grown near Karnal, India. The disease
was first confirmed outside of Asia in 1972 in the State

Economic Analysis of Ending the Issuance of 
Karnal Bunt Phytosanitary Wheat Export Certificates
Gary Vocke, Edward W. Allen, J. Michael Price1
Abstract:Karnal bunt is a wheat disease that is subject to regulation in the United
States through quarantining of affected counties to limit its spread. Currently, the
Karnal bunt regulatory program allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
to issue phytosanitary export certificates stating that wheat in a given shipment is
from an area where Karnal bunt is not known to occur. Ending this certifiation pro-
gram would jeopardize U.S. exports to some countries. A model developed by the
Economic Research Service was used to analyze a scenario of ending the certifica-
tion. The loss of export markets for U.S. wheat producers would be only partially
offset by increased domestic feeding of lower-

 Karnal bunt is not known to occur. Ending this certifiation pro-
gram would jeopardize U.S. exports to some countries. A model developed by the
Economic Research Service was used to analyze a scenario of ending the certifica-
tion. The loss of export markets for U.S. wheat producers would be only partially
offset by increased domestic feeding of lower-priced wheat. Wheat prices would
remain below baseline levels. Reduced wheat production and lower prices for wheat
combine to reduce the total value of the wheat produced in the country, as well as
the net income in U.S. agriculture. The cumulative reduction of national net farm
income from 2003 to 2007 relative to the baseline is $5.3 billion. However, this
includes cumulative marketing loan payments associated with all crops of $2.0 bil-
lion above the baseline over the 2003-07 period.

of Sonora, in northwest Mexico (Dept. for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs).
The disease was first found in the United States in
1996, in Arizona, Texas, and California, and again in
Texas in 1998. The latest outbreak was in north Texas
in 2001. It is not known how the disease spread to the
southwestern United States and then to north Texas.
Because the early outbreaks were isolated from the
major wheat-producing areas, the possibility of the
disease’s spreading to principal wheat-growing areas
was thought to be minimal. However, the 2001 out-
break of Karnal bunt in north Texas was at the edge of
the major wheat area of the Southern Plains (see fig.
A-1). This raised the prospect that the disease could
spread as far north as the spores can

 possibility of the
disease’s spreading to principal wheat-growing areas
was thought to be minimal. However, the 2001 out-
break of Karnal bunt in north Texas was at the edge of
the major wheat area of the Southern Plains (see fig.
A-1). This raised the prospect that the disease could
spread as far north as the spores can tolerate winter
weather conditions. Karnal bunt spores may rapidly
decay under extreme cold, suggesting that significant
portions of the northern United States would not be
conducive to long-term survival (and therefore perma-
nent establishment) of Karnal bunt (Dobesberger,
Jimenez, and Sequreira).
The occurrence of bunted kernels in areas infested
with Karnal bunt spores is typically low. The ideal
conditions for infection are temperatures in the range
of 59-72 degrees F. and accompanied by rainfall, over-
head irrigation, or high humidity. These conditions
must occur during heading and for a few weeks after-
ward for bunted kernels to develop (Forster and Blair).
These strict environmental conditions make it possible
for problems with Karnal bunt to be only intermittent
even if soil spore concentrations are high.
Spreading Karnal Bunt
Karnal bunt spores can be carried in soil and on a vari-
ety of surfaces, including seeds and other plant parts,
farm equipment, tools, and vehicles. They can also be
windborne. Karnal bunt spores are resistant to dry con-
ditions, sunlight, a wide range of temperatures, and
most fungicides. Wheat that is not infected can
become contaminated with spores by passing through
spore-contaminated equipment, transport vessels, or
facilities. Other grains can also be contaminated with
spores in the same way.

borne. Karnal bunt spores are resistant to dry con-
ditions, sunlight, a wide range of temperatures, and
most fungicides. Wheat that is not infected can
become contaminated with spores by passing through
spore-contaminated equipment, transport vessels, or
facilities. Other grains can also be contaminated with
spores in the same way.
While Karnal bunt is not harmful to animals, it is sus-
pected that spores in contaminated or infected feed
(grain or bran from milled wheat) can survive inges-
tion by animals. Since the manure of livestock fed
such feed is potentially a source of inoculum, bunted
wheat in quarantined counties must be heat-treated if
used for animal feed.
The American Phytopathological Society states that
the experience from countries where Karnal bunt
occurs suggests that Karnal bunt is a minor disease
and the little risk that does exist for grain quality can
be effectively managed with resistant varieties without
the use of quarantines (American Phytopathological
Society). The Society also suggests that although quar-
antines may delay the introduction of Karnal bunt into
new areas, they are unlikely to prevent such introduc-
tions and subsequent establishment. This conclusion
has been confirmed repeatedly, most recently by the
occurrence of Karnal bunt in the United Sates despite
quarantines imposed on wheat from countries where
the disease has been known to occur.
Quarantines may be ineffective where wheat-growing
areas are contiguous, as between Mexico and the
United States. However, where longer distances apply,
as between continents or where deserts or mountains
intervene, quarantines may help to protect countries
that do not have Karnal bunt (Murray and Brennan).

as between continents or where deserts or mountains
intervene, quarantines may help to protect countries
that do not have Karnal bunt (Murray and Brennan).
Yield Losses to Karnal Bunt
Karnal bunt spores usually replace only a portion of
the developing kernel and only a few of the kernels in
a head. Complete conversion of kernels to spores is
rare. Thus, yield reductions are generally minimal. For
example, surveys in India during years of heavy dis-
ease infestations revealed a general, area-wide yield
loss of less than 0.5 percent (Davila). However, in a
few fields with highly susceptible varieties, as much as
89 percent of the kernels were infected, with yield
losses ranging from 20 to 40 percent.
Options for Karnal Bunt Control
Wheat breeders in areas with Karnal bunt recognize
the importance of avoiding the release of highly sus-
ceptible varieties.2 This control measure has proven
effective for reducing the level of Karnal bunt suffi-
ciently that quality of the harvested grain is not severe-
ly affected. However, resistant varieties do not eradi-
cate the disease, and Karnal bunt epidemics have
recurred in India as soon as susceptible varieties were
again grown (Murray and Brennan).
Apparently, cultural practices are of little practical
value in reducing the probability of an outbreak
(Murray and Brennan). Seed treatments can reduce the

number of viable spores on seed, and, therefore, the
probability that Karnal bunt will be introduced to new
areas. Foliar application of fungicides can reduce the
level of disease, but more than one application is usu-
ally required, making this an expensive control option.
Fungicides are likely to be cost effective only if other
important diseases, such as rusts or Septoria blotches,
are also present. Fumigation of soil with chemicals,
such as methyl bromide, metham-sodium, and
formaldehyde, has been partially successful in killing
the spores.
Exporting Under Deregulation 
Is Problematic
Not all countries that have restrictions against 
Karnal bunt would, in practice, strictly prohibit wheat
imports from the United States if USDA stopped issu-
ing certificates. Each country has regulations that 
are often idiosyncratic in how they are written and
enforced. For example, Italy and Germany currently
import wheat from countries where Karnal bunt is
known to occur, after testing to ensure the wheat is
free of Karnal bunt, despite European Union regula-
tions against such a practice.
In addition, while some markets would be captured by
wheat-exporting countries that are free of Karnal bunt,

tions against such a practice.
In addition, while some markets would be captured by
wheat-exporting countries that are free of Karnal bunt,
U.S. wheat exports to countries that have no restrictions
against Karnal bunt would likely increase. The longrun
effects would likely depend on the extent that world
wheat markets treat Karnal bunt as a quality issue.
There is also an issue of what procedure would be used
by other countries for Karnal bunt testing if the United
States should stop issuing certificates. Currently, there is
no accurate Karnal bunt test available that is rapid
enough to use during ship loading. Even the microscop-
ic examination for spores with the “wash test” can lead
to false positives because of bunt on ryegrass Tilletia
walkeri. Annual ryegrass is a significant weed problem
in wheat fields in the southeastern United States. The
wash test is currently used for seed wheat to ensure that

most importing countries, even with phytosanitary regu-
lations against Karnal bunt, accept APHIS’s certificate
that the wheat comes from an area not known to have
Karnal bunt, and do not routinely test for Karnal bunt
spores or check for bunted kernels.
If even a few important wheat-importing countries
maintain prohibitions, shipping companies may have
concerns about shipping wheat from a deregulated
U.S. wheat sector. Ship owners wishing to protect their
interests may insist on a certificate from an authorita-
tive U.S. source that unequivocally confirms that the
cargo is free from Karnal bunt spores. 
Further, shipping vessels that carried contaminated
wheat to countries without prohibitions would have 
to be sanitized to ensure that later cargoes from other
sources going to countries that continue to have prohibi-
tions will not be contaminated. Under U.S. deregulation,
spores could spread through the storage and transport
equipment to other products like corn and soybeans.
The cost of testing and sanitizing to ensure freedom
from the disease would likely be considerable. 
There may also be issues with transshipment through
the St. Lawrence Seaway if the United States deregu-
lates Karnal bunt. Currently, Canada prohibits the

There may also be issues with transshipment through
the St. Lawrence Seaway if the United States deregu-
lates Karnal bunt. Currently, Canada prohibits the
entry of wheat from States with Karnal bunt. Any
wheat that crosses the Canadian border needs a decla-
ration that the grain originated in an area free of
Karnal bunt on the basis of official surveys.
The future importance of these issues will likely
depend on whether Karnal bunt becomes widespread
across the U.S. wheat sector. However, there is no cer-
tainty about how far and how rapidly the disease might
spread if the quarantine system is eliminated.
The USDA Regulated Areas
An area that is regulated by USDA for Karnal bunt is a
definable commercial wheat-production area that
includes at least one field that tested positive for
Karnal bunted kernels. USDA restricts movement of
wheat grain, straw, hay and farm equipment within and
out of these regulated areas. USDA tests wheat grown
in regulated areas each year for Karnal bunted kernels.
Currently, in a regulated area, a grain sample must be
drawn by an APHIS inspector or State cooperator at
the time of harvest, or if already harvested, from the
storage bins, and examined for bunted kernels. If the
sample is taken from the field as it is being harvested
and no bunted kernels are found, a certificate will be
issued and the grain allowed to be transported to any
market. If the grain sample came from grain already in
storage and no bunted kernels are found, then a permit
will be issued for the grain to be transported to any
market. If one or more bunted kernels are found in the
sample,
Text Len: 1715
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 being harvested
and no bunted kernels are found, a certificate will be
issued and the grain allowed to be transported to any
market. If the grain sample came from grain already in
storage and no bunted kernels are found, then a permit
will be issued for the grain to be transported to any
market. If one or more bunted kernels are found in the
sample, then a notice will be issued and the grain
sealed in the storage facility prior to approved treat-
ment or disposal.
In a regulated area, wheat grown to produce seed can
be planted only within the regulated area and only if
the seed tests spore negative through the wash test.
Seed wheat cannot be moved outside the regulated
area. Any seed grown in a regulated area that tests
spore positive (based on the wash test), but is bunt
negative (based on visual inspection) cannot leave the
area for seeding purposes, but it can leave the area for
export as grain to a country that does not require an
APHIS Karnal bunt certificate or for domestic use for
livestock feed or milling.
Wheat grain, straw, or wheat hay that tests bunt positive
cannot be moved outside the regulated area without
APHIS approval. If needed, a permit is issued to allow
the transport of these products to an approved facility
outside the regulated area for treatment or disposal.
Karnal bunt quarantines have been controversial since
they were initiated in 1996. To increase cooperation,
USDA compensates producers, grain handlers, and
other affected parties for losses suffered due to the
Federal quarantine action. Compensation payments
have totaled about $35 million since 1996 (U.S.
Department of Agriculture).

Estimating the Effects of Karnal 
Bunt Deregulation
Even though Karnal bunt poses no health risk, many
U.S. wheat export markets have a precautionary stance
against the acceptance of wheat without a certificate
indicating the wheat is from an area where Karnal bunt
is not known to occur. Thus, if the United States were
to stop its certification, U.S. wheat would not meet
those importing countries’ phytosanitary requirements.
It is uncertain how the wheat-importing countries of
the world would react if the United States were to end
its Karnal bunt quarantine regulation. The reaction of
many countries would likely depend upon how fre-

quent and how widespread Karnal bunt outbreaks
occurred in the United States and the availability of
wheat from other sources. However, it is possible to
anticipate the likely reactions of governments and
industry to deregulation not accompanied by a severe
outbreak. This study does not attempt to forecast
future incidence of Karnal bunt in U.S. wheat fields.
The scenario analyzed assumes a unilateral end to U.S.
karnal bunt certification, without significant success in
getting importing countries to accept something other
than a zero tolerance level for karnal bunt spores. If
ongoing scientific research and diplomatic efforts
cause a significant number of wheat importers to
accept a more relaxed standard than a zero tolerance,
then trade effects would likely be smaller. However,
such efforts would undoubtedly take time.

ongoing scientific research and diplomatic efforts
cause a significant number of wheat importers to
accept a more relaxed standard than a zero tolerance,
then trade effects would likely be smaller. However,
such efforts would undoubtedly take time. 
With unilateral deregulation, we assumed that most of
the adverse reactions of U.S. wheat customers would
fall on hard red winter wheat (HRW) producers in the
Central and Southern Plains and soft red winter wheat
(SRW) producers (these two classes averaged 62 per-
cent of U.S. wheat production between 1996 and
2000). The combination of weather conditions and
stage of plant growth needed to result in Karnal bunt
infection are most likely in areas where these two
classes of wheat are grown (Dobeseberger, Jimenez,
and Sequeira). Because U.S. wheat is blended, we also
assumed that HRW and SRW from northern States that
might not be susceptible to karnal bunt cannot be certi-
fied as free of spores. However, the harsh winters in
the northern United States where the other classes of
wheat are principally grown are expected to prevent
the spread of the disease into those regions. U.S.
domestic and international customers for the three
classes of wheat: hard red spring (HRS), durum in the
Northern Plains, and white wheat (from the traditional
Pacific Northwest and Northeastern white wheat areas,
not Kansas) are assumed to be unconcerned about
Karnal bunt contamination, even with decertification.
This lack of concern assumes that some alternative

for importers of spring and white wheat and is a major

Northern Plains, and white wheat (from the traditional
Pacific Northwest and Northeastern white wheat areas,
not Kansas) are assumed to be unconcerned about
Karnal bunt contamination, even with decertification.
This lack of concern assumes that some alternative
government or private certification is found acceptable
for importers of spring and white wheat and is a major
reason why this scenario does not have a larger U.S.
trade loss. Moreover, Canada is also assumed to accept
alternative certification, allowing transshipments
through the Saint Lawrence. For many common uses,
HRS and HRW are readily substituted, as are SRW
and soft white wheat. 
A world wheat trade model that appropriately estimates
trade flows by class and country was not available to
analyze the issue, so a scenario was developed based
on expert judgment of USDA analysts. A set of
assumptions about prices and trade impacts by country
was developed using the February 2002 trade matrix of
2001/02 world wheat trade. The percent changes in
U.S. wheat exports were then applied, beginning in
2003, relative to the USDA Agricultural Baseline
Projections to 2011, in a U.S. agricultural sector model
to calculate the impacts on the domestic farm sector. 
As a first step, countries were classified by their
antipathy to Karnal bunt and their presumed response
to U.S. deregulation (table A-1). For this analysis, each
significant market for U.S. wheat exports was put into
one of three categories.
Group A , accounting for 25 percent of forecast U.S.
exports, includes countries that: (1) have strict
requirements on Karnal bunt as reported by APHIS,
(2) have a history of strict observance of phytosanitary
regulations, (3) normally import hard red

requirements on Karnal bunt as reported by APHIS,
(2) have a history of strict observance of phytosanitary
regulations, (3) normally import hard red winter
(HRW) or soft red winter wheat (SRW), and (4) could
be expected to remain intransigent about only import-
ing wheat that is certified as coming from a Karnal
bunt-free zone. Important markets in this group
include EU-15, Eastern Europe, China, Egypt, Algeria,
Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and Brazil.
Group B , accounting for 35 percent of forecast U.S.
exports, includes countries that: (1) have strict require-
ments on Karnal bunt, as reported by APHIS, (2) may
be somewhat more flexible in implementation of phy-
tosanitary regulations, (3) normally import only a por-
tion of U.S. wheat from regions potentially at risk, and
(4) although decertification would disrupt HRW and
SRW shipments in the first year, over the next 2 years
these countries would be expected to relax Karnal bunt
standards to tolerance levels that would permit trade
and a resumption of imports from the United States.
Important markets in this group include the former
Soviet Union, Yemen, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan,
Sri Lanka, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and other
Western Hemisphere countries.

U.S. wheat exports were examined to evaluate the
effect of reducing U.S. HRW and SRW exports to zero

would find about 55 percent of U.S. exports unaccept-

 substitutability for some uses. The
world wheat market is segmented: some countries have
inelastic demand, are willing to pay high premiums,
and are expected to be concerned about Karnal bunt;
other countries like discounted, cheap wheat and are
not concerned about Karnal bunt. Assumptions about
responsiveness in each country drives the analysis of
changes in world wheat trade and U.S. exports. 
In the first year, U.S. exports of HRW and SRW are
calculated to increase to those markets still accepting
them, while overall U.S. wheat exports are calculated
to drop nearly 7 million tons, or 25 percent below
baseline levels. Most of the drop in U.S. exports is
expected to be gained by competitors’ exports and
reduced ending stocks (boosting prices in those coun-
tries). Importers also draw down stocks some, but the
decline in world wheat trade is small because some
importers actually increase imports of cheaper U.S.
HRW and SRW. 
While the U.S. average farm price for wheat drops sig-
nificantly (45 cents per bushel in 2003) under this sce-
nario, the premium for spring wheat (relative to the all-
wheat average farm price) is assumed to be about 50
cents per bushel greater than normal, while the discount
for HRW and SRW would be at least 50 cents greater
than normal. The market impacts of by-class premiums
and discounts are larger than the change in the average

Egypt is an important example of how a country
might react to Karnal bunt decertification. Egypt
has strict phytosanitary regulations regarding
Karnal bunt. Moreover, it is a significant producer,
with irrigated land that could be quite susceptible
to the disease. These factors would likely cause
Egypt to be inflexible about accepting wheat with
Karnal bunt spores (a Group A country). However,
while most U.S. exports to Egypt have been HRW
or SRW, some are other classes. U.S. shipments of
white wheat could be expected to increase, limiting
U.S. losses in the first year of the scenario (2003)
to less than 3 million tons (see table A-1).
However, in 2004, increased competition, in this
case especially from Australian white wheat, is
expected to push U.S. wheat out of the Egyptian
market. In the third year and later, after prices and
production in Australia decline from the peak in the
second year, U.S. white wheat shipments to Egypt
recoup losses, ending up higher than without
Karnal bunt. However, without SRW and HRW, the
United States has still lost most of its wheat export
market to Egypt. 
Venezuela is an example of a Group B country
(with medium Karnal bunt antipathy). While
Venezuela has regulations prohibiting Karnal bunt
in wheat imports, and Karnal bunt might propagate
in that climate, Venezuela’s wheat production is
insignificant. Eventually, Venezuela could be

Venezuela has regulations prohibiting Karnal bunt
in wheat imports, and Karnal bunt might propagate
in that climate, Venezuela’s wheat production is
insignificant. Eventually, Venezuela could be
expected to accept a Karnal bunt spore tolerance
greater than zero. However, it would likely take
extensive negotiations. About 70 percent of U.S.
exports to Venezuela are HRW or SRW. In the first
year of the scenario, U.S. HRS shipments would be
expected to increase some, but Canada and
Argentina would be expected to provide intense
competition, replacing most of U.S. HRW and SRW
shipments. In the second year, with negotiations
ongoing and intense competition from Canada, even
the U.S. HRS share is reduced. In the third year,
Venezuela is assumed to accept a reasonable toler-
ance for Karnal bunt spores, and U.S. exports
increase dramatically, but in the long run Canada
has gained a competitive edge, and the U.S. share
remains about 17 percent below what it would have
been without Karnal bunt. 
A Group C country, with low Karnal Bunt antipa-
thy, like Israel, has no regulation concerning Karnal
bunt. Imports of U.S. wheat are above baseline lev-
els throughout the scenario, but the increase in 2004
is less because increased competitor supplies and
reduced prices limit U.S. gains. In 2005 and later,
the U.S. share increases again because the price of
U.S. HRW and SRW is comparatively attractive.

Examples By Country
U.S. price received by farmers for wheat. The assumed
relative international price changes (about $1.00 per
bushel) are thus similar enough in magnitude to price
changes in 1995/96 (when the average farm price
increased $1.10) so that the 1994 to 1998 reaction of
U.S. competitors to high prices can provide insight into
their likely reaction in this scenario. 
In 1994/95, the major competitors (Canada, Australia,
EU, and Argentina) reduced wheat stocks more than
11 million tons, while in the Karnal bunt scenario, a 6-
million-ton reduction is anticipated. These countries
increased wheat production by over 30 million tons in
1996/97, but a smaller increase, about 15 million tons,
is assumed in the Karnal bunt scenario because their
price increases would be less than occurred in
1995/96. Moreover, competitors are currently planting
more wheat than in 1994/95, so it will be more diffi-
cult for them to expand from this higher base. 
In the second year of the scenario (2004), some of the
importing countries in Group B (see table A-1) are
assumed to adopt less restrictive Karnal bunt stan-
dards, opening imports to U.S. HRW and SRW, there-
by reducing the direct effect of Karnal bunt trade barri-
ers. However, in that second year, foreign competitors’
production (and U.S. HRS and

see table A-1) are
assumed to adopt less restrictive Karnal bunt stan-
dards, opening imports to U.S. HRW and SRW, there-
by reducing the direct effect of Karnal bunt trade barri-
ers. However, in that second year, foreign competitors’
production (and U.S. HRS and White wheat) is expect-
ed to increase strongly in response to the first year’s
higher prices. Although a portion of competitors’
increased production is used to replenish stocks, much
is expected to move into export channels, further
reducing U.S. market share. In the second year of the
scenario, U.S. wheat exports are estimated down 9.5
million tons, 35 percent below the baseline level (with-
out Karnal bunt). 
In the third year after deregulation, the rest of Group B
countries further relax Karnal bunt import standards,
and competitors’ response is muted, as wheat prices
and premiums in those countries decline. However, in
the third year, U.S. wheat exports are 20 percent below
baseline levels. In subsequent years, the U.S. recap-
tures some lost market share as price premiums in
competing countries become small. However, the
exclusion of U.S. HRW and SRW from group A mar-
kets results in a small premium for U.S. competitors
that are free of Karnal bunt and reduces long-term
U.S. wheat exports by 15 percent below baseline lev-
els. This long-term decline represents a loss in market
share despite the development of alternative regulatory
mechanisms in markets accounting for 80 percent of

U.S. wheat exports by 15 percent below baseline lev-
els. This long-term decline represents a loss in market
share despite the development of alternative regulatory
mechanisms in markets accounting for 80 percent of
U.S. wheat exports. 
No model is available that includes the effects of 
wheat classes on world trade or U.S. regional and class
differences with appropriate substitution elasticities.
Therefore, a more general model was used to quantify
price changes and address the effects on U.S. agriculture. 
Model Simulation Results
The U.S. domestic impacts of terminating certificates
for Karnal bunt were estimated with the Food and
Agricultural Policy Simulator (FAPSIM). FAPSIM is a
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. agricultural
sector maintained by the Economic Research Service
(ERS). The model contains submodels for 24 agricul-
tural commodities, including wheat.3 The model also
includes submodels to estimate the value of exports,
net farm income, and Government outlays on farm
programs for the United States. 
These submodels are linked together through the vari-
ables that they share in common. The model computes
the set of market prices that equilibrate supply and
demand in all of the commodity markets simultaneous-
ly, given any set of exogenous conditions. 
The estimated trade impacts were introduced into the
model by exogenously reducing wheat exports from
their baseline levels over the 2003-07 period by the
percentages already mentioned. The initial export lev-
els used in the analysis were obtained from the
February 2002 USDA baseline (USDA, Office of the
Chief Economist). All of the model simulation results
from the scenario are compared against the USDA

their baseline levels over the 2003-07 period by the
percentages already mentioned. The initial export lev-
els used in the analysis were obtained from the
February 2002 USDA baseline (USDA, Office of the
Chief Economist). All of the model simulation results
from the scenario are compared against the USDA
baseline projections in the discussion that follows. 
Figure A-2 shows the assumed reduction in wheat
exports under the scenario compared with the baseline.
In 2003/04 and 2004/05, exports under the scenario
decline relative to the baseline by 25 and 35 percent, or
by 244 million and 359 million bushels, respectively.
Exports partly recover in the succeeding years of the
analysis, averaging 15 percent less than the baseline.
The decline in exports under the scenario reduces the
farmgate price of wheat (fig. A-3). Prices decline from
the baseline by 17 and 19 percent, or by 45 and 53
cents per bushel, in 2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively.
The loss is larger in the second year because the
sharply higher prices expected to be received by U.S.
competitors in 2003/04 result in significantly expanded

Union would not put a tax on wheat exports to hold
down its domestic prices. U.S. domestic prices partial-
ly recover relative to the baseline in succeeding years

. We assumed that the European
Union would not put a tax on wheat exports to hold
down its domestic prices. U.S. domestic prices partial-
ly recover relative to the baseline in succeeding years
with recovery of some of the lost export markets. The
prices under the scenario are still below baseline prices
by 13 percent in 2007/08.
With domestic prices lower under the scenario, the
U.S. area planted to wheat declines relative to the
baseline (fig. A-4). However, the response by produc-
ers to the lower wheat prices is muted somewhat over
the initial years because of U.S. Government farm pro-
grams. Part of the market revenue loss that producers
experience due to lower farm prices over this period is
offset by an increase in marketing loan benefits that
they receive from the government. As a result, the area
planted to wheat declines relative to the baseline by 2
and 3 percent, or by 1.0 and 2.1 million acres, respec-
tively, in 2004/05 and 2005/06. In contrast, area plant-
ed to wheat declines by 2.7 million acres below the
baseline level in 2007/08 when producers are not
expected to receive any offsetting compensation
through marketing loans. Because the production
response is muted in the early years, excess production
occurs, causing the price impacts to be larger than they
would be in the absence of government programs.
With lower prices under the scenario, domestic feeding
of wheat increases sharply, by 32 and 107 percent, or
by 88 and 295 million bushels, in 2003/04 and
2004/05, respectively. With smaller price impacts in
the succeeding years, the changes in feed demand also

become smaller. Nonetheless, wheat feeding under the
scenario remains above the baseline level by about 32
percent in 2007/08. Part of the reason these impacts
are large is that the model solution was constrained to
ensure that the price of wheat never falls below its
feed value in relation to the price of corn. Wheat dis-
placed corn as an animal feed to the extent necessary
to ensure this constraint was satisfied.
Total domestic use of wheat is estimated to rise by 7
and 22 percent, or by 90 and 296 million bushels, for
2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively (fig. A-5). This rise

Total domestic use of wheat is estimated to rise by 7
and 22 percent, or by 90 and 296 million bushels, for
2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively (fig. A-5). This rise
is almost entirely due to the increased feeding of
wheat, with only a slight increase in food use. Seed
use declines under the scenario relative to the baseline
because of the reduction in area planted to wheat.
Even though wheat feeding increases sharply under the
scenario, this rise is not enough to offset export losses.
Thus, ending stocks are estimated to rise above the
baseline by 22 and 27 percent, or by 154 and 179 mil-
lion bushels, for 2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively
(fig. A-6). Although the impacts on ending stocks
become smaller in the succeeding years of the sce-
nario, stocks remain above baseline levels by 21 per-
cent in 2007/08.
The reduction in wheat production and the lower farm-
gate prices under the scenario combine to reduce U.S.
cash receipts received by wheat producers from farm
marketings (fig. A-7). Cash receipts for wheat are esti-
mated to drop below the baseline by $915 million and
$1,293 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively. By the

Scenario

final year of the analysis, cash receipts remain below
baseline levels by $1,167 million. Cumulative wheat
cash receipts decline by $5.8 billion below the baseline
over the 2003-07 period.
No marketing loan payments are assumed for wheat
over the 2003-07 period under the baseline. However,
the price declines for wheat over the 2003-05 period
under the scenario are sufficient to trigger marketing
loan benefits. The payments to wheat producers are
$0.7, $0.6, and $0.2 billion for 2003/04, 2004/05, and
2005/06, respectively. The cumulative marketing loan
benefits associated with all crops increase by $2.0 bil-
lion above the baseline over the 2003-07 period. 
As suggested above, other commodities are also affect-
ed by the price adjustments that occur in the wheat

 and $0.2 billion for 2003/04, 2004/05, and
2005/06, respectively. The cumulative marketing loan
benefits associated with all crops increase by $2.0 bil-
lion above the baseline over the 2003-07 period. 
As suggested above, other commodities are also affect-
ed by the price adjustments that occur in the wheat
sector under the scenario. As the profitability of wheat
production declines, producers shift production from
wheat to alternative crops. The increase in production
causes the prices for other crops to decline. However,
the price changes associated with other crops are small
in relation to the price changes for wheat. Farm prices
of other crops change by less than 5 percent from their
baseline levels over the 2003-07 period. The price
impacts for the livestock sector, stemming from lower
feed costs, are even smaller. 
The farm price of corn is estimated to decline below
the baseline level by 4.5 percent in 2003/2004 as live-
stock producers shift from corn to the lower priced
wheat in their feed rations. On average, corn prices are
1.3 percent below baseline levels over the 2003-07
period, with comparable changes for other feed grain
prices. As a result, cumulative cash receipts for feed
grains decline by $1.2 billion below the baseline over
the 2003-07 period.
With lower wheat exports and prices under the sce-
nario, the value of U.S. exports of wheat declines
below baseline levels. The cumulative value of total
U.S. agricultural exports is estimated to fall by over
$6.3 billion over the 2003-07 period under the scenario
(fig. A-8). Although most of the decrease is associated
with wheat, there are also downward adjustments in
the value of exports for other commodities due to
lower prices

 exports of wheat declines
below baseline levels. The cumulative value of total
U.S. agricultural exports is estimated to fall by over
$6.3 billion over the 2003-07 period under the scenario
(fig. A-8). Although most of the decrease is associated
with wheat, there are also downward adjustments in
the value of exports for other commodities due to
lower prices.
Because prices of all agricultural commodities decline
under the scenario, total U.S. cash receipts from the
farm marketings decline below baseline levels.
Cumulative cash receipts over the 2003-07 period are
estimated to be $10.4 billion below the baseline level.
More than half of this decline is associated directly
with wheat. There are also some offsetting adjust-
ments. Because there is less total crop area planted
under the scenario, producers incur fewer production
expenses. In aggregate, cumulative farm expenses are
seen as $2.9 billion below the baseline level over the
2003-07 period. In addition, with producers receiving
increased government support payments through mar-
keting loan benefits, cumulative net farm income over
the 2003-07 period is estimated to be $5.3 billion
lower than the baseline level (fig. A-9).
The average impacts discussed here would not be
spread evenly across the Nation’s wheat sector.
Because Karnal bunt deregulation would be focused on
hard red winter and soft red winter exports, impacts
would center on wheat producers in the Central and
Southern Plains and the Southeastern region of the
country. It is possible that a longer run effect of dereg-
ulation would be to reduce wheat acreage in the
Central and Southern Plains and to increase wheat
acreage in the Northern Plains, if foreign customers
continue to be reluctant to purchase wheat grown in
areas potentially affected by Karnal bunt.

Conclusions
Karnal bunt seldom results in significant yield losses
to wheat in the field. However, Karnal bunt affects
flour quality if more than 3 percent of the grains are
bunted because it gives off a fishy odor. In addition,
pasta products made with flour contaminated with
Karnal bunt can have an unacceptable color. The fun-
gus that causes Karnal bunt does not produce any toxic
compounds in leaf, stem tissue, or seed that pose
health risks when consumed. Thus, Karnal bunt is a
food quality issue rather than a food safety issue.
Because the fungus poses no risk to human health, the
U.S. Government does not have any food safety regu-
lations concerning wheat infected with Karnal bunt.
However, the compensation payments for the Karnal
bunt quarantine regulatory program have totaled about
$35 million

food quality issue rather than a food safety issue.
Because the fungus poses no risk to human health, the
U.S. Government does not have any food safety regu-
lations concerning wheat infected with Karnal bunt.
However, the compensation payments for the Karnal
bunt quarantine regulatory program have totaled about
$35 million from 1996 through 2001.
Even though scientific evidence is that Karnal bunt
posses no health risk, many U.S. wheat export markets
require that wheat from the United States be from
areas where Karnal bunt is not known to occur. Such
countries would likely resist importing U.S. wheat if
the certification procedures were terminated.
The assumed impact of terminating Karnal bunt certifi-
cation is entirely through reduced exports. Using an
ERS model of U.S. agriculture, an export scenario was
evaluated. Domestic prices dropped sharply, which, in
turn, reduced the area planted to wheat. Although
wheat feeding rose with the lower prices, the increase
was not nearly enough to offset the loss of export mar-
kets. Wheat prices remained below baseline levels. The
reduction in wheat production and the lower prices
combined to reduce the total value of the wheat pro-
duced in the country, as well as the net income of U.S.
agriculture. The effects primarily affected producers in
the Central and Southern Plains and in the Southeast.
The cumulative total reduction of national net farm
income from 2003 to 2007 is $5.3 billion. The cumula-
tive marketing loan payments associated with all crops
increase by $2.0 billion above the baseline over the
2003-07 period.

Introduction
Karnal bunt (sometimes called partial bunt), caused by
the fungus Tilletia indicaMitra, seldom results in sig-
nificant yield losses to wheat in the field. The fungus
does not produce any toxic compounds in leaf, stem
tissue, or seed that pose health risks when consumed
(Bonde). Because the fungus poses no risk to human
health, the U.S. Government does not have any food
safety regulations concerning Karnal bunt. However,
Karnal bunt affects flour quality if more than 3 percent
of the grains are bunted because it produces trimethy-
lamine, which gives off a fishy odor. Pasta products
made with flour contaminated with Karnal bunt can
have an unacceptable color. 
Many U.S. trading partners will not accept U.S. wheat
exports unless the wheat is certified to be from areas
where Karnal bunt is not known to occur. USDA’s
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
imposes quarantines in an attempt to contain the
spread of Karnal bunt in the United States and con-
ducts an annual voluntary survey of grain delivered to
elevators to check for Karnal bunt across the country.
The use of quarantines and the survey are the basis
upon which APHIS is able to issue a certificate that is
accepted by countries importing U.S. wheat.
Some have proposed that the Karnal bunt quarantine
regulations and surveys be ended, suggesting that
USDA should consider contaminated wheat a quality
issue and establish tolerances for contamination
(Combs). This paper analyzes the market effects of
abruptly ending the issuance of certificates stating that
U.S. wheat is from areas where Karnal bunt is not

many overseas markets. 
The Incidence of Karnal Bunt
Karnal bunt is geographically isolated, limited to the
Indian subcontinent, a small area of Mexico, and the
southwestern United States (Murray and Brennan).
Karnal bunt is so named because it was discovered in
1931 on wheat grown near Karnal, India. The disease
was first confirmed outside of Asia in 1972 in the State

Economic Analysis of Ending the Issuance of 
Karnal Bunt Phytosanitary Wheat Export Certificates
Gary Vocke, Edward W. Allen, J. Michael Price1
Abstract:Karnal bunt is a wheat disease that is subject to regulation in the United
States through quarantining of affected counties to limit its spread. Currently, the
Karnal bunt regulatory program allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
to issue phytosanitary export certificates stating that wheat in a given shipment is
from an area where Karnal bunt is not known to occur. Ending this certifiation pro-
gram would jeopardize U.S. exports to some countries. A model developed by the
Economic Research Service was used to analyze a scenario of ending the certifica-
tion. The loss of export markets for U.S. wheat producers would be only partially
offset by increased domestic feeding of lower-

 Karnal bunt is not known to occur. Ending this certifiation pro-
gram would jeopardize U.S. exports to some countries. A model developed by the
Economic Research Service was used to analyze a scenario of ending the certifica-
tion. The loss of export markets for U.S. wheat producers would be only partially
offset by increased domestic feeding of lower-priced wheat. Wheat prices would
remain below baseline levels. Reduced wheat production and lower prices for wheat
combine to reduce the total value of the wheat produced in the country, as well as
the net income in U.S. agriculture. The cumulative reduction of national net farm
income from 2003 to 2007 relative to the baseline is $5.3 billion. However, this
includes cumulative marketing loan payments associated with all crops of $2.0 bil-
lion above the baseline over the 2003-07 period.

of Sonora, in northwest Mexico (Dept. for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs).
The disease was first found in the United States in
1996, in Arizona, Texas, and California, and again in
Texas in 1998. The latest outbreak was in north Texas
in 2001. It is not known how the disease spread to the
southwestern United States and then to north Texas.
Because the early outbreaks were isolated from the
major wheat-producing areas, the possibility of the
disease’s spreading to principal wheat-growing areas
was thought to be minimal. However, the 2001 out-
break of Karnal bunt in north Texas was at the edge of
the major wheat area of the Southern Plains (see fig.
A-1). This raised the prospect that the disease could
spread as far north as the spores can

 possibility of the
disease’s spreading to principal wheat-growing areas
was thought to be minimal. However, the 2001 out-
break of Karnal bunt in north Texas was at the edge of
the major wheat area of the Southern Plains (see fig.
A-1). This raised the prospect that the disease could
spread as far north as the spores can tolerate winter
weather conditions. Karnal bunt spores may rapidly
decay under extreme cold, suggesting that significant
portions of the northern United States would not be
conducive to long-term survival (and therefore perma-
nent establishment) of Karnal bunt (Dobesberger,
Jimenez, and Sequreira).
The occurrence of bunted kernels in areas infested
with Karnal bunt spores is typically low. The ideal
conditions for infection are temperatures in the range
of 59-72 degrees F. and accompanied by rainfall, over-
head irrigation, or high humidity. These conditions
must occur during heading and for a few weeks after-
ward for bunted kernels to develop (Forster and Blair).
These strict environmental conditions make it possible
for problems with Karnal bunt to be only intermittent
even if soil spore concentrations are high.
Spreading Karnal Bunt
Karnal bunt spores can be carried in soil and on a vari-
ety of surfaces, including seeds and other plant parts,
farm equipment, tools, and vehicles. They can also be
windborne. Karnal bunt spores are resistant to dry con-
ditions, sunlight, a wide range of temperatures, and
most fungicides. Wheat that is not infected can
become contaminated with spores by passing through
spore-contaminated equipment, transport vessels, or
facilities. Other grains can also be contaminated with
spores in the same way.

ditions, sunlight, a wide range of temperatures, and
most fungicides. Wheat that is not infected can
become contaminated with spores by passing through
spore-contaminated equipment, transport vessels, or
facilities. Other grains can also be contaminated with
spores in the same way.
While Karnal bunt is not harmful to animals, it is sus-
pected that spores in contaminated or infected feed
(grain or bran from milled wheat) can survive inges-
tion by animals. Since the manure of livestock fed
such feed is potentially a source of inoculum, bunted
wheat in quarantined counties must be heat-treated if
used for animal feed.
The American Phytopathological Society states that
the experience from countries where Karnal bunt
occurs suggests that Karnal bunt is a minor disease
and the little risk that does exist for grain quality can
be effectively managed with resistant varieties without
the use of quarantines (American Phytopathological
Society). The Society also suggests that although quar-
antines may delay the introduction of Karnal bunt into
new areas, they are unlikely to prevent such introduc-
tions and subsequent establishment. This conclusion
has been confirmed repeatedly, most recently by the
occurrence of Karnal bunt in the United Sates despite
quarantines imposed on wheat from countries where
the disease has been known to occur.
Quarantines may be ineffective where wheat-growing
areas are contiguous, as between Mexico and the
United States. However, where longer distances apply,
as between continents or where deserts or mountains
intervene, quarantines may help to protect countries
that do not have Karnal bunt (Murray and Brennan).

areas are contiguous, as between Mexico and the
United States. However, where longer distances apply,
as between continents or where deserts or mountains
intervene, quarantines may help to protect countries
that do not have Karnal bunt (Murray and Brennan).
Yield Losses to Karnal Bunt
Karnal bunt spores usually replace only a portion of
the developing kernel and only a few of the kernels in
a head. Complete conversion of kernels to spores is
rare. Thus, yield reductions are generally minimal. For
example, surveys in India during years of heavy dis-
ease infestations revealed a general, area-wide yield
loss of less than 0.5 percent (Davila). However, in a
few fields with highly susceptible varieties, as much as
89 percent of the kernels were infected, with yield
losses ranging from 20 to 40 percent.
Options for Karnal Bunt Control
Wheat breeders in areas with Karnal bunt recognize
the importance of avoiding the release of highly sus-
ceptible varieties.2 This control measure has proven
effective for reducing the level of Karnal bunt suffi-
ciently that quality of the harvested grain is not severe-
ly affected. However, resistant varieties do not eradi-
cate the disease, and Karnal bunt epidemics have
recurred in India as soon as susceptible varieties were
again grown (Murray and Brennan).
Apparently, cultural practices are of little practical
value in reducing the probability of an outbreak
(Murray and Brennan). Seed treatments can reduce the

number of viable spores on seed, and, therefore, the
probability that Karnal bunt will be introduced to new
areas. Foliar application of fungicides can reduce the
level of disease, but more than one application is usu-
ally required, making this an expensive control option.
Fungicides are likely to be cost effective only if other
important diseases, such as rusts or Septoria blotches,
are also present. Fumigation of soil with chemicals,
such as methyl bromide, metham-sodium, and
formaldehyde, has been partially successful in killing
the spores.
Exporting Under Deregulation 
Is Problematic
Not all countries that have restrictions against 
Karnal bunt would, in practice, strictly prohibit wheat
imports from the United States if USDA stopped issu-
ing certificates. Each country has regulations that 
are often idiosyncratic in how they are written and
enforced. For example, Italy and Germany currently
import wheat from countries where Karnal bunt is
known to occur, after testing to ensure the wheat is
free of Karnal bunt, despite European Union regula-
tions against such a practice.
In addition, while some markets would be captured by
wheat-exporting countries that are free of Karnal bunt,

tions against such a practice.
In addition, while some markets would be captured by
wheat-exporting countries that are free of Karnal bunt,
U.S. wheat exports to countries that have no restrictions
against Karnal bunt would likely increase. The longrun
effects would likely depend on the extent that world
wheat markets treat Karnal bunt as a quality issue.
There is also an issue of what procedure would be used
by other countries for Karnal bunt testing if the United
States should stop issuing certificates. Currently, there is
no accurate Karnal bunt test available that is rapid
enough to use during ship loading. Even the microscop-
ic examination for spores with the “wash test” can lead
to false positives because of bunt on ryegrass Tilletia
walkeri. Annual ryegrass is a significant weed problem
in wheat fields in the southeastern United States. The
wash test is currently used for seed wheat to ensure that

most importing countries, even with phytosanitary regu-
lations against Karnal bunt, accept APHIS’s certificate
that the wheat comes from an area not known to have
Karnal bunt, and do not routinely test for Karnal bunt
spores or check for bunted kernels.
If even a few important wheat-importing countries
maintain prohibitions, shipping companies may have
concerns about shipping wheat from a deregulated
U.S. wheat sector. Ship owners wishing to protect their
interests may insist on a certificate from an authorita-
tive U.S. source that unequivocally confirms that the
cargo is free from Karnal bunt spores. 
Further, shipping vessels that carried contaminated
wheat to countries without prohibitions would have 
to be sanitized to ensure that later cargoes from other
sources going to countries that continue to have prohibi-
tions will not be contaminated. Under U.S. deregulation,
spores could spread through the storage and transport
equipment to other products like corn and soybeans.
The cost of testing and sanitizing to ensure freedom
from the disease would likely be considerable. 
There may also be issues with transshipment through
the St. Lawrence Seaway if the United States deregu-
lates Karnal bunt. Currently, Canada prohibits the

There may also be issues with transshipment through

lates Karnal bunt. Currently, Canada prohibits the
entry of wheat from States with Karnal bunt. Any
wheat that crosses the Canadian border needs a decla-
ration that the grain originated in an area free of
Karnal bunt on the basis of official surveys.
The future importance of these issues will likely
depend on whether Karnal bunt becomes widespread
across the U.S. wheat sector. However, there is no cer-
tainty about how far and how rapidly the disease might
spread if the quarantine system is eliminated.
The USDA Regulated Areas
An area that is regulated by USDA for Karnal bunt is a
definable commercial wheat-production area that
includes at least one field that tested positive for
Karnal bunted kernels. USDA restricts movement of
wheat grain, straw, hay and farm equipment within and
out of these regulated areas. USDA tests wheat grown
in regulated areas each year for Karnal bunted kernels.
Currently, in a regulated area, a grain sample must be
drawn by an APHIS inspector or State cooperator at
the time of harvest, or if already harvested, from the
storage bins, and examined for bunted kernels. If the
sample is taken from the field as it is being harvested
and no bunted kernels are found, a certificate will be
issued and the grain allowed to be transported to any
market. If the grain sample came from grain already in
storage and no bunted kernels are found, then a permit
will be issued for the grain to be transported to any
market. If one or more bunted kernels are found in the
sample,
Text Len: 1715
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 being harvested
and no bunted kernels are found, a certificate will be
issued and the grain allowed to be transported to any
market. If the grain sample came from grain already in
storage and no bunted kernels are found, then a permit
will be issued for the grain to be transported to any
market. If one or more bunted kernels are found in the
sample, then a notice will be issued and the grain
sealed in the storage facility prior to approved treat-
ment or disposal.
In a regulated area, wheat grown to produce seed can
be planted only within the regulated area and only if
the seed tests spore negative through the wash test.
Seed wheat cannot be moved outside the regulated
area. Any seed grown in a regulated area that tests
spore positive (based on the wash test), but is bunt
negative (based on visual inspection) cannot leave the
area for seeding purposes, but it can leave the area for
export as grain to a country that does not require an
APHIS Karnal bunt certificate or for domestic use for
livestock feed or milling.
Wheat grain, straw, or wheat hay that tests bunt positive
cannot be moved outside the regulated area without
APHIS approval. If needed, a permit is issued to allow
the transport of these products to an approved facility
outside the regulated area for treatment or disposal.
Karnal bunt quarantines have been controversial since
they were initiated in 1996. To increase cooperation,
USDA compensates producers, grain handlers, and
other affected parties for losses suffered due to the
Federal quarantine action. Compensation payments
have totaled about $35 million since 1996 (U.S.
Department of Agriculture).

Estimating the Effects of Karnal 
Bunt Deregulation
Even though Karnal bunt poses no health risk, many
U.S. wheat export markets have a precautionary stance
against the acceptance of wheat without a certificate
indicating the wheat is from an area where Karnal bunt
is not known to occur. Thus, if the United States were
to stop its certification, U.S. wheat would not meet
those importing countries’ phytosanitary requirements.
It is uncertain how the wheat-importing countries of
the world would react if the United States were to end
its Karnal bunt quarantine regulation. The reaction of
many countries would likely depend upon how fre-
4 /square6Wheat Yearbook/WHS-2002/March 2002 Economic Research Service/USDA
quent and how widespread Karnal bunt outbreaks
occurred in the United States and the availability of
wheat from other sources. However, it is possible to
anticipate the likely reactions of governments and
industry to deregulation not accompanied by a severe
outbreak. This study does not attempt to forecast
future incidence of Karnal bunt in U.S. wheat fields.
The scenario analyzed assumes a unilateral end to U.S.
karnal bunt certification, without significant success in
getting importing countries to accept something other
than a zero tolerance level for karnal bunt spores. If
ongoing scientific research and diplomatic efforts
cause a significant number of wheat importers to
accept a more relaxed standard than a zero tolerance,
then trade effects would likely be smaller. However,
such efforts would undoubtedly take time.

al bunt certification, without significant success in

than a zero tolerance level for karnal bunt spores. If
ongoing scientific research and diplomatic efforts
cause a significant number of wheat importers to
accept a more relaxed standard than a zero tolerance,
then trade effects would likely be smaller. However,
such efforts would undoubtedly take time. 
With unilateral deregulation, we assumed that most of
the adverse reactions of U.S. wheat customers would
fall on hard red winter wheat (HRW) producers in the
Central and Southern Plains and soft red winter wheat
(SRW) producers (these two classes averaged 62 per-
cent of U.S. wheat production between 1996 and
2000). The combination of weather conditions and
stage of plant growth needed to result in Karnal bunt
infection are most likely in areas where these two
classes of wheat are grown (Dobeseberger, Jimenez,
and Sequeira). Because U.S. wheat is blended, we also
assumed that HRW and SRW from northern States that
might not be susceptible to karnal bunt cannot be certi-
fied as free of spores. However, the harsh winters in
the northern United States where the other classes of
wheat are principally grown are expected to prevent
the spread of the disease into those regions. U.S.
domestic and international customers for the three
classes of wheat: hard red spring (HRS), durum in the
Northern Plains, and white wheat (from the traditional
Pacific Northwest and Northeastern white wheat areas,
not Kansas) are assumed to be unconcerned about
Karnal bunt contamination, even with decertification.
This lack of concern assumes that some alternative

for importers of spring and white wheat and is a major

Northern Plains, and white wheat (from the traditional
Pacific Northwest and Northeastern white wheat areas,
not Kansas) are assumed to be unconcerned about
Karnal bunt contamination, even with decertification.
This lack of concern assumes that some alternative
government or private certification is found acceptable
for importers of spring and white wheat and is a major
reason why this scenario does not have a larger U.S.
trade loss. Moreover, Canada is also assumed to accept
alternative certification, allowing transshipments
through the Saint Lawrence. For many common uses,
HRS and HRW are readily substituted, as are SRW
and soft white wheat. 
A world wheat trade model that appropriately estimates
trade flows by class and country was not available to
analyze the issue, so a scenario was developed based
on expert judgment of USDA analysts. A set of
assumptions about prices and trade impacts by country
was developed using the February 2002 trade matrix of
2001/02 world wheat trade. The percent changes in
U.S. wheat exports were then applied, beginning in
2003, relative to the USDA Agricultural Baseline
Projections to 2011, in a U.S. agricultural sector model
to calculate the impacts on the domestic farm sector. 
As a first step, countries were classified by their
antipathy to Karnal bunt and their presumed response
to U.S. deregulation (table A-1). For this analysis, each
significant market for U.S. wheat exports was put into
one of three categories.
Group A , accounting for 25 percent of forecast U.S.
exports, includes countries that: (1) have strict
requirements on Karnal bunt as reported by APHIS,
(2) have a history of strict observance of phytosanitary
regulations, (3) normally import hard red

(2) have a history of strict observance of phytosanitary

U.S. wheat exports were examined to evaluate the
effect of reducing U.S. HRW and SRW exports to zero
for Groups 1 and 2 during the first year (see table A-
1). This means that about 60 percent of U.S. customers
would find about 55 percent of U.S. exports unaccept-
able. Some switching to other U.S. wheat classes is
assumed, but switching would be limited by supplies
and by limited substitutability for some uses. The

 substitutability for some uses. The
world wheat market is segmented: some countries have
inelastic demand, are willing to pay high premiums,
and are expected to be concerned about Karnal bunt;
other countries like discounted, cheap wheat and are
not concerned about Karnal bunt. Assumptions about
responsiveness in each country drives the analysis of
changes in world wheat trade and U.S. exports. 
In the first year, U.S. exports of HRW and SRW are
calculated to increase to those markets still accepting
them, while overall U.S. wheat exports are calculated
to drop nearly 7 million tons, or 25 percent below
baseline levels. Most of the drop in U.S. exports is
expected to be gained by competitors’ exports and
reduced ending stocks (boosting prices in those coun-
tries). Importers also draw down stocks some, but the
decline in world wheat trade is small because some
importers actually increase imports of cheaper U.S.
HRW and SRW. 
While the U.S. average farm price for wheat drops sig-
nificantly (45 cents per bushel in 2003) under this sce-
nario, the premium for spring wheat (relative to the all-
wheat average farm price) is assumed to be about 50
cents per bushel greater than normal, while the discount
for HRW and SRW would be at least 50 cents greater
than normal. The market impacts of by-class premiums
and discounts are larger than the change in the average

Egypt is an important example of how a country
might react to Karnal bunt decertification. Egypt
has strict phytosanitary regulations regarding
Karnal bunt. Moreover, it is a significant producer,
with irrigated land that could be quite susceptible
to the disease. These factors would likely cause
Egypt to be inflexible about accepting wheat with
Karnal bunt spores (a Group A country). However,
while most U.S. exports to Egypt have been HRW
or SRW, some are other classes. U.S. shipments of
white wheat could be expected to increase, limiting
U.S. losses in the first year of the scenario (2003)
to less than 3 million tons (see table A-1).
However, in 2004, increased competition, in this
case especially from Australian white wheat, is
expected to push U.S. wheat out of the Egyptian
market. In the third year and later, after prices and
production in Australia decline from the peak in the
second year, U.S. white wheat shipments to Egypt
recoup losses, ending up higher than without
Karnal bunt. However, without SRW and HRW, the
United States has still lost most of its wheat export
market to Egypt. 
Venezuela is an example of a Group B country
(with medium Karnal bunt antipathy). While
Venezuela has regulations prohibiting Karnal bunt
in wheat imports, and Karnal bunt might propagate
in that climate, Venezuela’s wheat production is
insignificant. Eventually, Venezuela could be
expected to accept a Karnal bunt spore tolerance

Venezuela is an example of a Group B country
(with medium Karnal bunt antipathy). While
Venezuela has regulations prohibiting Karnal bunt
in wheat imports, and Karnal bunt might propagate
in that climate, Venezuela’s wheat production is
insignificant. Eventually, Venezuela could be
expected to accept a Karnal bunt spore tolerance
greater than zero. However, it would likely take
extensive negotiations. About 70 percent of U.S.
exports to Venezuela are HRW or SRW. In the first
year of the scenario, U.S. HRS shipments would be
expected to increase some, but Canada and
Argentina would be expected to provide intense
competition, replacing most of U.S. HRW and SRW
shipments. In the second year, with negotiations
ongoing and intense competition from Canada, even
the U.S. HRS share is reduced. In the third year,
Venezuela is assumed to accept a reasonable toler-
ance for Karnal bunt spores, and U.S. exports
increase dramatically, but in the long run Canada
has gained a competitive edge, and the U.S. share
remains about 17 percent below what it would have
been without Karnal bunt. 
A Group C country, with low Karnal Bunt antipa-
thy, like Israel, has no regulation concerning Karnal
bunt. Imports of U.S. wheat are above baseline lev-
els throughout the scenario, but the increase in 2004
is less because increased competitor supplies and
reduced prices limit U.S. gains. In 2005 and later,
the U.S. share increases again because the price of
U.S. HRW and SRW is comparatively attractive.

the U.S. share increases again because the price of
U.S. HRW and SRW is comparatively attractive. 
Examples By Country
U.S. price received by farmers for wheat. The assumed
relative international price changes (about $1.00 per
bushel) are thus similar enough in magnitude to price
changes in 1995/96 (when the average farm price
increased $1.10) so that the 1994 to 1998 reaction of
U.S. competitors to high prices can provide insight into
their likely reaction in this scenario. 
In 1994/95, the major competitors (Canada, Australia,
EU, and Argentina) reduced wheat stocks more than
11 million tons, while in the Karnal bunt scenario, a 6-
million-ton reduction is anticipated. These countries
increased wheat production by over 30 million tons in
1996/97, but a smaller increase, about 15 million tons,
is assumed in the Karnal bunt scenario because their
price increases would be less than occurred in
1995/96. Moreover, competitors are currently planting
more wheat than in 1994/95, so it will be more diffi-
cult for them to expand from this higher base. 
In the second year of the scenario (2004), some of the
importing countries in Group B (see table A-1) are
assumed to adopt less restrictive Karnal bunt stan-
dards, opening imports to U.S. HRW and SRW, there-
by reducing the direct effect of Karnal bunt trade barri-
ers. However, in that second year, foreign competitors’
production (and U.S. HRS and

see table A-1) are
assumed to adopt less restrictive Karnal bunt stan-
dards, opening imports to U.S. HRW and SRW, there-
by reducing the direct effect of Karnal bunt trade barri-
ers. However, in that second year, foreign competitors’
production (and U.S. HRS and White wheat) is expect-
ed to increase strongly in response to the first year’s
higher prices. Although a portion of competitors’
increased production is used to replenish stocks, much
is expected to move into export channels, further
reducing U.S. market share. In the second year of the
scenario, U.S. wheat exports are estimated down 9.5
million tons, 35 percent below the baseline level (with-
out Karnal bunt). 
In the third year after deregulation, the rest of Group B
countries further relax Karnal bunt import standards,
and competitors’ response is muted, as wheat prices
and premiums in those countries decline. However, in
the third year, U.S. wheat exports are 20 percent below
baseline levels. In subsequent years, the U.S. recap-
tures some lost market share as price premiums in
competing countries become small. However, the
exclusion of U.S. HRW and SRW from group A mar-
kets results in a small premium for U.S. competitors
that are free of Karnal bunt and reduces long-term
U.S. wheat exports by 15 percent below baseline lev-
els. This long-term decline represents a loss in market
share despite the development of alternative regulatory
mechanisms in markets accounting for 80 percent of
U.S. wheat exports.

U.S. wheat exports by 15 percent below baseline lev-
els. This long-term decline represents a loss in market
share despite the development of alternative regulatory
mechanisms in markets accounting for 80 percent of
U.S. wheat exports. 
No model is available that includes the effects of 
wheat classes on world trade or U.S. regional and class
differences with appropriate substitution elasticities.
Therefore, a more general model was used to quantify
price changes and address the effects on U.S. agriculture. 
Model Simulation Results
The U.S. domestic impacts of terminating certificates
for Karnal bunt were estimated with the Food and
Agricultural Policy Simulator (FAPSIM). FAPSIM is a
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. agricultural
sector maintained by the Economic Research Service
(ERS). The model contains submodels for 24 agricul-
tural commodities, including wheat.3 The model also
includes submodels to estimate the value of exports,
net farm income, and Government outlays on farm
programs for the United States. 
These submodels are linked together through the vari-
ables that they share in common. The model computes
the set of market prices that equilibrate supply and
demand in all of the commodity markets simultaneous-
ly, given any set of exogenous conditions. 
The estimated trade impacts were introduced into the
model by exogenously reducing wheat exports from
their baseline levels over the 2003-07 period by the
percentages already mentioned. The initial export lev-
els used in the analysis were obtained from the
February 2002 USDA baseline (USDA, Office of the
Chief Economist). All of the model simulation results
from the scenario are compared against the USDA
baseline projections in the discussion that

 by exogenously reducing wheat exports from
their baseline levels over the 2003-07 period by the
percentages already mentioned. The initial export lev-
els used in the analysis were obtained from the
February 2002 USDA baseline (USDA, Office of the
Chief Economist). All of the model simulation results
from the scenario are compared against the USDA
baseline projections in the discussion that follows. 
Figure A-2 shows the assumed reduction in wheat
exports under the scenario compared with the baseline.
In 2003/04 and 2004/05, exports under the scenario
decline relative to the baseline by 25 and 35 percent, or
by 244 million and 359 million bushels, respectively.
Exports partly recover in the succeeding years of the
analysis, averaging 15 percent less than the baseline.
The decline in exports under the scenario reduces the
farmgate price of wheat (fig. A-3). Prices decline from
the baseline by 17 and 19 percent, or by 45 and 53
cents per bushel, in 2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively.
The loss is larger in the second year because the
sharply higher prices expected to be received by U.S.
competitors in 2003/04 result in significantly expanded

production in 2004/05. We assumed that the European
Union would not put a tax on wheat exports to hold
down its domestic prices. U.S. domestic prices partial-
ly recover relative to the baseline in succeeding years
with recovery of some of the lost export markets. The
prices under the scenario are still below baseline prices

. We assumed that the European
Union would not put a tax on wheat exports to hold
down its domestic prices. U.S. domestic prices partial-
ly recover relative to the baseline in succeeding years
with recovery of some of the lost export markets. The
prices under the scenario are still below baseline prices
by 13 percent in 2007/08.
With domestic prices lower under the scenario, the
U.S. area planted to wheat declines relative to the
baseline (fig. A-4). However, the response by produc-
ers to the lower wheat prices is muted somewhat over
the initial years because of U.S. Government farm pro-
grams. Part of the market revenue loss that producers
experience due to lower farm prices over this period is
offset by an increase in marketing loan benefits that
they receive from the government. As a result, the area
planted to wheat declines relative to the baseline by 2
and 3 percent, or by 1.0 and 2.1 million acres, respec-
tively, in 2004/05 and 2005/06. In contrast, area plant-
ed to wheat declines by 2.7 million acres below the
baseline level in 2007/08 when producers are not
expected to receive any offsetting compensation
through marketing loans. Because the production
response is muted in the early years, excess production
occurs, causing the price impacts to be larger than they
would be in the absence of government programs.
With lower prices under the scenario, domestic feeding
of wheat increases sharply, by 32 and 107 percent, or
by 88 and 295 million bushels, in 2003/04 and
2004/05, respectively. With smaller price impacts in
the succeeding years, the changes in feed demand also

become smaller. Nonetheless, wheat feeding under the
scenario remains above the baseline level by about 32
percent in 2007/08. Part of the reason these impacts
are large is that the model solution was constrained to
ensure that the price of wheat never falls below its
feed value in relation to the price of corn. Wheat dis-
placed corn as an animal feed to the extent necessary
to ensure this constraint was satisfied.
Total domestic use of wheat is estimated to rise by 7
and 22 percent, or by 90 and 296 million bushels, for
2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively (fig. A-5). This rise

placed corn as an animal feed to the extent necessary

Total domestic use of wheat is estimated to rise by 7
and 22 percent, or by 90 and 296 million bushels, for
2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively (fig. A-5). This rise
is almost entirely due to the increased feeding of
wheat, with only a slight increase in food use. Seed
use declines under the scenario relative to the baseline
because of the reduction in area planted to wheat.
Even though wheat feeding increases sharply under the
scenario, this rise is not enough to offset export losses.
Thus, ending stocks are estimated to rise above the
baseline by 22 and 27 percent, or by 154 and 179 mil-
lion bushels, for 2003/04 and 2004/05, respectively
(fig. A-6). Although the impacts on ending stocks
become smaller in the succeeding years of the sce-
nario, stocks remain above baseline levels by 21 per-
cent in 2007/08.
The reduction in wheat production and the lower farm-
gate prices under the scenario combine to reduce U.S.
cash receipts received by wheat producers from farm
marketings (fig. A-7). Cash receipts for wheat are esti-
mated to drop below the baseline by $915 million and
$1,293 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively. By the

final year of the analysis, cash receipts remain below
baseline levels by $1,167 million. Cumulative wheat
cash receipts decline by $5.8 billion below the baseline
over the 2003-07 period.
No marketing loan payments are assumed for wheat
over the 2003-07 period under the baseline. However,
the price declines for wheat over the 2003-05 period
under the scenario are sufficient to trigger marketing
loan benefits. The payments to wheat producers are
$0.7, $0.6, and $0.2 billion for 2003/04, 2004/05, and
2005/06, respectively. The cumulative marketing loan
benefits associated with all crops increase by $2.0 bil-
lion above the baseline over the 2003-07 period. 
As suggested above, other commodities are also affect-
ed by the price adjustments that occur in the wheat

 and $0.2 billion for 2003/04, 2004/05, and
2005/06, respectively. The cumulative marketing loan
benefits associated with all crops increase by $2.0 bil-
lion above the baseline over the 2003-07 period. 
As suggested above, other commodities are also affect-
ed by the price adjustments that occur in the wheat
sector under the scenario. As the profitability of wheat
production declines, producers shift production from
wheat to alternative crops. The increase in production
causes the prices for other crops to decline. However,
the price changes associated with other crops are small
in relation to the price changes for wheat. Farm prices
of other crops change by less than 5 percent from their
baseline levels over the 2003-07 period. The price
impacts for the livestock sector, stemming from lower
feed costs, are even smaller. 
The farm price of corn is estimated to decline below
the baseline level by 4.5 percent in 2003/2004 as live-
stock producers shift from corn to the lower priced
wheat in their feed rations. On average, corn prices are
1.3 percent below baseline levels over the 2003-07
period, with comparable changes for other feed grain
prices. As a result, cumulative cash receipts for feed
grains decline by $1.2 billion below the baseline over
the 2003-07 period.
With lower wheat exports and prices under the sce-
nario, the value of U.S. exports of wheat declines
below baseline levels. The cumulative value of total
U.S. agricultural exports is estimated to fall by over
$6.3 billion over the 2003-07 period under the scenario
(fig. A-8). Although most of the decrease is associated
with wheat, there are also downward adjustments in
the value of exports for other commodities due to
lower prices

U.S. agricultural exports is estimated to fall by over

(fig. A-8). Although most of the decrease is associated
with wheat, there are also downward adjustments in
the value of exports for other commodities due to
lower prices.
Because prices of all agricultural commodities decline
under the scenario, total U.S. cash receipts from the
farm marketings decline below baseline levels.
Cumulative cash receipts over the 2003-07 period are
estimated to be $10.4 billion below the baseline level.
More than half of this decline is associated directly
with wheat. There are also some offsetting adjust-
ments. Because there is less total crop area planted
under the scenario, producers incur fewer production
expenses. In aggregate, cumulative farm expenses are
seen as $2.9 billion below the baseline level over the
2003-07 period. In addition, with producers receiving
increased government support payments through mar-
keting loan benefits, cumulative net farm income over
the 2003-07 period is estimated to be $5.3 billion
lower than the baseline level (fig. A-9).
The average impacts discussed here would not be
spread evenly across the Nation’s wheat sector.
Because Karnal bunt deregulation would be focused on
hard red winter and soft red winter exports, impacts
would center on wheat producers in the Central and
Southern Plains and the Southeastern region of the
country. It is possible that a longer run effect of dereg-
ulation would be to reduce wheat acreage in the
Central and Southern Plains and to increase wheat
acreage in the Northern Plains, if foreign customers
continue to be reluctant to purchase wheat grown in
areas potentially affected by Karnal bunt.

are not affected by deregulation. However, if domestic

wheat acreage to the North would be enhanced.
Conclusions
Karnal bunt seldom results in significant yield losses
to wheat in the field. However, Karnal bunt affects
flour quality if more than 3 percent of the grains are
bunted because it gives off a fishy odor. In addition,
pasta products made with flour contaminated with
Karnal bunt can have an unacceptable color. The fun-
gus that causes Karnal bunt does not produce any toxic
compounds in leaf, stem tissue, or seed that pose
health risks when consumed. Thus, Karnal bunt is a
food quality issue rather than a food safety issue.
Because the fungus poses no risk to human health, the
U.S. Government does not have any food safety regu-
lations concerning wheat infected with Karnal bunt.
However, the compensation payments for the Karnal
bunt quarantine regulatory program have totaled about
$35 million

lations concerning wheat infected with Karnal bunt.
However, the compensation payments for the Karnal
bunt quarantine regulatory program have totaled about
$35 million from 1996 through 2001.
Even though scientific evidence is that Karnal bunt
posses no health risk, many U.S. wheat export markets
require that wheat from the United States be from
areas where Karnal bunt is not known to occur. Such
countries would likely resist importing U.S. wheat if
the certification procedures were terminated.
The assumed impact of terminating Karnal bunt certifi-
cation is entirely through reduced exports. Using an
ERS model of U.S. agriculture, an export scenario was
evaluated. Domestic prices dropped sharply, which, in
turn, reduced the area planted to wheat. Although
wheat feeding rose with the lower prices, the increase
was not nearly enough to offset the loss of export mar-
kets. Wheat prices remained below baseline levels. The
reduction in wheat production and the lower prices
combined to reduce the total value of the wheat pro-
duced in the country, as well as the net income of U.S.
agriculture. The effects primarily affected producers in
the Central and Southern Plains and in the Southeast.
The cumulative total reduction of national net farm
income from 2003 to 2007 is $5.3 billion. The cumula-
tive marketing loan payments associated with all crops
increase by $2.0 billion above the baseline over the
2003-07 period.

wheat for Karnal bunt contamination, or the wheat
quality discounts

amination of vessels and handling facilities, regula-
tions for the transhipment of grain through the St.
Lawrence Seaway, and possible trade impacts for other
grains such as corn and soybeans if the Karnal bunt
quarantine system is deregulated.
