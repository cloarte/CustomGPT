skins on grains of wheat 
Small, brown beetles 
in dried plant or 
animal products
Adults possess wings 
but aren't known to fly
Length between 2 and 3 millimeters 
(1 mm = thickness of 1 dime)
THE HARM IT CAUSES
This tiny beetle is one of the world’s most destructive  
pests of grain products and seeds.  Its feeding   
damage often spoils 30 percent of the product; up to 
70 percent damage has been reported.  Detections 
require massive, long-term, and costly control and 
eradication efforts.  Established infestations are  
difficult to control because the beetle can survive 
without food for long periods, requires little moisture, 
hides in tiny cracks and crevices, and is relatively 
resistant to many insecticides and fumigants. 
WHAT YOU CAN DO
• Find out if you’re traveling to a country where 
Khapra beetle is known to occur.  Visit  
www.aphis.usda.gov/travel to view a travel  
alert that lists these countries.
• Don’t bring rice, soybeans, Cicer species  
(e.g., chickpeas), and safflower seeds from these 
countries into the United States.  Check the  
Web site above for any updates.
