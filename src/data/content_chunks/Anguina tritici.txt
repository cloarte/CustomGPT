 Invasion: (After Goodey, 1932):
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: Cultivated / agricultural land
 Reproduccion: Several weeks elapse in moist soil before the gall is softened enough to release the juveniles. It takes 2-9 days for juveniles to reach a plant ( Leukel, 1924 ); the first plant encountered is invaded. Horizontal and vertical migration do not exceed 20-30 cm ( Leukel, 1957 ) and 7-19 cm ( Limber, 1980 ), respectively. A film of moisture must be present on the invaded plant to allow nematode movement. Juveniles swim up the stem and enter the leaves or leaf sheath; they then migrate to the growing point where they feed ectoparasitically. When the floral organs appear, the staminate tissue is invaded followed by the carpellate tissue. Juveniles feed ectoparasitically until floral tissue develops, when gall formation is stimulated. Galls arise from undifferentiated carpellate tissue. Juveniles develop into males or females in the gall (fewer than 25 per gall), and thousands of eggs are deposited. One female can deposit up to 2000 eggs ( Southey, 1972 ). Mature females form tight coils, become quiescent, and die following oviposition.

 females in the gall (fewer than 25 per gall), and thousands of eggs are deposited. One female can deposit up to 2000 eggs ( Southey, 1972 ). Mature females form tight coils, become quiescent, and die following oviposition. Juveniles entering leaves produce a whitish gall and leaf symptoms. The entire life cycle of A. tritici is completed in about 113 days; however, the life cycle has been reported to last up to 164 days in India ( Swarup and Gupta, 1971 ). It is not uncommon for juveniles to leave the gall in autumn and seek new plants for overwintering or to overwinter in soil ( Maggenti, 1981 ). Some juveniles leave galls in the autumn and overwinter in the leaf sheaths of host plants ( Leukel, 1957 ). Juveniles enter a state of anhydrobiosis in dry storage. The water content in the nematodes is reduced from the normal level of 45-50% to 5%, lipid droplets become crinkled and indented and the body becomes tightly coiled ( Bird and Buttrose, 1974 ). The nematodes invade the leaves and leaf sheaths of emergent seedlings and also the developing floral parts. In the final stages of attack, they modify the seed into nematode-infected galls in the floral tissue. Juveniles in the gall range in number from 3600-32,400 in India ( Thorne, 1961 ). The number of females and males in galls ranged from 3-37 and 1-41, respectively ( Christie, 1959 ). A minimum population of 10,000 juveniles/kg soil is essential for development of ear-cockle. Disease intensity is greatest when nematode galls are placed in soil at a depth of 2-6 cm than when placed deeper ( Luc et al., 2005 ).

Disease intensity is greatest when nematode galls are placed in soil at a depth of 2-6 cm than when placed deeper ( Luc et al., 2005 ). A. tritici has survived up to 35 years in dry storage ( Thorne, 1961 ). Juveniles do not survive more than 1 year in field soil ( Norton, 1978 ). Some juveniles survive in the faeces of rodents, sheep, frogs, salamanders and goldfish ( Norton, 1978 ). Spores of a pathogen, such as Dilophosphora alopecuri , may be carried into the floral tissue on the cuticle of A. tritici . However, in most cases the disease organism is detected inside the gall with A. tritici . When the entire gall is filled with pathogen spores, the nematodes are eliminated by competition. One disease is traded for another with no real economic gain. The following diseases are associated with A. tritici : Corynebacterium michiganense pv. tritici [ Rathayibacter tritici ] on Polypogon monspeliensis ( Paruthi et al., 1989 ); Clavibacter tritici [ R. tritici ] on barley ( Bhatti et al., 1978 ) and wheat ( Swarup and Singh, 1962 ); and Dilophosphora alopecuri ( Poinar, 1983 ), D. graminus (Filipjev and Schuurmans Stekhoven, 1941), Neovossia indica [ Tilletia indica ] ( Paruthi and Bhatti, 1980 ), Sclerophthora macrospora ( Paruthi et al., 1992 ), Tilletia foetida [ T. laevis ] ( Mathur and Misra, 1961 ), Ust

Yellow ear-rot, or 'tundu', is a nematode-vectored bacterial disease commonly associated with ear-cockle. The disease is caused by the association of A. tritici with R. tritici .
 Sintomas: The absence of symptoms does not mean absence of A. tritici ( Thorne, 1949 ). Slight elevations occur on the upper leaf surface with indentations on the lower side. Other symptoms include wrinkling, twisting, curling of the margins towards the midrib, distortion, buckling, swelling and bulging. A tight spiral coil evolves, and dwarfing, loss of colour or a mottled, yellowed appearance and stem bending may also occur ( Byars, 1920 ; Leukel, 1924 ). In severe infection, the entire above-ground plant is distorted to some degree and a disease problem is usually obvious.
