 Invasion: E. australis is an annual that can only reproduce by seed (Gilbey and Weiss, 1980). Cotyledons are hairless and shaped like an elongated club with a round apex. The first leaves produced are hairless and oval with an obtuse apex. All subsequent leaves are more triangular with an indented, heart-shaped base (Wilding et al., 1993). The plant develops a long and thick taproot. The adult plant is prostrate or ascending with round, ribbed stems that radiate from the crown in all directions and that branch dichotomously at nodes. On the stems, at the base of the petioles, are brown membranous ochreae (circa 5 mm long). The basal leaves are usually the longest leaves on the plant (up to 15 cm) and have similarly long petioles. Moving along the stem and away from the crown, the leaves become smaller (down to 3 cm) with shorter petioles. The small (circa 2 mm), inconspicuous green flowers have separate sexes but are self-compatible and from these a hard wooden achene (fruit) with three spines (=modified lobes of the perianth) develops (Gardner, 1930). Achenes are dimorphic. Those attached to the lower sections of the crown of the plant (subterranean) differ from those attached elsewhere, including the upper sections of the crown (aerial), in that they are flattened with a bilateral rather than radial symmetry and they have proportionally shorter spines. Achenes are originally green (aerial) or white with yellow and red (subterranean) but turn brown as they ripen. The ripe

 of the crown of the plant (subterranean) differ from those attached elsewhere, including the upper sections of the crown (aerial), in that they are flattened with a bilateral rather than radial symmetry and they have proportionally shorter spines. Achenes are originally green (aerial) or white with yellow and red (subterranean) but turn brown as they ripen. The ripe subterranean achenes tend to remain attached to the mother plant's crown even after the plant has senesced and in subsequent years are likely to germinate near its parental plant's location (Gilbey and Weiss, 1980). The ripe aerial achenes readily detach from the parental plant and are triangular in cross section with their spines arranged so that one spine always points upwards, thereby increasing their chance of dispersal via a passing animal or even vehicles. Typically, only the aerial achenes are noticed as they are far more numerous, are on the soil's surface and have the strong, sharp, impaling spines. A similar achene dimorphism occurs in E. spinosa (Evenari et al., 1977;Weiss, 1980).The achenes contain a single, trigonous seed, produced firstly in the rosette and then sequentially in leaf axils along the stems. The plant has indeterminate growth, with stem and seed production continuing as long as the season is favourable. They ripen in approximately the same order as conception so that green achenes are still developing near the growing apices of the stem whilst ripe achenes have been shed from the stem near the crown. Due to the continuous growing nature of the plant, the size of aerial achenes vary greatly even within a single plant, but achenes are commonly >10 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip). In E. australis the subterranean achenes rarely exceed 8 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip).Weiss and

 have been shed from the stem near the crown. Due to the continuous growing nature of the plant, the size of aerial achenes vary greatly even within a single plant, but achenes are commonly >10 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip). In E. australis the subterranean achenes rarely exceed 8 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip).Weiss and Simmons (1979)collected seed (achenes) from E. australis populations in its native South Africa as well as from Australia and Hawaii where it is an exotic. Two generations of plant were then grown from these seeds planted simultaneously and within the same glasshouse, so as to remove the effects of environmental variations. They found little difference between the Australian and South African populations of E. australis, but second-generation plants from the Hawaii population had fewer stems, nodes and leaves and produced 40% less seeds than the others.Scott (1990)studied the biology and population dynamics of E. australis growing in South Africa and compared this to similar data collected byWeiss (1981)for E. australis grown in Australia. Seed banks, seedling densities, survivorship data and achene production were all found to be similar.

 Reproduccion: GeneticsThe chromosome number of E. australis (based upon Australian populations) is 2n=20 ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ) and is the same as both Australian and Portuguese populations of E. spinosa ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ; Queiros, 1983 ). In Australia, where both species co-exist, the plants readily hybridise. Both species are monoecious with flowers of both sexes forming near the apex of the stems as the plant grows. Due to the more erect morphology of E. spinosa and as pollen is more likely to fall down than go upwards, seeds collected from E. australis plants were commonly outcrossed with E. spinosa but seeds collected from E. spinosa plants were only rarely outcrossed with E. australis ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ). Putievsky et al. (1980) found the hybrids grew more vigorously than either parent, but were completely sterile when self-pollinated. They were, however, able to backcross with the parental species giving the possibility of gene flow between the species. There is very little genetic variability within E. australis ( Weiss and Simmons, 1979 ; Panetta, 1990a ). Panetta (1990a) states "E. australis provides an example of a sexually reproducing species whose patterns of within and between population variation are generally similar in both source and colonial regions. Indeed, 16 of the 21 surveyed South African populations could not be distinguished from Australian populations."Physiology and PhenologyIn areas with a Mediterranean climate, the emergence of E. australis usually begins in autumn after sufficient rain or in years with earlier rainfall, multiple waves of germination are often observed, each associated with significant rainfall events.

iology and PhenologyIn areas with a Mediterranean climate, the emergence of E. australis usually begins in autumn after sufficient rain or in years with earlier rainfall, multiple waves of germination are often observed, each associated with significant rainfall events. Weiss (1981) found that up to six distinct cohorts may sometimes occur within a single year and attributed these to the earlier rains arriving before the majority of viable seed had completed their required period of innate dormancy. Although mid-season accessions may contain the most individuals, it was the first accessions of each year that contributed the most to seed production. Flowers could be produced within 4 weeks of germination and seeds within 6 weeks; however, this was highly variable and in some years it took 18 weeks before flowers were even produced. Seeds are produced continuously at the growing apex of the stems throughout the growing season. Regardless of when they germinate, all Emex plants die at the end of the winter rains when soil moisture disappears ( Weiss, 1981 ). The longevity of the growing season can vary immensely from site to site and from year to year with 20-32 weeks after the first accession, reported in Weiss (1981) . Within a Mediterranean climatic region, irrigation during the summer will permit some E. australis seeds to germinate and these can successfully complete development ( Panetta, 1990b ) but germination rates are lower than normal due to a proportion of the seed being dormant. Seedling densities can be over 900 plants/m² ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ), though more commonly 20-500 plants/m² in areas where E. australis is a problem ( Gilbey and Lightfoot, 1979 ; Weiss, 1981 ; Scott, 1990 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993b ; Scott and Shivas, 1998; Yeoh et al., 2002 ). At seedling densities of approximately 200 plants/m², survival from emergence to seed production is 40-50% in both Australia and

m² in areas where E. australis is a problem ( Gilbey and Lightfoot, 1979 ; Weiss, 1981 ; Scott, 1990 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993b ; Scott and Shivas, 1998; Yeoh et al., 2002 ). At seedling densities of approximately 200 plants/m², survival from emergence to seed production is 40-50% in both Australia and South Africa ( Scott, 1990 ).In sub-tropical climates (e.g. KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, South Africa), E. australis can grow all year round, germinating at any time but remaining an annual ( Scott and Way, 1990 ). E. australis has three distinct phases of growth rate ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). Under glasshouse conditions, for the first 8 weeks after emergence, growth rates are rapid and most energy is diverted towards foliage production. At 8-15 weeks there is a slight decrease in growth with foliage production decreasing but with more stem elongation, branching and buds, flower and fruit formation and a corresponding increase in root biomass. From 15 weeks senescence occurs and whilst during this phase there is no net increase in plant weight, resources from the leaves, stems and roots are reabsorbed and translocated to the developing achene. Embryo development begins in the seed 3 weeks after flowering and seeds are mature 6 weeks after flowering. Gilbey and Weiss (1980) report the average weight of achenes as being 20 mg, 50 mg and 60 mg at 3, 6 and 8 weeks respectively after flowering. The weight of the achene remained stable after it was 8 weeks old. Weiss and Simmons (1977) found that the optimum temperature for production of seed, stems and leaves was 11.7°C and for roots 16.7°C. A delayed flowering and necrosis of stems was shown at the lowest (6.7°C) and highest (26.7

 weeks respectively after flowering. The weight of the achene remained stable after it was 8 weeks old. Weiss and Simmons (1977) found that the optimum temperature for production of seed, stems and leaves was 11.7°C and for roots 16.7°C. A delayed flowering and necrosis of stems was shown at the lowest (6.7°C) and highest (26.7°C) temperatures tested. Above 16.7°C, there were only a few fertile seeds produced with no seeds fully maturing within 15 weeks at 26.7°C. A very strong positive correlation exists between temperature and rate of development until the temperature reaches approximately 19°C, becoming a negative correlation above this.Within an annual pasture system of a Mediterranean climatic region, early cohorts of E. australis seedlings can result in response to significant summer rainfall events. This is due to the ability for some E. australis seed to germinate in response to moisture, relatively independently of temperature requirements (Weiss and Simmons, 1977; Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). In Australia, these result from events such as cyclonic activity which happens reasonably frequently within northern New South Wales and northern Western Australia. Out of season rainfall events are locally referred to as a "false break". Follow up rains may not occur until several months latter when the true autumn/winter rains begin. The long tap root of E. australis seedlings allows them to survive the long dry period following a false break far better than most other annual species and in years where significant E. australis individuals survive a false break they can dominate the pastures and produce massive seed banks if left uncontrolled ( Gilbey, 1974a ; Weiss, 1981 ). This can lead to dramatic increases in infestations of E. australis in the following year ( Lemerle, 1996 ).

is individuals survive a false break they can dominate the pastures and produce massive seed banks if left uncontrolled ( Gilbey, 1974a ; Weiss, 1981 ). This can lead to dramatic increases in infestations of E. australis in the following year ( Lemerle, 1996 ). Reproductive BiologyE. australis only reproduces by seed, is monoecious and self-compatible ( Gardner, 1930 ). The spiny female flowers are sessile and in axillary clusters which form first on the crown, in the centre of the rosette, but subsequently in leaf axil nodes along the stems. The male flowers form in short axillary racemes, often emerging between the female achenes ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). Stem growth, flower and subsequent seed production is continuous throughout the plant's lifetime. E. australis has a high degree of phenotypic plasticity with the extent of stem and node formation dependent upon environmental conditions and seed production being correlated with this stem and node production. Individuals growing under poor conditions (or in a short growing season) produce only a few seeds <10), but plants are capable of producing over 1100 seeds given favourable conditions ( Weiss, 1978 ). E. australis invests a large proportion of its available resources into reproduction with highly stressed plants devoting 36%, and plants under more favourable conditions devoting 62% of all resources into achene and seed production ( Weiss, 1978 ). Achene weight is variable from <10 mg to >90mg; however, Weiss (1978) found for Australian populations of E. australis the modal achene weight was 40-50 mg at the end of the growing season regardless of the plants' growing conditions. Weiss and Julien (1975) report mean achene lengths (capsule base to the top of the inner lobes of the female perianth) of 8.0 mm and mean widths (between two spine tips) of 9

 of E. australis the modal achene weight was 40-50 mg at the end of the growing season regardless of the plants' growing conditions. Weiss and Julien (1975) report mean achene lengths (capsule base to the top of the inner lobes of the female perianth) of 8.0 mm and mean widths (between two spine tips) of 9.5 mm. Massive seed banks can occur with up to 10,000 seeds/m² following the first year in pasture within a crop/pasture rotation, but over 17,000 seeds/m² is possible if E. australis plants are specifically protected from interspecific competition, pathogen and insect attack ( Scott et al., 2000 ).The persistence of E. australis and its ability to survive control measures is due to seed dormancy and longevity ( Cheam, 1996 ). All seeds are dormant when freshly formed and require a 2-6 month period of after-ripening before they can germinate ( Hagon and Simmons, 1978 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). Panetta and Randall (1993c) , studying four populations of E. australis in Western Australian, found that if given the correct environmental conditions, most seeds (80-95%) were able to germinate at some stage during the following autumn. Whilst some seeds within the seed bank remained in this constant non-dormant state, the dormancy pattern in the majority (60-90%) followed the climatic patterns with germination being possible each winter but not possible each summer. A proportion of the seeds (5-20%) remained in a state of constant innate dormancy for the duration of the study (2 years). Seeds that remain in the constant non-dormant state give the species the flexibility to recruit opportunistically after summer rainfall events within the Mediterranean climate ( Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). Seeds that remain in the extended innate-dormant

 summer. A proportion of the seeds (5-20%) remained in a state of constant innate dormancy for the duration of the study (2 years). Seeds that remain in the constant non-dormant state give the species the flexibility to recruit opportunistically after summer rainfall events within the Mediterranean climate ( Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). Seeds that remain in the extended innate-dormant state ensure the continued recruitment of seedlings each year ( Scott, 1990 ).Despite most of the viable E. australis seeds being able to germinate each autumn, the proportion of seeds that actually germinates each season is usually low with only 15% of viable seeds reported germinating by Scott (1990) for E. australis in South Africa and 17% reported by Cheam (1996) , 17.6% by Panetta and Randall (1993b) , and 37% by Weiss (1981) for E. australis in Australia. Cultivation is known to increase germination ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ; Weiss, 1990 ). Another important factor is the ability of the seed to imbibe sufficient water for germination via its encapsulating, large, hard and spiny perianth ( Cheam, 1987 ). As a consequence, unburied seeds have in general a low rate of germination. It would also explain Gilbey and Weiss's (1980) observation of lower emergence rates on sandy soils compared to heavier soils, which would retain higher moisture levels. Within a particular season, seeds buried 1-5 cm deep are most likely to become established ( Scott, 1990 ; Cheam, 1996 ) whereas those on the soil surface or buried deeper than 10 cm are more likely to remain viable in future years thus acting as seed reservoirs in the event of future soil disturbances.

 established ( Scott, 1990 ; Cheam, 1996 ) whereas those on the soil surface or buried deeper than 10 cm are more likely to remain viable in future years thus acting as seed reservoirs in the event of future soil disturbances. Cheam (1996) studied germination patterns from E. australis seeds sown at 1-15 cm and over 4 years, there was 53.9% germination (79% of these within the first year) from seeds buried at 1 cm compared to 23.5% from seeds on the surface and 0% from seeds buried at 15cm. After 4 years, 21.0%, 10.5% and 18.3% of the initial seeds remained viable at 0, 1 and 15 cm depth, respectively. Some E. australis seeds can remain viable in the soil for more than 8 years ( Gilbey, 1996 ).Environmental RequirementsA prerequisite to invading a new habitat is the ability to tolerate the new climatic conditions. Values estimated within the Climate table are derived from long-term climatic averages from sites known to be at the edge of the known distribution range for E. australis in the native range in South Africa ( Schulze, 1986 ) and where introduced in Australia ( Plumb, 1977 ). Models for predicting the potential distribution of both species, based upon both climate and plant development requirements, are given in Pheloung et al. (1996) . For E. australis in Australia, the predicted range is approximately identical to the current range and this the plant is not expected to spread much further. A similar model based on climatic conditions for New Zealand ( Panetta and Mitchell, 1991 ) predicts a range that is considerably larger than the actual range even following over 100 years of opportunity. AssociationsE. australis is a good host of the root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus neglectus, a pest of certain varieties of cereal crops. It can be managed by the

AssociationsE. australis is a good host of the root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus neglectus, a pest of certain varieties of cereal crops. It can be managed by the inclusion of non-host species grown in rotation with the susceptible crops therefore the presence of E. australis in the pasture phase of the rotation will hinder any implemented nematode-management practices ( Vanstone and Russ, 2001 ). There is no known mycorrhiza associated with E. australis ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). In Australia, both within pastures and crops, E. australis it is usually associated with other plant species in the families Compositae (in particular Arctotheca calendula), Cruciferae, Geraniaceae (in particular Erodium spp.), Gramineae, Leguminosae (in particular Trifolium spp.) or Polygonaceae ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ).Seed of E. australis is an important component of the diet for small mammals. In Australia, up to a quarter of the seeds on the soil surface are removed by mice ( Weiss, 1981 ) and in South Africa, a third are removed by gerbils ( Scott, 1990 ). In the northern grain-growing region of south-west Australia, the seeds of E. australis are a major part of the diet of the Major Mitchell and inland red-tailed black cockatoos, but the amount of seed removed is insignificant ( Scott et al. 2000 ) and the seeds are a minor food source for galahs, little and long billed corellas ( Keighery, 1996 ).

Reproductive BiologyE. australis only reproduces by seed, is monoecious and self-compatible ( Gardner, 1930 ). The spiny female flowers are sessile and in axillary clusters which form first on the crown, in the centre of the rosette, but subsequently in leaf axil nodes along the stems. The male flowers form in short axillary racemes, often emerging between the female achenes ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). Stem growth, flower and subsequent seed production is continuous throughout the plant's lifetime. E. australis has a high degree of phenotypic plasticity with the extent of stem and node formation dependent upon environmental conditions and seed production being correlated with this stem and node production. Individuals growing under poor conditions (or in a short growing season) produce only a few seeds <10), but plants are capable of producing over 1100 seeds given favourable conditions ( Weiss, 1978 ). E. australis invests a large proportion of its available resources into reproduction with highly stressed plants devoting 36%, and plants under more favourable conditions devoting 62% of all resources into achene and seed production ( Weiss, 1978 ).

E. australis invests a large proportion of its available resources into reproduction with highly stressed plants devoting 36%, and plants under more favourable conditions devoting 62% of all resources into achene and seed production ( Weiss, 1978 ). Achene weight is variable from <10 mg to >90mg; however, Weiss (1978) found for Australian populations of E. australis the modal achene weight was 40-50 mg at the end of the growing season regardless of the plants' growing conditions. Weiss and Julien (1975) report mean achene lengths (capsule base to the top of the inner lobes of the female perianth) of 8.0 mm and mean widths (between two spine tips) of 9.5 mm. Massive seed banks can occur with up to 10,000 seeds/m² following the first year in pasture within a crop/pasture rotation, but over 17,000 seeds/m² is possible if E. australis plants are specifically protected from interspecific competition, pathogen and insect attack ( Scott et al., 2000 ).The persistence of E. australis and its ability to survive control measures is due to seed dormancy and longevity ( Cheam, 1996 ). All seeds are dormant when freshly formed and require a 2-6 month period of after-ripening before they can germinate ( Hagon and Simmons, 1978 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). Panetta and Randall (1993c) , studying four populations of E. australis in Western Australian, found that if given the correct environmental conditions, most seeds (80-95%) were able to germinate at some stage during the following autumn.

Whilst some seeds within the seed bank remained in this constant non-dormant state, the dormancy pattern in the majority (60-90%) followed the climatic patterns with germination being possible each winter but not possible each summer. A proportion of the seeds (5-20%) remained in a state of constant innate dormancy for the duration of the study (2 years). Seeds that remain in the constant non-dormant state give the species the flexibility to recruit opportunistically after summer rainfall events within the Mediterranean climate ( Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). Seeds that remain in the extended innate-dormant state ensure the continued recruitment of seedlings each year ( Scott, 1990 ).Despite most of the viable E. australis seeds being able to germinate each autumn, the proportion of seeds that actually germinates each season is usually low with only 15% of viable seeds reported germinating by Scott (1990) for E. australis in South Africa and 17% reported by Cheam (1996) , 17.6% by Panetta and Randall (1993b) , and 37% by Weiss (1981) for E. australis in Australia. Cultivation is known to increase germination ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ; Weiss, 1990 ). Another important factor is the ability of the seed to imbibe sufficient water for germination via its encapsulating, large, hard and spiny perianth ( Cheam, 1987 ). As a consequence, unburied seeds have in general a low rate of germination. It would also explain Gilbey and Weiss's (1980) observation of lower emergence rates on sandy soils compared to heavier soils, which would retain higher moisture levels. Within a particular season,

It would also explain Gilbey and Weiss's (1980) observation of lower emergence rates on sandy soils compared to heavier soils, which would retain higher moisture levels. Within a particular season, seeds buried 1-5 cm deep are most likely to become established ( Scott, 1990 ; Cheam, 1996 ) whereas those on the soil surface or buried deeper than 10 cm are more likely to remain viable in future years thus acting as seed reservoirs in the event of future soil disturbances. Cheam (1996) studied germination patterns from E. australis seeds sown at 1-15 cm and over 4 years, there was 53.9% germination (79% of these within the first year) from seeds buried at 1 cm compared to 23.5% from seeds on the surface and 0% from seeds buried at 15cm. After 4 years, 21.0%, 10.5% and 18.3% of the initial seeds remained viable at 0, 1 and 15 cm depth, respectively. Some E. australis seeds can remain viable in the soil for more than 8 years ( Gilbey, 1996 ).Environmental RequirementsA prerequisite to invading a new habitat is the ability to tolerate the new climatic conditions. Values estimated within the Climate table are derived from long-term climatic averages from sites known to be at the edge of the known distribution range for E. australis in the native range in South Africa ( Schulze, 1986 ) and where introduced in Australia ( Plumb, 1977 ).

For E. australis in Australia, the predicted range is approximately identical to the current range and this the plant is not expected to spread much further. A similar model based on climatic conditions for New Zealand ( Panetta and Mitchell, 1991 ) predicts a range that is considerably larger than the actual range even following over 100 years of opportunity. AssociationsE. australis is a good host of the root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus neglectus, a pest of certain varieties of cereal crops. It can be managed by the inclusion of non-host species grown in rotation with the susceptible crops therefore the presence of E. australis in the pasture phase of the rotation will hinder any implemented nematode-management practices ( Vanstone and Russ, 2001 ). There is no known mycorrhiza associated with E. australis ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). In Australia, both within pastures and crops, E. australis it is usually associated with other plant species in the families Compositae (in particular Arctotheca calendula), Cruciferae, Geraniaceae (in particular Erodium spp.), Gramineae, Leguminosae (in particular Trifolium spp.) or Polygonaceae ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ).Seed of E. australis is an important component of the diet for small mammals. In Australia, up to a quarter of the seeds on the soil surface are removed by mice ( Weiss, 1981 ) and in South Africa, a third are removed by gerbils ( Scott, 1990 ).

In the northern grain-growing region of south-west Australia, the seeds of E. australis are a major part of the diet of the Major Mitchell and inland red-tailed black cockatoos, but the amount of seed removed is insignificant ( Scott et al. 2000 ) and the seeds are a minor food source for galahs, little and long billed corellas ( Keighery, 1996 ).

 Invasion: E. australis is an annual that can only reproduce by seed (Gilbey and Weiss, 1980). Cotyledons are hairless and shaped like an elongated club with a round apex. The first leaves produced are hairless and oval with an obtuse apex. All subsequent leaves are more triangular with an indented, heart-shaped base (Wilding et al., 1993). The plant develops a long and thick taproot. The adult plant is prostrate or ascending with round, ribbed stems that radiate from the crown in all directions and that branch dichotomously at nodes. On the stems, at the base of the petioles, are brown membranous ochreae (circa 5 mm long). The basal leaves are usually the longest leaves on the plant (up to 15 cm) and have similarly long petioles. Moving along the stem and away from the crown, the leaves become smaller (down to 3 cm) with shorter petioles. The small (circa 2 mm), inconspicuous green flowers have separate sexes but are self-compatible and from these a hard wooden achene (fruit) with three spines (=modified lobes of the perianth) develops (Gardner, 1930). Achenes are dimorphic. Those attached to the lower sections of the crown of the plant (subterranean) differ from those attached elsewhere, including the upper sections of the crown (aerial), in that they are flattened with a bilateral rather than radial symmetry and they have proportionally shorter spines. Achenes are originally green (aerial) or white with yellow and red (subterranean) but turn brown as they ripen. The ripe

 of the crown of the plant (subterranean) differ from those attached elsewhere, including the upper sections of the crown (aerial), in that they are flattened with a bilateral rather than radial symmetry and they have proportionally shorter spines. Achenes are originally green (aerial) or white with yellow and red (subterranean) but turn brown as they ripen. The ripe subterranean achenes tend to remain attached to the mother plant's crown even after the plant has senesced and in subsequent years are likely to germinate near its parental plant's location (Gilbey and Weiss, 1980). The ripe aerial achenes readily detach from the parental plant and are triangular in cross section with their spines arranged so that one spine always points upwards, thereby increasing their chance of dispersal via a passing animal or even vehicles. Typically, only the aerial achenes are noticed as they are far more numerous, are on the soil's surface and have the strong, sharp, impaling spines. A similar achene dimorphism occurs in E. spinosa (Evenari et al., 1977;Weiss, 1980).The achenes contain a single, trigonous seed, produced firstly in the rosette and then sequentially in leaf axils along the stems. The plant has indeterminate growth, with stem and seed production continuing as long as the season is favourable. They ripen in approximately the same order as conception so that green achenes are still developing near the growing apices of the stem whilst ripe achenes have been shed from the stem near the crown. Due to the continuous growing nature of the plant, the size of aerial achenes vary greatly even within a single plant, but achenes are commonly >10 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip). In E. australis the subterranean achenes rarely exceed 8 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip).Weiss and

 have been shed from the stem near the crown. Due to the continuous growing nature of the plant, the size of aerial achenes vary greatly even within a single plant, but achenes are commonly >10 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip). In E. australis the subterranean achenes rarely exceed 8 mm wide (spine tip to spine tip).Weiss and Simmons (1979)collected seed (achenes) from E. australis populations in its native South Africa as well as from Australia and Hawaii where it is an exotic. Two generations of plant were then grown from these seeds planted simultaneously and within the same glasshouse, so as to remove the effects of environmental variations. They found little difference between the Australian and South African populations of E. australis, but second-generation plants from the Hawaii population had fewer stems, nodes and leaves and produced 40% less seeds than the others.Scott (1990)studied the biology and population dynamics of E. australis growing in South Africa and compared this to similar data collected byWeiss (1981)for E. australis grown in Australia. Seed banks, seedling densities, survivorship data and achene production were all found to be similar.

 Reproduccion: GeneticsThe chromosome number of E. australis (based upon Australian populations) is 2n=20 ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ) and is the same as both Australian and Portuguese populations of E. spinosa ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ; Queiros, 1983 ). In Australia, where both species co-exist, the plants readily hybridise. Both species are monoecious with flowers of both sexes forming near the apex of the stems as the plant grows. Due to the more erect morphology of E. spinosa and as pollen is more likely to fall down than go upwards, seeds collected from E. australis plants were commonly outcrossed with E. spinosa but seeds collected from E. spinosa plants were only rarely outcrossed with E. australis ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ). Putievsky et al. (1980) found the hybrids grew more vigorously than either parent, but were completely sterile when self-pollinated. They were, however, able to backcross with the parental species giving the possibility of gene flow between the species. There is very little genetic variability within E. australis ( Weiss and Simmons, 1979 ; Panetta, 1990a ). Panetta (1990a) states "E. australis provides an example of a sexually reproducing species whose patterns of within and between population variation are generally similar in both source and colonial regions. Indeed, 16 of the 21 surveyed South African populations could not be distinguished from Australian populations."Physiology and PhenologyIn areas with a Mediterranean climate, the emergence of E. australis usually begins in autumn after sufficient rain or in years with earlier rainfall, multiple waves of germination are often observed, each associated with significant rainfall events.

iology and PhenologyIn areas with a Mediterranean climate, the emergence of E. australis usually begins in autumn after sufficient rain or in years with earlier rainfall, multiple waves of germination are often observed, each associated with significant rainfall events. Weiss (1981) found that up to six distinct cohorts may sometimes occur within a single year and attributed these to the earlier rains arriving before the majority of viable seed had completed their required period of innate dormancy. Although mid-season accessions may contain the most individuals, it was the first accessions of each year that contributed the most to seed production. Flowers could be produced within 4 weeks of germination and seeds within 6 weeks; however, this was highly variable and in some years it took 18 weeks before flowers were even produced. Seeds are produced continuously at the growing apex of the stems throughout the growing season. Regardless of when they germinate, all Emex plants die at the end of the winter rains when soil moisture disappears ( Weiss, 1981 ). The longevity of the growing season can vary immensely from site to site and from year to year with 20-32 weeks after the first accession, reported in Weiss (1981) . Within a Mediterranean climatic region, irrigation during the summer will permit some E. australis seeds to germinate and these can successfully complete development ( Panetta, 1990b ) but germination rates are lower than normal due to a proportion of the seed being dormant. Seedling densities can be over 900 plants/m² ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ), though more commonly 20-500 plants/m² in areas where E. australis is a problem ( Gilbey and Lightfoot, 1979 ; Weiss, 1981 ; Scott, 1990 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993b ; Scott and Shivas, 1998; Yeoh et al., 2002 ). At seedling densities of approximately 200 plants/m², survival from emergence to seed production is 40-50% in both Australia and

m² in areas where E. australis is a problem ( Gilbey and Lightfoot, 1979 ; Weiss, 1981 ; Scott, 1990 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993b ; Scott and Shivas, 1998; Yeoh et al., 2002 ). At seedling densities of approximately 200 plants/m², survival from emergence to seed production is 40-50% in both Australia and South Africa ( Scott, 1990 ).In sub-tropical climates (e.g. KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, South Africa), E. australis can grow all year round, germinating at any time but remaining an annual ( Scott and Way, 1990 ). E. australis has three distinct phases of growth rate ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). Under glasshouse conditions, for the first 8 weeks after emergence, growth rates are rapid and most energy is diverted towards foliage production. At 8-15 weeks there is a slight decrease in growth with foliage production decreasing but with more stem elongation, branching and buds, flower and fruit formation and a corresponding increase in root biomass. From 15 weeks senescence occurs and whilst during this phase there is no net increase in plant weight, resources from the leaves, stems and roots are reabsorbed and translocated to the developing achene. Embryo development begins in the seed 3 weeks after flowering and seeds are mature 6 weeks after flowering. Gilbey and Weiss (1980) report the average weight of achenes as being 20 mg, 50 mg and 60 mg at 3, 6 and 8 weeks respectively after flowering. The weight of the achene remained stable after it was 8 weeks old. Weiss and Simmons (1977) found that the optimum temperature for production of seed, stems and leaves was 11.7°C and for roots 16.7°C. A delayed flowering and necrosis of stems was shown at the lowest (6.7°C) and highest (26.7

 weeks respectively after flowering. The weight of the achene remained stable after it was 8 weeks old. Weiss and Simmons (1977) found that the optimum temperature for production of seed, stems and leaves was 11.7°C and for roots 16.7°C. A delayed flowering and necrosis of stems was shown at the lowest (6.7°C) and highest (26.7°C) temperatures tested. Above 16.7°C, there were only a few fertile seeds produced with no seeds fully maturing within 15 weeks at 26.7°C. A very strong positive correlation exists between temperature and rate of development until the temperature reaches approximately 19°C, becoming a negative correlation above this.Within an annual pasture system of a Mediterranean climatic region, early cohorts of E. australis seedlings can result in response to significant summer rainfall events. This is due to the ability for some E. australis seed to germinate in response to moisture, relatively independently of temperature requirements (Weiss and Simmons, 1977; Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). In Australia, these result from events such as cyclonic activity which happens reasonably frequently within northern New South Wales and northern Western Australia. Out of season rainfall events are locally referred to as a "false break". Follow up rains may not occur until several months latter when the true autumn/winter rains begin. The long tap root of E. australis seedlings allows them to survive the long dry period following a false break far better than most other annual species and in years where significant E. australis individuals survive a false break they can dominate the pastures and produce massive seed banks if left uncontrolled ( Gilbey, 1974a ; Weiss, 1981 ). This can lead to dramatic increases in infestations of E. australis in the following year ( Lemerle, 1996 ).

 similar model based on climatic conditions for New Zealand ( Panetta and Mitchell, 1991 ) predicts a range that is considerably larger than the actual range even following over 100 years of opportunity. AssociationsE. australis is a good host of the root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus neglectus, a pest of certain varieties of cereal crops. It can be managed by the inclusion of non-host species grown in rotation with the susceptible crops therefore the presence of E. australis in the pasture phase of the rotation will hinder any implemented nematode-management practices ( Vanstone and Russ, 2001 ). There is no known mycorrhiza associated with E. australis ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). In Australia, both within pastures and crops, E. australis it is usually associated with other plant species in the families Compositae (in particular Arctotheca calendula), Cruciferae, Geraniaceae (in particular Erodium spp.), Gramineae, Leguminosae (in particular Trifolium spp.) or Polygonaceae ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ).Seed of E. australis is an important component of the diet for small mammals. In Australia, up to a quarter of the seeds on the soil surface are removed by mice ( Weiss, 1981 ) and in South Africa, a third are removed by gerbils ( Scott, 1990 ). In the northern grain-growing region of south-west Australia, the seeds of E. australis are a major part of the diet of the Major Mitchell and inland red-tailed black cockatoos, but the amount of seed removed is insignificant ( Scott et al. 2000 ) and the seeds are a minor food source for galahs, little and long billed corellas ( Keighery, 1996 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology GeneticsThe chromosome number of E. australis (based upon Australian populations) is 2n=20 ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ) and is the same as both Australian and Portuguese populations of E. spinosa ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ; Queiros, 1983 ). In Australia, where both species co-exist, the plants readily hybridise. Both species are monoecious with flowers of both sexes forming near the apex of the stems as the plant grows. Due to the more erect morphology of E. spinosa and as pollen is more likely to fall down than go upwards, seeds collected from E. australis plants were commonly outcrossed with E. spinosa but seeds collected from E. spinosa plants were only rarely outcrossed with E. australis ( Putievsky et al., 1980 ). Putievsky et al. (1980) found the hybrids grew more vigorously than either parent, but were completely sterile when self-pollinated. They were, however, able to backcross with the parental species giving the possibility of gene flow between the species. There is very little genetic variability within E. australis ( Weiss and Simmons, 1979 ; Panetta, 1990a ). Panetta (1990a) states "E. australis provides an example of a sexually reproducing species whose patterns of within and between population variation are generally similar in both source and colonial regions.

Panetta (1990a) states "E. australis provides an example of a sexually reproducing species whose patterns of within and between population variation are generally similar in both source and colonial regions. Indeed, 16 of the 21 surveyed South African populations could not be distinguished from Australian populations."Physiology and PhenologyIn areas with a Mediterranean climate, the emergence of E. australis usually begins in autumn after sufficient rain or in years with earlier rainfall, multiple waves of germination are often observed, each associated with significant rainfall events. Weiss (1981) found that up to six distinct cohorts may sometimes occur within a single year and attributed these to the earlier rains arriving before the majority of viable seed had completed their required period of innate dormancy. Although mid-season accessions may contain the most individuals, it was the first accessions of each year that contributed the most to seed production. Flowers could be produced within 4 weeks of germination and seeds within 6 weeks; however, this was highly variable and in some years it took 18 weeks before flowers were even produced. Seeds are produced continuously at the growing apex of the stems throughout the growing season. Regardless of when they germinate, all Emex plants die at the end of the winter rains when soil moisture disappears ( Weiss, 1981 ). The longevity of the growing season can vary immensely from site to site and from year to year with 20-32 weeks after the first accession, reported in Weiss (1981) . Within a Mediterranean climatic region, irrigation during the summer will permit some E. australis seeds to germinate and these can successfully complete development ( Panetta, 1990b ) but germination rates are lower than normal due to a proportion of the seed being dormant. Seedling densities can be over 900 plants/m² ( Gilbey and

ion, reported in Weiss (1981) . Within a Mediterranean climatic region, irrigation during the summer will permit some E. australis seeds to germinate and these can successfully complete development ( Panetta, 1990b ) but germination rates are lower than normal due to a proportion of the seed being dormant. Seedling densities can be over 900 plants/m² ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ), though more commonly 20-500 plants/m² in areas where E. australis is a problem ( Gilbey and Lightfoot, 1979 ; Weiss, 1981 ; Scott, 1990 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993b ; Scott and Shivas, 1998; Yeoh et al., 2002 ). At seedling densities of approximately 200 plants/m², survival from emergence to seed production is 40-50% in both Australia and South Africa ( Scott, 1990 ).In sub-tropical climates (e.g. KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, South Africa), E. australis can grow all year round, germinating at any time but remaining an annual ( Scott and Way, 1990 ). E. australis has three distinct phases of growth rate ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). Under glasshouse conditions, for the first 8 weeks after emergence, growth rates are rapid and most energy is diverted towards foliage production. At 8-15 weeks there is a slight decrease in growth with foliage production decreasing but with more stem elongation, branching and buds, flower and fruit formation and a corresponding increase in root biomass. From 15 weeks senescence occurs and whilst during this phase there is no net increase in plant weight, resources from the leaves, stems and roots are reabsorbed and translocated to the developing achene. Embryo development begins in the seed 3 weeks after flowering and seeds are mature 6 weeks after flowering. Gilbey and Weiss (1980) report the average weight of achenes as being 20 mg

 weeks senescence occurs and whilst during this phase there is no net increase in plant weight, resources from the leaves, stems and roots are reabsorbed and translocated to the developing achene. Embryo development begins in the seed 3 weeks after flowering and seeds are mature 6 weeks after flowering. Gilbey and Weiss (1980) report the average weight of achenes as being 20 mg, 50 mg and 60 mg at 3, 6 and 8 weeks respectively after flowering. The weight of the achene remained stable after it was 8 weeks old. Weiss and Simmons (1977) found that the optimum temperature for production of seed, stems and leaves was 11.7°C and for roots 16.7°C. A delayed flowering and necrosis of stems was shown at the lowest (6.7°C) and highest (26.7°C) temperatures tested. Above 16.7°C, there were only a few fertile seeds produced with no seeds fully maturing within 15 weeks at 26.7°C. A very strong positive correlation exists between temperature and rate of development until the temperature reaches approximately 19°C, becoming a negative correlation above this.Within an annual pasture system of a Mediterranean climatic region, early cohorts of E. australis seedlings can result in response to significant summer rainfall events. This is due to the ability for some E. australis seed to germinate in response to moisture, relatively independently of temperature requirements (Weiss and Simmons, 1977; Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). In Australia, these result from events such as cyclonic activity which happens reasonably frequently within northern New South Wales and northern Western Australia. Out of season rainfall events are locally referred to as a "false break". Follow up rains may not occur until several months latter when the true autumn/winter rains begin. The long tap root of E. australis seedlings allows them to survive the long dry period following a false break far better than most

 as cyclonic activity which happens reasonably frequently within northern New South Wales and northern Western Australia. Out of season rainfall events are locally referred to as a "false break". Follow up rains may not occur until several months latter when the true autumn/winter rains begin. The long tap root of E. australis seedlings allows them to survive the long dry period following a false break far better than most other annual species and in years where significant E. australis individuals survive a false break they can dominate the pastures and produce massive seed banks if left uncontrolled ( Gilbey, 1974a ; Weiss, 1981 ). This can lead to dramatic increases in infestations of E. australis in the following year ( Lemerle, 1996 ). Reproductive BiologyE. australis only reproduces by seed, is monoecious and self-compatible ( Gardner, 1930 ). The spiny female flowers are sessile and in axillary clusters which form first on the crown, in the centre of the rosette, but subsequently in leaf axil nodes along the stems. The male flowers form in short axillary racemes, often emerging between the female achenes ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ). Stem growth, flower and subsequent seed production is continuous throughout the plant's lifetime. E. australis has a high degree of phenotypic plasticity with the extent of stem and node formation dependent upon environmental conditions and seed production being correlated with this stem and node production. Individuals growing under poor conditions (or in a short growing season) produce only a few seeds <10), but plants are capable of producing over 1100 seeds given favourable conditions ( Weiss, 1978 ). E. australis invests a large proportion of its available resources into reproduction with highly stressed plants devoting 36%, and plants under more favourable conditions devoting 62% of all resources into achene and seed production ( Weiss, 1978 ). Achene weight is variable from <10 mg to >90

 <10), but plants are capable of producing over 1100 seeds given favourable conditions ( Weiss, 1978 ). E. australis invests a large proportion of its available resources into reproduction with highly stressed plants devoting 36%, and plants under more favourable conditions devoting 62% of all resources into achene and seed production ( Weiss, 1978 ). Achene weight is variable from <10 mg to >90mg; however, Weiss (1978) found for Australian populations of E. australis the modal achene weight was 40-50 mg at the end of the growing season regardless of the plants' growing conditions. Weiss and Julien (1975) report mean achene lengths (capsule base to the top of the inner lobes of the female perianth) of 8.0 mm and mean widths (between two spine tips) of 9.5 mm. Massive seed banks can occur with up to 10,000 seeds/m² following the first year in pasture within a crop/pasture rotation, but over 17,000 seeds/m² is possible if E. australis plants are specifically protected from interspecific competition, pathogen and insect attack ( Scott et al., 2000 ).The persistence of E. australis and its ability to survive control measures is due to seed dormancy and longevity ( Cheam, 1996 ). All seeds are dormant when freshly formed and require a 2-6 month period of after-ripening before they can germinate ( Hagon and Simmons, 1978 ; Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). Panetta and Randall (1993c) , studying four populations of E. australis in Western Australian, found that if given the correct environmental conditions, most seeds (80-95%) were able to germinate at some stage during the following autumn. Whilst some seeds within the seed bank remained in this constant non-dormant state, the dormancy pattern in the majority (60-90%) followed the climatic

c) , studying four populations of E. australis in Western Australian, found that if given the correct environmental conditions, most seeds (80-95%) were able to germinate at some stage during the following autumn. Whilst some seeds within the seed bank remained in this constant non-dormant state, the dormancy pattern in the majority (60-90%) followed the climatic patterns with germination being possible each winter but not possible each summer. A proportion of the seeds (5-20%) remained in a state of constant innate dormancy for the duration of the study (2 years). Seeds that remain in the constant non-dormant state give the species the flexibility to recruit opportunistically after summer rainfall events within the Mediterranean climate ( Panetta and Randall, 1993c ). Seeds that remain in the extended innate-dormant state ensure the continued recruitment of seedlings each year ( Scott, 1990 ).Despite most of the viable E. australis seeds being able to germinate each autumn, the proportion of seeds that actually germinates each season is usually low with only 15% of viable seeds reported germinating by Scott (1990) for E. australis in South Africa and 17% reported by Cheam (1996) , 17.6% by Panetta and Randall (1993b) , and 37% by Weiss (1981) for E. australis in Australia. Cultivation is known to increase germination ( Gilbey and Weiss, 1980 ; Weiss, 1990 ). Another important factor is the ability of the seed to imbibe sufficient water for germination via its encapsulating, large, hard and spiny perianth ( Cheam, 1987 ). As a consequence, unburied seeds have in general a low rate of germination. It would also explain Gilbey and Weiss's (1980) observation of lower emergence rates on sandy soils compared to heavier soils, which would retain higher moisture levels. Within a particular season,

 sufficient water for germination via its encapsulating, large, hard and spiny perianth ( Cheam, 1987 ). As a consequence, unburied seeds have in general a low rate of germination. It would also explain Gilbey and Weiss's (1980) observation of lower emergence rates on sandy soils compared to heavier soils, which would retain higher moisture levels. Within a particular season, seeds buried 1-5 cm deep are most likely to become established ( Scott, 1990 ; Cheam, 1996 ) whereas those on the soil surface or buried deeper than 10 cm are more likely to remain viable in future years thus acting as seed reservoirs in the event of future soil disturbances. Cheam (1996) studied germination patterns from E. australis seeds sown at 1-15 cm and over 4 years, there was 53.9% germination (79% of these within the first year) from seeds buried at 1 cm compared to 23.5% from seeds on the surface and 0% from seeds buried at 15cm. After 4 years, 21.0%, 10.5% and 18.3% of the initial seeds remained viable at 0, 1 and 15 cm depth, respectively. Some E. australis seeds can remain viable in the soil for more than 8 years ( Gilbey, 1996 ).Environmental RequirementsA prerequisite to invading a new habitat is the ability to tolerate the new climatic conditions. Values estimated within the Climate table are derived from long-term climatic averages from sites known to be at the edge of the known distribution range for E. australis in the native range in South Africa ( Schulze, 1986 ) and where introduced in Australia ( Plumb, 1977 ). Models for predicting the potential distribution of both species, based upon both climate and plant development requirements, are given in Pheloung et al. (1996) . For E. australis in Australia, the predicted range is approximately identical to the current range and

For E. australis in Australia, the predicted range is approximately identical to the current range and this the plant is not expected to spread much further. A similar model based on climatic conditions for New Zealand ( Panetta and Mitchell, 1991 ) predicts a range that is considerably larger than the actual range even following over 100 years of opportunity.
