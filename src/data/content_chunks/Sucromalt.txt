To Live the Sweet 
Life, Live with 
Sucromalt 
ARS may have a pretty sweet deal for diabetics 
and others looking to curb their sugar intake. ARS 
scientists at the National Center for Agricultural 
Utilization Research in Peoria, IL, partnered 
with private industry to develop a sweetener 
called Sucromalt. Sucromalt, also called 
“Xtend™,” offers consumers health benefits 
such as its slow and complete digestibility, as 
well as its ability to release carbohydrates into the 
bloodstream slowly.
As a low-glycemic-index ingredient, Sucromalt 
is only 70 percent as sweet as sugar  and 
provides comparatively stable blood sugar levels 
after consumption. In contrast, high-glycemic 
foods and traditional sugars cause rapid spikes 
and falls in blood sugar levels that are dangerous 
– or even fatal – for people suffering from diabetes.  
Consumers may currently find Sucromalt-
sweetened products in beloved foods like ice
cream, jam, cereal, and shakes. Because of 
Sucromalt’s unique properties, diabetics and 
people watching their blood sugar levels can 
now enjoy 
their favorite 
desserts and 
sweet foods 
once again.
