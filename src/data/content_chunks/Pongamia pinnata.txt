 Reproduccion: The chromosome numbers reported for P. pinnata are 2 n = 20, 22 ( Bairiganjan and Patnaik, 1989 ; Oyen, 1997 ; Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2020 ). Pongamia pinnata reproduces by seed and can also be propagated vegetatively from root suckers and branch cuttings ( Daniel, 1997 ; Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). This species produces nectariferous flowers with copious amounts of pollen with additional secretions of nectar droplets on wing and keel petals. It has an explosive pollination mechanism adapted for tripping by certain nectar-seeking bees [Apidae]. Floral visitors include bees, wasps and thrips. Some bees such as Apis dorsata , A. cerana indica , Amegilla sp., Megachile sp., Xylocopa latipes , X. pubescens and wasps collect only nectar, while all other bees and thrips collect pollen and nectar. Among bees, Apis spp . and Amegilla sp . are the more common species involved in pollination. P. pinnata is an important bee-forage tree species during the summer season.

 bees, Apis spp . and Amegilla sp . are the more common species involved in pollination. P. pinnata is an important bee-forage tree species during the summer season. It is able to produce viable, self-pollinated seeds, as has been observed in Hawaii. The flowers stay open only on the day of anthesis and remain closed for the other two successive days of flower-life. Unpollinated flowers fall off, while pollinated ones develop into fruits ( Raju and Rao, 2006 ). Further details on the pollination and reproductive biology of P. pinnata are available from Kukade and Tidke (2013) and Veereshkumar et al. (2021) . In India, leaf flushing in P. pinnata occurs in April with new leaves  developing from May onwards. Flowering takes place during April to June pods ripen during March to May of the following year; seeds ripen from February to May ( Sangwan et al., 2010 ). A few individuals extend flowering into June. A few trees have been reported to flower during the second season in October-November ( Raju and Rao, 2006 ). The seeding season is April to June ( Daniel, 1997 ). In India, flowers appear in April to June and seeds ripen during February to May of the following year ( Sangwan et al. 2010 ); in China a shorter period has been observed for seed maturation, with flowers emerging in April to May and seeds ripening during October to December ( Huang et al., 2018 ). Seedlings reach a height of 60 cm about 1.5 years after sowing. Pod production starts 4-7 years after sowing ( Mukta and Sreevalli, 2010 ; Murphy et al., 2012 ; Csurhes and Hankamer, 2016 ). Flowering occurs in late spring and summer (May onwards) in the USA ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). In some parts of the world

Flowering occurs in late spring and summer (May onwards) in the USA ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). In some parts of the world, flowers may appear throughout the year. Anthesis is acropetal in the raceme, with 40-50 floral buds that take 13-16 days to bloom. Flowers open for a day and remain closed for two successive days. Pollination is mediated by wasps and bees. Pollinated flowers develop into fruits. Flowering to pod maturity takes 10-11 months ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). P. pinnata, in Australia (Queensland), is recognized by its seasonal leaf loss somewhere between August and November (rarely December, January and May); the flush of new red leaves is followed by flowering (February-September). Full-sized fruit are present most of the year; fruit ripens almost 12 months after flowering. The indehiscent fruit walls rot quickly in wet conditions, allowing for germination ( Cooper et al., 2019 ). In Mesoamerica, flowering and fructification occur in June ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2020 ). In South Asia, flowering takes place from May to June and fructification from August to October ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2020 ). Individual trees yield 9-90 kg of pods annually with mature trees yielding 8-24 kg seed annually ( Oyen, 1997 ). There are 1500-1700 seeds per kg ( Daniel, 1997 ) and annual seed yields range from 36 t/ha ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). The growth of young trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 m in height and 0.4 cm in diameter in 13 months has

The growth of young trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 m in height and 0.4 cm in diameter in 13 months has been recorded ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). The lateral spread of the roots of this species is about 9 m in 18 years ( Misra and Singh, 1987 ). The root nodule microsymbionts in P. pinnata in southern India have been identified as belonging to Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium ( Rasul et al., 2012 ). Trees in cultivation start production of seeds in 4 or 5 years ( Duke, 1983 ), while wild trees take 10 years ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). It is recommended that 10- and 15-year-old trees be harvested for poles and wood ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). P. pinnata produces seeds containing 30-40% oil ( Daniel, 1997 ). With a life span of 85 to 100 years, P. pinnata produces sustainable yields until 50 years of age ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). Pongamia pinnata is associated with evergreen, riparian and monsoon forests ( Cooper et al., 2019 ). Pongamia pinnata is native to humid and subtropical environments. Its altitudinal range is from 0-1200 m, but in the Himalayan foothills, it is not found above 600 m ( Daniel, 1997 ). In Mesoamerica, the range is from 200 to 220 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2020 ).

In Mesoamerica, the range is from 200 to 220 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2020 ). In its natural range, P. pinnata tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees withstand light frost and tolerate temperatures over 50°C. The reported temperature range for growth is 10-50°C, with the optimum between 16 and 38°C. Annual rainfall required is 500-2500 mm, with a dry season of 2-6 months. It is shade-tolerant and grows under the tree canopy and can grow well even with full light. It can tolerate a wide range of soil types but performs best in deep, well-drained, sandy loams with adequate moisture. This species will also grow on sandy soils and heavy, swelling clay soils. It is very tolerant of saline conditions and alkalinity. The reported soil pH range for growth is 6-9, with the optimum being 6.5-8.5 ( Oyen, 1997 ; Orwa et al., 2009 ).

ctive Biology Pongamia pinnata reproduces by seed and can also be propagated vegetatively from root suckers and branch cuttings ( Daniel, 1997 ; Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). This species produces nectariferous flowers with copious amounts of pollen with additional secretions of nectar droplets on wing and keel petals. It has an explosive pollination mechanism adapted for tripping by certain nectar-seeking bees [Apidae]. Floral visitors include bees, wasps and thrips. Some bees such as Apis dorsata , A. cerana indica , Amegilla sp., Megachile sp., Xylocopa latipes , X. pubescens and wasps collect only nectar, while all other bees and thrips collect pollen and nectar. Among bees, Apis spp . and Amegilla sp . are the more common species involved in pollination. P. pinnata is an important bee-forage tree species during the summer season. It is able to produce viable, self-pollinated seeds, as has been observed in Hawaii. The flowers stay open only on the day of anthesis and remain closed for the other two successive days of flower-life. Unpollinated flowers fall off, while pollinated ones develop into fruits ( Raju and Rao, 2006 ). Further details on the pollination and reproductive biology of P. pinnata are available from Kukade and Tidke (2013) and Veereshkumar et al. (2021) . Physiology and Phenology In India, leaf flushing in P. pinnata occurs in April with new leaves  developing from May onwards. Flowering takes place during April to June pods ripen during March to May of the following year; seeds ripen from February to May ( Sangwan et al., 2010 ).

Flowering takes place during April to June pods ripen during March to May of the following year; seeds ripen from February to May ( Sangwan et al., 2010 ). A few individuals extend flowering into June. A few trees have been reported to flower during the second season in October-November ( Raju and Rao, 2006 ). The seeding season is April to June ( Daniel, 1997 ). In India, flowers appear in April to June and seeds ripen during February to May of the following year ( Sangwan et al. 2010 ); in China a shorter period has been observed for seed maturation, with flowers emerging in April to May and seeds ripening during October to December ( Huang et al., 2018 ). Seedlings reach a height of 60 cm about 1.5 years after sowing. Pod production starts 4-7 years after sowing ( Mukta and Sreevalli, 2010 ; Murphy et al., 2012 ; Csurhes and Hankamer, 2016 ). Flowering occurs in late spring and summer (May onwards) in the USA ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). In some parts of the world, flowers may appear throughout the year. Anthesis is acropetal in the raceme, with 40-50 floral buds that take 13-16 days to bloom. Flowers open for a day and remain closed for two successive days. Pollination is mediated by wasps and bees. Pollinated flowers develop into fruits. Flowering to pod maturity takes 10-11 months ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). P. pinnata, in Australia (Queensland), is recognized by its seasonal leaf loss somewhere between August and November (rarely December, January and May); the flush of new red leaves is followed by flowering (February-September).

 into fruits. Flowering to pod maturity takes 10-11 months ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). P. pinnata, in Australia (Queensland), is recognized by its seasonal leaf loss somewhere between August and November (rarely December, January and May); the flush of new red leaves is followed by flowering (February-September). Full-sized fruit are present most of the year; fruit ripens almost 12 months after flowering. The indehiscent fruit walls rot quickly in wet conditions, allowing for germination ( Cooper et al., 2019 ). In Mesoamerica, flowering and fructification occur in June ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2020 ). In South Asia, flowering takes place from May to June and fructification from August to October ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2020 ). Individual trees yield 9-90 kg of pods annually with mature trees yielding 8-24 kg seed annually ( Oyen, 1997 ). There are 1500-1700 seeds per kg ( Daniel, 1997 ) and annual seed yields range from 36 t/ha ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). The growth of young trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 m in height and 0.4 cm in diameter in 13 months has been recorded ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). The lateral spread of the roots of this species is about 9 m in 18 years ( Misra and Singh, 1987 ). The root nodule microsymbionts in P. pinnata in southern India have been identified as belonging to Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium ( Rasul et al., 2012 ). Trees in cultivation start production of seeds in 4 or 5 years ( Duke, 1983 ), while wild trees take 10 years ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). It is recommended that 10- and 15-year-old trees be harvested for poles and wood ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamas

It is recommended that 10- and 15-year-old trees be harvested for poles and wood ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). P. pinnata produces seeds containing 30-40% oil ( Daniel, 1997 ). Longevity With a life span of 85 to 100 years, P. pinnata produces sustainable yields until 50 years of age ( Rajeswara Rao and Syamasundar, 2012 ). Associations Pongamia pinnata is associated with evergreen, riparian and monsoon forests ( Cooper et al., 2019 ). Environmental Requirements Pongamia pinnata is native to humid and subtropical environments. Its altitudinal range is from 0-1200 m, but in the Himalayan foothills, it is not found above 600 m ( Daniel, 1997 ). In Mesoamerica, the range is from 200 to 220 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2020 ). In its natural range, P. pinnata tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees withstand light frost and tolerate temperatures over 50°C. The reported temperature range for growth is 10-50°C, with the optimum between 16 and 38°C. Annual rainfall required is 500-2500 mm, with a dry season of 2-6 months. It is shade-tolerant and grows under the tree canopy and can grow well even with full light. It can tolerate a wide range of soil types but performs best in deep, well-drained, sandy loams with adequate moisture. This species will also grow on sandy soils and heavy, swelling clay soils. It is very tolerant of saline conditions and alkalinity. The reported soil pH range for growth is 6-
