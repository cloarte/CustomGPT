Terms and Definitions

Designation of Herds as “Quarantined”
• Affected herds are considered “quarantined” due to a formal quarantine 
order of the entire herd or informal hold order for subgroups of exposed 
animals.
• Herds under quarantine due to tracing investigations are generally 
excluded from this report due to the temporary nature of their restrictions.
• Quarantined herds are removed from this report once the quarantine or 
hold order is removed, typically after verification testing.
TB Test-and-Removal Protocol – VS Memo 552.47
• Consist of 3 stages:
1) Removal Testing
2) Verification Testing
3) Assurance Testing 
• To release a herd from quarantine:
• Two consecutive removal tests must be completed without evidence of M.bovis 
infection. 
• 2nd removal test must achieve a 95% or greater confidence level the herd is TB-free.
• Verification test must be conducted and achieve a confidence level of 95% or greater 
that the herd is TB-free.
Methods of Detection of TB-Affected Herds
• Area surveillance: Surveillance in a defined area such as counties in or 
bordering the modified accredited zone in Michigan.
• Assurance test: Herds identified during the assurance testing phase of a 
test and remove herd plan.
• Epi investigation: Herds identified as part of epidemiologic investigations

• Assurance test: Herds identified during the assurance testing phase of a 
test and remove herd plan.
• Epi investigation: Herds identified as part of epidemiologic investigations 
associated with TB-affected animals or TB-affected herds.
• Movement test: Herds identified through testing of animals for routine 
movements, e.g., export and interstate commerce.
• Slaughter trace: Herds identified as the source of animals with suspicious 
lesions during routine slaughter surveillance. Also called “6-35 traces”
Definitions and Acronyms
• 6-35 Trace: Tracing of the source of a suspected or confirmed case of TB 
that was identified during slaughter surveillance and reported on a VS 6-35 
form; known otherwise as a “slaughter trace.” 
• DSA: Designated Surveillance Area
• IFG: Interferon gamma
• M. bovis: Mycobacterium bovis, known as bovine or zoonotic tuberculosis
• NGL: No gross lesions on postmortem examination
• NVSL: National Veterinary Services Laboratories
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction; A molecular biology method of assessing 
for presence of segments of generic material, i.e., DNA and RNA
• WGS: Whole Genome Sequencing of TB bacterial DNA; used to assess 
relatedness among TB bacterial strains
Definitions and Acronyms
• WHT: Whole herd test
• Q Released: Quarantine released
