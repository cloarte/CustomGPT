Bluebunch wheatgrass is a drought-resistant bunchgrass native to the dryareas of the western states. It is a dominant species in the Pacific Northwestand Intermountain States. Both taxa are very similar, except the beardlesslacks the awns, making the plants more palatable in late stages of growth.Plant growth is vigorous, starting early in spring. Plants may reach a heightof 4 feet. Leaves are up to 10 inches long and 0.5 inch wide, flat and tendingto droop. Leaves remain green throughout the summer and are palatable even whendry. Propagation is by seed.
