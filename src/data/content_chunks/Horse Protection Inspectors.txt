Horse Protection Inspectors 
In May 2024, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) published new Horse 
Protection regulations that eliminate 
the role of Designated Qualified Persons. 
The new regulations also relieve Horse 
Industry Organizations of their regulatory 
responsibilities. Effective February 1, 2025, 
only Veterinary Medical Officers from USDA’s 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) and Horse Protection Inspectors 
(HPIs) may conduct inspections. Once 
trained and authorized by APHIS, HPIs will 
function as third-party inspectors who 
event managers may appoint to conduct 
inspections at their events.  
Working as an HPI
Although HPIs are trained and authorized by 
APHIS to conduct inspections, they are not 
APHIS employees. Once an HPI candidate 
successfully completes training, APHIS will 
issue a certificate of authorization that is 
valid for one year.  APHIS will then add the 
HPI’s name and contact information to the 
APHIS website.  Event managers can select 
an HPI from the list and contact them directly 
to negotiate coverage and fees. While event 
management may appoint an HPI to cover 
their event, neither event management nor 
APHIS can require an HPI to work a particular 
event. HPIs set their own rates and determine 
their schedule.
