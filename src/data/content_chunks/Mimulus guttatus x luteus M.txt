Mimulus guttatus x luteus (M. x robertsii)Silverside - monkeyflower  -Scrophulariaceae© Neville McKee© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)Monkeyflower is now well established as a naturalised alien beside many streams in Northern Ireland. Before c.1992 it was generally thought that the N. Ireland colonies were mostly ofMimulus guttatusfrom North America, but more careful examination has revealed that most of our wild plants belong toM. x robertsii, a hybrid of garden origin betweenM. guttatusand the South AmericanM. luteus.These are rather soft, fleshy, perennial plants with toothed oval opposite leaves and large, showy, bright yellow flowers. They form attractive clumps or colonies on river banks and shingle. The earliest reports of these plants in the wild in Northern Ireland date from around the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries.All names:Mimulus guttatus x luteus (M. x robertsii)Silverside;Mimulus x robertsiiSilverside;Mimulus guttatus x luteusNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
