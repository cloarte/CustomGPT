CIRSIUM ARVENSE (L.) Scop. Asteraceae Common name: Canada thistle, Creeping thistle, Common fieldthistle. Ecol. & Biol: Perennial. Roots - creeping and white, side roots give rise to upright stem Stem: upto 60 cm, without wings carrying spiny leaves . Leaves: spiny, hairy on upper surface, sessile. Inflorescence: heads, dioecious, bracts apressed. Flowers - male and female produced on seperate plants, male flower heads with long bracts on their base, feathering pappus of branched brownish hairs. Propagation by roots. Flowering time: July - September. Distribution: It is not distributed uniformly in the cultivated fields, occurs in localised spots in levelled field with more moisture and high fertility gradient. Control measures: Deep cultivation, removal of underground parts from localised spots and use of post-emergence herbicides in the heavy infestation areas can form a long term strategy for its control. Clopyralid is more effective than other broad leaf herbicides. Countries: Iran , Mongolia , Nepal , Pakistan , Syria, Back to Database of Weed Species in Crops and Countries
