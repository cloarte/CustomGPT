Atriplex prostrata sens.str.Boucher ex DC. - Spear-leaved Orache  -Chenopodiaceae© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)One of the two commonest seashore oraches (Atriplexspp.) to be found in plenty around Northern Ireland's coast. The other isA. glabriuscula, and the two are sometimes grouped together for convenience as theA. prostrataaggregate. The fruit is enclosed by two triangular bracteoles, which are fused together only at their bases, unlike those ofA. glabriusculawhich are fused for some distance above the base. The two species often grow together.All names:Atriplex prostrata sens.str.Boucher ex DC.;Atriplex prostrataBoucher ex DC.;Atriplex hastataauct. non L.;Atriplex deltoideaBab.;Atriplex calothecaauct.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
