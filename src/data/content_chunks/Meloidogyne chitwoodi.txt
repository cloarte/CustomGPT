 Invasion: Adult males and the second-stage juveniles are vermiform, motile animals, similar in general appearance to free-living soil nematodes. Females are characteristically pear-shaped, pearly-white and sedentary. The male is 887-1268 µm in length and 22-37 µm in width with a slight taper at each end. The tail is short, 4.7-9.0 µm and rounded. Cuticular annules are distinct and are more prominent near each end. The female is 430-740 µm in length and 344-518 µm in width. Second-stage

The female is 430-740 µm in length and 344-518 µm in width. Second-stage juveniles are 336-417 µm in length and 12.5-15.5 µm in width, tail short, 39-47 µm, scarcely tapered and hyaline. Eggs are 79-92 µm in length and 40-46 µm in width.

 Reproduccion: The life cycle of M. chitwoodi takes approximately 3-4 weeks under favourable conditions. Juveniles hatch from eggs in soil or on the root surface. Second-stage juveniles (the infective stage) penetrate root tips through unsuberized epidermal cells or wounds and move into the cortical region. Soon after entry, nematodes stimulate giant cell and gall formation in the host tissue. Necrotic lesions occur in the cortex. Juveniles then swell to become sausage-shaped, stop feeding and undergo three rapid successive moults to become adult males or females. Adult males have slender, vermiform bodies; they leave the root and are found free in the rhizosphere or near the protruding body of the female. However, as in the case of other Meloidogyne spp., it is probable that males are largely functionless and reproduction is nearly always parthenogenetic. Adult females have characteristically pear-shaped, pearly-white bodies and they are found embedded in host tissue. Eggs are laid by the female in a gelatinous sac near the root surface.

Adult females have characteristically pear-shaped, pearly-white bodies and they are found embedded in host tissue. Eggs are laid by the female in a gelatinous sac near the root surface. In potato tubers, modified host cells form a protective layer or 'basket' around the egg mass and the juveniles as they hatch. The egg shell itself is hyaline with no visible markings.M. chitwoodi passes the winter as eggs or juveniles and can survive extended periods of sub-zero temperatures. M. chitwoodi needs a temperature of 4°C for hatching and penetrating roots, and 6°C for development. Charchar and Santo (2001) reported on the effect of temperature on embryonic development and hatching of M. chitwoodi in Brazil. M. chitwoodi requires 600-800 degree-days to complete the first generation, whilst subsequent generations require 500-600 degree-days. Studies on potato in Oregon, USA, during 1992-1994 indicated that rapid population increase occurred after 1200 degree-days ( Ingham and Rykbost, 1995 ). M. hapla requires a similar number of degree-days for development but does not begin development until temperatures rise above 10°C. Population dynamics in relation to degree-day accumulation have been considered by Pinkerton et al. (1991) . M. chitwoodi was found to be more pathogenic at 25°C than at 30°C in glasshouse tests performed on yellow sweet clover ( Griffin and Jensen, 1997 ). Brommer and Molendijk (2001) reported that there were at least two generations per year in fields naturally infected with M. chitwoodi in the Netherlands.Several races of M. chitwoodi have been described, distinguished by slight differences in host range.

The first two, known as race 1 and race 2, were in particular distinguished with regard to carrot and lucerne ( Santo and Pinkerton, 1985 ; Mojtahedi et al., 1988 ). Race 3 has recently been described in California, USA ( Mojtahedi et al., 1994 ). The nematode found in the Netherlands previously named M. chitwoodi B-type has been redescribed as a new species (M. fallax) ( Karssen, 1996 ). Current research is attempting to clarify the position regarding races, Beek et al. (1999) proposing a pathotype scheme to describe intraspecific variation in pathogenicity.
 Sintomas: Symptoms of M. chitwoodi vary according to host, population density of the nematode and environmental conditions. Above-ground symptoms are often not obvious but may consist of varying degrees of stunting, lack of vigour and a tendency to wilt under moisture stress, all leading to reduced yield. The galls produced on potato tubers by M. chitwoodi differ from those caused by other species of Meloidogyne. M. hapla, for example, forms small but distinct galls (together with extensive root proliferation) while M. incognita forms large, easily noticeable galls. The symptoms caused by M. chitwoodi are often not easily detected and are more apparent in some cultivars than in others; tubers may, in some cases, be heavily infected without visible symptoms.

The symptoms caused by M. chitwoodi are often not easily detected and are more apparent in some cultivars than in others; tubers may, in some cases, be heavily infected without visible symptoms. When present, the galls appear as small raised swellings on the tuber surface above the developing nematodes. A number of galls may be concentrated on one area of the tuber or single galls may be scattered near eyes or lesions. Internal tissue below the gall is necrotic and brownish. Adult females are visible just below the surface as glistening, white, pear-shaped bodies surrounded by a brownish layer of host tissue. Potato roots may also be infected, but this is difficult to detect without a magnifying lens, as little or no galling occurs, even in heavy infestations. The spherical bodies of females may protrude from the surface of small rootlets surrounded posteriorly by a large egg-filled sac which becomes dark-brown with age.In other crops, root galls and reduced root production decrease yields and marketability. Gall formation occurs on most cereals but is more noticeable on wheat and oats than on barley or maize. In tomatoes, M. chitwoodi produces root galls in some cultivars but not in others.
