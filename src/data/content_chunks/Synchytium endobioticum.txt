 Life Cycle
Synchytium endobioticum
Life cycle diagram of Synchytrium endobioticum. A, infected tubers, stem and stolons  
with wart symptoms; B, resting sporangium; C, resting sporangium with maturing 
zoospores; D, discharged motile zoospores; E, two zoospores form a (diploid) 
sporangium to later form a zygote;  F, zoospore entering a host cell by direct 
penetration; G, young prosorus in host cell; H, contents of prosorus passing into host 
cell; I, cross section of sorus with two (haploid) sporangia and remains of empty 
prosorus; and J, three mature (haploid) sporangia in sorus with zoospores beginning to 
be released. The haploid sporangia are summer sporangia and the diploid sporangia are 
resting winter sporangia (Stevenson et al., 2001; illustrations after Walker, 1957).
