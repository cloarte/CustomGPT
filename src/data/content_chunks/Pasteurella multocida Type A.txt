1. Reagent Name: Pasteurella multocida Type A Bacterin (Bovine Isolate) 
2. Strain or Source: NVSL strain 1062 
3. Lot Number: IRP 591 
4. Fill Date: April 8, 2011 
5. Expiration Date: May 30, 2029 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: To be used in accordance with title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 
CFR) section, 113.121 for bovine P. multocida bacterins. 
7. Instructions for Use: The reference bacterin should be pre-diluted 1:5 with phosphate 
buffered saline (pH 7.2) immediately prior to use. The 1:5 pre-diluted reference bacterin is 
considered undiluted reference. The reference bacterin is then administered intraperitoneally (0.1 
mL/dose) in mice at the following dilutions - undiluted, 1:5, and 1:25. Phosphate-buffered saline 
(pH 7.2) is used for the serial dilutions. 
8. Test of Reagent: The bacterin was tested for sterility according to 9 CFR 113.26. The 
validation for potency tests was based on 9 CFR 113.121.
