THE HARM IT CAUSES
The ACP causes serious damage to citrus plants and 
citrus plant relatives.  Burned tips and twisted leaves 
result from an infestation on new growth.  ACPs are 
also carriers of the bacterium that causes citrus 
greening disease, spreading the disease to healthy 
citrus plants.  Citrus greening is one of the most 
serious citrus plant diseases in the world.  Once a tree 
is infected, there is no cure. 
WHAT YOU CAN DO
• Do not move homegrown citrus fruit or plants across 
State lines.
• Only buy citrus fruit or trees from shippers who 
comply with Federal quarantine restrictions
