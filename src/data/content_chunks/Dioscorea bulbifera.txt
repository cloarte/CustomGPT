 Invasion: Herbaceous, vigorous, twining (counter-clockwise) vine with non-spiny stems to 20 m or more in length, freely branching above; internodes round or slightly angled in cross section. Stems are not winged but often have a noticeable ridge along the margin. Leaves are alternate; blades 9-12.5 × 5.5-11 cm, ovate, chartaceous, glabrous, with 9-11 parallel veins, the apex acuminate to caudate, the base cordate, the margins slightly undulate; petioles (4)12-15 cm long, winged and projecting as a pair of pseudo-stipules surrounding the stem at base; bulbils axillary, usually rounded with mostly smooth surfaces, 5-6 cm wide. It has a woody, tuberous rootstock. Underground tubers ofD. bulbiferaare small, and sometimes absent.

 Reproduccion: Genetics The diploid chromosome number in this species varies from 36 to 80 depending on the origin of the cultivar analysed ( Baquar, 1980 ). A clear separation between African and Asian plants has been shown using chloroplast restriction patterns. Significant intraspecific diversity has been indicated in continental Africa using morphological evaluations. Within East and West Africa regions, African haplotype diversity was significant, possibly reflecting the long history of cultivation and human movement of the species in Africa ( Croxton et al., 2011 ). Reproductive Biology Dioscorea bulbifera is a dioecious species, with male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers occurring on separate plants. Flowers are small, white to greenish and they are arranged in relatively long clusters (panicles and spikes) up to 4 inches long ( Wagner et al., 1999 ; Miller, 2003 ). Flowers produce a pleasant fragrance and are visited by bees, wasps and nocturnal insects ( Hammer, 1998 ). Within its native range, this species reproduces sexually by seed, and vegetatively through the production of bulbils and underground tubers ( Miller, 2003 ). However, in many locations where this species has been introduced, sexual reproduction appears to be absent or extremely rare, and all or nearly all reproduction is through bulbils. The fruit-type is a dry, dehiscent, trilocular capsule

However, in many locations where this species has been introduced, sexual reproduction appears to be absent or extremely rare, and all or nearly all reproduction is through bulbils. The fruit-type is a dry, dehiscent, trilocular capsule (1.8-2.8 cm in length and from 1-1.5 cm in width) which, at maturity is pale brown. Seeds, ranging in length from 12-22 mm, are unilaterally winged, elongated and are slightly curved at the point of attachment ( Overholt et al., 2014 ). Physiology and Phenology In North America, D. bulbifera produces both male and female flowers during the summer months, but not every year, and fruits are produced from June to October ( Hammer, 1998 ; Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2008 ). In South and West Africa, plants produce flowers from February to March and the fruiting season begins in March ( Wilkin, 2001 ). On islands in the Pacific, such as Hawaii and Polynesia, plants produce flowers during summer and fruits are produced from August to October and year-round ( Wagner et al., 1999 ). Dioscorea bulbifera follows a repeated annual cycle of growth and dormancy that corresponds to the rainy and dry seasons within its native range ( Coursey, 1967 ). Outside its native range, this species has a winter dormant period when the stems die back to the ground. After dormancy, the underground tubers give rise to stems which quickly grow, often reaching up to 20 m long by the end of the growing season ( Wagner et al., 1999 ). Bulbils can also last a year or more on the ground waiting for suitable environmental conditions to sprout. It has been suggested that bulbils require a chilling period before they sprout ( Okagami and Tann

Bulbils can also last a year or more on the ground waiting for suitable environmental conditions to sprout. It has been suggested that bulbils require a chilling period before they sprout ( Okagami and Tanno, 1991 ). Martin (1974) states that sprouting of bulbils in the plant’s native range is variety-specific with some varieties producing bulbils throughout the growing season, that germinate within a few weeks of dropping. Other varieties produce bulbils that remain dormant until the following growing season. There is some evidence that temperature, and to a lesser extent bulbil weight, were the only factors which influenced sprouting of bulbils ( Overholt et al., 2014 ). Environmental Requirements Dioscorea bulbifera prefers to grow in areas with high temperatures (around 25-35°C), high humidity and high precipitation (>1000 mm annual rainfall), at low to middle elevations; 900-4000 mm is tolerated. This species grows best in a loamy soil that has good drainage and is preferably high in organic material ( Martin, 1974 ; Wilkin, 2001 ). A mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soil is preferred but D. bulbifera can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils ( https://pfaf.org/ ). D. bulbifera is adapted to partially to fully shaded conditions, but it does not tolerate salty or frosty conditions and plant vigour is affected at temperatures below 20°C ( Moriwasa, 1999 ; Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2008 ). It is more tolerant to low temperatures during dormancy.

is economically important world-wide as a food crop. Two-thirds of the worldwide production is grown in West
Africa. The origin ofD. bulbiferais uncertain. Some believe that the plant is native to both Asia and Africa.
Others believe that it is a native of Asia and was subsequently introduced into Africa.[1]Potato vine is a serious weed in central and southern Florida. Vines grow as rapidly as 20 cm per day, quickly
spiraling up to tree tops. The vines form dense masses that shade out trees and may eventually kill them.Natural historyIn 1905,D. bulbiferawas imported into Florida for scientific study. A perennial herbaceous vine with annual

stems,D. bulbiferaclimbs to a height of 9 m or more by twining to the left. Potato vine has alternate, orbicular to
cordate leaves, 10-25 cm wide, with prominent veins.[1]Dioscorea alata(white yam), also found in Florida, is recognizable by its winged stems. These wings are often
pink on plants growing in the shade. UnlikeD. bulbifera,D. alatatwines to the right. Native to Southeast Asia
and Indo-Malaysia, this species is also grown as a food crop. The leaves are heart-shaped likeD. bulbifera, but
more elongate and primarily opposite. Sometimes the leaves are alternate in young, vigorous stems and often one
leaf is aborted and so the vine appears to be alternate, but the remaining leaf scar is still visible. Stems may root
and develop underground tubers that can reach over 50 kg in weight if they touch damp soil. Aerial bulbils are
also produced.[1]A third species found in Florida isDioscorea sansibarensis.Dioscorea  sansibarensistwines to the left and is
distinguishable from the other two species by its small, often purplish, smooth bulbils. Bulbils of this species are
poisonous. A native of East Africa, it is unknown how this plant got to Florida. The leaves are orbicular at
maturity and reach greater than 60 cm wide. The leaves are cordate near the base with a long tail-like projection
produced on the leaf tip. Young leaves have wide, pointed projections off to each side. Stems, 3 cm thick or
greater, can climb into tree canopies before producing leaves.[1]Dioscoreaspe

maturity and reach greater than 60 cm wide. The leaves are cordate near the base with a long tail-like projection
produced on the leaf tip. Young leaves have wide, pointed projections off to each side. Stems, 3 cm thick or
greater, can climb into tree canopies before producing leaves.[1]Dioscoreaspecies are dioecious. In Florida, flowers occur during the summer months (but not every year). The
inconspicuous flowers are pleasant smelling and green to white in color. Male and female flowers are superficially
alike. Fruit, ca. 3-5 cm long is 3-lobed with 1-2 seeds per cell. Seeds are wind-dispersed although fruit set in
Florida occurs only occasionally.[1]The principal means of spread are by underground tubers and bulbils (aerial tubers). The underground tubers and
bulbils sprout in the spring (March) using the dead stems from the previous year as a “trellis” to climb into the tree
canopy. Bulbils are produced in June and July from the leaf axils until the plant matures. Bulbils may be smooth
and light grayish brown or warty and dark brown.[1]Bulbils can last a year or more on the ground
and still sprout. Sprouting can also occur without soil contact. The bulbils fall to the ground in late August and
die-back of stems generally occurs in October. Raccoons, wild hogs and other animals do not seem to feed upon
the bulbils. Mature bulbils float in water suggesting that flood waters may be a form of dispersal.Dioscorea bulbiferais an aggressive weed in Florida.Dioscorea  bulbiferaprefers growing in hardwood forests[1]and invades thick

the bulbils. Mature bulbils float in water suggesting that flood waters may be a form of dispersal.Dioscorea bulbiferais an aggressive weed in Florida.Dioscorea  bulbiferaprefers growing in hardwood forests[1]and invades thickets, disturbed areas, fence rows, and tropical hammocks. Potato vine is often found in
urban lots and flood plain forests, but the most vigorous growth occurs within forest canopy gaps.Dioscorea  bulbiferais
rarely found along disturbed edges of pinelands and is not salt tolerant so it does not invade marine areas.Management/MonitoringPreventative MeasuresDioscorea  bulbiferais often recommended as an ornamental planting because its leaves are attractive and the plant quickly
forms dense shade. People should be warned that this plant grows rapidly and moved tubers can resprout in
unwanted areas.Vines grow rapidly in areas of direct sunlight. Therefore, concentrate control efforts in these areas. Monitor the
number of vines climbing up trees or rooted stems per plot several times per year. Bulbils the size of peas are
capable of sprouting so diligent monitoring is necessary.[1]Mechanical ControlManual removal is very effective but is labor intensive. Remove bulbils in the wintertime by hand or by raking and
then again when they begin to sprout. All bulbils should be removed and burned to prevent spread into new areas.
Underground tuber reshooting may not be as important for recolonizing an area as sprouting bulbils, therefore

Underground tuber reshooting may not be as important for recolonizing an area as sprouting bulbils, therefore
concentrate efforts on removing as many bulbils as possible.Burn/Cut/GrazeManaged burns may controlD. bulbifera. Stems readily succumb to fire but often subterranean tubers resprout
quickly. Large bulbils can resprout if fire temperature is too low.
To weaken the subterranean tuber, clip back and remove stems before bulbils form in June.Chemical ControlRoundUp, a nonselective herbicide, will kill the vines but the tuber will most likely resprout.
Garlon 4 applied at a 10% concentration provides good control when applied with the basal application method.
Basal application methods should use an oil diluent. Completely encircle the lowest 30-61 cm of the stem or trunk
with the herbicide and form a band at least 15 cm wide. Garlon 4 (10% concentration) and Garlon 3A (50%
concentration) provide excellent control when applied to a cut surface. Apply herbicide during the growing season.
Wound plants (e.g., with a hatchet) by making a downward cut and use a chemical-resistant squirt bottle to apply
the herbicide. Follow up treatments (usually 1-2) are recommended at 6 month intervals until control is successful.[2]Information sourcesBibliography↑Hammer, R.L. 1998. Diagnosis:Dioscorea.

 Reproduccion: Genetics The diploid chromosome number in this species varies from 36 to 80 depending on the origin of the cultivar analysed ( Baquar, 1980 ). A clear separation between African and Asian plants has been shown using chloroplast restriction patterns. Significant intraspecific diversity has been indicated in continental Africa using morphological evaluations. Within East and West Africa regions, African haplotype diversity was significant, possibly reflecting the long history of cultivation and human movement of the species in Africa ( Croxton et al., 2011 ). Reproductive Biology Dioscorea bulbifera is a dioecious species, with male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers occurring on separate plants. Flowers are small, white to greenish and they are arranged in relatively long clusters (panicles and spikes) up to 4 inches long ( Wagner et al., 1999 ; Miller, 2003 ). Flowers produce a pleasant fragrance and are visited by bees, wasps and nocturnal insects ( Hammer, 1998 ). Within its native range, this species reproduces sexually by seed, and vegetatively through the production of bulbils and underground tubers ( Miller, 2003 ). However, in many locations where this species has been introduced, sexual reproduction appears to be absent or extremely rare, and all or nearly all reproduction is through bulbils.

However, in many locations where this species has been introduced, sexual reproduction appears to be absent or extremely rare, and all or nearly all reproduction is through bulbils. The fruit-type is a dry, dehiscent, trilocular capsule (1.8-2.8 cm in length and from 1-1.5 cm in width) which, at maturity is pale brown. Seeds, ranging in length from 12-22 mm, are unilaterally winged, elongated and are slightly curved at the point of attachment ( Overholt et al., 2014 ). Physiology and Phenology In North America, D. bulbifera produces both male and female flowers during the summer months, but not every year, and fruits are produced from June to October ( Hammer, 1998 ; Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2008 ). In South and West Africa, plants produce flowers from February to March and the fruiting season begins in March ( Wilkin, 2001 ). On islands in the Pacific, such as Hawaii and Polynesia, plants produce flowers during summer and fruits are produced from August to October and year-round ( Wagner et al., 1999 ). Dioscorea bulbifera follows a repeated annual cycle of growth and dormancy that corresponds to the rainy and dry seasons within its native range ( Coursey, 1967 ). Outside its native range, this species has a winter dormant period when the stems die back to the ground. After dormancy, the underground tubers give rise to stems which quickly grow, often reaching up to 20 m long by the end of the growing season ( Wagner et al., 1999 ). Bulbils can also last a year or more on the ground waiting for suitable environmental conditions to sprout.

Bulbils can also last a year or more on the ground waiting for suitable environmental conditions to sprout. It has been suggested that bulbils require a chilling period before they sprout ( Okagami and Tanno, 1991 ). Martin (1974) states that sprouting of bulbils in the plant’s native range is variety-specific with some varieties producing bulbils throughout the growing season, that germinate within a few weeks of dropping. Other varieties produce bulbils that remain dormant until the following growing season. There is some evidence that temperature, and to a lesser extent bulbil weight, were the only factors which influenced sprouting of bulbils ( Overholt et al., 2014 ). Environmental Requirements Dioscorea bulbifera prefers to grow in areas with high temperatures (around 25-35°C), high humidity and high precipitation (>1000 mm annual rainfall), at low to middle elevations; 900-4000 mm is tolerated. This species grows best in a loamy soil that has good drainage and is preferably high in organic material ( Martin, 1974 ; Wilkin, 2001 ). A mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soil is preferred but D. bulbifera can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils ( https://pfaf.org/ ). D. bulbifera is adapted to partially to fully shaded conditions, but it does not tolerate salty or frosty conditions and plant vigour is affected at temperatures below 20°C ( Moriwasa, 1999 ; Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2008 ). It is more tolerant to low temperatures during dormancy.

is economically important world-wide as a food crop. Two-thirds of the worldwide production is grown in West
Africa. The origin ofD. bulbiferais uncertain. Some believe that the plant is native to both Asia and Africa.
Others believe that it is a native of Asia and was subsequently introduced into Africa.[1]Potato vine is a serious weed in central and southern Florida. Vines grow as rapidly as 20 cm per day, quickly
spiraling up to tree tops. The vines form dense masses that shade out trees and may eventually kill them.Natural historyIn 1905,D. bulbiferawas imported into Florida for scientific study. A perennial herbaceous vine with annual

stems,D. bulbiferaclimbs to a height of 9 m or more by twining to the left. Potato vine has alternate, orbicular to
cordate leaves, 10-25 cm wide, with prominent veins.[1]Dioscorea alata(white yam), also found in Florida, is recognizable by its winged stems. These wings are often
pink on plants growing in the shade. UnlikeD. bulbifera,D. alatatwines to the right. Native to Southeast Asia
and Indo-Malaysia, this species is also grown as a food crop. The leaves are heart-shaped likeD. bulbifera, but
more elongate and primarily opposite. Sometimes the leaves are alternate in young, vigorous stems and often one
leaf is aborted and so the vine appears to be alternate, but the remaining leaf scar is still visible. Stems may root
and develop underground tubers that can reach over 50 kg in weight if they touch damp soil. Aerial bulbils are
also produced.[1]A third species found in Florida isDioscorea sansibarensis.Dioscorea  sansibarensistwines to the left and is
distinguishable from the other two species by its small, often purplish, smooth bulbils. Bulbils of this species are
poisonous. A native of East Africa, it is unknown how this plant got to Florida. The leaves are orbicular at
maturity and reach greater than 60 cm wide. The leaves are cordate near the base with a long tail-like projection
produced on the leaf tip. Young leaves have wide, pointed projections off to each side. Stems, 3 cm thick or
greater, can climb into tree canopies before producing leaves.[1]Dioscoreaspe

 The leaves are orbicular at
maturity and reach greater than 60 cm wide. The leaves are cordate near the base with a long tail-like projection
produced on the leaf tip. Young leaves have wide, pointed projections off to each side. Stems, 3 cm thick or
greater, can climb into tree canopies before producing leaves.[1]Dioscoreaspecies are dioecious. In Florida, flowers occur during the summer months (but not every year). The
inconspicuous flowers are pleasant smelling and green to white in color. Male and female flowers are superficially
alike. Fruit, ca. 3-5 cm long is 3-lobed with 1-2 seeds per cell. Seeds are wind-dispersed although fruit set in
Florida occurs only occasionally.[1]The principal means of spread are by underground tubers and bulbils (aerial tubers). The underground tubers and
bulbils sprout in the spring (March) using the dead stems from the previous year as a “trellis” to climb into the tree
canopy. Bulbils are produced in June and July from the leaf axils until the plant matures. Bulbils may be smooth
and light grayish brown or warty and dark brown.[1]Bulbils can last a year or more on the ground
and still sprout. Sprouting can also occur without soil contact. The bulbils fall to the ground in late August and
die-back of stems generally occurs in October. Raccoons, wild hogs and other animals do not seem to feed upon
the bulbils. Mature bulbils float in water suggesting that flood waters may be a form of dispersal.Dioscorea bulbiferais an aggressive weed in Florida.Dioscorea  bulbiferaprefers growing in hardwood forests[1]and invades thick

Mature bulbils float in water suggesting that flood waters may be a form of dispersal.Dioscorea bulbiferais an aggressive weed in Florida.Dioscorea  bulbiferaprefers growing in hardwood forests[1]and invades thickets, disturbed areas, fence rows, and tropical hammocks. Potato vine is often found in
urban lots and flood plain forests, but the most vigorous growth occurs within forest canopy gaps.Dioscorea  bulbiferais
rarely found along disturbed edges of pinelands and is not salt tolerant so it does not invade marine areas.Management/MonitoringPreventative MeasuresDioscorea  bulbiferais often recommended as an ornamental planting because its leaves are attractive and the plant quickly
forms dense shade. People should be warned that this plant grows rapidly and moved tubers can resprout in
unwanted areas.Vines grow rapidly in areas of direct sunlight. Therefore, concentrate control efforts in these areas. Monitor the
number of vines climbing up trees or rooted stems per plot several times per year. Bulbils the size of peas are
capable of sprouting so diligent monitoring is necessary.[1]Mechanical ControlManual removal is very effective but is labor intensive. Remove bulbils in the wintertime by hand or by raking and
then again when they begin to sprout. All bulbils should be removed and burned to prevent spread into new areas.
Underground tuber reshooting may not be as important for recolonizing an area as sprouting bulbils, therefore
concentrate efforts on removing as many bulbils as possible.Burn/Cut/GrazeManaged burns may controlD. bulbifera. Stems readily succumb to fire but often subterranean tubers resprout

 into new areas.
Underground tuber reshooting may not be as important for recolonizing an area as sprouting bulbils, therefore
concentrate efforts on removing as many bulbils as possible.Burn/Cut/GrazeManaged burns may controlD. bulbifera. Stems readily succumb to fire but often subterranean tubers resprout
quickly. Large bulbils can resprout if fire temperature is too low.
To weaken the subterranean tuber, clip back and remove stems before bulbils form in June.Chemical ControlRoundUp, a nonselective herbicide, will kill the vines but the tuber will most likely resprout.
Garlon 4 applied at a 10% concentration provides good control when applied with the basal application method.
Basal application methods should use an oil diluent. Completely encircle the lowest 30-61 cm of the stem or trunk
with the herbicide and form a band at least 15 cm wide. Garlon 4 (10% concentration) and Garlon 3A (50%
concentration) provide excellent control when applied to a cut surface. Apply herbicide during the growing season.
Wound plants (e.g., with a hatchet) by making a downward cut and use a chemical-resistant squirt bottle to apply
the herbicide. Follow up treatments (usually 1-2) are recommended at 6 month intervals until control is successful.[2]Information sourcesBibliography↑Hammer, R.L. 1998. Diagnosis:Dioscorea.
