The database is publicly available since September 2021. All EPPO members countries are invited to appoint an official contact point and provide information about resistance cases in their respective countries to the EPPO Secretariat through this contact point. So far 27 EPPO member countries have nominated a contact point and most of them entered resistance cases in the database. In addition to the 811 resistance cases already validated in previous EWG meetings (and visible in the Database for all users), this year the EWG considered 210 new (or updated) cases and 202 of them were validated. The cases validated at the meeting will soon be visible for all users of the Database. The cases which could not be validated at the meeting will need further work or consideration by the countries that proposed them. Expert Working Group A regular topic on the agenda is the update from Panel members on current and new resistance cases and management strategies. Country presentations were made by Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, followed by information from the Resistance Action Committees (RAC
