Overview
Appearance
Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos
is an herbaceous biennial or perennial plant that readily invades open areas. Its name is derived from the black margins of the flower bract tips which give the flower heads a spotted look.
Foliage
A basal rosette of deeply lobed leaves is produced the first year. Rosette leaves are deeply lobed, petiolate, and approximately 8 in. (20 cm) long. Flowering stems are 1-4 ft. (0.3-1.2 m) tall and branched. Stem leaves are alternate and may be slightly lobed or linear. Leaves become smaller and less lobed toward the apex.
Flowers
The small purple to pink flowers bloom in the early summer.
Fruit
Reproduction of spotted knapweed occurs solely by seed. Hundreds and/or thousands of seeds are produced. Seeds are easily distributed by wind, animals, and contaminated hay. Seeds can remain viable in the soil for up to 8 years.
Ecological Threat
Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos
invades a wide variety of habitats including pastures, open forests, prairies, meadows, old fields, and disturbed areas. It displaces native vegetation and reduces the forage potential for wildlife and livestock. It is native to Europe and western Asia. It was accidentally introduced into North America in contaminated alfalfa and clover seed in the late 1800s.
