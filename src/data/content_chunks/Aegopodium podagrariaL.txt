Aegopodium podagrariaL. - Ground-elder  -Umbelliferae / Apiaceae(Map updated: March 2008)Gardeners will be familiar with this plant as one of the most difficult weeds to combat, having an aggressive underground creeping stem by which it spreads into all sorts of unwanted places. It is not native to Ireland, having been introduced from continental Europe for use as a herb in cooking. Several other umbellifers which are now naturalised in Ireland and Great Britain were brought in from Europe for use as herbs, such as Alexanders which, like ground elder, is no longer used in modern cuisine. Apart from its occurrence as a garden weed, the plant is frequently found in lowland hedgebanks, usually not far away from houses. In summer it produces attractive white-flowered umbels on tall stems.All names:Aegopodium podagrariaL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
