uncle bearing a prophyll and usually 1 or more peduncular bracts; rachis bearing prominent or much-reduced rachis bracts; rachillae 1 to many, bearing flowers in various arrangements, often solitary, paired, in threes (triads) or more; flowers usually with 3 sepals, 3 petals, 6 stamens, and 3 carpels. Fruits variously shaped and colored, sometimes covered with overlapping scales; endosperm ruminate or homogeneous; germination remote or adjacent; eophylls undivided, bifid, pinnate, or palmate.About 183 genera and ca. 2,450 species: tropical and subtropical areas in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Madagascar, and the Pacific; 18 genera (two introduced) and 77 species (27 endemic, four introduced, includingAreca catechu,Arenga pinnata,Cocos nucifera, andPhoenix dactylifera) in China.A very wide range of palm species is grown as ornamentals in botanical gardens, including those in the humid, tropical parts of China. A few are more widely grown in China and are listed at the end of this account.See Henderson (Palms S. Asia. 2009).Pei Shengji, Chen Sanyang & Tong Shaoquan. 1991.

 rachis is truncated and the leaf appears fan-shaped.Peduncular bract– the second (and subsequent) bract(s) on an inflorescence after theprophyll.Pinna(pluralpinnae) – a single leaflet of apinnateleaf.Pinnate– of a leaf in which the rachis is elongate and the leaf appears feather-shaped.Prophyll– the first bract on an axillary branch, usually applying to that of an inflorescence.Rachilla(pluralrachillae) – the flower bearing branch(es) of an inflorescence.Reduplicate– of apinnaor segment fold in which the central axis of a fold is adaxial and the margins abaxial (i.e., L-shaped in cross section).Remote germination– germination in which the seedling develops at some distance from the seed, by extension of the cotyledonary petiole.Semelparous(syn. hapaxanthic) – the condition of a stem with a relatively short reproductive phase, typically of 1–7 years duration, before death.1Leaves palmate or costapalmate(2)+Leaves pinnate (or pinnately veined if undivided) or bipinnate(7)2(1)Hastula absent; petioles deeply channeled.12Chuniophoenix+Hastula present; petioles not deeply channeled(3)3(2)Petiole margins unarmed(4)+Petiole margins armed(5)4(3)Segments with 1(or 2) reduplicate folds, green abaxially.9Rhapis+Segments with several induplicate folds, grayish or silvery white abaxially.7Guihaia5(3)Leaf blades split to their bases
