P. O. Box 844 
Ames, IA 50010 
1. Reagent Name: Clostridium tetani Toxin 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 664 
4. Fill Date: October 31, 2018 
5. Expiration Date: February 28, 2029 
Precautions: Accidental parenteral inoculation and ingestion of the toxin are the primary 
hazards associated with this reagent. It is uncertain if tetanus toxin can be absorbed 
through mucous membranes; consequently, the hazards associated with aerosols and 
droplets remain unclear. The administration of an adult diphtheria-tetanus toxoid at 10-
year intervals reduces the risk of toxin exposures to laboratory personnel and is highly 
recommended. 
6. Intended Use: Use IRP 664 to coat microtiter plates for the indirect enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described in SAM 217, and for the comparative toxin-
antitoxin neutralization test in guinea pigs as described in SAM 206. 
7. Instructions for Use: 
9CFR 113.217 Tetanus Toxoid: To conduct the ELISA, coat each well of the microtiter plate 
with 100 µL of IRP 664 diluted 1:12 by adding 1 mL IRP 664 + 11 mL

antitoxin neutralization test in guinea pigs as described in SAM 206. 
7. Instructions for Use: 
9CFR 113.217 Tetanus Toxoid: To conduct the ELISA, coat each well of the microtiter plate 
with 100 µL of IRP 664 diluted 1:12 by adding 1 mL IRP 664 + 11 mL antigen coating buffer 
(ACB) or 2 mL IRP 664 + 22 mL ACB (for two plates). 
9CFR 113.451 Tetanus Antitoxin: To conduct comparative toxin-antitoxin neutralization tests 
in guinea pigs at the 0.10 Antitoxin Unit per mL level, dilute IRP 664 to 1:625 in 1/15 M 
phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.2% gelatin (PBS w/ gelatin) by adding 1 mL IRP 664 + 
9 mL PBS w/ gelatin (1:10); 2 mL (1:10) + 18 mL PBS w/ gelatin; 4 mL (1:100) + 21 mL PBS 
w/ gelatin. 
8. Test of Reagent: Determination of the test dose of toxin – Titrations were performed to 
determine the optimum toxin concentration for adsorption to 96-well microtiter plates. 
Sterility Test – The toxin was tested for sterility and found to be free of viable bacteria and fungi 
according to 9CFR 113.26.

12. Origin and Passage History: Clostridium tetani culture 7010 obtained from Burns Bio-
tech was used to produce IRP 664. The history of the culture prior to being sent to the Center for 
Veterinary Biologics is unknown. 
13. Method of Preparation: The culture was grown in 10-liter fermentor vessels containing 
Modified Mueller & Miller Medium. The culture incubated at 35°-36°C for 110-120 hours, 
harvested, then centrifuged at 10,000 x g in a rotor chamber at 2°-7°C for 45 minutes. The 
supernatant was passed through a Pall VacuCap® 90 PF filter unit containing 0.8/0.2-µm 
Supor® membranes. The filtrate was concentrated using a Millipore pellicon cassette system 
containing a 10,000 NMWL PTGC00005 filter. The concentrated material retained by the filter 
was passed through a Pall VacuCap® 90 PF filter unit containing 0.8/0.2-µm Supor® 
membranes.
