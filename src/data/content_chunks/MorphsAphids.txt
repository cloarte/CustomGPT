MorphsAphids species each exhibit several biologically and morphologically different formsAphid species can exhibit as many as 12 different forms, or morphs, during the course of their seasonal life-cycle. AphID only considers adult femaleviviparae,apterousandalate. It does not treat males,oviparae,immatures, or any number of other specialized morphs. Before using AphID, it is important to confirm that the unidentified specimen is anadult female vivipara, and NOT an immature, an ovipara, or a male.
ApteraThe adult apterous vivipara is specialized for asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction. She gives live birth to genetic clones of herself.AlataThe alata is equipped with wings for migration or movement from one host to another. She is also very fecund, although does not typically produce quite as many offspring as her apterous sister.Adult viviparaThe adult vivipara can be recognized by the presence of a genital plate andrudimentary gonapophyses. It also frequently hasembryosvisible within itsabdomen.Thegenital plateis pointed to above and threerudimentary gonapophysesare below. These structures can be hard to distinguish if the specimen is poorly mounted.Genital plateThe genital plate is characteristic of adult aphids.The genital plate is circled and pointed to in this image. Note the clustering ofsetaeon the bottom end of thesclerite, with only a fewsetaetowards the front, and none in the middle. This is a common (but not universal) pattern of genital platesetae.Rudimentary gonapophysesViviparae also exhibit these structures, which are reduced and modified genitalia used in live birth. The number of gonapophyses is standard among aphid groups, there usually being three or

The number of gonapophyses is standard among aphid groups, there usually being three or four.Three rudimentary gonapophyses are covered in smallsetae.OviparaThe ovipara is usually easily recognized by having a large number ofpseudosensoriaon hermetatibia. In some instances, if she has mated, she may also be carying eggs.Pseudosensoria on the tibia are clearly visible here. Note also the large and conspicuous eggs.MaleThe adult male has obvious genitalia. In poor specimen preparations, however, the genitalia may be hard to distinguish from the rest of the generally heavily sclerotized rear end of the aphid.The genitalia on this male are clearly visible.
