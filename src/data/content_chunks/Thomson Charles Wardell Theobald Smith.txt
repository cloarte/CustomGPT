This list is arranged in chronological order by year of induction beginning with the current year and ending in 1908. Find a member | Top Barbara Baker - Elected 2021 Plant Biology Barbara Baker, a plant molecular geneticist with the ARS Plant Gene Expression Center in Albany, California, is known for her work with disease resistance genes (R-genes) in plants. Baker’s research revealed that R-genes and the proteins they encode for form a major plant defense system against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi. The concept of single traits conferring disease resistance to specific pathogens has been around for decades. But Baker was the first to isolate one of these single genes responsible for resistance to a specific plant virus. This gene, named N for Necrosis, codes for a protein that provides resistance to the tobacco mosaic virus. With the advances that have followed Baker’s work, plant scientists and breeders have been able to speed up the process and introduce new disease resistance genes into crops.

Find a member | Top James Giovannoni - Elected 2016 Plant, Soil, and Microbial Sciences James J. Giovannoni, molecular biologist with USDA's Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture and Health in Ithaca, New York, revolutionized the understanding of fruit ripening biology and genetics. He pioneered research in fruit ripening epigenetics, which is a natural layer of chemical instructions superimposed over DNA. Giovannoni's 2002 landmark discovery of the tomato gene RIN, which regulates ethylene, opened a new frontier in understanding the biology of fruit ripening. His discovery that epigenetics plays a pivotal role in tomato ripening has opened the door to new ways of thinking about how plant development may be regulated genetically beyond the DNA sequence alone. Giovannoni, working with colleagues in the United States, Great Britain and Israel, has shown that RIN-like genes also control ripening in melons, banana, and even strawberries. He and his colleagues have isolated and characterized other genes contributing to a broader understanding of ripening control and the regulation of fruit quality and nutritional value.

Find a member | Top Jitender P Dubey - Elected 2010 Animal, Nutritional, and Applied Microbial Sciences Jitender Dubey, microbiologist with the Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, worked chiefly on three single-cell organisms: Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Sarcocystis neurona. He spent years developing methods for identifying the presence of T. gondii and guidelines for rendering infected meat safe for consumption. Toxoplasmosis , caused by T. gondii , is a devastating disease among congenitally infected children and a major cause of foodborne disease in the United States. Neospora caninum causes spontaneous abortion in livestock and paralysis in household pets. Having identified N. caninum as the cause, Dubey developed tests to identify it, discovered its lifecycle, and led research into developing a vaccine. Dubey also identified the cause of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, a neurological disease in horses. He developed a diagnostic test, explained the protozoa's life cycle, and discovered the drugs used to treat the disease.

Sears, geneticist with the ARS Cereal Genetics Research Unit at the University of Missouri, conducted research that provided essential data about wheat's 21 chromosomes. He produced a series of wheat lines called aneuploids used to analyze individual chromosomes for useful genes. In the 1950s, Sears transferred a gene for resistance to leaf rust disease from a wild grass species into the wheat variety Chinese Spring. This led to rust-resistant wheats around the world and increased annual revenue for the wheat farmers of Kansas alone by an estimated $30 million. It was science's first example of chromosome engineering, incorporating a small segment of a chromosome from one plant species into another. Sears' work in wheat genetics and discoveries of chromosomal mechanisms established standards in animal, plant, and human genetics secured him a spot in the ARS Hall of Fame. He also received other prestigious awards including the Hoblitzelle Award for Research in Agricultural Sciences and the Wolf Prize in Agriculture.

Find a member | Top Sterling B. Hendricks - Elected 1952 Plant Physiology, Mineralogy, and Chemistry Sterling B. Hendricks, chemist with the Mineral Nutrition Pioneering Research Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, was one of the first Americans to use x-rays to study molecular structure. In the early 1940s in Beltsville, H.A. Borthwick, M.W. Parker and Sterling Hendricks began collaborating in conducting research on the effects of photoperiodism in the flowering of short-day plants. Using a spectrograph built from a huge carbon arc light they salvaged, the scientists studied the effect of different light wavelengths on soybeans noting that red light was very effective for promoting germination or triggering flowering responses. Those studies led to the discovery of a pigment-containing protein later named phytochrome. Red light switches phytochrome to a biologically active form, while far red light reverses it to a biologically inactive form, a process that controls germination, growth and flowering. Though Hendricks was notably remembered for his work on plant photobiology, he also pioneered the application of radioisotopes to the study of phosphate fertilizer transport and intake into plant roots. In 1981 the Sterling B.

Raper's identification of a cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum , in 1935 led to four decades of research and publication on a group of organisms ( Dictyostelids and Acrasids ) that have wide applications in microbiology. From 1940 to 1953 Dr. Raper served as microbiologist at the USDA Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois. In 1940, upon a visit from British scientists Raymond Florey and Ronald Heatley, seeking to develop methods of large-scale penicillin production for the war effort, Raper and his associates initiated a research program at NRRL of historic importance. Beginning with a Penicillium strain from Alexander Fleming, the NRRL "Penicillin Team" went on to develop increasing yields of penicillin in submerged culture which was of critical therapeutic impact for World War II combat injuries, and which launched the "Age of Antibiotics."

Find a member | Top Sewall Wright - Elected 1934 Genetics Sewall Wright, biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., was an influential pioneer in the field of evolutionary genetics. Upon receiving his doctorate from Harvard, Wright moved to Washington where he became senior animal husbandman in the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1915 to 1925. There he took over the analysis of a colony of guinea pigs, some of which had been sib-mated for many generations. Wright's analysis of the effects of inbreeding and hybridization are classic. His work contributed to the USDA Technical Bulletin 103:1-14 "The Persistence of Differentiation Among Inbred Families of Guinea Pigs" in 1929. At the same time, he studied coat color inheritance. This was the period in which Wright began to make major theoretical advances. He worked out the consequences of various mating systems, and his studies on quantitative inheritance, along with those of R. A. Fisher, became the foundation for scientific animal breeding. During this period Wright also developed what he later called the "shifting balance theory."

Smith joined USDA in 1884 and during his first 2 years, while working on hog cholera, discovered a new species of bacteria ( Salmonella enterica , formerly called Salmonella choleraesuis ), which was later shown to often be a secondary infection to the viral infection hog cholera. In 1888 Smith begun studies on Texas cattle fever. He discovered that a protozoa, which he eventually named Piroplasma bigeminum (now called Babesia bigemina ) was causing the destruction of the red blood cells of infected cattle. Experiments conducted with fellow scientists, demonstrated for the first time that the infection could pass in ticks from adults to nymphs and spread from infected to uninfected animals. In 1895, Smith reported that blackhead, a devastating enterohepatitis in turkeys, was caused by a protozoan called Amoeba meleagridis (now Histomonas meleagridis ). He also showed that kill bacteria could produce disease immunity. BAI Bulletin No. One, Smith's 301-page monograph about the laboratory and field experiments (1893), is regarded as one of the classics of medical literature.

Baker’s research revealed that R-genes and the proteins they encode for form a major plant defense system against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi. The concept of single traits conferring disease resistance to specific pathogens has been around for decades. But Baker was the first to isolate one of these single genes responsible for resistance to a specific plant virus. This gene, named N for Necrosis, codes for a protein that provides resistance to the tobacco mosaic virus. With the advances that have followed Baker’s work, plant scientists and breeders have been able to speed up the process and introduce new disease resistance genes into crops.

Holley focused on isolating transfer RNA (tRNA) and later on determining the sequence and structure of alanine tRNA, the molecule that incorporates the amino acid alanine into proteins. Holley and his team determined tRNA's structure by using two ribonucleases to split the tRNA molecule into pieces. The nucleotide sequence was completed at the end of 1964 and was a key discovery in explaining the synthesis of proteins from messenger RNA. Holley was awarded Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for describing the structure of alanine transfer RNA linking DNA and protein synthesis. Find a member | Top Edward F. Knipling - Elected 1966 Insect Control Edward F. Knipling director of the Entomology Division in Beltsville, Maryland, began work with his long-time colleague, Dr. Raymond C. Bushland in 1935 on research concentrated on treating cattle for screwworm maggots. In the early 1950s, Knipling developed an innovative sterile male technique for controlling insect pests. Insect control strategies at that time relied mostly on chemical pesticides. His method involved releasing sterile male insects into the wild to disrupt insect reproduction. Knipling's pioneering research led to eradication of the screwworm from the U.S., Mexico and parts of Central America. Today it's used worldwide to eradicate outbreaks of other pests such as Mediterranean fruit flies. Knipling went on to lead a USDA research team in Orlando Florida working with the U.S. Army to develop repellents and controls for biting insects (e.g., flies, mosquitoes, lice) that vectored diseases such as typhus and malaria, which posed a threat to U.S. and Allied forces.

Sears, geneticist with the ARS Cereal Genetics Research Unit at the University of Missouri, conducted research that provided essential data about wheat's 21 chromosomes. He produced a series of wheat lines called aneuploids used to analyze individual chromosomes for useful genes. In the 1950s, Sears transferred a gene for resistance to leaf rust disease from a wild grass species into the wheat variety Chinese Spring. This led to rust-resistant wheats around the world and increased annual revenue for the wheat farmers of Kansas alone by an estimated $30 million. It was science's first example of chromosome engineering, incorporating a small segment of a chromosome from one plant species into another. Sears' work in wheat genetics and discoveries of chromosomal mechanisms established standards in animal, plant, and human genetics secured him a spot in the ARS Hall of Fame. He also received other prestigious awards including the Hoblitzelle Award for Research in Agricultural Sciences and the Wolf Prize in Agriculture.

Borthwick spent many years studying and quantifying the photoperiodic mechanisms that control flowering in plants. His studies formed the basis for collaborative research with other scientists that successfully identified and isolated the photoreceptor for day length detection in plants. Using a huge carbon arc light salvaged from a theater, Borthwick and his team studied the effect of different light wavelengths on Biloxi soybeans. Those studies led to the discovery of a plant photoreceptor protein, which the team named phytochrome. Phytochrome, one of the most important discoveries in plant science of the 20th century, is recognized as one of the universal regulators of plant physiology and growth. Find a member | Top Arnold Kent Balls - Elected 1954 Food Technology Arnold Kent Balls, chemist with the Enzyme Research Laboratory of the USDA's Bureau of Agricultural and Industrial Chemistry (later the Western Regional Research Laboratory) conducted outstanding research for that department in both basic and applied aspects of food enzymes. Balls and his associates developed methods of purifying and crystallizing enzymes. Throughout his long and productive scientific career, Balls' prime interest was the understanding of the chemical nature of enzymes and their mechanisms of action. He very successfully applied the basic knowledge toward improvement and preservation of food products and other agricultural commodities. Thus, the knowledge gained from his work on the action of papain found wide practical application in the tenderizing of meat. His work on the oxidation-reduction of the proteinases of flour has provided useful information for the processing of wheat and to the baking industry in general.

Find a member | Top Sterling B. Hendricks - Elected 1952 Plant Physiology, Mineralogy, and Chemistry Sterling B. Hendricks, chemist with the Mineral Nutrition Pioneering Research Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, was one of the first Americans to use x-rays to study molecular structure. In the early 1940s in Beltsville, H.A. Borthwick, M.W. Parker and Sterling Hendricks began collaborating in conducting research on the effects of photoperiodism in the flowering of short-day plants. Using a spectrograph built from a huge carbon arc light they salvaged, the scientists studied the effect of different light wavelengths on soybeans noting that red light was very effective for promoting germination or triggering flowering responses. Those studies led to the discovery of a pigment-containing protein later named phytochrome. Red light switches phytochrome to a biologically active form, while far red light reverses it to a biologically inactive form, a process that controls germination, growth and flowering. Though Hendricks was notably remembered for his work on plant photobiology, he also pioneered the application of radioisotopes to the study of phosphate fertilizer transport and intake into plant roots. In 1981 the Sterling B. Hendricks Lecture was established by ARS to honor the memory of Hendricks and to recognize scientists who have made outstanding contributions to the chemical science of agriculture.

Find a member | Top Kenneth Bryan Raper - Elected 1949 Plant Biology Kenneth Bryan Raper, microbiologist with the USDA Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois, was a mycologist and botanist whose contributions to the medical and industrial applications of fungi of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium stand among the outstanding achievements of twentieth-century science. Raper's identification of a cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum , in 1935 led to four decades of research and publication on a group of organisms ( Dictyostelids and Acrasids ) that have wide applications in microbiology. From 1940 to 1953 Dr. Raper served as microbiologist at the USDA Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois. In 1940, upon a visit from British scientists Raymond Florey and Ronald Heatley, seeking to develop methods of large-scale penicillin production for the war effort, Raper and his associates initiated a research program at NRRL of historic importance. Beginning with a Penicillium strain from Alexander Fleming, the NRRL "Penicillin Team" went on to develop increasing yields of penicillin in submerged culture which was of critical therapeutic impact for World War II combat injuries, and which launched the "Age of Antibiotics."

Find a member | Top Sewall Wright - Elected 1934 Genetics Sewall Wright, biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., was an influential pioneer in the field of evolutionary genetics. Upon receiving his doctorate from Harvard, Wright moved to Washington where he became senior animal husbandman in the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1915 to 1925. There he took over the analysis of a colony of guinea pigs, some of which had been sib-mated for many generations. Wright's analysis of the effects of inbreeding and hybridization are classic. His work contributed to the USDA Technical Bulletin 103:1-14 "The Persistence of Differentiation Among Inbred Families of Guinea Pigs" in 1929. At the same time, he studied coat color inheritance. This was the period in which Wright began to make major theoretical advances. He worked out the consequences of various mating systems, and his studies on quantitative inheritance, along with those of R. A. Fisher, became the foundation for scientific animal breeding. During this period Wright also developed what he later called the "shifting balance theory."

Erwin Frank Smith - Elected 1913 Plant Pathology Erwin Frank Smith, plant pathologist with the USDA, researched a wide range of plant diseases including fire blight in pears and apples. Smith's studies showed that fire blight disease is caused by an infectious bacterium—an important advance in the field of plant disease control. He also conducted work on "peach yellows"—a wide-spread destructive disease caused by a phytoplasma—and other related peach diseases. Speculating that plant and animal tumors and cancers had similar etiologies, Smith spent the latter part of his life devoted to work on crown gall which causes tumor-like growths on roots and trunks of plants. In 1913, he received a certificate of honor from the American Medical Association for his work on "Cancer in Plants."

Smith joined USDA in 1884 and during his first 2 years, while working on hog cholera, discovered a new species of bacteria ( Salmonella enterica , formerly called Salmonella choleraesuis ), which was later shown to often be a secondary infection to the viral infection hog cholera. In 1888 Smith begun studies on Texas cattle fever. He discovered that a protozoa, which he eventually named Piroplasma bigeminum (now called Babesia bigemina ) was causing the destruction of the red blood cells of infected cattle. Experiments conducted with fellow scientists, demonstrated for the first time that the infection could pass in ticks from adults to nymphs and spread from infected to uninfected animals. In 1895, Smith reported that blackhead, a devastating enterohepatitis in turkeys, was caused by a protozoan called Amoeba meleagridis (now Histomonas meleagridis ). He also showed that kill bacteria could produce disease immunity. BAI Bulletin No. One, Smith's 301-page monograph about the laboratory and field experiments (1893), is regarded as one of the classics of medical literature.
