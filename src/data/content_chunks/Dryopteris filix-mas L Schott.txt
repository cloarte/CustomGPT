Dryopteris filix-mas(L.) Schott - Common Male Fern  -Dryopteridaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)© Paul Hackney© Paul HackneyThis is one of our commonest native fern species found on roadside verges, in hedgebanks and in scrub. It is similar to the Scaly Male-fernDryopteris affinisbut lacks the dark spot at the base of the primary leaf segments (calledpinnae) which is a consistent feature of that species. It also differs in that it is a sexually-reproducing species, whereasD. affinisreproduces asexually. The two species can hybridize, but there are only a few records of the hybrid in theCEDaRdatabase. This may be because the hybrid is so similar to the parent species in general appearance.All names:Dryopteris filix-mas(L.)
