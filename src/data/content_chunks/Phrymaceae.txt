China 18 (see comment below).Z. Yu Li (in FRPS 70: 314-317. 2002) treated Phrymaceae to include only the genusPhryma, but recent studies have shown that the family should include a number of genera previously considered to be part of Scrophulariaceae. For China Phrymaceae now includesMimuluswith five species (four endemic), which has already been treated for theFlora of Chinain Scrophulariaceae (D. Y. Hong & N. H. Holmgren, Fl. China 18: 40-41. 1998), andPhrymawith a single species. Two additional genera from Scrophulariaceae in China,MazusLoureiro andLanceaJ. D. Hooker & Thomson, were included in Phrymaceae by P. R. Beardsley and R. G. Olmstead (Amer. J. Bot. 89: 1093-1102. 2002), but we have excluded these two genera from Phrymaceae (see B. Oxelman et al., Taxon 54: 411-425. 2005; Z. Xia et al., Amer. J.
