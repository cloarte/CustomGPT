 Reproduccion: X. diversicaudatum has six stages: the egg, four juvenile stages and the adult. The female deposits eggs in the soil and hatching occurs when development of the first juvenile stage is complete.

In southeastern England X. diversicaudatum was considered to take 2 years to develop from egg to adult and the adult to have a life-span of 3-5 years ( Flegg, 1968 ). However, under temperate conditions this species probably completes its life-cycle within the growing season.Under laboratory conditions at 18°C, with strawberry as the host, X. diversicaudatum females survived for ca 60 weeks. The nematodes had a reproductive span of 54 weeks and produced ca 180-200 progeny, which was equivalent to one egg every 21 day degrees above a threshold temperature of 5°C. Development from egg to adult took ca 12 weeks, being equivalent to 1092 day degrees above 5°C ( Brown and Coiro, 1983 ).In a comprehensive survey of the geographical distribution of longidorid nematodes in the British Isles, Taylor and Brown (1976) reported X. diversicaudatum to be associated with soils with an average sand particle fraction of 53%. Similarly, in Spain the species was associated with sandy soils ( Arias et al., 1986 ). In Switzerland, X. diversicaudatum was found associated with soils derived from siliceous rock and not in soils originating from calcareous rock (Klingler et al., 1983). Distribution of X. diversicaudatum in the soil profile is associated with that of the host plant species with soil depth apparently having little effect on the nematodes life-cycle or the proportion of life-stages ( Flegg, 1968 ). In England, X. diversicaudatum occurs to a depth of 60-100 cm, but numbers decrease below a depth of ca 20 cm ( Harrison and Winslow, 1961 ; Flegg, 1968 ; Taylor and Thomas, 1968 ).

At two sites in southern England and eastern Scotland, in undisturbed soil and at a cultivated site, respectively, the horizontal distribution of X. diversicaudatum remained largely unchanged for 30 and 24 years, respectively. At both sites the populations levels of the nematode had significantly reduced during these periods, probably as a result of climatic conditions providing drier habitats ( Taylor et al., 1994 ). X. diversicaudatum frequently occurs in association with other longidorid species and in Britain was positively associated with Longidorus caespiticola, especially in Wales ( Taylor and Brown, 1976 ). Feeding by X. diversicaudatum, when the nematode occurs in large numbers, can cause direct damage to crop plant species. However, the economic impact of the nematode results from it being the natural vector of a range of serological and symptomatological variants of arabis mosaic (ArMV) and strawberry latent ringspot (SLRSV) nepoviruses which cause diseases in a wide range of crops. These viruses affect a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops and recently in the Fribourg region of Switzerland a variant of ArMV, naturally transmitted by X. diversicaudatum was identified causing a yellowing disease of barley cv. Express ( Ramel et al., 1995 ). This is the first record of a nepovirus causing a disease in a graminaceous crop.

In southeastern England X. diversicaudatum was considered to take 2 years to develop from egg to adult and the adult to have a life-span of 3-5 years ( Flegg, 1968 ). However, under temperate conditions this species probably completes its life-cycle within the growing season.Under laboratory conditions at 18°C, with strawberry as the host, X. diversicaudatum females survived for ca 60 weeks. The nematodes had a reproductive span of 54 weeks and produced ca 180-200 progeny, which was equivalent to one egg every 21 day degrees above a threshold temperature of 5°C. Development from egg to adult took ca 12 weeks, being equivalent to 1092 day degrees above 5°C ( Brown and Coiro, 1983 ).In a comprehensive survey of the geographical distribution of longidorid nematodes in the British Isles, Taylor and Brown (1976) reported X. diversicaudatum to be associated with soils with an average sand particle fraction of 53%. Similarly, in Spain the species was associated with sandy soils ( Arias et al., 1986 ). In Switzerland, X. diversicaudatum was found associated with soils derived from siliceous rock and not in soils originating from calcareous rock (Klingler et al., 1983). Distribution of X. diversicaudatum in the soil profile is associated with that of the host plant species with soil depth apparently having little effect on the nematodes life-cycle or the proportion of life-stages ( Flegg, 1968 ). In England, X. diversicaudatum occurs to a depth of 60-100 cm, but numbers decrease below a depth of ca 20 cm ( Harrison and Winslow, 1961 ; Flegg, 1968 ; Taylor and Thomas, 1968 ).

In England, X. diversicaudatum occurs to a depth of 60-100 cm, but numbers decrease below a depth of ca 20 cm ( Harrison and Winslow, 1961 ; Flegg, 1968 ; Taylor and Thomas, 1968 ). At two sites in southern England and eastern Scotland, in undisturbed soil and at a cultivated site, respectively, the horizontal distribution of X. diversicaudatum remained largely unchanged for 30 and 24 years, respectively. At both sites the populations levels of the nematode had significantly reduced during these periods, probably as a result of climatic conditions providing drier habitats ( Taylor et al., 1994 ). X. diversicaudatum frequently occurs in association with other longidorid species and in Britain was positively associated with Longidorus caespiticola, especially in Wales ( Taylor and Brown, 1976 ). Feeding by X. diversicaudatum, when the nematode occurs in large numbers, can cause direct damage to crop plant species. However, the economic impact of the nematode results from it being the natural vector of a range of serological and symptomatological variants of arabis mosaic (ArMV) and strawberry latent ringspot (SLRSV) nepoviruses which cause diseases in a wide range of crops. These viruses affect a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops and recently in the Fribourg region of Switzerland a variant of ArMV, naturally transmitted by X. diversicaudatum was identified causing a yellowing disease of barley cv. Express ( Ramel et al., 1995 ). This is the first record of a nepovirus causing a disease in a graminaceous crop.
 Sintomas: Feeding by X. diversicaudatum causes characteristic root-tip galling which can result in dwarfing of the whole plant. This reduction in growth can reduce plant crop yield. Indirect damage can result from the nem

 Sintomas: Feeding by X. diversicaudatum causes characteristic root-tip galling which can result in dwarfing of the whole plant. This reduction in growth can reduce plant crop yield. Indirect damage can result from the nematodes ability to transmit arabis mosaic (ArMV) and strawberry latent ringspot nepoviruses (SLRSV) ( Pitcher et al., 1974 ; Taylor and Brown, 1997 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology X. diversicaudatum has six stages: the egg, four juvenile stages and the adult. The female deposits eggs in the soil and hatching occurs when development of the first juvenile stage is complete. The juveniles are separated by a moult in which the cuticle separates from the underlying hypodermis (apolysis), the new cuticle is formed, and the old cuticle is shed (ecdysis), including the lining of the oesophagus together with the odontostyle. The juvenile stages can be distinguished by measurement of the functional odontostyle and the replacement odontostyle which is located in the oesophagus. The first stage juvenile is readily distinguished by the position of the replacement odontostyle which lies within the odontophore, with its anterior tip just posterior to the base of the functional odontostyle. The length of the replacement odontostyle is similar to that of the functional odontostyle of the subsequent life-stage. In southeastern England X. diversicaudatum was considered to take 2 years to develop from egg to adult and the adult to have a life-span of 3-5 years ( Flegg, 1968 ).
