 Invasion: E. dulcis is an aquatic, perennial sedge which grows to a height of 1.5 m. The leafless stems are round, smooth, 2-10 mm thick and transversely septate. Tubers are often formed at the ends of the stolons (Pancho and Soerjani, 1978). The single spikelet is cylindrical, broader than the stem, and several-to-many flowered. The glumes are spirally arranged; hypogynous bristles or scales are often present. E. dulcis propagates vegetatively by rhizome, tuber and seed.This leafless plant is also known as a spikerush; dense populations of E. dulcis look like green spikes.A perennial, rhizomatous, semiaquatic herb, often grown as an annual crop. Rhizome short with elongated stolons, each one often terminating in a zoned, depressed globose, brownish to blackish corm, 1-4 cm in diameter. Stem erect, terete, tufted, 40-200 cm tall, 3-10 mm in diameter, longitudinally striate, distinctly transversely septate, the intersepta 5-12 mm long, hollow, smooth, greyish to glossy dark green. Leaves reduced to some bladeless basal sheaths, 3-20 cm long, membr

 in diameter. Stem erect, terete, tufted, 40-200 cm tall, 3-10 mm in diameter, longitudinally striate, distinctly transversely septate, the intersepta 5-12 mm long, hollow, smooth, greyish to glossy dark green. Leaves reduced to some bladeless basal sheaths, 3-20 cm long, membranous, oblique or truncate at the apex, reddish brown to purple. Inflorescence a single, terminal, many-flowered spikelet, cylindrical, 1.5-6.0 x 3-6 mm, as thick as or somewhat thicker than the stem, apex obtuse to acute; glumes numerous, oblong, 4.0-6.5 x 1.7-3.2 mm, densely imbricate; flowers bisexual, with perianth of 6-8, filiform, unequal, white to brown bristles; stamens 3, anthers linear, 2-3 mm long; style 7-8 mm long, 2-3-fid, the enlarged base persistent in fruit. Fruit an obovoid nut (achene), 1.5-2.2 x 1.2-1.8 mm, shiny yellow to brown.

 Habitat: , 
 Reproduccion: Growth and DevelopmentAbout 6-8 weeks after corms have been planted they develop short subterranean rhizomes which start producing a number of daughter plants close to the mother stem, resulting in a clump. Because the plant does not develop normal leaves, the photosynthetic activity takes place in the numerous stems. When stems protrude about 15 cm above the surface of the water, they start forming inflorescences at their tips. Shortly after flowering, plants start producing corms at the end of about 12.5-cm-long stol

When stems protrude about 15 cm above the surface of the water, they start forming inflorescences at their tips. Shortly after flowering, plants start producing corms at the end of about 12.5-cm-long stolons which grow downwards into the mud at an angle of 45° to the surface of the mud. About 7-8 months after planting, the new corms are mature and the stems turn brown and eventually die.Other Botanical InformationE. dulcis is extremely polymorphic, widely distributed and also extensively cultivated. The wild forms usually produce only very small, almost black corms up to 1 cm in diameter. The cultivated forms have more robust stems and larger, sweeter, purplish to brownish corms, up to 4 cm in diameter and about 2.5 cm long.EcologyChinese water chestnut occurs in open places both in salt or brackish and in fresh water swamps, often forming pure stands surrounding the open water, from sea-level up to 1350 m altitude and as far as 40°N latitude in China. A long, warm growing season with at least 220 frost-free days is needed for crop growth. Corms will only sprout at soil temperatures above 14°C. The field should be kept inundated for at least 6 months. Preferred soils are rich clay or muck soils with a pH of 6.9-7.3. Chinese water chestnut can be grown successfully in slightly more acid soils provided that these are limed.E. dulcis is considered a dominant weed in the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia, growing well in black water rivers and marshes, water bodies which are generally acidic in nature ( Mansor and Ahmad, 1986 ).In Malaysia, populations of E

It grows in open reed swamps, black water rivers, on the shores of lakes and in irrigation canals; it sometimes grows well in brackish swamps.
