2020  Summary  of  West  Nile  Virus   
Equine  Cases  in  the  United  States  
This report is a descriptive summary of U.S. equine West Nile virus (WNV) cases reported to the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2020. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) branch collaborates with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) and State veterinary and public health officials to facilitate communication about 
arbovirus disease cases in horses and confirm equine cases in each State. CDC collects arbovirus case 
information using its ArboNET reporting system, an electronic surveillance and reporting system for 
tracking and reporting arboviral activity in humans and animals. During the transmission season, VS 
disseminates the equine case information to State animal health officials for confirmation and posts the 
number of confirmed cases to the USDA WNV information web site 
(https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine). This 
site also provides specific case definitions. In this document, ‘reported cases’ of WNV may include 
presumptive positive and confirmed positive cases. 
In 2020, 71 equine cases of WNV were reported from 19 States. Figure 1 shows the annual number of 
equine WNV cases reported in the United States from 2007 through 2020. Figure 2 shows the number of 
equine WNV cases in each State in 2020, and Table 1 provides the number of cases per county or parish 
in those States in 2020.

Total Reported West Nile Virus Equine Cases for the United States 71 
WNV can be a deadly disease in equids, with mortality occurring in roughly 33 percent of all infected 
animals. Furthermore, up to 40 percent of affected equids may still exhibit neurological signs as long as 
6 months after diagnosis.1 This susceptibility to the virus makes equids a recognized WNV sentinel 
species for the human population.
