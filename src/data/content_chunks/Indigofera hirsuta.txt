 Invasion: An erect or spreading annual, up to 1 .5 m tall but generally shorter. Stems cylindrical or slightly ridged, densely clothed with long, fine, spreading, grey or reddish-brown pubescence. Stipules linear, setaceous, up to 1 cm long. Five to seven leaflets, occasionally nine, elliptical-oblong, up to 40 mm long and 25 mm wide, the terminal one rather longer than the lateral, pilose on both surfaces. Inflorescence a dense, many-flowered raceme, hirsute, 20 to 30 cm long, including a peduncle more than 25 mm long. Bracts linear-lanceolate, up to 25 mm long. Pedicels around 1 mm long, reflexed in fruit. Calyx stiff, brown and hirsute, about 4 mm long, divided almost to the base into linear, setaceous lobes. Corolla white pubescent outside, brick-red or rose inside. Pods straight, rather tetragonal, with well-developed sutures, 12 to 20 mm long about 2 mm wide, thickly hirsute; many of the hairs, especially the dorsal ones, usually brown. Six to nine seeds, cuboid, angular, strongly pitted (FAO, 2013). In China, flowers July-September and fruits between October and December (eFloras, 2013).

In Sri Lanka, I. hirsuta flowers and fruits from September to February and in the United States it flowers late in the growing season, producing a good green manure or forage crop before seed maturation ( Djarwaningsih, 1997 ). Pollination is by insects ( Duke, 1981 ). I. hirsuta is capable of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with cowpea-type rhizobia ( Djarwaningsih, 1997 ).

In Florida, it has been estimated that the presence of I. hirsuta in mixtures is the equivalent to applying 126 kg per hectare of nitrogen per year on pure grass pastures ( FAO, 2013 ). I. hirsuta occurs as a weed in cultivated and waste areas, in grassland, savanna, dry and deciduous forest, on river banks and beaches, between altitudes of 0-1500 m ( PIER, 2013 ). In Africa, the species is grown at altitudes between sea level and 1350 m ( FAO 2013 ); in China and Taiwan, altitudes below 100 m ( PIER, 2013 ); and in Madagascar, up to 900 m ( Puy et al., 2002 ). It does not tolerate frost or waterlogging. A dry season stimulates flowering and seed production. Although generally fairly tolerant to shade, growth under heavy shade in an established stand of pine trees in Costa Rica was poor. The species is economically adaptable to poor sandy loamy soil conditions within a pH of 5.0-8.0, thus being useful for soil improvement. It requires, however, moderately to well-drained soils, and is best adapted to mildly acidic soils and fertile sandy loams with little lime ( Duke, 1981 ; Djarwaningsih, 1997 ; FAO 2013 ). In terms of nutrient requirements, “being well-adapted to low-fertility soils, I. hirsuta has not shown major responses to applied fertilizer. In Panama, Silvey and Carlisle (1972) obtained no dry-matter-yield response to the application of up to 30 kg/ha Zn or up to 100 kg/ha P, although forage content of both elements was increased.
