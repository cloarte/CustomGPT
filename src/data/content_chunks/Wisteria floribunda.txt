Overview
Appearance
Wisteria floribunda
is a deciduous, woody vine capable of growing to a height of 35 ft. (10.7 m). Stems can be up to 10 in. (25.4 cm) in diameter, with smooth, light gray to white bark. When looking down at the plant the vines twine around the host plant in a clockwise direction.
Foliage
Alternate, pinnately compound leaves (13-19 leaflets) are tapered at the tip with wavy edges. Leaves are up to 12 in. (30 cm) in length.
Flowers
Lavender, pink or white flowers are fragrant, very showy and abundant and occur in dangling clusters in the spring. Flowers clusters are 9-20 in. (22.9-50.8 cm) long.
Fruit
Seeds are contained within brown, hairy, flattened, bean-like pods. Although seeds are viable, vegetative growth is the primary method of spread for this invasive.
Ecological Threat
Invasions often occur around previous plantings.
Wisteria floribunda
can displace native vegetation and kill trees and shrubs by girdling them. The vine has the ability to change the structure of a forest by killing trees and altering the light availability to the forest floor. A native of Japan, it was first introduced into North America around 1830 for ornamental purposes.
