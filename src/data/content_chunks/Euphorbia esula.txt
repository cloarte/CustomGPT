 Invasion: Leafy spurge is a deep-rooted perennial plant. It grows as clusters with upright stems, 0.3 to 0.9 m tall. Stems originate from underground adventitious buds on the crown and root and begin to grow in early spring conditions (see Pictures). Mature leafy spurge plants have extensive root systems. The vertical roots extend a few metres into the soil and horizontal roots allow them to expand (Raju, 1985). The greenish-yellow inflorescences are borne in an umbel. Each umbel supports many cyathia of tiny, inconspicuous flowers, subtended by four crescent-shaped, nectar-secreting glands and two conspicuous, heart-shaped, greenish-yellow bracts (involucre). Each cyathium has one pistillate (female) and 10-20 staminate (male) flowers. The pistillate flower has three styles fused at the bases and branched at the tips and a 3-chambered ovary. The pistil grows downward by elongation

 conspicuous, heart-shaped, greenish-yellow bracts (involucre). Each cyathium has one pistillate (female) and 10-20 staminate (male) flowers. The pistillate flower has three styles fused at the bases and branched at the tips and a 3-chambered ovary. The pistil grows downward by elongation of the pedicel. No sepals (calyx) and petals (corolla) are present in leafy spurge. The pistillate flowers develop before the staminate flowers, minimizing self pollination (Messersmith, 1983;Selleck et al., 1962) (see Pictures). Seeds are produced continuously after a month of flowering and until the autumn. These seeds are produced in one- to three-lobed capsules and are about 0.25 cm in diameter. They are silvery-grey to grey and have a yellow protrusion at the narrow end. During development, seeds change colour from yellow through orange to brown and finally to grey at maturity (Wick and Lyle, 1964). Leaves are bluish-green, hairless, stalkless, narrow and 5-8 cm in length. They are usually alternate on the stem and are linear to oblong. Leafy spurge produces a milky-white latex when injured which seals wounds (Raju, 1985). This latex contains a toxic substance which inhibits cattle and horses from grazing live leafy spurge (Lym et al., 2000;IPMPA, 2003).

 Reproduccion: GeneticsThe genetics of leafy spurge is complicated and a high degree of genetic variability among North American leafy spurge populations has been reported ( Rowe et al., 1997 ). Leafy spurge has been studied by cytotaxonomic (or cytogenetic: study of shape, ploidy and chromosome number) and genotypic (study of variation at the genomic DNA level) approaches. Cytotaxonomic approaches have been used to determine Euphorbia species; however, since introgressive hybridization (intercross and backcross) occurs frequently among Euphorbia species (i.e., E. pseudovirgata, E. cyparissias and E. virgata), cytotaxonomic approaches are limited for species determination. At present, three basic chromosome numbers (x = 8, 9, 10) of leafy spurge have been reported in the literature, and the chromosome number of 2n = 60, a hexaploid, is most prevalent in nature ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1987 ; Stahevitch et al., 1988 ). On the basis of cytotaxonomic analysis, the chromosome of leafy spurge has revealed a high degree of instability (mosaicism); chromosome number varies from 2n = 48 to 2n = 60 ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1987 ). Composite idiograms of E. esula (2n = 6x = 60) imply the occurrence of segmental allopolyploidy (comp

otaxonomic analysis, the chromosome of leafy spurge has revealed a high degree of instability (mosaicism); chromosome number varies from 2n = 48 to 2n = 60 ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1987 ). Composite idiograms of E. esula (2n = 6x = 60) imply the occurrence of segmental allopolyploidy (composed of partially homologous chromosome sets from closely related species) ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1989 ). Both results reflect that introgressive hybridization is a common phenomenon among Euphorbia species.A genotypic approach is used to identify genotypes among Euphorbia species. The identification of plant genotypes is important for biological control because the establishment of biological control agents is often linked to plant genotype. It is known that variability in the establishment of biological control agents is associated with differences in the genotypes of host species (Lym and Carlson, 2002). Two methods, chloroplast DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (cpDNA RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), are commonly used for genotypic identification of leafy spurge ( Nissen et al., 1995 ; Rowe et al., 1997 ). Genotypic analysis has found that North American leafy spurge has a high degree of genetic variability, suggesting possible multiple introductions or high levels of variation in the native range ( Rowe et al., 1997 ).Physiology and PhenologyPhysiologyLeafy spurge reproduces by seeds and underground adventitious buds (root and crown buds). Population expansion was thought to occur mostly from underground vegetative buds. However, recent analysis suggests that a high degree of genetic variability exists in isolated stands or patches of leafy spurge indicating that seed reproduction may be a significant mechanism for expansion (D Horvath, USDA/ARS, Fargo, ND, USA, personal communication, 2003).

However, recent analysis suggests that a high degree of genetic variability exists in isolated stands or patches of leafy spurge indicating that seed reproduction may be a significant mechanism for expansion (D Horvath, USDA/ARS, Fargo, ND, USA, personal communication, 2003). Under normal growing conditions, root buds develop but are maintained in a quiescent state by the aerial portion of the plant. These buds develop into new shoots when the shoot is killed or separated from the roots. Two types of inhibition were observed during bud dormancy in leafy spurge: innate and correlative inhibition. Innate inhibition is normally associated with post-senescence and flowering. JV Anderson (USDA/ARS, Fargo, ND, USA, personal communication, 2003) has observed that in the late autumn or early winter, both root and crown buds enlarge and develop deep innate dormancy. Chilling breaks this inhibition status ( Nissen and Foley, 1987a ; Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ; Chao et al., 2001 ). Correlative inhibition, on the other hand, occurs mostly during the growing season, where inhibition is under the control of signals produced by the aerial portion of the plant. Two separate signals, one from the mature leaves and one from the meristems (apical or axillary buds), result in correlative inhibition. Horvath (1999) demonstrated that the presence of either leaves or growing axillary buds was sufficient to inhibit root bud growth. However, the leaf-derived signal required photosynthesis for its production or transport, whereas no photosynthesis was required for the signal from growing axillary buds. Current results suggest that the leaf-derived signal acts through gibberellic acid (GA) and is responsible for inhibiting the G1/S-phase transition, and the meristem-derived signal is responsible for the inhibition of cell division post S-

derived signal required photosynthesis for its production or transport, whereas no photosynthesis was required for the signal from growing axillary buds. Current results suggest that the leaf-derived signal acts through gibberellic acid (GA) and is responsible for inhibiting the G1/S-phase transition, and the meristem-derived signal is responsible for the inhibition of cell division post S-phase ( Chao et al., 2001 ; Horvath et al., 2002; Horvath and Anderson, 2002 ).Other factors such as nutrients, water status, light, temperature, phytohormones and carbohydrates affect leafy spurge development and/or survival ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; McIntyre, 1972 , 1979; McIntyre and Raju, 1967 ; Morrow, 1979 ; Nissen and Foley, 1987a , b; Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ; Cyr and Bewley, 1989 , 1990; Chao et al., 2001 ). Nitrogen appears to be important in the development and growth of leafy spurge. The number of root buds increased at high nitrogen levels (105 p.p.m.). Under deficient nitrogen levels (2.1 p.p.m.), the outgrowth of lateral buds was completely suppressed ( McIntyre and Raju, 1967 ). Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves stored in the roots appear to provide a source for long-term survival. Total sugars, total readily available carbohydrates, and total nitrate decline sharply in roots from late April through early May ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). The total available carbohydrates reached the lowest level in mid-May when plants began to bloom, followed by a short period of rapid storage and finally, a moderate rate of build-up until the end of the growing season. As the temperature dropped in the autumn, the percentage of true starch declined and sugars (mainly sucrose) increased in the roots ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). Total organic nitrogen in the roots

 the lowest level in mid-May when plants began to bloom, followed by a short period of rapid storage and finally, a moderate rate of build-up until the end of the growing season. As the temperature dropped in the autumn, the percentage of true starch declined and sugars (mainly sucrose) increased in the roots ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). Total organic nitrogen in the roots declined from early spring to August then increased. Free amino acids and soluble proteins are also reported to show an increased accumulation in roots of leafy spurge during the onset of autumn and winter ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 , 1990). However, unlike starch and soluble carbohydrates, soluble protein, free amino acids and nitrate reserves in the roots of leafy spurge were reduced in decapitated or defoliated plants ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990 ). Higher internal water levels enhance root bud growth. McIntyre (1979) showed that the water content of the root buds increased by 25% within 24 hours of shoot removal, promoting the growth of root buds. Increasing the humidity from 50 to 95% increased the rate of emergence and elongation of root buds after stem removal ( McIntyre, 1979 ). Different phytohormones act differently on root bud growth. GA can promote root bud growth and reverse the status of correlative inhibition in leafy spurge root buds. In contrast, abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin and sugar (glucose and sucrose) can inhibit root bud growth. Sugar and GA were functionally antagonistic since GA has been shown to overcome the inhibitory effect imposed by glucose and sucrose ( Chao et al., 2001 ). The importance of light and temperature has also been documented. For example, the percentage of flowering shoots decreases under limiting light ( Selleck et al., 1962 ) and plant height increases progressively upon increasing soil temperature ( Morrow, 1979 ).PhenologyLeafy spurge is one of the first plants to

For example, the percentage of flowering shoots decreases under limiting light ( Selleck et al., 1962 ) and plant height increases progressively upon increasing soil temperature ( Morrow, 1979 ).PhenologyLeafy spurge is one of the first plants to emerge in the spring. It emerges during March in Iowa and Wisconsin, in late March to early April in North Dakota, and late April in Saskatchewan ( Hanson and Rudd, 1933 ; Bakke, 1936 ; Selleck et al., 1962 ; Anderson, 1999 ). Shoots originate from crown tissue around the soil surface and from intermittent buds along the root system. Bud sprouting declines in mid-summer during pollen production ( Best et al., 1980 ; Messersmith, 1983 ; Lym, 1991 ). The plant usually ceases growing during the hot and dry summer months. Stems from seedlings or small root segments generally do not flower in the first year.Flowering occurs primarily in May but continues through autumn. Bracts are seen about 2 weeks before the emergence of flowers and give leafy spurge the appearance of blooming ( Lym, 1998 ). Each flowering shoot produces more than 150 to 200 seeds. The seeds can be propelled 4.6 or more metres when the mature capsule dehisces. The seeds germinate in spring and continuously throughout the growing season; however, the peak period of germination is late May and early June. Normally, 99% of the seeds will germinate within 2 years, but some are viable for up to 8 years in soil ( Bowes and Thomas, 1978 ; Cole, 1991 ). The optimal temperature for germination fluctuates between 20 and 30°C. Seedling emergence is optimal at depths of 1.5-5 cm. Young seedlings develop an extensive root system in a short time.

 seeds will germinate within 2 years, but some are viable for up to 8 years in soil ( Bowes and Thomas, 1978 ; Cole, 1991 ). The optimal temperature for germination fluctuates between 20 and 30°C. Seedling emergence is optimal at depths of 1.5-5 cm. Young seedlings develop an extensive root system in a short time. All seedlings become perennial by the time they reach the 10-leaf stage, but on some occasions they are able to reproduce vegetatively from buds within 7 days of germinating ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Lym, 1991 ). Leafy spurge has vigorous, rhizome-like, long horizontal roots, short horizontal feeder roots, and short and long vertical roots. The vertical roots can grow as deep as 4.6 m ( Bakke, 1936 ). The roots serve as a nutrient reserve capable of sustaining the plant for years. Vegetative buds are formed on the crown or anywhere along the length of the root. These buds produce shoots in the spring and form new roots for the lateral spread of an infestation. Root fragments are also capable of regenerating new shoots. Partial injury to root systems, stems or foliage induces bud growth and spread of the plant ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Messersmith, 1983 ; Wolters et al., 1994 ). Reproductive BiologyReproduction occurs by both vegetative re-growth from underground adventitious buds located on the crowns and spreading roots and by the production of large quantities of seeds. For seed reproduction, insects usually carry out flower pollination. The pollen is most viable approximately 24 hours after emergence of the male flower ( Selleck et al., 1962 ). The female is most receptive to pollen when the stigma opens while the pistil has not inverted. As female flowers develop before male flowers, leafy spurge has a preference for cross-pollination. The fruit develops from a three-celled ovary. Seeds

 flower pollination. The pollen is most viable approximately 24 hours after emergence of the male flower ( Selleck et al., 1962 ). The female is most receptive to pollen when the stigma opens while the pistil has not inverted. As female flowers develop before male flowers, leafy spurge has a preference for cross-pollination. The fruit develops from a three-celled ovary. Seeds grow inside a three-valved capsule and ripen from early July till late autumn. When ripe, the capsule dehisces, shooting seeds up to 4.6 m for distribution. Fresh seed is generally 60 to 80% viable. Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting seed germination. Alternating temperatures of 20 to 30°C produces the highest germination rate (84%) ( Hanson and Rudd, 1933 ). Light and water are other environmental factors affecting leafy spurge seed germination. Light impedes germination whereas water contributes to rapid germination ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). The testa (seed coat) of germinable seeds breaks between 12 and 24 hours after imbibition and the radicle can emerge as early as 12 hours ( Selleck et al., 1962 ). Root hairs develop 12-24 hours after the radicle has reached 1 cm. The hypocotyl arises within 12 hours after the appearance of the root hairs. Vegetative buds are visible 10-12 days after seedling emergence from the soil surface ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Seedlings do not usually flower in the first year ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Morrow, 1979 ).Vegetative reproduction of leafy spurge occurs from underground adventitious buds on the crown and root tissue (crown and root buds). These buds develop into new shoots when the aerial portion of the plant is removed. Visible buds are present all year around. However, during flowering, new buds are emerging while old buds are deteriorating; the underground vegetative buds are tiny but

These buds develop into new shoots when the aerial portion of the plant is removed. Visible buds are present all year around. However, during flowering, new buds are emerging while old buds are deteriorating; the underground vegetative buds are tiny but discernible. Throughout the growing season, new buds enlarge and elongate (see Pictures). Some buds can become many centimetres long during the autumn but fail to develop/differentiate into new shoots due to correlative inhibition and cold temperatures ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Messersmith et al., 1985 ; Raju, 1985 ). Environmental RequirementsLeafy spurge grows in diverse environments from dry to sub-humid and from subtropic to subartic, but most commonly under conditions of a well-balanced water supply ( Lym, 1998 ). It establishes more readily in disturbed soil, and is primarily found in untilled, non-cropland habitats such as abandoned cropland, pastures, rangeland, woodland, roadsides and waste areas. It can also establish in an undisturbed, pristine plant community ( Derscheid et al., 1985 ; Dunn, 1985 ; Watson, 1985). Although leafy spurge grows most commonly on coarse-textured soils ( Selleck et al., 1962 ), it tolerates a wide range of soils including a coarse-textured group of light loam to sand, the intermediate group of loam to clay loam, and the clay to heavy clay soils. However, seed germination and seedling establishment appears to be more suited to fine-textured soils ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Generally, leafy spurge requires a cold acclimation period to break autumn-induced (post-senescent) innate dormancy in vegetative buds ( Harvey and Nowiers

Generally, leafy spurge requires a cold acclimation period to break autumn-induced (post-senescent) innate dormancy in vegetative buds ( Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ) and to assist in flowering.AssociationsMany insects are identified as natural enemies of leafy spurge; for further information, see section on Biological Control.

The optimal temperature for germination fluctuates between 20 and 30°C. Seedling emergence is optimal at depths of 1.5-5 cm. Young seedlings develop an extensive root system in a short time. All seedlings become perennial by the time they reach the 10-leaf stage, but on some occasions they are able to reproduce vegetatively from buds within 7 days of germinating ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Lym, 1991 ). Leafy spurge has vigorous, rhizome-like, long horizontal roots, short horizontal feeder roots, and short and long vertical roots. The vertical roots can grow as deep as 4.6 m ( Bakke, 1936 ). The roots serve as a nutrient reserve capable of sustaining the plant for years. Vegetative buds are formed on the crown or anywhere along the length of the root. These buds produce shoots in the spring and form new roots for the lateral spread of an infestation. Root fragments are also capable of regenerating new shoots. Partial injury to root systems, stems or foliage induces bud growth and spread of the plant ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Messersmith, 1983 ; Wolters et al., 1994 ). Reproductive BiologyReproduction occurs by both vegetative re-growth from underground adventitious buds located on the crowns and spreading roots and by the production of large quantities of seeds.

Reproductive BiologyReproduction occurs by both vegetative re-growth from underground adventitious buds located on the crowns and spreading roots and by the production of large quantities of seeds. For seed reproduction, insects usually carry out flower pollination. The pollen is most viable approximately 24 hours after emergence of the male flower ( Selleck et al., 1962 ). The female is most receptive to pollen when the stigma opens while the pistil has not inverted. As female flowers develop before male flowers, leafy spurge has a preference for cross-pollination. The fruit develops from a three-celled ovary. Seeds grow inside a three-valved capsule and ripen from early July till late autumn. When ripe, the capsule dehisces, shooting seeds up to 4.6 m for distribution. Fresh seed is generally 60 to 80% viable. Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting seed germination. Alternating temperatures of 20 to 30°C produces the highest germination rate (84%) ( Hanson and Rudd, 1933 ). Light and water are other environmental factors affecting leafy spurge seed germination. Light impedes germination whereas water contributes to rapid germination ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). The testa (seed coat) of germinable seeds breaks between 12 and 24 hours after imbibition and the radicle can emerge as early as 12 hours ( Selleck et al., 1962 ). Root hairs develop 12-24 hours after the radicle has reached 1 cm. The hypocotyl arises within 12 hours after the appearance of the root hairs. Vegetative buds are visible 10-12 days after seedling emergence from the soil surface ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Seedlings do not usually flower in the first year ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Morrow, 1979 ).Ve

Vegetative buds are visible 10-12 days after seedling emergence from the soil surface ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Seedlings do not usually flower in the first year ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Morrow, 1979 ).Vegetative reproduction of leafy spurge occurs from underground adventitious buds on the crown and root tissue (crown and root buds). These buds develop into new shoots when the aerial portion of the plant is removed. Visible buds are present all year around. However, during flowering, new buds are emerging while old buds are deteriorating; the underground vegetative buds are tiny but discernible. Throughout the growing season, new buds enlarge and elongate (see Pictures). Some buds can become many centimetres long during the autumn but fail to develop/differentiate into new shoots due to correlative inhibition and cold temperatures ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Messersmith et al., 1985 ; Raju, 1985 ). Environmental RequirementsLeafy spurge grows in diverse environments from dry to sub-humid and from subtropic to subartic, but most commonly under conditions of a well-balanced water supply ( Lym, 1998 ). It establishes more readily in disturbed soil, and is primarily found in untilled, non-cropland habitats such as abandoned cropland, pastures, rangeland, woodland, roadsides and waste areas. It can also establish in an undisturbed, pristine plant community ( Derscheid et al., 1985 ; Dunn, 1985 ; Watson, 1985).

However, seed germination and seedling establishment appears to be more suited to fine-textured soils ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Generally, leafy spurge requires a cold acclimation period to break autumn-induced (post-senescent) innate dormancy in vegetative buds ( Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ) and to assist in flowering.AssociationsMany insects are identified as natural enemies of leafy spurge; for further information, see section on Biological Control.

 Invasion: Leafy spurge is a deep-rooted perennial plant. It grows as clusters with upright stems, 0.3 to 0.9 m tall. Stems originate from underground adventitious buds on the crown and root and begin to grow in early spring conditions (see Pictures). Mature leafy spurge plants have extensive root systems. The vertical roots extend a few metres into the soil and horizontal roots allow them to expand (Raju, 1985). The greenish-yellow inflorescences are borne in an umbel. Each umbel supports many cyathia of tiny, inconspicuous flowers, subtended by four crescent-shaped, nectar-secreting glands and two conspicuous, heart-shaped, greenish-yellow bracts (involucre). Each cyathium has one pistillate (female) and 10-20 staminate (male) flowers. The pistillate flower has three styles fused at the bases and branched at the tips and a 3-chambered ovary. The pistil grows downward by elongation

 conspicuous, heart-shaped, greenish-yellow bracts (involucre). Each cyathium has one pistillate (female) and 10-20 staminate (male) flowers. The pistillate flower has three styles fused at the bases and branched at the tips and a 3-chambered ovary. The pistil grows downward by elongation of the pedicel. No sepals (calyx) and petals (corolla) are present in leafy spurge. The pistillate flowers develop before the staminate flowers, minimizing self pollination (Messersmith, 1983;Selleck et al., 1962) (see Pictures). Seeds are produced continuously after a month of flowering and until the autumn. These seeds are produced in one- to three-lobed capsules and are about 0.25 cm in diameter. They are silvery-grey to grey and have a yellow protrusion at the narrow end. During development, seeds change colour from yellow through orange to brown and finally to grey at maturity (Wick and Lyle, 1964). Leaves are bluish-green, hairless, stalkless, narrow and 5-8 cm in length. They are usually alternate on the stem and are linear to oblong. Leafy spurge produces a milky-white latex when injured which seals wounds (Raju, 1985). This latex contains a toxic substance which inhibits cattle and horses from grazing live leafy spurge (Lym et al., 2000;IPMPA, 2003).

 Reproduccion: GeneticsThe genetics of leafy spurge is complicated and a high degree of genetic variability among North American leafy spurge populations has been reported ( Rowe et al., 1997 ). Leafy spurge has been studied by cytotaxonomic (or cytogenetic: study of shape, ploidy and chromosome number) and genotypic (study of variation at the genomic DNA level) approaches. Cytotaxonomic approaches have been used to determine Euphorbia species; however, since introgressive hybridization (intercross and backcross) occurs frequently among Euphorbia species (i.e., E. pseudovirgata, E. cyparissias and E. virgata), cytotaxonomic approaches are limited for species determination. At present, three basic chromosome numbers (x = 8, 9, 10) of leafy spurge have been reported in the literature, and the chromosome number of 2n = 60, a hexaploid, is most prevalent in nature ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1987 ; Stahevitch et al., 1988 ). On the basis of cytotaxonomic analysis, the chromosome of leafy spurge has revealed a high degree of instability (mosaicism); chromosome number varies from 2n = 48 to 2n = 60 ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1987 ). Composite idiograms of E. esula (2n = 6x = 60) imply the occurrence of segmental allopolyploidy (comp

otaxonomic analysis, the chromosome of leafy spurge has revealed a high degree of instability (mosaicism); chromosome number varies from 2n = 48 to 2n = 60 ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1987 ). Composite idiograms of E. esula (2n = 6x = 60) imply the occurrence of segmental allopolyploidy (composed of partially homologous chromosome sets from closely related species) ( Schulz-Schaeffer and Gerhardt, 1989 ). Both results reflect that introgressive hybridization is a common phenomenon among Euphorbia species.A genotypic approach is used to identify genotypes among Euphorbia species. The identification of plant genotypes is important for biological control because the establishment of biological control agents is often linked to plant genotype. It is known that variability in the establishment of biological control agents is associated with differences in the genotypes of host species (Lym and Carlson, 2002). Two methods, chloroplast DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (cpDNA RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), are commonly used for genotypic identification of leafy spurge ( Nissen et al., 1995 ; Rowe et al., 1997 ). Genotypic analysis has found that North American leafy spurge has a high degree of genetic variability, suggesting possible multiple introductions or high levels of variation in the native range ( Rowe et al., 1997 ).Physiology and PhenologyPhysiologyLeafy spurge reproduces by seeds and underground adventitious buds (root and crown buds). Population expansion was thought to occur mostly from underground vegetative buds. However, recent analysis suggests that a high degree of genetic variability exists in isolated stands or patches of leafy spurge indicating that seed reproduction may be a significant mechanism for expansion (D Horvath, USDA/ARS, Fargo, ND, USA, personal communication, 2003).

However, recent analysis suggests that a high degree of genetic variability exists in isolated stands or patches of leafy spurge indicating that seed reproduction may be a significant mechanism for expansion (D Horvath, USDA/ARS, Fargo, ND, USA, personal communication, 2003). Under normal growing conditions, root buds develop but are maintained in a quiescent state by the aerial portion of the plant. These buds develop into new shoots when the shoot is killed or separated from the roots. Two types of inhibition were observed during bud dormancy in leafy spurge: innate and correlative inhibition. Innate inhibition is normally associated with post-senescence and flowering. JV Anderson (USDA/ARS, Fargo, ND, USA, personal communication, 2003) has observed that in the late autumn or early winter, both root and crown buds enlarge and develop deep innate dormancy. Chilling breaks this inhibition status ( Nissen and Foley, 1987a ; Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ; Chao et al., 2001 ). Correlative inhibition, on the other hand, occurs mostly during the growing season, where inhibition is under the control of signals produced by the aerial portion of the plant. Two separate signals, one from the mature leaves and one from the meristems (apical or axillary buds), result in correlative inhibition. Horvath (1999) demonstrated that the presence of either leaves or growing axillary buds was sufficient to inhibit root bud growth. However, the leaf-derived signal required photosynthesis for its production or transport, whereas no photosynthesis was required for the signal from growing axillary buds. Current results suggest that the leaf-derived signal acts through gibberellic acid (GA) and is responsible for inhibiting the G1/S-phase transition, and the meristem-derived signal is responsible for the inhibition of cell division post S-

derived signal required photosynthesis for its production or transport, whereas no photosynthesis was required for the signal from growing axillary buds. Current results suggest that the leaf-derived signal acts through gibberellic acid (GA) and is responsible for inhibiting the G1/S-phase transition, and the meristem-derived signal is responsible for the inhibition of cell division post S-phase ( Chao et al., 2001 ; Horvath et al., 2002; Horvath and Anderson, 2002 ).Other factors such as nutrients, water status, light, temperature, phytohormones and carbohydrates affect leafy spurge development and/or survival ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; McIntyre, 1972 , 1979; McIntyre and Raju, 1967 ; Morrow, 1979 ; Nissen and Foley, 1987a , b; Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ; Cyr and Bewley, 1989 , 1990; Chao et al., 2001 ). Nitrogen appears to be important in the development and growth of leafy spurge. The number of root buds increased at high nitrogen levels (105 p.p.m.). Under deficient nitrogen levels (2.1 p.p.m.), the outgrowth of lateral buds was completely suppressed ( McIntyre and Raju, 1967 ). Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves stored in the roots appear to provide a source for long-term survival. Total sugars, total readily available carbohydrates, and total nitrate decline sharply in roots from late April through early May ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). The total available carbohydrates reached the lowest level in mid-May when plants began to bloom, followed by a short period of rapid storage and finally, a moderate rate of build-up until the end of the growing season. As the temperature dropped in the autumn, the percentage of true starch declined and sugars (mainly sucrose) increased in the roots ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). Total organic nitrogen in the roots

 the lowest level in mid-May when plants began to bloom, followed by a short period of rapid storage and finally, a moderate rate of build-up until the end of the growing season. As the temperature dropped in the autumn, the percentage of true starch declined and sugars (mainly sucrose) increased in the roots ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). Total organic nitrogen in the roots declined from early spring to August then increased. Free amino acids and soluble proteins are also reported to show an increased accumulation in roots of leafy spurge during the onset of autumn and winter ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 , 1990). However, unlike starch and soluble carbohydrates, soluble protein, free amino acids and nitrate reserves in the roots of leafy spurge were reduced in decapitated or defoliated plants ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990 ). Higher internal water levels enhance root bud growth. McIntyre (1979) showed that the water content of the root buds increased by 25% within 24 hours of shoot removal, promoting the growth of root buds. Increasing the humidity from 50 to 95% increased the rate of emergence and elongation of root buds after stem removal ( McIntyre, 1979 ). Different phytohormones act differently on root bud growth. GA can promote root bud growth and reverse the status of correlative inhibition in leafy spurge root buds. In contrast, abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin and sugar (glucose and sucrose) can inhibit root bud growth. Sugar and GA were functionally antagonistic since GA has been shown to overcome the inhibitory effect imposed by glucose and sucrose ( Chao et al., 2001 ). The importance of light and temperature has also been documented. For example, the percentage of flowering shoots decreases under limiting light ( Selleck et al., 1962 ) and plant height increases progressively upon increasing soil temperature ( Morrow, 1979 ).PhenologyLeafy spurge is one of the first plants to

For example, the percentage of flowering shoots decreases under limiting light ( Selleck et al., 1962 ) and plant height increases progressively upon increasing soil temperature ( Morrow, 1979 ).PhenologyLeafy spurge is one of the first plants to emerge in the spring. It emerges during March in Iowa and Wisconsin, in late March to early April in North Dakota, and late April in Saskatchewan ( Hanson and Rudd, 1933 ; Bakke, 1936 ; Selleck et al., 1962 ; Anderson, 1999 ). Shoots originate from crown tissue around the soil surface and from intermittent buds along the root system. Bud sprouting declines in mid-summer during pollen production ( Best et al., 1980 ; Messersmith, 1983 ; Lym, 1991 ). The plant usually ceases growing during the hot and dry summer months. Stems from seedlings or small root segments generally do not flower in the first year.Flowering occurs primarily in May but continues through autumn. Bracts are seen about 2 weeks before the emergence of flowers and give leafy spurge the appearance of blooming ( Lym, 1998 ). Each flowering shoot produces more than 150 to 200 seeds. The seeds can be propelled 4.6 or more metres when the mature capsule dehisces. The seeds germinate in spring and continuously throughout the growing season; however, the peak period of germination is late May and early June. Normally, 99% of the seeds will germinate within 2 years, but some are viable for up to 8 years in soil ( Bowes and Thomas, 1978 ; Cole, 1991 ).

Horvath (1999) demonstrated that the presence of either leaves or growing axillary buds was sufficient to inhibit root bud growth. However, the leaf-derived signal required photosynthesis

 under the control of signals produced by the aerial portion of the plant. Two separate signals, one from the mature leaves and one from the meristems (apical or axillary buds), result in correlative inhibition. Horvath (1999) demonstrated that the presence of either leaves or growing axillary buds was sufficient to inhibit root bud growth. However, the leaf-derived signal required photosynthesis for its production or transport, whereas no photosynthesis was required for the signal from growing axillary buds. Current results suggest that the leaf-derived signal acts through gibberellic acid (GA) and is responsible for inhibiting the G1/S-phase transition, and the meristem-derived signal is responsible for the inhibition of cell division post S-phase ( Chao et al., 2001 ; Horvath et al., 2002; Horvath and Anderson, 2002 ).Other factors such as nutrients, water status, light, temperature, phytohormones and carbohydrates affect leafy spurge development and/or survival ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; McIntyre, 1972 , 1979; McIntyre and Raju, 1967 ; Morrow, 1979 ; Nissen and Foley, 1987a , b; Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ; Cyr and Bewley, 1989 , 1990; Chao et al., 2001 ). Nitrogen appears to be important in the development and growth of leafy spurge. The number of root buds increased at high nitrogen levels (105 p.p.m.). Under deficient nitrogen levels (2.1 p.p.m.), the outgrowth of lateral buds was completely suppressed ( McIntyre and Raju, 1967 ). Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves stored in the roots appear to provide a source for long-term survival. Total sugars, total readily available carbohydrates, and total nitrate decline sharply in roots from late April through early May ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). The total available carbohydrates reached the lowest level in mid

.), the outgrowth of lateral buds was completely suppressed ( McIntyre and Raju, 1967 ). Carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves stored in the roots appear to provide a source for long-term survival. Total sugars, total readily available carbohydrates, and total nitrate decline sharply in roots from late April through early May ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). The total available carbohydrates reached the lowest level in mid-May when plants began to bloom, followed by a short period of rapid storage and finally, a moderate rate of build-up until the end of the growing season. As the temperature dropped in the autumn, the percentage of true starch declined and sugars (mainly sucrose) increased in the roots ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 ). Total organic nitrogen in the roots declined from early spring to August then increased. Free amino acids and soluble proteins are also reported to show an increased accumulation in roots of leafy spurge during the onset of autumn and winter ( Cyr and Bewley, 1989 , 1990). However, unlike starch and soluble carbohydrates, soluble protein, free amino acids and nitrate reserves in the roots of leafy spurge were reduced in decapitated or defoliated plants ( Cyr and Bewley, 1990 ). Higher internal water levels enhance root bud growth. McIntyre (1979) showed that the water content of the root buds increased by 25% within 24 hours of shoot removal, promoting the growth of root buds. Increasing the humidity from 50 to 95% increased the rate of emergence and elongation of root buds after stem removal ( McIntyre, 1979 ). Different phytohormones act differently on root bud growth. GA can promote root bud growth and reverse the status of correlative inhibition in leafy spurge root buds. In contrast, abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin and sugar (glucose and sucrose) can inhibit root bud growth. Sugar and GA were functionally antagonistic since GA has been shown to overcome the inhibitory

ohormones act differently on root bud growth. GA can promote root bud growth and reverse the status of correlative inhibition in leafy spurge root buds. In contrast, abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin and sugar (glucose and sucrose) can inhibit root bud growth. Sugar and GA were functionally antagonistic since GA has been shown to overcome the inhibitory effect imposed by glucose and sucrose ( Chao et al., 2001 ). The importance of light and temperature has also been documented. For example, the percentage of flowering shoots decreases under limiting light ( Selleck et al., 1962 ) and plant height increases progressively upon increasing soil temperature ( Morrow, 1979 ).PhenologyLeafy spurge is one of the first plants to emerge in the spring. It emerges during March in Iowa and Wisconsin, in late March to early April in North Dakota, and late April in Saskatchewan ( Hanson and Rudd, 1933 ; Bakke, 1936 ; Selleck et al., 1962 ; Anderson, 1999 ). Shoots originate from crown tissue around the soil surface and from intermittent buds along the root system. Bud sprouting declines in mid-summer during pollen production ( Best et al., 1980 ; Messersmith, 1983 ; Lym, 1991 ). The plant usually ceases growing during the hot and dry summer months. Stems from seedlings or small root segments generally do not flower in the first year.Flowering occurs primarily in May but continues through autumn. Bracts are seen about 2 weeks before the emergence of flowers and give leafy spurge the appearance of blooming ( Lym, 1998 ). Each flowering shoot produces more than 150 to 200 seeds. The seeds can be propelled 4.6 or more metres when the mature capsule dehisces. The seeds germinate in spring and continuously throughout the growing season; however, the peak period of germination is late May and early June. Normally, 99% of the seeds will germinate

 appearance of blooming ( Lym, 1998 ). Each flowering shoot produces more than 150 to 200 seeds. The seeds can be propelled 4.6 or more metres when the mature capsule dehisces. The seeds germinate in spring and continuously throughout the growing season; however, the peak period of germination is late May and early June. Normally, 99% of the seeds will germinate within 2 years, but some are viable for up to 8 years in soil ( Bowes and Thomas, 1978 ; Cole, 1991 ). The optimal temperature for germination fluctuates between 20 and 30°C. Seedling emergence is optimal at depths of 1.5-5 cm. Young seedlings develop an extensive root system in a short time. All seedlings become perennial by the time they reach the 10-leaf stage, but on some occasions they are able to reproduce vegetatively from buds within 7 days of germinating ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Lym, 1991 ). Leafy spurge has vigorous, rhizome-like, long horizontal roots, short horizontal feeder roots, and short and long vertical roots. The vertical roots can grow as deep as 4.6 m ( Bakke, 1936 ). The roots serve as a nutrient reserve capable of sustaining the plant for years. Vegetative buds are formed on the crown or anywhere along the length of the root. These buds produce shoots in the spring and form new roots for the lateral spread of an infestation. Root fragments are also capable of regenerating new shoots. Partial injury to root systems, stems or foliage induces bud growth and spread of the plant ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Messersmith, 1983 ; Wolters et al., 1994 ). Reproductive BiologyReproduction occurs by both vegetative re-growth from underground adventitious buds located on the crowns and spreading roots and by the production of large quantities of seeds. For seed reproduction, insects usually carry out flower pollination. The

 induces bud growth and spread of the plant ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Messersmith, 1983 ; Wolters et al., 1994 ). Reproductive BiologyReproduction occurs by both vegetative re-growth from underground adventitious buds located on the crowns and spreading roots and by the production of large quantities of seeds. For seed reproduction, insects usually carry out flower pollination. The pollen is most viable approximately 24 hours after emergence of the male flower ( Selleck et al., 1962 ). The female is most receptive to pollen when the stigma opens while the pistil has not inverted. As female flowers develop before male flowers, leafy spurge has a preference for cross-pollination. The fruit develops from a three-celled ovary. Seeds grow inside a three-valved capsule and ripen from early July till late autumn. When ripe, the capsule dehisces, shooting seeds up to 4.6 m for distribution. Fresh seed is generally 60 to 80% viable. Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting seed germination. Alternating temperatures of 20 to 30°C produces the highest germination rate (84%) ( Hanson and Rudd, 1933 ). Light and water are other environmental factors affecting leafy spurge seed germination. Light impedes germination whereas water contributes to rapid germination ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). The testa (seed coat) of germinable seeds breaks between 12 and 24 hours after imbibition and the radicle can emerge as early as 12 hours ( Selleck et al., 1962 ). Root hairs develop 12-24 hours after the radicle has reached 1 cm. The hypocotyl arises within 12 hours after the appearance of the root hairs. Vegetative buds are visible 10-12 days after seedling emergence from the soil surface ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Seedlings do not usually flower in the first year ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Morrow, 1979 ).Ve

 develop 12-24 hours after the radicle has reached 1 cm. The hypocotyl arises within 12 hours after the appearance of the root hairs. Vegetative buds are visible 10-12 days after seedling emergence from the soil surface ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Seedlings do not usually flower in the first year ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Morrow, 1979 ).Vegetative reproduction of leafy spurge occurs from underground adventitious buds on the crown and root tissue (crown and root buds). These buds develop into new shoots when the aerial portion of the plant is removed. Visible buds are present all year around. However, during flowering, new buds are emerging while old buds are deteriorating; the underground vegetative buds are tiny but discernible. Throughout the growing season, new buds enlarge and elongate (see Pictures). Some buds can become many centimetres long during the autumn but fail to develop/differentiate into new shoots due to correlative inhibition and cold temperatures ( Selleck et al., 1962 ; Messersmith et al., 1985 ; Raju, 1985 ). Environmental RequirementsLeafy spurge grows in diverse environments from dry to sub-humid and from subtropic to subartic, but most commonly under conditions of a well-balanced water supply ( Lym, 1998 ). It establishes more readily in disturbed soil, and is primarily found in untilled, non-cropland habitats such as abandoned cropland, pastures, rangeland, woodland, roadsides and waste areas. It can also establish in an undisturbed, pristine plant community ( Derscheid et al., 1985 ; Dunn, 1985 ; Watson, 1985). Although leafy spurge grows most commonly on coarse-textured soils ( Selleck et al., 1962 ), it tolerates a wide range of soils including a coarse-textured group of light loam to sand, the intermediate group of loam to clay lo

 an undisturbed, pristine plant community ( Derscheid et al., 1985 ; Dunn, 1985 ; Watson, 1985). Although leafy spurge grows most commonly on coarse-textured soils ( Selleck et al., 1962 ), it tolerates a wide range of soils including a coarse-textured group of light loam to sand, the intermediate group of loam to clay loam, and the clay to heavy clay soils. However, seed germination and seedling establishment appears to be more suited to fine-textured soils ( Messersmith et al., 1985 ). Generally, leafy spurge requires a cold acclimation period to break autumn-induced (post-senescent) innate dormancy in vegetative buds ( Harvey and Nowierski, 1988 ) and to assist in flowering.AssociationsMany insects are identified as natural enemies of leafy spurge; for further information, see section on Biological Control.
