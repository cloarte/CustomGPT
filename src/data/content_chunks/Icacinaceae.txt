34.Icacinaceae茶茱萸科 cha zhu yu keAuthors:Hua Peng&Richard A. HowardTrees, shrubs, or lianas, occasionally with tendrils. Leaves alternate, rarely opposite, estipulate, veins mostly pinnate, sometimes palmate, margin usually entire, rarely lobed or denticulate. Inflorescences spikes, racemes, panicles, or cymes, axillary or terminal, rarely opposite leaves, with small bracts or not. Flowers regular, bisexual, sometimes polygamous or unisexual, (3 or)4- or 5(or 6)-merous. Calyx generally articulate to pedicel, usually persistent, small; lobes imbricate, rarely valvate.

Ovary superior, 2-carpellate, coherent, 1-loculed, rarely 3-5-loculed; ovules 2, rarely 1 per locule, pendulous from apex, anatropous with abaxial raphe and micropyle facing upward; funicle usually thickened above micropyle; style rarely developed, simple; stigmas 2(or 3-5), or coherent to capitate or peltate.
