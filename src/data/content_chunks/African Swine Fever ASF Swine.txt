African Swine Fever (ASF) Swine Influenza
ASF is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that 
affects both domestic and feral swine. It causes bruising and 
bleeding, among other clinical signs. Infection usually leads 
to death. 
Swine influenza is a contagious viral disease in swine. Influenza 
viruses are common in swine. Pigs may experience mild 
respiratory illness or show no signs of illness. Infection may 
result in economic losses for the producer.
ASF spreads through contact with infected animals and 
contaminated objects. 
Swine influenza may spread through the air in droplets, 
contact with infected animals, or contaminated objects.
ASF has not been detected in the United States. It is 
recognized as a foreign animal disease.
Swine influenza is present in the United States. It is not a 
reportable or regulated disease.
There is no effective treatment or USDA-approved vaccine 
for ASF.
Pigs are often vaccinated with autogenous or commercially 
available vaccines. Supportive care may include anti-fever 
medications and antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial 
infections. Most animals recover within a week.
Animals typically show clinical signs within 15 days of being 
infected with the virus, but this may range from 3 to 21 days. 
Signs may include:
• Unexpected death
• High fever and huddling
• Decreased appetite and weakness
• Coughing and difficulty breathing
• Red or purple blotchy skin or skin lesions
• Bloody diarrhea and vomiting
Animals typically begin showing signs 1 to 3 days after they 
are infected with the virus. Signs may include: 
• Mild to transient fever
• Decreased appetite and weakness
• Coughing that sounds like barking and

 Decreased appetite and weakness

Animals typically begin showing signs 1 to 3 days after they 
are infected with the virus. Signs may include: 
• Mild to transient fever
• Decreased appetite and weakness
• Coughing that sounds like barking and  
   difficulty breathing  
• Nasal discharge
• Sneezing
ASF is not a food safety concern. Swine influenza is not a food safety concern.
Immediately report animals with any signs of ASF to State 
or Federal animal health officials or call USDA toll-free at 
1-866-536-7593 for appropriate testing and investigation.
Contact your veterinarian and isolate the sick animal(s) 
from the rest of the herd, if possible.
ASF is not a threat to human health. It cannot transmit from 
pigs to people. The ASF virus only infects domestic and wild 
pigs. People can carry the virus on their clothes, shoes, and 
equipment which may potentially infect swine.
Swine influenza viruses typically do not infect people. How-
ever, human infections with influenza viruses that normally 
circulate in swine do occur. These infections are generally 
mild; however, patients with underlying conditions may be 
more at risk.
