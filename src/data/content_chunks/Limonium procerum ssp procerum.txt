Limonium procerum ssp. procerum- sea-lavender  -Plumbaginaceae(Map updated: March 2008)This is a plant which occurs at several places along Ireland's east-coast, but the only site within Northern Ireland is near Ardglass where it is confined to the ledges of one very short stretch of rocky cliffs. It is Northern Ireland's only representative of a group of closely-related plants which are called theLimonium binervosumaggregate, and also the only sea-lavender which grows on rock within Northern Ireland. It is an attractive plant, with a basal rosette of oval leaves and a branched densely-flowered inflorescence of small pale blue flowers. The whole plant reaches about 8 inches (20 cm) in height.All names:Limonium procerum ssp. procerumNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
