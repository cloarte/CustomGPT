 Sinonimos: No encontrado
 Invasion: Annual or short-lived perennial herb, erect and widely spreading, up to 150 cm tall unarmed; stem rounded or narrowly winged, sometimes warty, glabrous or sparsely pubescent, young stem sometimes covered with curved, simple hairs. Leaves arranged spirally to almost opposite, simple; petiole 1–9 cm long; blade ovate to lanceolate, up to 14(–16) cm x 7(–12) cm, cuneate to truncate at base and decurrent along the petiole, acute to acuminate at apex, entire to toothed, glabrous or sparsely pubescent. Inflorescence simple umbellate cymes, 3- to 10-flowered; peduncles to 2.8 cm long, elongating up to 4 cm in fruit. Flowers bisexual, regular, 5-merous; pedicel 5–10 mm long, becoming nodding; calyx cup-shaped, 1.5–2 mm in diameter, lobes ovate to oblong, reflexed in fruit; corolla deeply stellate, 5–9 mm in diameter, white or flushed purple with basal yellow-green star, lobes ovate-oblong, approx. 3 mm long; stamens inserted on corolla throat, filaments 0.5–2 mm long, with hairs on inner side, anthers yellow, connivent, 1.5–2 mm long, opening by terminal pores; ovary superior, globose, approx. 1 mm in diameter, style 2.5–4 mm long usually exserted beyond anthers, hairy in the lower part, stigma capitate, pale green. Fruit a globose berry 4–8

Fruit a globose berry 4–8(–10) mm in diameter, from green turning to glossy purplish black at maturity, rarely dark green, many-seeded. Seeds discoid, 1–1.5(–2) mm long, creamy coloured, often tinged with purple (Edmonds and Chweya, 1997;Manoko and Weerden, 2004).
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: Seedling growth is fast after epigeal germination and flowering occurs within 2 months of seed germination. Normally self pollinated, cross pollination does occur often facilitated by bees and syrphid flies. Flowering continues and fruits crop with the pedicel when ripe. Birds eat the fruits and disperse the seeds. Often found in disturbed ground from sea level to 2926 m ( Edmonds and Chweya, 1997 ), but it is mainly found at low altitudes growing as a weed on various soil types in open or lightly shaded areas. In semiarid regions it occurs near water sources or infests irrigated fields as it does not tolerate drought ( Manoko and Weerden, 2004 ).
