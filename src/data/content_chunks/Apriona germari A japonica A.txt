46 th Meeting of the Panel on Phytosanitary Measures Changins (CH), 2012-10-02/04 The Panel met in Changins in Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil on 2012-10-02/04. The main task of this Panel is to evaluate risks presented by specific pests and design phytosanitary measures to avoid their introduction and spread. EPPO lists of pests recommended for regulation The Panel reviewed the PRAs prepared by the Expert Working Groups on Apriona germari, A. japonica and A. cinerea and on Thaumatotibia leucotreta and considered in particular the management options. It also reviewed management measures for Phytophthora kernoviae and Phytophthora ramorum . Review of measures will carry on at the next Panel meeting. The Panel agreed that EFSA PRAs should also be considered to make EPPO recommendations on pest listing. Alert List The Panel suggested emerging pests that could be added to the Alert List (e.g. Ecdytolopha aurantiana , Euwallacea fornicatus, Macchiademus diplopterus, Platynota stultana). Some concerns were also raised on Anthonomus eugenii, an A1 pest currently not regulated in the EU. Euwallacea fornicatus adult Javier Mercado (Colorado State University) - Bugwood.org Pest Risk Analysis The Panel discussed the different EPPO Schemes for PRA (PM 5/2, PM 5/3 and PM 5/5) and for which purposes they should be used. They agreed that PM 5/2 Pest risk analysis on detection of a pest in an imported consignment should be maintained. The Panel considered that a more flexible approach may be used with PM 5/3 Decision-Support Scheme Pest Risk Analysis for quarantine pests and PM 5/5 Decision-

2, PM 5/3 and PM 5/5) and for which purposes they should be used. They agreed that PM 5/2 Pest risk analysis on detection of a pest in an imported consignment should be maintained. The Panel considered that a more flexible approach may be used with PM 5/3 Decision-Support Scheme Pest Risk Analysis for quarantine pests and PM 5/5 Decision-Support Scheme for an Express Pest Risk Analysis in order to produce PRAs that are fit for purpose. The Panel discussed the current EPPO process to review PRAs to decide on pest listing, and make recommendations on how to better involve members of the Panel on PRA Development. The Panel carried on its work on the Decision-support scheme for prioritizing action during outbreaks produced in the framework of the EU project PRATIQUE so that it may become an EPPO Standard. The Panel also discussed priorities for the organization of EWGs for PRA. It agreed that the next EWGs should be organized to revise risk management options for Agrilus planipennis (A1 pest), and to prepare a PRA on Neoleucinodes elegantalis . Finally, the Panel recommended that a study should be performed on pests associated with imports of tomato and pepper fruit. The Panel was presented preliminary results of ISEFOR and PERMIT projects. The Panel will next meet on 2013-03-05/07.
