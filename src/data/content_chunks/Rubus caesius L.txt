Rubus caesiusL. - Dewberry  -Rosaceae© Roy Anderson© Roy Anderson(Map updated: March 2008)ThisRubusspecies is similar to the blackberries (Rubus fruticosus), but is distinguished by having all leaves divided into three leaflets (five inR. fruticosus) and by having only a few individual drupelets in the fruit. The drupelets are covered with a pale 'bloom'.It is a normal sexually-reproducing species (unlike nearly all members of theR. fruticosusagg.)It is rare, and some of the records on the map may even refer to the morecaesius-like of its hybrids withR. fruticosusagg. It occurs principally on dry, basic (e.g. limestone) soils.Hybrids withR. fruticosusare fairly frequent; some of these have become stabilised and behave as species in their own right and these are grouped together asRubus fruticosusSectionCorylifolii. Overall, members of this section are very common in hedges and heaths etc., but they have not been mapped for this web site.All names:Rubus caesiusL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
