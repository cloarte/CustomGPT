The tree is very large, up to over 100 feet. It is a tropical evergreen,native to northern Brazil, with large leathery leaves, 2 feet long and 6 incheswide. The tree forms forests along the Amazon and Rio Nigro Rivers. Largequantities of nuts are gathered from such trees, but they are littlecultivated. The fruits are round, about 6 inches in diameter, with a hard shellnear 0.5 inch thick, which contains 18 to 24 of the 3-sided angular nuts. Theshell of the individual nut is woody, rather thin, and completely filled withthe white, creamy kernel. Brazil nuts are not produced commercially in theU.S., but large quantities are imported.
