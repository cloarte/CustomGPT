Plant Notes:  Common Sunflower is an introduced herbaceous annual in the Sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is thought to have been native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has been widely cultivated for thousands of years for its seed. Common Sunflower has been collected throughout Alabama. It occurs on roadsides, around the edges of fields, along railroads, and in waste areas. It is an annual with a tap root. Stems are erect, from 2-10 feet in height, pubescent, and are usually unbranched in cultivated plants. Leaves are alternate, petiolate, ovate to triangular in outline, and pubescent on both surfaces. The margins are entire or toothed. Flowers are produced in heads. There is usually a single terminal head. The phyllaries (bracts subtending the head) are ovate to ovate-lanceolate in outline, pubescent, with ciliate margins and long acuminate apices. The heads have 17-30 yellow, red, or bi-colored ray flowers and 150+ reddish-yellow disc flowers. The fruit is an achene. Common Sunflower is grown commercially for its seed which are used as bird seed, human food, and for oil. It is the only native North American species that is a major crop plant. Common Sunflower is a popular annual, and many varieties are available as seed. Seed should be planted after danger of frost has passed. Common Sunflower prefers a well-

It is the only native North American species that is a major crop plant. Common Sunflower is a popular annual, and many varieties are available as seed. Seed should be planted after danger of frost has passed. Common Sunflower prefers a well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter and full sun. Large plants may have to be staked to prevent them from falling over.--A. Diamond  ;
