Uses
The wood, elastic and soft, fairly light and easily worked, is used for
cigarboxes, pumps, and wooden carvings, shoes and slippers.  The bark, used for
tanning, imparts a hard red appearance to leather.  The wood is also used in
making the molds for glass manufacture.  The tree provides habitat and food for
wildlife, watershed protection, and is used in environmental forestry (Ag.
Handbook 450).  With little ornamental value, it is recommended only for wet
sites.
Folk Medicine
According to Hartwell (1967–1971), 
the leaves are decocted in folk
remedies for cancer of the breast, duodenum, esophagus, face, pylorus,
pancreas, rectum, throat, tongue, and uterus.  The bark and/or roots are used
for cancers and inflammatory tumors of the throat.  Reported to be alterative,
astringent, detersive, diuretic, sudorific, tonic, and vermifuge, black alder
is a folk remedy for cancer, fever, foot ailments, tumors, and worms (Duke and
Wain, 1981).  The bark decoction is taken as a gargle for angina and
pharyngitis, as an enema in hematachezia.

 sudorific, tonic, and vermifuge, black alder
is a folk remedy for cancer, fever, foot ailments, tumors, and worms (Duke and
Wain, 1981).  The bark decoction is taken as a gargle for angina and
pharyngitis, as an enema in hematachezia.
Chemistry
The bark contains up to 20% tannin, a flavone glycoside of the
hyperoside type, a reddish dye, emodin (?), alnulin (C

lustrous, later dark gray and rougher.  Leaves rotund or broadly ovate to

lustrous, later dark gray and rougher.  Leaves rotund or broadly ovate to
ellipsoid or ovate, 4–9 cm long, 3–7 cm wide, basally rounded the petiole 1–2
cm long; stipules obtuse, soon deciduous.  Male cones purplish brown in autumn
and winter, brown in the spring, 6–12 cm long, in clusters of 3–5.  Fruits
rounded, the seeds winged. Seeds ca 700,000–750,000/kg, but yielding only ca
20–25,000 plantable seedlings.
Germplasm
Reported from the Eurosiberian Center of Diversity, black alder, or cvs
thereof, is reported to tolerate frost, poor soil, and waterlogging.  Hortus
III lists var.
barbata, denticulata
, and
glutinosa
, as well as
several cvs 'Aurea', 'Imperialis', 'Incisa', 'Oxycanthifolial, 'Pyramidatis',
'Quercifolia', 'Rubrinervia', and 'Sorbifolia'.  Wyman (1974) mentions
'Laciniata'.
Alnus glutinosa
serves as a rootstock for grafting of
other alder species.
Distribution
Throughout the Caucasus, Europe, Siberia, into Asia Minor, Iran, and
North Africa.  Naturalized locally in eastern Canada and Northeastern U.S.

Estimated to range from Warm Temperate Dry to Moist through Cool

, into Asia Minor, Iran, and
North Africa.  Naturalized locally in eastern Canada and Northeastern U.S.
Ecology
Estimated to range from Warm Temperate Dry to Moist through Cool
Temperate Steppe to Wet Forest Life Zones, black alder is estimated to tolerate
annual precipitation of 4 to 20 dm, annual temperature of 8 to 14°C, and pH
of 6 to 8.  Ranging north to Wyman's Zone 3.
Cultivation
Seeds which have remained viable after floating for 12 months, are sown
at depths of 3–6 mm, in spring or fall.  For blanket bogs in England, spot
sowings have been recommended ca 15 seeds per spot fertilized with ca 60 g
phosphate.  Seeds germinate as well under continuous darkness as with normal
day lengths.  Air-dried seeds stored at 1–2°C retained their viability for
two years. Seeds can however be sown immediately as soon as ripe.
Harvesting
Timber and/or firewood harvested as needed, the shrub apparently
coppices readily. In the U.S., it flowers from March to May, the fruits
ripening in fall, natural dispersal occurring from late fall to early spring.

2
/ha.  The standing biomass
was about 59.3 MT/ha wood, bark, and branches, 2.8 MT leaves, and 4.3 MT
estimated roots.  Leaf litterfall was ca 2.5 MT/ha/yr.  A British stand
dominated by
A. glutinosa
(ca 1600 trees/ha, 55%
Alnus
, 44%
Betula pendula
and
Acer pseudoplatanus
) had a basal area of ca 25
m
2
/ha, a leaf area index of 3.6, and a standing biomass of 109 MT/ha.
Energy
According to the phytomass files, annual productivity is estimated at 6
to 9 MT/ha.  The tree has yielded 11.8 MT/ha/yr on pulverized fuel ash
(Dennington, et al, 1983).  Kestemont (1975) estimated annual productivity at
8.66 MT/ha, with 5.87 MT in wood, bark, and branches, 2.79 MT in foliage.
According to Cannell, (1982), Hughes (1971) estimated the aerial productivity
at ca 6.7 MT/ha/yr with wood, bark, and branches accounting for 4.26 MT + 0.34
MT litter, 1.78 MT leaf and leaf litter, 0.34 MT fruit and fruit litter.  NAS
(1980a) recommends the black alder for consideration for firewood plantations
in Tropical highlands where unseasonal cold might destroy the red alder.

 for 4.26 MT + 0.34
MT litter, 1.78 MT leaf and leaf litter, 0.34 MT fruit and fruit litter.  NAS
(1980a) recommends the black alder for consideration for firewood plantations
in Tropical highlands where unseasonal cold might destroy the red alder.
Nitrogen-fixation by trees up to 8 years old has been put at 125 kg/ha/yr, for
20 years at 56–130 kg/ha/yr (NAS, 1979).  Related red alder has been estimated
to fix as much as 300 kg/ha.
Biotic Factors
Agriculture Handbook 165 lists the following diseases for
Alnus
glutinosa
:
Phymatotrichum omnivorum
(root rot),
Polyporus
versicolor
(sapwood rot),
Septoria alni
(leaf spot), and
Sphaeropsis alnicola
(on twigs).  Like other alders, the cv 'Laciniata'
is susceptible to a canker which can kill large parts of the plant quickly
(Wyman, 1974).  Nematodes include
Longidorus maximus,
and
Pratylenchus penetrans
(Golden, pers. commun. 1984).

Nitrogen-fixation by trees up to 8 years old has been put at 125 kg/ha/yr, for
