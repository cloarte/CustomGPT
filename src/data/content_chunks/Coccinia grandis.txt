 Reproduccion: Coccinia grandis is one of the few angiosperms, and so far the only species in the genus, that has heteromorphic sex chromosomes ( Ming et al., 2011 ; Holstein, 2015 ). It contains 22 autosomes plus two gonosomes. Female individuals have homomorphic XX (22+XX), whereas male individuals have heteromorphic XY chromosomes (22+XY). The Y chromosome is approximately 2.5 times longer than the X ( Ming et al., 2011 ; Holstein, 2015 ). Due to the presence of sex chromosomes, sex expression in C. grandis is predetermined, and sex ratios in the offspring follow Mendelian inheritance of a single allele ( Holstein, 2015 ).

22+XY). The Y chromosome is approximately 2.5 times longer than the X ( Ming et al., 2011 ; Holstein, 2015 ). Due to the presence of sex chromosomes, sex expression in C. grandis is predetermined, and sex ratios in the offspring follow Mendelian inheritance of a single allele ( Holstein, 2015 ). Coccinia grandis can hybridize with other Coccinia species, but the F1 seems to be always sterile. Artificial crosses with Coccinia hirtella and Coccinia sessilifolia result in vigorous hybrids, even though these species do not co-occur, nor are closely related to C. grandis ( Holstein, 2015 ). Coccinia grandis flowers and fruits profusely ( Imbumi, 2004 ). It is pollinated by bees including Trigona apicalis and Trigona collina in Thailand, and Megachile sp. in Cambodia ( Jongjitvimol and Wattanachaiyingcharoen, 2006 ; Holstein, 2015 ). In Hawaii, various hymenopterans have been observed visiting the flowers including the honey bee Apis mellifera ( Starr et al., 2003 ). The flower scent has been described as ‘weak but fresh’ ( Holstein, 2015 ). The fruits of C. grandis are consumed by birds ( Bhatt and Kumar, 2001 ; Chun, 2002 ) and bats ( Elangovan et al., 2001 ). Elephants are also reported to feed on C. grandis ( Mubalama, 2000 ), and possibly also act as seed dispersers. The seeds do not exhibit dormancy ( Motooka et al., 2003 ), and can be successfully germinated directly in soil, indicating that passage through a digestive tract is not necessary, although the role of endozoochoric transport on germination is not known ( Holstein, 2015 ).

The seeds do not exhibit dormancy ( Motooka et al., 2003 ), and can be successfully germinated directly in soil, indicating that passage through a digestive tract is not necessary, although the role of endozoochoric transport on germination is not known ( Holstein, 2015 ). Coccinia grandis can also be easily propagated vegetatively by means of stem cuttings, which is the preferred method used by farmers. According to Imbumi (2004) , cuttings start developing new leaves and shoots after about a month, with suckers developing after another month, and flowering and fruiting commencing 1 month later; the period from planting to the first harvest takes up to 5 months. Coccinia grandis flowers and fruits throughout the year, but not at the end of the dry season or in cold seasons. When cultivated in temperate regions, the plants appear to need one to two weeks of at least 10 h of daylight with sunny weather for flower induction ( Holstein, 2015 ). The stems of C. grandis become corky with age and both the rootstock and stems act as water reservoirs which enable the plant to survive the dry season ( Imbumi, 2004 ). Coccinia grandis is a perennial plant ( Holstein, 2015 ). In the wild, individuals 20 years or older have been observed, reaching a length of 30 m ( Imbumi, 2004 ). Coccinia grandis is a hardy, sun-loving vine that grows well in tropical and subtropical environments and has the potential to invade principally dry forests ( Starr et al., 2003 ). In Africa, it occurs naturally in semi-arid areas ( Imbumi, 2004 ). In South East Asia, where precipitation is much higher, it seems to require well-drained, usually sandy soils as it is intolerant to waterlogging ( Boonkerd et al., 1993 ; Holstein, 2015 ). It

It has been reported on black clay soil, black cotton soil, and sand and limestone, and seems to have a certain tolerance to salt ( Holstein, 2015 ).
