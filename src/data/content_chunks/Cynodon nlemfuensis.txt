 Invasion: Perennial, mat forming, stoloniferous, not rhizomatous grass. Stolons stout, woody, usually lying flat on the ground. Culms 20-60 cm tall, 1-5 mm thick, not becoming woody. Sheaths glabrous; ligules about 0.3 mm, membranous, ciliolate; blades 5-16 cm long, 2-6 mm wide, abaxial surfaces glabrous or with scattered long hairs, adaxial surfaces with scattered long hairs. Panicles with 4-13 branches; branches (2) 4-7 (10) cm, in 1(-3) whorls, lax, usually green, axes triquetrous. Spikelets 2-3 mm. Lower glumes 1.7-2 mm; upper glumes 1.5-2.3(3) mm; lemmas 1.9-2.9 mm, keels not winged, shortly pubescent, at least distally; paleas glabrous. Fruits are caryopses with adherent pericarp (Barkworth et al., 2003).

 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for C. nlemfuensis is mostly 2 n = 18 and rarely 2 n = 36 ( Barkworth et al., 2003 ; Cook et al., 2005 ). Reproductive Biology Evidence available suggests that C. nlemfuensis may be an outcrossing species and that flowers are probably wind-pollinated ( Cook et al., 2005 ). Physiology and Phenology C. nlemfuensis is a perennial fast-growing grass ( Barkworth et al., 2003 ). In South Africa, it has been recorded flowering from January to March, but in tropical America it can flower all year long (Más and Garcia-Molinari, 2006). Fruit and seed production is very poor outside its native distribution range ( Cook et al., 2005 ). In actively managed pastures C. nlemfuensis is often intercropped with low-growing legumes to improve forage quality and reduce the harmful effects of its prussic acid content. Good results are reported with Stylosanthes guianensis, Centrosema pubescens, Trifolium repens, and Lotononis bainesii .

Good results are reported with Stylosanthes guianensis, Centrosema pubescens, Trifolium repens, and Lotononis bainesii . In Brazil, C. nlemfuensis has been intercropped with Arachis pintoi ( Smith and Valenzuela, 2002 ). C. nlemfuensis is limited to lower elevations with an average annual rainfall between about 600 and 3000 mm (commonly 800-1200 mm) and to areas where temperatures do not fall below -4°C ( Cook et al., 2005 ; PROTA4U, 2013). Within its native distribution range, it occurs from sea level up to 2300 m elevation, representing a range in average annual temperature from about 20 to 27ºC ( Cook et al., 2005 ). C. nlemfuensis grows on a wide range of soil types ranging from sands to heavy clays, although it performs best in moist, well-drained, lighter textured soils. It is adapted to soils with a pH between about 4.5 and 8, but ideally between about 5.5 and 7. It does not tolerate salty or shaded conditions, but is well adapted to drought ( Smith and Valenzuela, 2002 ; Cook et al., 2005 ; FAO, 2013 ).
