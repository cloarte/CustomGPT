 Invasion: A. hispidusis sometimes considered to be perennial, as in Bhutan where it is described as ‘usually perennial’ (Noltie, 2000), but it is more commonly described as annual. It is a sprawling plant, rooting at the nodes with flowering stems up to 30 cm high; nodes hairy. Leaves are relatively short and broad, narrowly obovate up to 5 cm long and 15 mm wide, auricled at the base and acutely tipped, variably glabrous or hairy on the margins. Ligule 0.5-3 mm. Inflorescence a set of up to 10 or more racemes, up to 5 cm long, pale green or purple, variously glabrous to shortly hairy. Sessile spikelet up to 7 mm long; lower glume lanceolate, convex, 6-9-nerved with scabrid veins. Upper glume slightly longer with awn up to 11 mm long in typical forms but may be much shorter and hardly exserted. Pedicelled spikelet occasionally present at the tip of the raceme, but usually absent with pedicel a stump up to 2 mm long.

 Reproduccion: A. hispidus is described by Chen and Phillips (2006) as an extremely polymorphic, polyploid species with 2n =10, 18 or 36. Aguillera et al. (2011) indicates n = 9, so the commonest forms with 2n = 36 are presumably tetraploid. A. hispidus establishes from seed each year.

Ueno (1995) describes bundle-sheath-like cells that are not associated with vascular tissue. Known as distinctive cells, they occasionally occur as single or multiple files in the mesophyll in leaves of A. hispidus . Sometimes described as perennial, but no indication of any prolonged perennation. A. hispidus is apparently favoured by high nitrogen levels as it decreased markedly when grassland ceased to be fertilized ( Kondo et al., 1985 ). Hwang et al. (2003) noted that A. hispidus at sites in Korea was associated with soils high in magnesium and phosphorous. In Korean arboreta, A. hispidus was associated with Digitaria sanguinalis ( Hwang et al., 2003 ). A. hispidus is apparently favoured by relatively moist conditions and full or at least partial sunlight. A. hispidus does not tolerate acidic soils, a pH of 5.6 proving fatal in a study by Suaghara (1981) . In Japan, A. hispidus was found to be more common in upland conditions than lowland, but had a wider tolerance of moisture conditions than some other C4 grasses (Takeda et al . , 1977). Yan et al. (2006) observed that A. hispidus is highly tolerant of manganese and copper on old mining sites. It is apparently quite tolerant of ozone and acid rain (Ohkuru et al . , 1993).
