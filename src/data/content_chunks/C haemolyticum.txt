This Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) describes procedures for potency testing biological 
products containing Clostridium haemolyticum antigen as prescribed in title 9, Code of Federal 
Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.107. For products that require 2 vaccinations, guinea pigs are 
vaccinated twice, 21 to 23 days apart, and challenged with a standard dose of virulent  
C. haemolyticum spores 14 to 15 days following the second vaccination. For products that 
require a single dose, guinea pigs are vaccinated and challenged with a standard dose of virulent 
C. haemolyticum spores 35 to 38 days following vaccination. This is a 2-stage test in which the 
second stage is applied only when exactly 2 vaccinated guinea pigs die in the first stage.

4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   Vaccination of test animals 
 
4.1.1 Check the label on each container of product to be tested for identity and 
recommended field dose. The guinea pig dose is 1/5 of the recommended calf 
dose. 
 
4.1.2 Thoroughly mix the product by striking the container against the palm of 
the hand at least 25 times before the syringes are filled. Use 5-mL or 10-mL 
syringes, fitted with 23-gauge x 1-inch needles.

4.1.3 Vaccinate 8 guinea pigs with each serial of product. Administer the 
vaccine subcutaneously in the ventral thoracic area. Administer the first 
vaccination on the RIGHT side of the guinea pig. 
 
4.1.4 For 2-dose products, administer the second vaccination 21 to 23 days after 
the first. Administer the second vaccination subcutaneously in the ventral thoracic 
area on the LEFT side of the guinea pig. 
 
4.2   Timing of challenge 
 
4.2.1 Challenge 8 guinea pigs per serial of product 14 to 15 days after the 
second vaccination for 2-dose products or 35 to 38 days after vaccination for 
single-dose products. 
 
4.2.2 Challenge the nonvaccinated control guinea pigs at the same time. The 5 
nonvaccinated guinea pigs may serve as controls for up to 4 serials of product.  
 
4.3   Preparation of challenge 
 
4.3.1 Thaw a vial of challenge culture, IRP 647, at room temperature and use 
immediately. 
 
4.3.2 Mix the contents thoroughly by shaking the vial vigorously. 
 
4.3.3 Use a 2-mL pipette to remove 0.7 mL of spore suspension from the vial. 
Pipette 0.5 mL of spore suspension into a glass tube containing 4.5 mL of cold, 
sterile 0.85% NaCl solution (1:10 dilution).

4.3.3 Use a 2-mL pipette to remove 0.7 mL of spore suspension from the vial. 
Pipette 0.5 mL of spore suspension into a glass tube containing 4.5 mL of cold, 
sterile 0.85% NaCl solution (1:10 dilution). 
 
Note:  The C. haemolyticum spore suspension is viscid and must be pipetted 
with care to ensure delivery of the complete volume. 
 
4.3.4 Use a 5-mL pipette to remove 3 mL of well-mixed spore suspension 
diluted 1:10. Transfer 2 mL into a 50-mL serum vial containing 26 mL of cold, 
sterile calcium chloride solution. Cap and seal the bottle. Mix this 1:140 challenge 
suspension thoroughly and place on ice. Allow the challenge suspension to remain 
on ice approximately 10 minutes before inoculating the first guinea pig. 
 
4.3.5 Mix the challenge thoroughly before each syringe is filled. Use 3-mL 
syringes fitted with 23-gauge x 1-inch needles to inoculate the guinea pigs. 
Inoculate each guinea pig intramuscularly in the thigh of the right or left hind leg 
with 0.5 mL of challenge material. The challenge dilution contains approximately 
100 guinea pig lethal dose 50 (LD50) per 0.5 mL. 
 
Note: Each 28-mL volume of the 1:140 challenge dilution may be used to 
challenge up to 40 vaccinates and 5 nonvaccinated controls. This constitutes

a challenge unit. Additional 28-mL volumes of challenge must be prepared if 
additional challenge units are required. 
 
4.3.6 Complete the inoculation of the guinea pigs in each challenge unit within 
approximately 30 minutes from the time the challenge dilution is prepared. 
 
4.4   Observation of guinea pigs following challenge 
 
Observe the guinea pigs for 72 hours following challenge and record deaths. Also 
examine the test animals for sores, edema, and general physical condition. Record 
these observations on the daily record. The test is concluded at the end of the 
72 hours. 
 
Note:  Moribund animals exhibiting clinical signs consistent with the 
expected disease pathogenesis that are unable to rise or move under their 
own power may be humanely euthanized and considered as deaths as 
outlined in 9 CFR 117.4. 
 
5.  Interpretation of Test Results 
 
The test is interpreted as prescribed in 9 CFR 113.107. For a valid test, at least 80% of the 
controls shall die within the 3-day post-challenge observation period.  
 
If this requirement is met, the results of the potency test
