Overview
Appearance
Quercus acutissima
is a large, up to 50 ft. (15.2 m) in height, deciduous tree that has been invading forests in the eastern United States.
Foliage
The leaves are alternate, broadly lance-shaped, 4-7.5 in. (10.2-19 cm) long, up to 2.5 in. (6.4 cm) wide with bristly teeth along the margin.
Flowers
Flowers bloom in May and are small and inconspicuous.
Fruit
Fruit are large acorns with spreading, curved scales on the involucre. Trees produce large amounts of acorns.
Ecological Threat
Quercus acutissima
has been found in recent years to escape plantings and establish in nearby forests, potentially displacing native vegetation. It is native to Asia and has been widely planted in the United States as an ornamental and as food for wildlife. It is no longer recommended for planting in the United States because of its potential impact on native ecosystems.
