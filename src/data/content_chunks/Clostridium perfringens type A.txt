1. Reagent Name: Clostridium perfringens type A recombinant-alpha antitoxin 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 564 (08) 
4. Fill Date: September 17, 2008 
5. Expiration Date: February 28, 2029 
Precautions: This reagent does not present a hazard to laboratory personnel who work with the 
antitoxin provided sound fundamental laboratory techniques are followed. 
6. Intended Use: IRP 564 (08) serves as the standard antitoxin when C. perfringens type A 
(alpha) toxin-neutralization (TN) tests in mice. 
7. Instructions for Use: IRP 564 (08) contains 55 International units of alpha antitoxin per 
mL. A dilution of standard antitoxin containing 1.0 antitoxin unit per mL (AU/mL) is used in the 
mouse assay. The dilution is prepared by adding 1.0 mL of IRP 564 (

) tests in mice. 
7. Instructions for Use: IRP 564 (08) contains 55 International units of alpha antitoxin per 
mL. A dilution of standard antitoxin containing 1.0 antitoxin unit per mL (AU/mL) is used in the 
mouse assay. The dilution is prepared by adding 1.0 mL of IRP 564 (08) to 9.0 mL of peptone 
diluent (1.0% peptone, 0.25% sodium chloride, pH 7.2). The antitoxin diluted 1:10 should be 
dispensed into individual tubes and stored at -70°± 5°C. The final dilution containing 1.0 AU/mL 
for the mouse assay is prepared by adding 1.0 mL of the 1:10 dilution to 4.5 mL of diluent. 
8. Test of Reagent: Determination of antitoxin titer - The antitoxin titer of IRP 564 (08) 
was determined by injecting mice intravenously with 0.5-mL volumes of diluted antitoxin mixed 
with 1.0 L+ dose of toxin (the smallest amount of toxin which, when mixed with 1.0 unit of 
antitoxin causes death in at least 80% of the mice within 48 hours) and 1.0 Lo dose of toxin (the 
largest amount of toxin which, when mixed with 1.0 unit of antitoxin, causes no deaths in 
animals within 48 hours). The antitoxin titer of IRP 564 (08) was confirmed by comparing the 
results of mice injected with toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing 1.0 mL of IRP 564 (08) 
possessing 1.0 AU/mL with the results of mice injected with toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing 
1.0

 within 48 hours). The antitoxin titer of IRP 564 (08) was confirmed by comparing the 
results of mice injected with toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing 1.0 mL of IRP 564 (08) 
possessing 1.0 AU/mL with the results of mice injected with toxin-antitoxin mixtures containing 
1.0 mL of International C. perfringens alpha antitoxin possessing 1.0 AU/mL. 
Sterility test - The toxin was tested for sterility and found to be free of viable bacteria and fungi 
according to procedures outlined in title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.26. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 2-mL glass vials containing 1.3 mL of 
antitoxin.

12. Origin and Passage History: C. perfringens type A recombinant-alpha antitoxin IRP 
564-08 was obtained from young adult goats immunized with IRP 566 (C. perfringens type A 
recombinant-alpha toxoid) and antigen prepared from IRP 563-07 (C. perfringens type A 
recombinant-alpha toxin). 
13. Method of Preparation: Goats with no history of Clostridial vaccinations received 
multiple injections of C. perfringens type A recombinant-alpha toxoid (IRP 566) and toxin (IRP 
563) during a 6-month period. Sera from the hyperimmunized goats were fractionated with 
ammonium sulfate. The immunoglobulin obtained was dialyzed against 0.010 M phosphate 
buffered saline, pH 7.2, passed through a sterile disposable filter unit containing a 0.22-µm 
membrane, aseptically dispensed
