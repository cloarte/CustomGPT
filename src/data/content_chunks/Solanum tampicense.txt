Overview
Appearance
Solanum tampicense
is a sprawling, semi-woody shrub that invades wetlands in Florida. The green stems are up to 15 ft. (4.6 m) long and prickly.
Foliage
Leaves are alternate, to 10 in. (25 cm) long, 3 in. (7 cm) wide, wavy along the margins and have prickles on the veins.
Flowers
Solanum tampicense
has small, white flowers occur in small clusters at the leaf axils during the summer to fall.
Fruit
The fruits are small tomato-like berries that turn bright red when ripe.
Ecological Threat
Solanum tampicense
, being tolerant of full sun and full shade, can invade many types of wetland ecosystems such as cypress swamps and river edges. It is capable of forming extensive, dense stands that displace native vegetation. It is native to the West Indies and Central America. It was accidentally introduced into Florida. The ability of
Solanum tampicense
to form dense thickets that are difficult for other species to penetrate suggests this noxious weed has the potential to invade and alter many of Florida’s wetland habitats as well as impede access to and use of water resources (Fox and Wigginton, 1996; Fox and Bryson, 1998)
