in the United States 
 
January 1 – December 31, 2023   
 
 
This document summarizes equine infectious anemia (EIA) cases and testing reported in the United 
States during 2023. Following current guidance, the over 400 EIA-approved laboratories sent monthly 
summary testing data directly to Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services 
(VS). All positive cases were confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), and the 
VS Equine Health Team compiled case information in collaboration with State animal health officials. 
 
Reporting of EIA testing is summarized on a calendar-year basis. During 2023, a total of 1,364,247 EIA 
tests were conducted, resulting in detection of 61 positive horses on 45 premises (Table 1). These 
results compared to 1,349,759 tests and 96 positives on 45 premises in 2022. Figure 1 is a map depicting 
reported numbers of horses and premises testing positive for EIA by state and county in 2023. Figure 2 
presents a summary of EIA testing from 2003–2023. Historical data and additional information on EIA 
are available online at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/equine/infectious-anemia.

Although the current prevalence of EIA in the U.S. equine population remains very low, at an estimated 
national prevalence of around 0.004 percent, the epidemiology of EIA-positive cases has shifted in 
recent years. Most EIA cases were previously found to occur from natural transmission by biting fly 
vectors in untested and undertested populations. Increasing cases of iatrogenic transmission (disease 
resulting from medical activity) are now being identified.

Figure 2. Reported numbers of EIA tests and positive cases in the United States, 2003–2023 
 
In 2023, out of the total 61 confirmed EIA cases identified, there were 40 cases of EIA in either current 
or former Quarter Horse racehorses where iatrogenic transmission was the method of disease spread. 
Two of these cases were co-infected with Theileria equi, a causative agent of equine piroplasmosis, 
which was also transmitted by iatrogenic means. Iatrogenic transmission in this equine population 
occurs through unhygienic practices by horse trainers and owners. Practices include re-

 method of disease spread. 
Two of these cases were co-infected with Theileria equi, a causative agent of equine piroplasmosis, 
which was also transmitted by iatrogenic means. Iatrogenic transmission in this equine population 
occurs through unhygienic practices by horse trainers and owners. Practices include re-use of needles, 
syringes, and IV sets; administration of blood transfusions from untested donor horses; use of illegal 
blood products from other countries; and infectious blood contamination of multi-dose drug vials.  
 
Some of the iatrogenic transmission cases in the Quarter Horse racehorse population are found in 
horses participating in unsanctioned racing. However, there are also recognized crossover cases 
between unsanctioned and sanctioned racing in some parts of the United States. Cases in sanctioned 
Quarter Horse racehorses with no obvious connection to unsanctioned racing have also been identified. 
EIA-positive cases in this emerging high-risk population are frequently found in clusters, indicating a 
horse trainer or owner repeatedly using unhygienic practices which caused disease spread to multiple 
horses. These cases are preventable with good hygienic practices and basic biosecurity measures. Thus, 
increased education and outreach to trainers and owners of Quarter Horse racehorses are needed to 
mitigate the continued spread of EIA.  
 
Of the remaining 21 positive EIA cases identified in the United States during 2023, eight (8) originated 
from untested/undertested herds where natural transmission was likely occurring over a long period, 
four (4) horses were suspected or confirmed to have been illegally moved into the United States from 
Mexico, and nine (9) horses were infected from an unknown/

Current APHIS guidance for EIA-approved laboratories now provides more comprehensive EIA testing 
data than previously existed. Figure 3 captures the number of EIA tests performed in 2023 by month. 
March, April, and May, respectively, were the busiest months for EIA testing in 2023.

Two EIA test types are authorized for use by approved laboratories in the United States: 1. agar gel 
immunodiffusion (AGID) tests, commonly called Coggins tests, and 2. enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) tests. Figure 4 depicts the number of AGID tests performed throughout the United States 
in 2023, compared to the number of ELISA tests performed. Both test assays were used in 2023 with 
similar frequency.

Figure 5 shows the number and type of EIA assays used to test resident horses in each state. Twenty-
nine States and Puerto Rico reported fewer than 20,000 EIA tests performed on their horse populations 
in 2023. Nineteen States reported between 20,000 and 60,000 EIA tests performed on their horse 
populations in 2023. Three (3) States—Florida, Kentucky, and Texas—reported over 60,000 EIA tests 
performed on their horse populations in 2023. Horse populations in 24 states were tested more 
frequently using an ELISA assay than the AGID assay. In comparison, horse populations in 26 states and 
Puerto Rico were tested more frequently using the AGID assay compared to an ELISA assay.

Although the current prevalence of EIA in the U.S. equine population remains very low, at an estimated 
national prevalence of around 0.004 percent, the epidemiology of EIA-positive cases has shifted in 
recent years. Most EIA cases were previously found to occur from natural transmission by biting fly 
vectors in untested and undertested populations. Increasing cases of iatrogenic transmission (disease 
resulting from medical activity) are now being identified.

In 2023, out of the total 61 confirmed EIA cases identified, there were 40 cases of EIA in either current 
or former Quarter Horse racehorses where iatrogenic transmission was the method of disease spread. 
Two of these cases were co-infected with Theileria equi, a causative agent of equine piroplasmosis, 
which was also transmitted by iatrogenic means. Iatrogenic transmission in this equine population 
occurs through unhygienic practices by horse trainers and owners. Practices include re-

 method of disease spread. 
Two of these cases were co-infected with Theileria equi, a causative agent of equine piroplasmosis, 
which was also transmitted by iatrogenic means. Iatrogenic transmission in this equine population 
occurs through unhygienic practices by horse trainers and owners. Practices include re-use of needles, 
syringes, and IV sets; administration of blood transfusions from untested donor horses; use of illegal 
blood products from other countries; and infectious blood contamination of multi-dose drug vials.  
 
Some of the iatrogenic transmission cases in the Quarter Horse racehorse population are found in 
horses participating in unsanctioned racing. However, there are also recognized crossover cases 
between unsanctioned and sanctioned racing in some parts of the United States. Cases in sanctioned 
Quarter Horse racehorses with no obvious connection to unsanctioned racing have also been identified. 
EIA-positive cases in this emerging high-risk population are frequently found in clusters, indicating a 
horse trainer or owner repeatedly using unhygienic practices which caused disease spread to multiple 
horses. These cases are preventable with good hygienic practices and basic biosecurity measures. Thus, 
increased education and outreach to trainers and owners of Quarter Horse racehorses are needed to 
mitigate the continued spread of EIA.  
 
Of the remaining 21 positive EIA cases identified in the United States during 2023, eight (8) originated 
from untested/undertested herds where natural transmission was likely occurring over a long period, 
four (4) horses were suspected or confirmed to have been illegally moved into the United States from 
Mexico, and nine (9) horses were infected from an unknown/

Current APHIS guidance for EIA-approved laboratories now provides more comprehensive EIA testing 
data than previously existed. Figure 3 captures the number of EIA tests performed in 2023 by month. 
March, April, and May, respectively, were the busiest months for EIA testing in 2023.

Two EIA test types are authorized for use by approved laboratories in the United States: 1. agar gel 
immunodiffusion (AGID) tests, commonly called Coggins tests, and 2. enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) tests. Figure 4 depicts the number of AGID tests performed throughout the United States 
in 2023, compared to the number of ELISA tests performed. Both test assays were used in 2023 with 
similar frequency.

Figure 5 shows the number and type of EIA assays used to test resident horses in each state. Twenty-
nine States and Puerto Rico reported fewer than 20,000 EIA tests performed on their horse populations 
in 2023. Nineteen States reported between 20,000 and 60,000 EIA tests performed on their horse 
populations in 2023. Three (3) States—Florida, Kentucky, and Texas—reported over 60,000 EIA tests 
performed on their horse populations in 2023. Horse populations in 24 states were tested more 
frequently using an ELISA assay than the AGID assay. In comparison, horse populations in 26 states and 
Puerto Rico were tested more frequently using the AGID assay compared to an ELISA assay.
