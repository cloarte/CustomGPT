Crataegus laevigata x monogyna (C. x macrocarpa)Hegetschw. - Hybrid Hawthorn  -Rosaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)© Paul HackneyThis is the hybrid between the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and the Midland thorn (C. laevigata). Much more frequent thanC. laevigatain hedgerows and occasionally elsewhere such as on the sand dunes of The Umbra, but much less common thanC. monogyna. Probably introduced with hedging hawthorns from England, and almost certainly not native to Northern Ireland.Some forms of this hybrid are very close toC. laevigataand are probably F1 hybrids, others are less distinct because of back-crossing and introgression. Good examples of F1 hybrids are found in lanesides near Crow Glen above Ligoniel.All names:Crataegus laevigata x monogyna (C. x macrocarpa)Hegetschw.;Crataegus x macrocarpaHegetschw.;Crataegus laevigata x monogyna;Crataegus x ovalisKittel;Crataegus x mediaauct. non Bechst.;Crataegus monogyna x laevigataNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
