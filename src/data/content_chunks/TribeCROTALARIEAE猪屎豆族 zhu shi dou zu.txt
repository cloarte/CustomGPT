Leaves generally digitately 3(-7)-foliolate, sometimes 1-foliolate or simple, usually pulvinate; stipels absent. Inflorescences terminal, ± leaf-opposed, or less often axillary, racemes or heads, sometimes flowers solitary or aggregated into leafy pseudoracemes. Calyx generally with 5 subequal lobes. Corolla papilionaceous; standard sometimes with basal calluslike appen­dages. Stamens all connate into a sheath split above; anthers generally dimorphic, alternately basifixed and dorsifixed. Ovary 2- to many ovuled; style bearded lengthwise or minutely ciliate on adaxial side. Legumes usually turgid or inflated, rarely compressed, 2-valved, continuous within. Seeds estrophiolate.Eleven genera and slightly more than 1,200 species: most diverse in S Africa where all but one N African genus occur, two genera extending east to China and one pantropical (Crotalaria); three genera (one introduced) and 44 species (nine endemic, seven introduced) in China.1Stamens all similar; legume compressed, narrowly oblong, 3.5-5.5 × ca. 0.2 cm.52Rothia+Stamens dimorphic, 5 shorter with oblong basifixed anthers alternating with 5 longer with ovoid dorsifixed anthers; legume usually conspicuously inflated, or if not then less than 1.5 cm and/or more than 0.4 cm wide(2)
