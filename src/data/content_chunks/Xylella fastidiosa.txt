 Invasion: X. fastidiosais a fastidious Gram-negative, xylem-limited bacterium, rod-shaped with rippled cell walls. It is strictly aerobic (microaerophilic), non-flagellate, does not form spores and measures 0.1-0.5 x 1-5 µm. The peach strain was given byNyland et al. (1973)as 0.35 x 2.3 µm. See alsoBradbury (1991). Thread-like strands (fimbriae) attached to the polar ends of bacterial cells can be observed in electron microscopy (Mircetich et al., 1976) and scanning electron microscopy (Feil et al., 2003b). These probably function in bacterial attachment and 'twitching' movement (Meng et al., 2005).

 Reproduccion: X. fastidiosa proliferates only in xylem vessels, in roots, stems and leaves. The vessels are ultimately blocked by bacterial aggregates and by tyloses and gums formed by the plant, although disease induction may not be due simply to water blockage ( Goodwin et al., 1988 ). Pierce's disease strains of the bacterium are efficiently acquired by vector insects, with no latent period, and persist in infective adult insects indefinitely ( Severin, 1949 ). In tests made during the 1940s in California, USA, 75 of 100 tested plant species proved to be hosts from which vectors could acquire the pathogen by feeding ( Freitag, 1951 ). Additional studies with culturing and targeted gene amplification (PCR) of X. fastidiosa revealed additional symptomless hosts ( Purcell and Saunders, 1999b ; Costa et al., 2004; Wistrom and Purcell, 2005 ). Most of these hosts have only very mild (slight stunting) or no symptoms when infected. Winter climate is a key factor in delimiting the areas where X. fastidiosa can persist from one season to the next. Pierce's disease and phony disease only occur in areas with a mild winter, presumably in relation to survival of the bacterium in dormant plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Experimental cold therapy of diseased grapevines suggests that freezing temperatures can eliminate the bacterium directly from plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Wet winters promote survival of high vector populations and favour disease spread in regions with dry summers. In temperate climates with regular freezing winter temperatures, infections of X.

, presumably in relation to survival of the bacterium in dormant plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Experimental cold therapy of diseased grapevines suggests that freezing temperatures can eliminate the bacterium directly from plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Wet winters promote survival of high vector populations and favour disease spread in regions with dry summers. In temperate climates with regular freezing winter temperatures, infections of X. fastidiosa established in grapevines during the early growing season are most likely to persist until the following year ( Purcell, 1981 ; Feil et al., 2003a ). In California, USA, there is no evidence of vine to vine spread of chronic infections, probably because when bacteria first appear in new foliage ( Smart et al. 1998 ), the chances of establishing infections that will survive the subsequent winter are small. For this reason, vectors that survive the winter may be especially important in establishing early season infections. The lack of potential vectors that overwinter as adults and thus can introduce new infections into woody plants may explain the absence of natural spread or establishment in temperate climate regions such as Europe. X. fastidiosa is reported to be transmitted to seedlings from infected fresh seed in citrus (Li et al., 2003). This should be taken into account when importing citrus seed for propagation but is not likely to present a risk for introducing the bacterium via commercial fruit. The bacterium is sensitive to dry conditions commonly found in most seeds, but tests of seed transmission have only been reported for citrus. It tends to multiply rapidly in infected grapevines. Infected vines are conspicuous the year after infection and are easily destroyed or die within one to several years, depending on vine cultivar and age. Newly planted vines that are infected by grafting die within a year. In non-systemic hosts such as willow, X. fastidiosa dies within weeks of infecting a xylem cell via vector inoculation (Purcell and Saunders, 1999). Bacterial

In non-systemic hosts such as willow, X. fastidiosa dies within weeks of infecting a xylem cell via vector inoculation (Purcell and Saunders, 1999). Bacterial populations are maintained in natural vegetation by vector transmission to and latent multiplication in wild plants. On citrus, the variegated chlorosis disease appears to spread from tree to tree within citrus groves ( Laranjeira, 1997 ; Laranjeira et al., 1998 ). The 9-12 months incubation before symptoms appear in orange trees facilitates the spread of infected nursery trees and probably explains the rapid movements of the disease across Brazil within a decade (Coletta-Filho et al., 2000). Regulations in Brazil now require that nursery trees are produced under screens to prevent infection. The vectors of citrus strains appear to have the same vector group specificity (suctorial xylem feeders) as grapevine strains, but transmission trials indicate that vector transmission is much less efficient in citrus compared with grape ( Lopes et al., 1996 ; Roberto et al., 1996 ; Yamamoto et al., 2002 ). Vectors Virtually all sucking insects that feed predominantly on xylem fluid are potential vectors (Purcell, 1989). Leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) in the subfamily Cicadellinae (sharpshooters) and spittle bugs or froghoppers (Cercopidae) are by far the most common species of known vectors within the natural range of X. fastidiosa in North America.

 (Cercopidae) are by far the most common species of known vectors within the natural range of X. fastidiosa in North America. As previously predicted, cicadas (Cicadidae) are vectors as well ( Paião et al., 2002 ). Cicadella viridis (Cicadellinae) and the meadow spittle bug, Philaenus spumarius (Cercopidae), are common and widespread in central and southern Europe ( Pavan and Gambon, 2003 ) and reported to occur on grape ( Hering, 1966 ). In California, USA, all tested members of the subfamily Cicadellinae (including Carneocephala fulgida, Draeculacephala minerva and Graphocephala atropunctata ) were vectors of the grapevine strain (Hewitt et al., 1949). Homalodisca vitripennis, H. insolita, Oncometopia orbona, Graphocephala versuta and Cuerna costalis are reported vectors of the peach strain ( Turner and Pollard, 1959 ; Yonce, 1983 ). All these are xylem-feeding, suctorial insects which acquire the bacterium rapidly when feeding (less than 2 h). The bacterium adheres to the mouthparts and is released directly from them when the insect feeds again ( Purcell et al., 1979 ). It multiplies in the vector but does not circulate in its haemolymph, nor does it require a latent period before transmission (unlike a phytoplasma). Very few live cells in the vector&apos;s head are needed for efficient transmission ( Hill and Purcell 1995a ). Transmission is usually from wild, generally symptomless, hosts to cultivated hosts (grapevines, peaches) rather than between cultivated hosts, though the latter can occur.

Transmission is usually from wild, generally symptomless, hosts to cultivated hosts (grapevines, peaches) rather than between cultivated hosts, though the latter can occur. Feeding preferences of G. atropunctata for different grapevine cultivars have been noted, but these seem to not have a role in field susceptibility ( Purcell, 1981 ). A study of X. fastidiosa vectors on olive trees in Italy suggests that potential vectors may include the phloem-feeder Euscelis lineolatus ( Elbeaino et al., 2014b ). Further studies are needed to confirm transmission. The biology of the vectors is important in understanding the epidemiology of the disease. In California, USA, species such as D. minerva and C. fulgida inhabit permanent pastures alongside vineyards, or live on weeds within them. Irrigation and weed control practices which produce foci of preferred host plants, including Cynodon dactylon and Echinochloa crus-galli , increase vector populations and the spread of the bacterium ( Purcell and Frazier, 1985 ). Other species, such as G. atropunctata , multiply on grapevine but overwinter on a variety of other wild hosts, chiefly in riparian vegetation.
 Sintomas: On grapevines The most characteristic symptom of primary infection is leaf scorch. An early sign is sudden drying of part of a green leaf, which then turns brown while adjacent tissues turn yellow or red. The desiccation spreads and the whole leaf may shrivel and drop, leaving only the petiole attached. Diseased stems often mature irregularly, with patches of brown and green tissue. In later years, infected plants develop late and produce stunted chlorotic shoots. Chronically infected

 is sudden drying of part of a green leaf, which then turns brown while adjacent tissues turn yellow or red. The desiccation spreads and the whole leaf may shrivel and drop, leaving only the petiole attached. Diseased stems often mature irregularly, with patches of brown and green tissue. In later years, infected plants develop late and produce stunted chlorotic shoots. Chronically infected plants may have small, distorted leaves with interveinal chlorosis and shoots with shortened internodes. Highly susceptible cultivars rarely survive more than 2-3 years, despite any signs of recovery early in the second growing season. Young vines succumb more quickly than do older vines. More tolerant cultivars may survive chronic infection for more than 5 years ( Hewitt et al., 1942 ; Goodwin and Purcell, 1992 ). On peaches Young shoots are stunted and bear greener, denser foliage (due to shorter internodes) than healthy trees. Lateral branches grow horizontally or droop, so that the tree seems uniform, compact and rounded. Leaves and flowers appear early, and leaves remain on the tree longer than on healthy trees. Affected trees yield increasingly fewer and smaller fruits until, after 3-5 years, they become economically worthless ( Hutchins, 1933 ). On citrus Trees can start showing the symptoms of variegated chlorosis from nursery size up to more than 10 years of age. Younger trees (1-3 years) become systemically colonized by X. fastidiosa much faster than do older trees. Trees more than 8-10 years old are not usually totally affected, but rather have symptoms on the extremities of branches. Affected trees show foliar chlorosis resembling zinc deficiency with interveinal chlorosis. The chlorosis appears on young leaves as they mature and may also occur on older leaves. Newly affected trees show sectoring of symptoms, whereas trees which have been affected for a period of time show the variegated chlorosis throughout the canopy.

 affected, but rather have symptoms on the extremities of branches. Affected trees show foliar chlorosis resembling zinc deficiency with interveinal chlorosis. The chlorosis appears on young leaves as they mature and may also occur on older leaves. Newly affected trees show sectoring of symptoms, whereas trees which have been affected for a period of time show the variegated chlorosis throughout the canopy. As the leaves mature, small, light-brown, slightly raised gummy lesions (becoming dark-brown or even necrotic) appear on the underside, directly opposite the yellow chlorotic areas on the upper side. Fruit size is greatly reduced; it may take 550 affected fruits to fill a field box, compared with 250 normal fruits. The sugar content of affected fruit is higher than in non-affected fruit, and the fruit has a hard rind, causing damage to juicing machines. Blossom and fruit set occur at the same time on healthy and affected trees, but normal fruit thinning does not occur on affected trees and the fruits remain small but open earlier. Since more fruits remain, total production is not greatly reduced. On affected trees of cv. Pera and other orange cultivars, fruits often occur in clusters of 4-10, resembling grape clusters. Affected trees show stunting and slow growth rate; twigs and branches die back and the canopy thins, but affected trees do not die ( Chang et al., 1993a ,b; Lee et al., 1991 , 1993). Control has been achieved by removing inoculum in established orange groves and using sanitary measures to prevent infection of nurseries and new groves. All symptomatic branches from trees older than 3 years are cut off up to 1 m below the most basal symptoms. Symptomatic trees less than 4 years old are removed. To prevent the infection of nursery trees, nurseries are located away from citrus plantings, sharpshooters are controlled prophylactically by insecticides,

 measures to prevent infection of nurseries and new groves. All symptomatic branches from trees older than 3 years are cut off up to 1 m below the most basal symptoms. Symptomatic trees less than 4 years old are removed. To prevent the infection of nursery trees, nurseries are located away from citrus plantings, sharpshooters are controlled prophylactically by insecticides, and buds are taken from trees tested free of X. fastidiosa and grown vectors in screen houses or glass houses to exclude vectors. The effectiveness of these measures ( Rodas, 1994 ) indicates that most spread of variegated chlorosis is from tree to tree within citrus orchards ( Laranjeira, 1997 ).

 Invasion: X. fastidiosais a fastidious Gram-negative, xylem-limited bacterium, rod-shaped with rippled cell walls. It is strictly aerobic (microaerophilic), non-flagellate, does not form spores and measures 0.1-0.5 x 1-5 µm. The peach strain was given byNyland et al. (1973)as 0.35 x 2.3 µm. See alsoBradbury (1991). Thread-like strands (fimbriae) attached to the polar ends of bacterial cells can be observed in electron microscopy (Mircetich et al., 1976) and scanning electron microscopy (Feil et al., 2003b). These probably function in bacterial attachment and 'twitching' movement (Meng et al., 2005).

 Reproduccion: X. fastidiosa proliferates only in xylem vessels, in roots, stems and leaves. The vessels are ultimately blocked by bacterial aggregates and by tyloses and gums formed by the plant, although disease induction may not be due simply to water blockage ( Goodwin et al., 1988 ). Pierce's disease strains of the bacterium are efficiently acquired by vector insects, with no latent period, and persist in infective adult insects indefinitely ( Severin, 1949 ). In tests made during the 1940s in California, USA, 75 of 100 tested plant species proved to be hosts from which vectors could acquire the pathogen by feeding ( Freitag, 1951 ). Additional studies with culturing and targeted gene amplification (PCR) of X. fastidiosa revealed additional symptomless hosts ( Purcell and Saunders, 1999b ; Costa et al., 2004; Wistrom and Purcell, 2005 ). Most of these hosts have only very mild (slight stunting) or no symptoms when infected. Winter climate is a key factor in delimiting the areas where X. fastidiosa can persist from one season to the next. Pierce's disease and phony disease only occur in areas with a mild winter, presumably in relation to survival of the bacterium in dormant plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Experimental cold therapy of diseased grapevines suggests that freezing temperatures can eliminate the bacterium directly from plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Wet winters promote survival of high vector populations and favour disease spread in regions with dry summers. In temperate climates with regular freezing winter temperatures, infections of X.

, presumably in relation to survival of the bacterium in dormant plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Experimental cold therapy of diseased grapevines suggests that freezing temperatures can eliminate the bacterium directly from plants ( Purcell, 1980a ). Wet winters promote survival of high vector populations and favour disease spread in regions with dry summers. In temperate climates with regular freezing winter temperatures, infections of X. fastidiosa established in grapevines during the early growing season are most likely to persist until the following year ( Purcell, 1981 ; Feil et al., 2003a ). In California, USA, there is no evidence of vine to vine spread of chronic infections, probably because when bacteria first appear in new foliage ( Smart et al. 1998 ), the chances of establishing infections that will survive the subsequent winter are small. For this reason, vectors that survive the winter may be especially important in establishing early season infections. The lack of potential vectors that overwinter as adults and thus can introduce new infections into woody plants may explain the absence of natural spread or establishment in temperate climate regions such as Europe. X. fastidiosa is reported to be transmitted to seedlings from infected fresh seed in citrus (Li et al., 2003). This should be taken into account when importing citrus seed for propagation but is not likely to present a risk for introducing the bacterium via commercial fruit. The bacterium is sensitive to dry conditions commonly found in most seeds, but tests of seed transmission have only been reported for citrus. It tends to multiply rapidly in infected grapevines. Infected vines are conspicuous the year after infection and are easily destroyed or die within one to several years, depending on vine cultivar and age. Newly planted vines that are infected by grafting die within a year. In non-systemic hosts such as willow, X. fastidiosa dies within weeks of infecting a xylem cell via vector inoculation (Purcell and Saunders, 1999). Bacterial

In non-systemic hosts such as willow, X. fastidiosa dies within weeks of infecting a xylem cell via vector inoculation (Purcell and Saunders, 1999). Bacterial populations are maintained in natural vegetation by vector transmission to and latent multiplication in wild plants. On citrus, the variegated chlorosis disease appears to spread from tree to tree within citrus groves ( Laranjeira, 1997 ; Laranjeira et al., 1998 ). The 9-12 months incubation before symptoms appear in orange trees facilitates the spread of infected nursery trees and probably explains the rapid movements of the disease across Brazil within a decade (Coletta-Filho et al., 2000). Regulations in Brazil now require that nursery trees are produced under screens to prevent infection. The vectors of citrus strains appear to have the same vector group specificity (suctorial xylem feeders) as grapevine strains, but transmission trials indicate that vector transmission is much less efficient in citrus compared with grape ( Lopes et al., 1996 ; Roberto et al., 1996 ; Yamamoto et al., 2002 ). Vectors Virtually all sucking insects that feed predominantly on xylem fluid are potential vectors (Purcell, 1989). Leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) in the subfamily Cicadellinae (sharpshooters) and spittle bugs or froghoppers (Cercopidae) are by far the most common species of known vectors within the natural range of X. fastidiosa in North America.

 (Cercopidae) are by far the most common species of known vectors within the natural range of X. fastidiosa in North America. As previously predicted, cicadas (Cicadidae) are vectors as well ( Paião et al., 2002 ). Cicadella viridis (Cicadellinae) and the meadow spittle bug, Philaenus spumarius (Cercopidae), are common and widespread in central and southern Europe ( Pavan and Gambon, 2003 ) and reported to occur on grape ( Hering, 1966 ). In California, USA, all tested members of the subfamily Cicadellinae (including Carneocephala fulgida, Draeculacephala minerva and Graphocephala atropunctata ) were vectors of the grapevine strain (Hewitt et al., 1949). Homalodisca vitripennis, H. insolita, Oncometopia orbona, Graphocephala versuta and Cuerna costalis are reported vectors of the peach strain ( Turner and Pollard, 1959 ; Yonce, 1983 ). All these are xylem-feeding, suctorial insects which acquire the bacterium rapidly when feeding (less than 2 h). The bacterium adheres to the mouthparts and is released directly from them when the insect feeds again ( Purcell et al., 1979 ). It multiplies in the vector but does not circulate in its haemolymph, nor does it require a latent period before transmission (unlike a phytoplasma). Very few live cells in the vector&apos;s head are needed for efficient transmission ( Hill and Purcell 1995a ).

Transmission is usually from wild, generally symptomless, hosts to cultivated hosts (grapevines, peaches) rather than between cultivated hosts, though the latter can occur. Feeding preferences of G. atropunctata for different grapevine cultivars have been noted, but these seem to not have a role in field susceptibility ( Purcell, 1981 ). A study of X. fastidiosa vectors on olive trees in Italy suggests that potential vectors may include the phloem-feeder Euscelis lineolatus ( Elbeaino et al., 2014b ). Further studies are needed to confirm transmission. The biology of the vectors is important in understanding the epidemiology of the disease. In California, USA, species such as D. minerva and C. fulgida inhabit permanent pastures alongside vineyards, or live on weeds within them. Irrigation and weed control practices which produce foci of preferred host plants, including Cynodon dactylon and Echinochloa crus-galli , increase vector populations and the spread of the bacterium ( Purcell and Frazier, 1985 ). Other species, such as G. atropunctata , multiply on grapevine but overwinter on a variety of other wild hosts, chiefly in riparian vegetation.
 Sintomas: On grapevines The most characteristic symptom of primary infection is leaf scorch. An early sign is sudden drying of part of a green leaf, which then turns brown while adjacent tissues turn yellow or red. The desiccation spreads and the whole leaf may shrivel and drop, leaving only the petiole attached. Diseased stems often mature irregularly, with patches of brown and green tissue. In later years, infected plants develop late and produce stunted chlorotic shoots. Chronically infected

 is sudden drying of part of a green leaf, which then turns brown while adjacent tissues turn yellow or red. The desiccation spreads and the whole leaf may shrivel and drop, leaving only the petiole attached. Diseased stems often mature irregularly, with patches of brown and green tissue. In later years, infected plants develop late and produce stunted chlorotic shoots. Chronically infected plants may have small, distorted leaves with interveinal chlorosis and shoots with shortened internodes. Highly susceptible cultivars rarely survive more than 2-3 years, despite any signs of recovery early in the second growing season. Young vines succumb more quickly than do older vines. More tolerant cultivars may survive chronic infection for more than 5 years ( Hewitt et al., 1942 ; Goodwin and Purcell, 1992 ). On peaches Young shoots are stunted and bear greener, denser foliage (due to shorter internodes) than healthy trees. Lateral branches grow horizontally or droop, so that the tree seems uniform, compact and rounded. Leaves and flowers appear early, and leaves remain on the tree longer than on healthy trees. Affected trees yield increasingly fewer and smaller fruits until, after 3-5 years, they become economically worthless ( Hutchins, 1933 ). On citrus Trees can start showing the symptoms of variegated chlorosis from nursery size up to more than 10 years of age. Younger trees (1-3 years) become systemically colonized by X. fastidiosa much faster than do older trees. Trees more than 8-10 years old are not usually totally affected, but rather have symptoms on the extremities of branches. Affected trees show foliar chlorosis resembling zinc deficiency with interveinal chlorosis. The chlorosis appears on young leaves as they mature and may also occur on older leaves. Newly affected trees show sectoring of symptoms, whereas trees which have been affected for a period of time show the variegated chlorosis throughout the canopy.

 affected, but rather have symptoms on the extremities of branches. Affected trees show foliar chlorosis resembling zinc deficiency with interveinal chlorosis. The chlorosis appears on young leaves as they mature and may also occur on older leaves. Newly affected trees show sectoring of symptoms, whereas trees which have been affected for a period of time show the variegated chlorosis throughout the canopy. As the leaves mature, small, light-brown, slightly raised gummy lesions (becoming dark-brown or even necrotic) appear on the underside, directly opposite the yellow chlorotic areas on the upper side. Fruit size is greatly reduced; it may take 550 affected fruits to fill a field box, compared with 250 normal fruits. The sugar content of affected fruit is higher than in non-affected fruit, and the fruit has a hard rind, causing damage to juicing machines. Blossom and fruit set occur at the same time on healthy and affected trees, but normal fruit thinning does not occur on affected trees and the fruits remain small but open earlier. Since more fruits remain, total production is not greatly reduced. On affected trees of cv. Pera and other orange cultivars, fruits often occur in clusters of 4-10, resembling grape clusters. Affected trees show stunting and slow growth rate; twigs and branches die back and the canopy thins, but affected trees do not die ( Chang et al., 1993a ,b; Lee et al., 1991 , 1993). Control has been achieved by removing inoculum in established orange groves and using sanitary measures to prevent infection of nurseries and new groves. All symptomatic branches from trees older than 3 years are cut off up to 1 m below the most basal symptoms. Symptomatic trees less than 4 years old are removed. To prevent the infection of nursery trees, nurseries are located away from citrus plantings, sharpshooters are controlled prophylactically by insecticides,

 measures to prevent infection of nurseries and new groves. All symptomatic branches from trees older than 3 years are cut off up to 1 m below the most basal symptoms. Symptomatic trees less than 4 years old are removed. To prevent the infection of nursery trees, nurseries are located away from citrus plantings, sharpshooters are controlled prophylactically by insecticides, and buds are taken from trees tested free of X. fastidiosa and grown vectors in screen houses or glass houses to exclude vectors. The effectiveness of these measures ( Rodas, 1994 ) indicates that most spread of variegated chlorosis is from tree to tree within citrus orchards ( Laranjeira, 1997 ).
