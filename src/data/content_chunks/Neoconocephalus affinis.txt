 closer than the populations from Trinidad. Bar-coding data are available for the species ( BOLDS, 2022 ). Little is known about the reproductive biology of N. affinis . Male Neoconocephalus produce species-specific calls which females use to localize and approach males for mating ( Greenfield, 1990 ). Typically, among co-occurring species, calls differ distinctly in their temporal pattern, which allows females to selectively approach conspecific males ( Walker and Greenfield, 1983 ; Schul and Patterson, 2003 ; Deily and Schul, 2006 ). Neoconocephalus species go through three stages in their life cycle: egg, nymph and adult. Adult females use their ovipositor to open wounds in grasses, in between stems and sheaths of roots or leaves ( SINA, 2022b ). Some species are known to lay eggs on the ground and cracks in the bark ( Torres et al., 2008 ). Katydids protect the eggs by secreting a sticky, waterproof substance with which they cover and harden. In another species, Neoconocephalus triops , the eggs are light green in colour and are long and oval-shaped with pointed ends. In the conehead katydids, nymphs are light green, resembling the adults with long, slender bodies, but lack wings and sexual characteristics. At least in the species N. triops , nymphs go through seven instars ( SINA, 2022c ). Rather, they change from green to brown during late-instar moults, usually during the last moult ( SINA, 2022b ). Nymphs reach adulthood after about 7 weeks ( Whitesell, 1974 ). In other Neoconocephalus species, male calling is known to be energetically costly and it raises body temperature, especially inside the thorax. Thus, calling efficiency is tied to environmental temperature and physiological conditions of the male ( Heath and Josephson, 1970 ).

In other Neoconocephalus species, male calling is known to be energetically costly and it raises body temperature, especially inside the thorax. Thus, calling efficiency is tied to environmental temperature and physiological conditions of the male ( Heath and Josephson, 1970 ). Due to its tropical and subtropical distribution, N. affinis should exhibit the tropical life history defined in Snyder et al. (2009) , which incorporates multiple generations per year and direct egg development without environmental triggers. Studies on the specific phenology of the species were not found. SINA (2022a) reports that its season (not specified whether it refers to reproduction or population peak) is in August but perhaps year-round. Longevity of N. affinis is unknown. Nymphs of N. triops reach adulthood after about 7 weeks, but adult lifespan is unspecified ( Whitesell, 1974 ). Juveniles of Neoconocephalus species are mostly found among grasses, feeding on the flowers and the developing seeds ( SINA, 2022d ). The katydid genus Neoconocephalus has been used to study many aspects of acoustic biology, such as chorusing behaviour ( Greenfield, 1983 ), acoustic spacing ( Meixner et al., 1979 ; Brush et al., 1985 ), mechanics ( Walker, 1975 ) and energetics of calling ( Heath and Josephson, 1970 ; Josephson, 1984 ; 1985), developmental plasticity of calling behaviour ( Whitesell and Walker, 1978 ; Beckers and Schul, 2008 ), recognition of conspecific calls during phonotaxis ( Deily and Schul, 2004 ; 2006; 2009; Bush et al., 2009 ) and sexual selection ( Greenfield and Roizen, 1993 ; Greenfield et al., 1997 ).

The song of N. affinis is characteristic of the species ( Walker and Greenfield, 1983 ) and consists of bouts of rattling, mostly occurring between 1-4 h after sunset, with component sequences lasting 1 s to 5 min or longer ( Greenfield, 1983 ). In Puerto Rico, Bush et al. (2009) studied positive phonotaxis to tape-recorded conspecific songs by males in the field. The authors report that N. affinis males stridulate loudly during evening hours, and while most males seem territorial, aggression between neighbours rarely occurs. The members of the genus Neoconocephalus are phytophagous; adults feed on seeds, fruits and leaves; nymphs feed on flowers and seeds ( SINA, 2022d ). Some species are recorded as feeding on grasses (Poaceae), including sugarcane and rice ( Wolcott, 1921 ; Ballou, 1945 ; Guagliumi, 1960 ; 1962; Rambajan, 1981 ; Urtiaga, 2007 ). Katydids, in general, prefer protein-rich food ( Arthur, 2008 ) and some Neoconocephalus species adults are known to feed on insects ( Pathak and Khan, 1994 ). Damage by females of N. affinis during oviposition favours the onset of bud-rot disease caused by Phytophthora sp. in oil palms ( Torres et al., 2008 ).

 Sintomas: Neoconocephalus species are mostly phytophagous, with both adults and nymphs commonly seen piercing and feeding on plants ( Aguilar, 2009 ). Thus, through feeding, they damage leaves, flowers, inflorescences, stems, root sheaths, seeds and fruits. In general, tender leaves and growing points are preferred by katydids ( Arthur, 2008 ).

The song of N. affinis is characteristic of the species ( Walker and Greenfield, 1983 ) and consists of bouts of rattling, mostly occurring between 1-4 h after sunset, with component sequences lasting 1 s to 5 min or longer ( Greenfield, 1983 ). In Puerto Rico, Bush et al. (2009) studied positive phonotaxis to tape-recorded conspecific songs by males in the field. The authors report that N. affinis males stridulate loudly during evening hours, and while most males seem territorial, aggression between neighbours rarely occurs. Nutrition The members of the genus Neoconocephalus are phytophagous; adults feed on seeds, fruits and leaves; nymphs feed on flowers and seeds ( SINA, 2022d ). Some species are recorded as feeding on grasses (Poaceae), including sugarcane and rice ( Wolcott, 1921 ; Ballou, 1945 ; Guagliumi, 1960 ; 1962; Rambajan, 1981 ; Urtiaga, 2007 ). Katydids, in general, prefer protein-rich food ( Arthur, 2008 ) and some Neoconocephalus species adults are known to feed on insects ( Pathak and Khan, 1994 ). Associations Damage by females of N. affinis during oviposition favours the onset of bud-rot disease caused by Phytophthora sp. in oil palms ( Torres et al., 2008 ). Environmental Requirements Neoconocephalus affinis seems to require some humidity since it prefers forest margins and does not occur in dry or completely open habitats ( Walker and Greenfield, 1983 ). In Costa Rica, it is registered at elevations from 10 to 2000 metres ( INBio, 2022 ).
