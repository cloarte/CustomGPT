◦ Does the result of potency testing a single 
vial provide you any level of comfort 
regarding your expectation of a serial at 
release? 
◦ Does the result of potency testing a single 
vial provide you any level of comfort 
regarding that serial at any point 
throughout-dating? 

 Increase the precision of the assay. 
◦ Use a smaller dilution factor. 
◦ Use data from more dilutions. 
◦ Use more wells per dilution. 
◦ Consistency among operators. 
 

 Test each vial multiple times. 
◦ Reduces assay variance 

 Sloppy assays may mask/obscure 
potency loss. 
◦ May result in higher throughout-dating 
specification due to lack of precision in 
the COD data. 
◦ May result in closer release and 
throughout-dating specification but at the 
cost of a higher throughout-dating 
specification and in terms of formulation. 

 What would you do? 
◦ The antigen was difficult and very 
expensive to produce  
◦ Conducting potency tests was relatively 
inexpensive 
 What would you do?  
◦ The antigen was easy and inexpensive to 
produce  
◦ Conducting the potency test was relatively 
expensive? 

 Evaluated All Confirmation of Dating 
(COD) studies using a in vitro assay

 Evaluated All Confirmation of Dating 
(COD) studies using a in vitro assay 
submitted after January 1, 2013 
◦ 46 total fractions 
 67% had a lower release or throughout-dating 
specification or both under Draft 440 
 7% showed no change to either the release or  
throughout-dating specification 
 26% showed both a higher release and 
throughout-dating specification
