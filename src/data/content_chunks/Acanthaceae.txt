3.Acanthaceae爵床科 jue chuang keAuthors:Yunfei Deng,Jia-qi Hu,Thomas F. Daniel,John Wood&John R. I. WoodBarleria cristataCredit: Harvard University HerbariaProstrate, erect, or rarely climbing herbs (annual or perennial), subshrubs, shrubs, or rarely small trees, usually with cystoliths (except in following Chinese genera:Acanthus,Blepharis,Nelsonia,Ophiorrhiziphyllon,Staurogyne, andThunbergia), isophyllous (leaf pairs of equal size at each node) or anisophyllous (leaf pairs of unequal size at each node). Branches decussate, terete to angular in cross-section, nodes often swollen, sometimes spinose with spines derived from reduced leaves, bracts, and/or bracteoles. Stipules absent. Leaves opposite [rarely alternate or whorled]; leaf blade margin entire, sinuate, crenate, dentate, or rarely pinnatifid. Inflorescences terminal or axillary spikes, racemes, panicles, or dense clusters, rarely of solitary flowers; bracts 1 per flower or dichasial cluster, large and brightly colored or minute and green, sometimes becoming spinose; bracteoles present or rarely absent, usually 2 per flower. Flowers sessile or pedicellate, bisexual, zygomorphic to subactinomorphic. Calyx synsepalous (at least basally), usually 4- or 5-lobed, rarely (Thunbergia) reduced to an entire cupular ring or 10-20-lobed. Corolla sympetalous, sometimes resupinate 180º by twisting of cor

 pedicellate, bisexual, zygomorphic to subactinomorphic. Calyx synsepalous (at least basally), usually 4- or 5-lobed, rarely (Thunbergia) reduced to an entire cupular ring or 10-20-lobed. Corolla sympetalous, sometimes resupinate 180º by twisting of corolla tube; tube cylindric or funnelform; limb subactinomorphic (i.e., subequally 5-lobed) or zygomorphic (either 2-lipped with upper lip subentire to 2-lobed and lower lip 3-lobed, or rarely 1-lipped with 3 lobes); lobes ascending or descending cochlear, quincuncial, contorted, or open in bud. Stamens epipetalous, included in or exserted from corolla tube, 2 or 4 and didynamous; filaments distinct, connate in pairs, or monadelphous basally via a sheath (Strobilanthes); anthers with 1 or 2 thecae; thecae parallel to perpendicular, equally inserted to superposed, spherical to linear, base muticous or spurred, usually longitudinally dehiscent; staminodes 0-3, consisting of minute projections or sterile filaments. Disk annular and nectar-producing at base of ovary. Ovary superior, 2-locular, placentation axile, with 2 to many ovules per locule; style filiform, simple; stigma funnel-shaped or 2-lobed (one lobe sometimes suppressed), one or both lobes sometimes recurved or recoiled.

Fruit a loculicidal, stipitate or not, 2-valved, explosively dehiscent capsule [rarely drupaceous], 2- to many seeded, apex with or without a beak; septa remaining attached to or separating from inner wall of mature capsule. Seeds usually borne on hooklike retinacula (attached to septa of capsule), or retinacula lacking (Nelsonia,Ophiorrhiziphyllon,Staurogyne,Thunbergia), surface smooth or roughened, pubescent or lacking trichomes, sometimes with hygroscopic trichomes that expand when moistened.About 220 genera and ca. 4,000 species: pantropical and subtropical, with a few species in temperate regions; 35 genera (one endemic) and 304 species (134 endemic, eight introduced) in China.Pollen characters have traditionally been important in delimiting genera and higher taxa in the family; they are used sparingly in the key below.AvicenniaLinnaeus, usually placed in either Verbenaceae (and treated as such in Fl. China 17: 49. 1994) or Avicenniaceae, is now included in Acanthaceae on the basis of molecular phylogenetic studies (e.g., A. E. Schwarzbach & L. A. McDade, Syst.
