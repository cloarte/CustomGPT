Guidelines for Handling Survey Samples for Identification of Lobesia botrana, the 
European Grapevine Moth (EGVM) for States (except CA) 
Joel Floyd, PPQ Domestic Diagnostics Coordinator 
 
Several states in 2010 are conducting surveys for the European Grapevine Moth (EGVM) , 
Lobesia botrana, under CAPS and Farm Bill funding.  These guidelines are for state and PPQ 
personnel servicing traps, for screeners, and for taxonomists involved with the survey.  
 
All traps that are approved for the EGVM survey are sticky traps must be sorted and screened for 
suspect adult moths in the family Tortricidae. (Larvae should not be surveyed for and will not be 
identified as part of this survey.) Proper sorting and screening will limit the material forwarded

 and for taxonomists involved with the survey.  
 
All traps that are approved for the EGVM survey are sticky traps must be sorted and screened for 
suspect adult moths in the family Tortricidae. (Larvae should not be surveyed for and will not be 
identified as part of this survey.) Proper sorting and screening will limit the material forwarded 
to the taxonomic specialists in your state capable of identifying suspects of this species.  Because 
the adults are small and have somewhat variable wing patterns, morphological screening can be 
difficult.  The often obscured condition of specimens captured in sticky traps further compounds 
the difficulty in recognizing suspects of the target species.   
 
Fortunately traps baited with the EGVM pheromone lure are thought to be more specific than the 
Light brown apple moth pheromone, but will likely still capture other moth species including 
other tortricids. Some of these non-target, endemic species may be similar to EGVM in 
appearance.  Consequently, most screening for this survey will occur by someone familiar with 
characteristics of tortricids and identifications of suspects by a taxonomist familiar with the 
characteristics described in the “Screening and Identification Aid for the EGVM” by Todd 
Gilligan, Steven Passoa, and Marc Epstein, seen below. 
 
Traps should be serviced at regular intervals according the guidance provided by the program. If 
traps are stored for more than a few days after collection, they should be kept in a cool location 
such as a refrigerator until they can be examined and processed.  This will prevent deterioration 
of the specimens.  Do not freeze traps except to kill the adults still alive in traps, which is 
necessary.  And do not send live moths in traps through the

traps are stored for more than a few days after collection, they should be kept in a cool location 
such as a refrigerator until they can be examined and processed.  This will prevent deterioration 
of the specimens.  Do not freeze traps except to kill the adults still alive in traps, which is 
necessary.  And do not send live moths in traps through the mail to other locations.  
 
Sorting of Traps 
 
Sorting can be performed at the field level to only select traps with Lepidoptera of the 
appropriate shape and size according to the screening aid guidance.  
 
1st Level Screening of Traps 
 
1st Level Screening is defined as recognizing moths that appear to be in the family Tortricidae. 
This will require examination through a good hand-lens or preferably through a dissecting 
microscope and should be performed by a screener with experience or training in recognizing 
characteristics of Lepidoptera families.  Traps containing suspect tortricid moths, or if there is 
any doubt, are to be sent to a diagnostic laboratory or taxonomist in the state experienced with 
adult Lepidoptera identification.

4.22.2010 
2nd Level Screening of Traps 
 
2nd Level Screening is defined as selection of suspect EGVM based on external wing pattern 
characteristics and dissection of the male’s abdomen to inspect the genitalia. This should be 
performed by a taxonomist familiar with Lepidoptera dissection techniques. When forwarding 
dissected specimens, the genitalia from these specimens should not be mounted on slides.  The 
genitalia should be sent forward in alcohol in a vial (in microvials with
Text Len: 1617
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of the male’s abdomen to inspect the genitalia. This should be 
performed by a taxonomist familiar with Lepidoptera dissection techniques. When forwarding 
dissected specimens, the genitalia from these specimens should not be mounted on slides.  The 
genitalia should be sent forward in alcohol in a vial (in microvials with glycerin if available) with 
the whole adult moth specimen for final identification. 
 
The routing and confirmation of the EGVM from either screening level will depend on the stated 
taxonomic ability of a state/PPQ taxonomic infrastructure. State departments of agriculture, 
universities, or PPQ in a state with the taxonomic ability and capacity to make determinations to 
the 2nd level screening will first forward any suspect EGVM specimens to one of the PPQ-
designated Lepidoptera Identifiers listed below.  If confirmed as suspect EGVM that potentially 
represent new state or county records, the specimen(s) will be forwarded to John Brown with the 
USDA-ARS Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Washington, DC for final confirmation.   
 
States that do not have 1st and/or 2nd level screening ability can forward specimens or sorted 
whole traps to one of the PPQ-designated Lepidoptera Identifiers. Prior approval and notification 
for doing this must go through the PPQ Regional Survey Coordinators informing them of the 
need, and the number of traps anticipated.

Communications of Results 
 
Not all of the moths in the trap will be identified by PPQ-designated Lepidoptera 
taxonomists to the species level if not suspect EGVM.  Negative results mean EGVM is 
not in the sample.  All negative EGVM determinations made by PPQ-designated 
Lepidoptera identifiers will be communicated by them by e-mail back to the SPHD, 
SPRO, regional program managers, and submitter in the state of origin.  These can be 
accumulated and sent summarized in a spreadsheet at the end of the week.  
 
Any positive suspect EGVM identification that are not new state or county records will 
be also communicated directly, but daily as they occur, to the SPRO, SPHD, and 
submitter and the EGVM  regional survey coordinators. 
 
When PPQ-designated Identifiers are forwarding a suspect new state or county EGVM 
records, notification that specimens are being forwarded to SEL will be sent by e-mail to 
ppq.nis.urgents@aphis.usda.gov e-mail address.  A copy of the PPQ form 391 with the 
tentative determination must be e-mailed or faxed to the NIS urgent team (PPQ National

Identification Service, fax number: 301-734-5276).  The NIS urgent team will have the 
PPQ form 391 information entered in the PestID system and notify SEL that specimen(s) 
are being forwarded for final confirmation. NIS will send an e-mail alert to the 
headquarters PPQ Emergency and Domestic Programs staff that suspect EGVM  
specimens from a new state or county are being forwarded to SEL for confirmation. They 
will in turn notify the SPHD and SPRO in the state of origin, the Regional Program 
Managers.  
 
Once SEL makes a final determination, positive or negative, the notification will be sent 
to the PPQ Emergency and Domestic Programs staff in Riverdale, MD who will forward 
the confirmations to the national and regional program mangers, SPHD and SPRO, who 
in turn will notify the appropriate state level personnel including the submitter. 
 
European Grapevine Moth
Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiff.)
 The European grapevine moth (EGVM), Lobesia botrana 
(Denis & Schiffermüller), is one of the most destructive grape 
pests in the Palearctic. L. botrana larvae cause damage to grapes 
by feeding on fruit, resulting in direct damage and secondary 
infection of feeding sites by botrytis bunch rot (gray mold; 
Fungi). L. botr

rana 
(Denis & Schiffermüller), is one of the most destructive grape 
pests in the Palearctic. L. botrana larvae cause damage to grapes 
by feeding on fruit, resulting in direct damage and secondary 
infection of feeding sites by botrytis bunch rot (gray mold; 
Fungi). L. botrana  was discovered infesting grapes in Napa 
Valley, California in 2009; it has not been reported from North 
America outside of California. 
 L. botrana is a member of the Tortricidae, a large family 
of moths (Lepidoptera) that includes many pest species. In North 
America there are approximately 1200 species of tortricids, 
which are often referred to as “leafrollers” because the larvae 
of some species feed inside a rolled leaf. Most tortricid moths 
are small and brown with a wingspan of approximately 10-30 
mm. L. botrana can be distinguished from many other tortricids 
by its wing pattern and small size; however some species are 
superficially similar to L. botrana. Other species of Lobesia and 
related Paralobesia (both subfamily Olethreutinae) are present 
in North America, and a genitalic dissection is necessary to 
separate these species from L. botrana in most cases.
 This aid is designed to assist in the screening and 
identification of L. botrana adults collected from sticky traps in 
the United States. It covers basic sorting of traps, first and second 
level screening, and identification based on morphological

 Lobesia botrana  pheromone traps should be sorted 
initially for the presence of moths of the appropriate size, 
color, and shape. Traps that contain moths meeting all of the 
following requirements should be moved to level 1 screening:
 1) Moths are approximately 4-7 mm (¼ inch)
  long (forewing length) (Figs. 5 & 6)
 2) Moths have an overall shape that is similar to
  the outline depicted in Fig. 4. Note that moths
  caught on their side or back may have a 
  different outline (Fig. 6).
 3) Moths appear superficially similar to those 
  depicted in Figs. 1-2 & 6-7.
 The appearance of moths caught in sticky traps can 
vary substantially depending on the amount of sticky glue on 
the moth. For this reason, any small, tortrid-like moth should 
be sent forward to level 1 screening.

 Moths that meet the sorting requirements should be screened 
for suspect tortricids. Level 1 screening is difficult for small moths 
and may need to be performed by a trained Lepidopterist. When 
in doubt distinguishing first level screening characters, forward 
traps that have passed the sorting requirements to a trained 
taxonomist. Suspect tortricids in traps should not be manipulated or 
removed for screening unless expertise is available.
 Tortricid moths can be identified by the following combination 
of characters:
 1) Antennae simple, thread-like, and never
  pectinate (feathery).
 2) Tympanum absent. Members of the Pyraloidea may 
  appear similar but have a tympanum at the base of
  the abdomen.
 3) Labial palpi pointed and project forward. Some
  families have labial palpi that curve upwards.
 4) Maxillary palpi are very reduced and not visible in
  tortricids. Maxillary palpi may be visible under
  magnification in some commonly intercepted
  pyralid species.
 4) Proboscis (tongue) unscaled. Members of the
  Gelechioidea and Pyraloidea have a scaled
  proboscis.
 5) Chaetosema (patch of bristle-like setae) present
  above the compound eye. (Chaetosema may be
  difficult to see without a high-quality microscope.)
 Moths meeting the above criteria should be sent to level

 Moths meeting the above criteria should be sent to level

packed following the steps outlined in Fig. 8. Traps can be folded, 
with stickum-glue on the inside, making sure the two halves are 
not touching, secured loosely with a rubber band, and placed in a 
plastic bag for shipment. Insert 2-3 styrofoam packing peanuts on 
trap surfaces without moths to cushion and prevent the two sticky 
surfaces from sticking during shipment to taxonomists. DO NOT 
simply fold traps flat or cover traps with transparent wrap (or other 
material), as this will guarantee specimens will be seriously damaged 
or pulled apart – making identification difficult or impossible.

http://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/LBAM/dissections.html
 Cleaned specimens should be pinned and labeled. Initial 
screening is based on wing pattern, which varies little between 
individuals. L. botrana  and close relatives can be separated from 
most other Nearctic tortricids by a combination of the following 
wing characters (depicted in red in Figs. 9 & 10); note that male 
L. botrana lack a forewing costal fold:
Wing Pattern
 1) All L. botrana individuals have a prominent
  leaden-gray bar that runs across the middle of 
  the forewing (Fig. 9). Often this bar is outlined 
  in white. In a resting individual these markings 
  form a complete, transverse, gray bar across 
  the middle of the specimen (Fig. 10).
 2) Many L. botrana individuals have a prominent
  inverted “Y” in the outer half of the forewing.
  This “Y” is formed from leaden-gray scales 
  outlined in white (Figs. 9 & 10). This feature may
  not be evident in some specimens, especially 
  those that are worn; however close examination
  should reveal some remnants of this pattern

 Specimens that pass initial wing pattern screening most

procedures for Lepidoptera are outlined in Clarke (1951) and 
Robinson (1976). Separated abdomens and genitalia preparations 
should be carefully labeled to remain associated with pinned 
specimens. Specimens may need to be sent to a tortricid specialist 
for positive identification.

 2) A long, feather-shaped signum is present (Fig. 12).
 
 Male Nearctic Paralobesia have a cluster of long setae (the

 Paralobesia viteana  is a native pest of grapes in eastern 
North America. This species is easily separated from L. botrana by 
genitalic characters: male P . viteana have a prominent lobe projecting 
from the valva that is absent in L. botrana, and female P . viteana 
lack a signum. The only common native Lobesia species in eastern

Guidelines for Handling Survey Samples for Identification of Lobesia botrana, the 
European Grapevine Moth (EGVM) for States (except CA) 
Joel Floyd, PPQ Domestic Diagnostics Coordinator 
 
Several states in 2010 are conducting surveys for the European Grapevine Moth (EGVM) , 
Lobesia botrana, under CAPS and Farm Bill funding.  These guidelines are for state and PPQ 
personnel servicing traps, for screeners, and for taxonomists involved with the survey.  
 
All traps that are approved for the EGVM survey are sticky traps must be sorted and screened for 
suspect adult moths in the family Tortricidae. (Larvae should not be surveyed for and will not be 
identified as part of this survey.) Proper sorting and screening will limit the material forwarded

 and for taxonomists involved with the survey.  
 
All traps that are approved for the EGVM survey are sticky traps must be sorted and screened for 
suspect adult moths in the family Tortricidae. (Larvae should not be surveyed for and will not be 
identified as part of this survey.) Proper sorting and screening will limit the material forwarded 
to the taxonomic specialists in your state capable of identifying suspects of this species.  Because 
the adults are small and have somewhat variable wing patterns, morphological screening can be 
difficult.  The often obscured condition of specimens captured in sticky traps further compounds 
the difficulty in recognizing suspects of the target species.   
 
Fortunately traps baited with the EGVM pheromone lure are thought to be more specific than the 
Light brown apple moth pheromone, but will likely still capture other moth species including 
other tortricids. Some of these non-target, endemic species may be similar to EGVM in 
appearance.  Consequently, most screening for this survey will occur by someone familiar with 
characteristics of tortricids and identifications of suspects by a taxonomist familiar with the 
characteristics described in the “Screening and Identification Aid for the EGVM” by Todd 
Gilligan, Steven Passoa, and Marc Epstein, seen below. 
 
Traps should be serviced at regular intervals according the guidance provided by the program. If 
traps are stored for more than a few days after collection, they should be kept in a cool location 
such as a refrigerator until they can be examined and processed.  This will prevent deterioration 
of the specimens.  Do not freeze traps except to kill the adults still alive in traps, which is 
necessary.  And do not send live moths in traps through the

traps are stored for more than a few days after collection, they should be kept in a cool location 
such as a refrigerator until they can be examined and processed.  This will prevent deterioration 
of the specimens.  Do not freeze traps except to kill the adults still alive in traps, which is 
necessary.  And do not send live moths in traps through the mail to other locations.  
 
Sorting of Traps 
 
Sorting can be performed at the field level to only select traps with Lepidoptera of the 
appropriate shape and size according to the screening aid guidance.  
 
1st Level Screening of Traps 
 
1st Level Screening is defined as recognizing moths that appear to be in the family Tortricidae. 
This will require examination through a good hand-lens or preferably through a dissecting 
microscope and should be performed by a screener with experience or training in recognizing 
characteristics of Lepidoptera families.  Traps containing suspect tortricid moths, or if there is 
any doubt, are to be sent to a diagnostic laboratory or taxonomist in the state experienced with 
adult Lepidoptera identification.

2nd Level Screening of Traps 
 
2nd Level Screening is defined as selection of suspect EGVM based on external wing pattern 
characteristics and dissection of the male’s abdomen to inspect the genitalia. This should be 
performed by a taxonomist familiar with Lepidoptera dissection techniques. When forwarding 
dissected specimens, the genitalia from these specimens should not be mounted on slides.  The 
genitalia should be sent forward in alcohol in a vial (in microvials with
Text Len: 1617
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of the male’s abdomen to inspect the genitalia. This should be 
performed by a taxonomist familiar with Lepidoptera dissection techniques. When forwarding 
dissected specimens, the genitalia from these specimens should not be mounted on slides.  The 
genitalia should be sent forward in alcohol in a vial (in microvials with glycerin if available) with 
the whole adult moth specimen for final identification. 
 
The routing and confirmation of the EGVM from either screening level will depend on the stated 
taxonomic ability of a state/PPQ taxonomic infrastructure. State departments of agriculture, 
universities, or PPQ in a state with the taxonomic ability and capacity to make determinations to 
the 2nd level screening will first forward any suspect EGVM specimens to one of the PPQ-
designated Lepidoptera Identifiers listed below.  If confirmed as suspect EGVM that potentially 
represent new state or county records, the specimen(s) will be forwarded to John Brown with the 
USDA-ARS Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Washington, DC for final confirmation.   
 
States that do not have 1st and/or 2nd level screening ability can forward specimens or sorted 
whole traps to one of the PPQ-designated Lepidoptera Identifiers. Prior approval and notification 
for doing this must go through the PPQ Regional Survey Coordinators informing them of the 
need, and the number of traps anticipated.

Communications of Results 
 
Not all of the moths in the trap will be identified by PPQ-designated Lepidoptera 
taxonomists to the species level if not suspect EGVM.  Negative results mean EGVM is 
not in the sample.  All negative EGVM determinations made by PPQ-designated 
Lepidoptera identifiers will be communicated by them by e-mail back to the SPHD, 
SPRO, regional program managers, and submitter in the state of origin.  These can be 
accumulated and sent summarized in a spreadsheet at the end of the week.  
 
Any positive suspect EGVM identification that are not new state or county records will 
be also communicated directly, but daily as they occur, to the SPRO, SPHD, and 
submitter and the EGVM  regional survey coordinators. 
 
When PPQ-designated Identifiers are forwarding a suspect new state or county EGVM 
records, notification that specimens are being forwarded to SEL will be sent by e-mail to 
ppq.nis.urgents@aphis.usda.gov e-mail address.  A copy of the PPQ form 391 with the 
tentative determination must be e-mailed or faxed to the NIS urgent team (PPQ National

Identification Service, fax number: 301-734-5276).  The NIS urgent team will have the 
PPQ form 391 information entered in the PestID system and notify SEL that specimen(s) 
are being forwarded for final confirmation. NIS will send an e-mail alert to the 
headquarters PPQ Emergency and Domestic Programs staff that suspect EGVM  
specimens from a new state or county are being forwarded to SEL for confirmation. They 
will in turn notify the SPHD and SPRO in the state of origin, the Regional Program 
Managers.  
 
Once SEL makes a final determination, positive or negative, the notification will be sent 
to the PPQ Emergency and Domestic Programs staff in Riverdale, MD who will forward 
the confirmations to the national and regional program mangers, SPHD and SPRO, who 
in turn will notify the appropriate state level personnel including the submitter. 
 
European Grapevine Moth
Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiff.)
 The European grapevine moth (EGVM), Lobesia botrana 
(Denis & Schiffermüller), is one of the most destructive grape 
pests in the Palearctic. L. botrana larvae cause damage to grapes 
by feeding on fruit, resulting in direct damage and secondary 
infection of feeding sites by botrytis bunch rot (gray mold;

rana 
(Denis & Schiffermüller), is one of the most destructive grape 
pests in the Palearctic. L. botrana larvae cause damage to grapes 
by feeding on fruit, resulting in direct damage and secondary 
infection of feeding sites by botrytis bunch rot (gray mold; 
Fungi). L. botrana  was discovered infesting grapes in Napa 
Valley, California in 2009; it has not been reported from North 
America outside of California. 
 L. botrana is a member of the Tortricidae, a large family 
of moths (Lepidoptera) that includes many pest species. In North 
America there are approximately 1200 species of tortricids, 
which are often referred to as “leafrollers” because the larvae 
of some species feed inside a rolled leaf. Most tortricid moths 
are small and brown with a wingspan of approximately 10-30 
mm. L. botrana can be distinguished from many other tortricids 
by its wing pattern and small size; however some species are 
superficially similar to L. botrana. Other species of Lobesia and 
related Paralobesia (both subfamily Olethreutinae) are present 
in North America, and a genitalic dissection is necessary to 
separate these species from L. botrana in most cases.
 This aid is designed to assist in the screening and 
identification of L. botrana adults collected from sticky traps in 
the United States. It covers basic sorting of traps, first and second 
level screening, and identification based on morphological

 Lobesia botrana  pheromone traps should be sorted 
initially for the presence of moths of the appropriate size, 
color, and shape. Traps that contain moths meeting all of the 
following requirements should be moved to level 1 screening:
 1) Moths are approximately 4-7 mm (¼ inch)
  long (forewing length) (Figs. 5 & 6)
 2) Moths have an overall shape that is similar to
  the outline depicted in Fig. 4. Note that moths
  caught on their side or back may have a 
  different outline (Fig. 6).
 3) Moths appear superficially similar to those 
  depicted in Figs. 1-2 & 6-7.
 The appearance of moths caught in sticky traps can 
vary substantially depending on the amount of sticky glue on 
the moth. For this reason, any small, tortrid-like moth should 
be sent forward to level 1 screening.

 Moths that meet the sorting requirements should be screened 
for suspect tortricids. Level 1 screening is difficult for small moths 
and may need to be performed by a trained Lepidopterist. When 
in doubt distinguishing first level screening characters, forward 
traps that have passed the sorting requirements to a trained 
taxonomist. Suspect tortricids in traps should not be manipulated or 
removed for screening unless expertise is available.
 Tortricid moths can be identified by the following combination 
of characters:
 1) Antennae simple, thread-like, and never
  pectinate (feathery).
 2) Tympanum absent. Members of the Pyraloidea may 
  appear similar but have a tympanum at the base of
  the abdomen.
 3) Labial palpi pointed and project forward. Some
  families have labial palpi that curve upwards.
 4) Maxillary palpi are very reduced and not visible in
  tortricids. Maxillary palpi may be visible under
  magnification in some commonly intercepted
  pyralid species.
 4) Proboscis (tongue) unscaled. Members of the
  Gelechioidea and Pyraloidea have a scaled
  proboscis.
 5) Chaetosema (patch of bristle-like setae) present
  above the compound eye. (Chaetosema may be
  difficult to see without a high-quality microscope.)
 Moths meeting the above criteria should be sent to level

 Moths meeting the above criteria should be sent to level

packed following the steps outlined in Fig. 8. Traps can be folded, 
with stickum-glue on the inside, making sure the two halves are 
not touching, secured loosely with a rubber band, and placed in a 
plastic bag for shipment. Insert 2-3 styrofoam packing peanuts on 
trap surfaces without moths to cushion and prevent the two sticky 
surfaces from sticking during shipment to taxonomists. DO NOT 
simply fold traps flat or cover traps with transparent wrap (or other 
material), as this will guarantee specimens will be seriously damaged 
or pulled apart – making identification difficult or impossible.

http://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/LBAM/dissections.html
 Cleaned specimens should be pinned and labeled. Initial 
screening is based on wing pattern, which varies little between 
individuals. L. botrana  and close relatives can be separated from 
most other Nearctic tortricids by a combination of the following 
wing characters (depicted in red in Figs. 9 & 10); note that male 
L. botrana lack a forewing costal fold:
Wing Pattern
 1) All L. botrana individuals have a prominent
  leaden-gray bar that runs across the middle of 
  the forewing (Fig. 9). Often this bar is outlined 
  in white. In a resting individual these markings 
  form a complete, transverse, gray bar across 
  the middle of the specimen (Fig. 10).
 2) Many L. botrana individuals have a prominent
  inverted “Y” in the outer half of the forewing.
  This “Y” is formed from leaden-gray scales 
  outlined in white (Figs. 9 & 10). This feature may
  not be evident in some specimens, especially 
  those that are worn; however close examination
  should reveal some remnants of this pattern

 Specimens that pass initial wing pattern screening most

procedures for Lepidoptera are outlined in Clarke (1951) and 
Robinson (1976). Separated abdomens and genitalia preparations 
should be carefully labeled to remain associated with pinned 
specimens. Specimens may need to be sent to a tortricid specialist 
for positive identification.

  from the corpus bursae which is gradually enlarged
  anteriorly (Fig. 12).
 2) A long, feather-shaped signum is present (Fig. 12).
 
 Male Nearctic Paralobesia have a cluster of long setae (the 
saccular tuft) that extends from the ventral margin of the valva that 
is not present in L. botrana. Most female Nearctic Paralobesia lack 
a signum.
 Paralobesia viteana  is a native pest of grapes in eastern 
North America. This species is easily separated from L. botrana by 
genitalic characters: male P . viteana have a prominent lobe projecting 
from the valva that is absent in L. botrana, and female P . viteana 
lack a signum. The only common native Lobesia species in eastern 
North America, L. carduana , is not likely to be associated with 
grapes. Gilligan et al. (2008) should be consulted for identification

have been recorded. Neither are likely to be associated with grapes 
and both can be separated from L. botrana by genitalic characters. 
Powell and Opler (2009) should be consulted for identification of 
olethreutines in western North America.

Key to Screen and Identify L. botrana 
Suspects in the United States
 The following key covers screening and 
identification of suspect L. botrana . Sticky traps 
normally capture only males moths, although female 
moths have been captured in California. Both sexes of 
moths are included; figures on previous pages should 
be consulted for specific characters.
1.  Abdominal or thoracic tympanum present;
 antenna pectinate; labial palpi upturned;
 proboscis scaled or absent; moths not about
 4-7 mm long ..............................Not
