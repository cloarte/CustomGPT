Leaves arranged alternately in 2 ranks, differentiated into sheath, blade, and an adaxial erect appendage at sheath/blade junction (ligule); leaf sheath surrounding and supporting culm-internode, split to base or infrequently tubular with partially or completely fused margins, modified with reduced blade in bamboos (culm sheaths); leaf blades divergent, usually long, narrow and flat, but varying from inrolled and filiform to ovate, veins parallel, sometimes with cross-connecting veinlets (especially in bamboos); ligule membranous or a line of hairs.

Inflorescence terminal or axillary, an open, contracted, or spikelike panicle, or composed of lax to spikelike racemes arranged along an elongate central axis, or digitate, paired, or occasionally solitary; axillary inflorescences often many, subtended by spatheoles (specialized bladeless leaf sheaths) and gathered into a leafy compound panicle; spikelets often aggregated into complex clusters in bamboos. Spikelets composed of distichous bracts arranged along a slender axis (rachilla); typically 2 lowest bracts (glumes) empty, subtending 1 to many florets; glumes often poorly differentiated from accompanying bracts in bamboos. Florets composed of 2 opposing bracts enclosing a single small flower, outer bract (lemma) clasping the more delicate, usually 2-keeled inner bract (palea); base of floret often with thickened prolongation articulated with rachilla (callus); lemma often with apical or dorsal bristle (awn), glumes also sometimes awned.

Fruit normally a dry indehiscent caryopsis with thin pericarp firmly adherent to seed, pericarp rarely free, fleshy in some bamboos; embryo small or large; hilum punctate to linear.About 700 genera and 11,000 species: widely distributed in all regions of the world; 28 tribes, 226 genera (seven endemic), and 1795 species (809 endemic) in China.Grasses are present throughout China, but the largest area of natural grassland lies in the northern part of the country, forming part of the temperate Eurasian steppe. Much of this area has now been converted from rangeland into farmland with wheat (Triticum) as the major food crop. The moister grasslands of northeast China support forest steppe, the dominant natural grasses beingLeymus chinensisandStipa grandis. The climate becomes progressively drier eastward, supporting steppe and semidesert steppe. Species ofStipaare dominant, withAgropyron,Cleistogenes,Koeleria, andLeymus. Common grasses of the dry alpine steppe of the high Xizang-Qinghai Plateau include species ofElymus,Festuca,Leymus,Poa,Puccinellia, andStipa.

Desert grasses of northwest China include sand-binding species ofAeluropus,Cleistogenes, andOrinus.In warm, subtropical areas of southern China widespread tropical genera are well represented, includingCymbopogon,Digitaria,Eulalia,Paspalum,Pennisetum, andSetaria. The major food crop here is rice (Oryza). Other tropical genera with their center of distribution in southeast Asia extend into China, includingArundinella,Isachne, andMicrostegium. Extensive pure stands ofPhacelurus latifoliusare found in coastal salt marshes, as are introduced species ofSpartina.Phragmitesspecies form large colonies in the shallow margins of inland lakes and rivers.The subfamilies of Poaceae are not included here, as they are largely based on non-morphological characters that are not readily available for identification purposes. However, the traditional grass tribes, as broadly accepted over the last two decades, do mainly have a morphological expression, backed up by characteristics of anatomy, embryology, and other cryptic characters. With practice and increasing familiarity with the family, it is usually possible to assign an unknown grass to a tribe without undue difficulty. The tribe is therefore taken as the primary division here.Modern molecular systematic studies are providing new insights into grass relationships. This new information has been incorporated where it has proved possible to link it to morphology, mainly by the separation ofDanthonieaefromArundineaeand the repositioning of a few individual genera.
