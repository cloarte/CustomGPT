USDA Departmental Regulation 
(DR) 1020-006:
Public Access to Scholarly 
Publications and Digital Scientific 
Research Data

   
Public access makes scientific 
information freely available to all. 
Benefits of public access include:
Equal access to 
research 
products
Discovery and 
innovation in 
agricultural 
research
Enablement of 
data-driven 
decision-making
Scientific 
accountability, 
transparency, 
and integrity

Federal Drivers of Public Access
• Federal requirements laid out in two White House Office of 
S
cience and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandums: 
• Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded 
Scientific Research (2013)
• Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to 
Federally Funded Research (2022)
• Implementation is ongoing across federal science 
agenc
ies; coordination through NSTC Subcommittee on 
Open Science
• Alignment with implementation of other external drivers 
(
e.g., OPEN Government Data Act of 2018)

2022 OSTP Memorandum: Ensuring Free, Immediate, 
and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research
1. Update their public access policies as soon as possible, 
and 
no later than December 31st, 2025, to make 
publications and their supporting data resulting from 
federally funded research publicly accessible without an 
embargo on their free and public release
2. Establish transparent procedures that ensure scientific and 
r
esearch integrity is maintained in public access policies
3. Coordinate with OSTP to ensure equi table delivery of 
federally funded research results and data

Implementation Plan Roadmap: FY 2024
• Continue customer and stakeholder engagement to validate information 
and requirements for making USDA-funded research freely, immediately, 
and equitably accessible by December 31, 2025. 
• Make changes to existing USDA public access policy, following statutory 
and regulatory requirements and processes, so that USDA can implement 
new policies by December 31, 2025. 
• Ensure ongoing operations and maintenance, and enhancements to 
PubAg, Ag Data Commons, and research management systems to ensure 
public access to USDA-funded research outputs, with an emphasis on 
digital persistent identifier issues to integrate research outputs consistently 
and at scale. 
• Prototype automated reporting frameworks and processes needed to 
analyze policy effectiveness. 
• Develop plans to carry out likely development needs as well as needs 
revealed during the policy development and implementation process. 
• Develop new outreach and training materials and validate them with 
customers and community stakeholders. 

Scope of DR 1020-006

Scope: 
Peer-reviewed 
journal articles 
published by 
nongovernmental 
organizations
Accepted manuscripts must be made freely 
available to the public through PubAg within 
12 months of upon publication.
In most cases these should be 
submitted to submit.nal.usda.gov.
Final published articles may be submitted to 
PubAg to satisfy this requirement, if the author 
has the right to share the published version 
(i.e., open access articles)
2. Requirements for Digital Scientific 
Research Data

Digital scientific 
research data 
that are 
appropriate for

2. a. Requirements for Digital Scientific 
Research Data
Digital scientific research data assets should be made publicly accessible to 
fullest extent practicable.
However, nine categories of digital scientific research data assets should not 
be made publicly accessible, including:
• Data that would not be necessary for validation of scientific research findings (i.e., trivial data)
• Data assets that include personally identifiable information (PII) or other information that could 
enable re-identification of individuals or businesses
• Proprietary data assets
• Data assets related to protecting critical infrastructure
• Data assets related to the physical location of threatened or endangered species or sensitive 
archaeological sites
• Data assets for which release would be inconsistent with U.S. national, homeland, or economic 
security or would have significant negative impact on intellectual property rights, innovation, 
and U.S. competitiveness
• Data assets for which public access is inconsistent with agency mission (e.g., documents 
designated CUI)
• Other data assets whose release is limited by law, regulation, contract, agreement, national 
security requirements, or policy (e.g., classified data or dual-use research data)
• Data covered by a FOIA exemption
