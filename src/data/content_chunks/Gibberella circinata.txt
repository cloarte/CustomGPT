 Invasion: Fusarium circinatumis similar in appearance to closely related species. It is characterized by the production of macro- and microconidia, which are mitotically derived spores that serve to propagate the fungus under natural conditions. Both spore types are formed on natural substrata and on artificial growth media. Macroconidia are typically 3-septate, with walls that are slightly curved to nearly parallel throughout. The apical cell narrows to an inwardly (i.e. toward the ventral side) curved tip, and the basal cell is foot-shaped (i.e. it has a slight indentation or notch on the dorsal

The apical cell narrows to an inwardly (i.e. toward the ventral side) curved tip, and the basal cell is foot-shaped (i.e. it has a slight indentation or notch on the dorsal side).Nirenberg and O'Donnell (1998)report macroconidia dimensions as in the range 32-48 x 3.3-3.8 µm. The shape and size of the macroconidium inF. circinatumis similar to that in numerous other species (including many formerly grouped together in section Liseola) and thus is of limited diagnostic value. Microconidia are typically single-celled but may be septate, and are usually ovoid but can be more nearly oval or, less often, allantoid. Microconidia are borne in false heads on aerial polyphialides. In culture, the proliferation of microconidiophores, coupled with a slight twisting of the aerial mycelium on which they are borne, givesF. circinatuma distinctive colony morphology. Aerial mycelium is white, but may have slight purple or violet pigmentation. The underside of a culture may be colourless or show various colourations depending on the isolate, growth medium and culture conditions. Sectors, which form readily in some isolates, frequently differ in colour from the 'parent' colony, indicating that pigmentation is a highly mutable characteristic.

 Reproduccion: The sexual morph is readily formed under laboratory conditions and may occur in nature, but the asexual morph, F. circinatum , predominates. Two asexual propagules, macroconidia and microconidia, are presumed to be the primary form in which the pathogen is disseminated, either by wind or by insects to which spores can adhere. Bark-feeding insects commonly breed in pitch canker-killed branches and a large percentage of the emergent brood carry the pathogen. These insects (including numerous species in the genera: Pityophthorus , Ips and Conophthorus ) cannot only transport the pathogen to a new host but may also provide a wound suitable for infection and thus serve as vectors of pitch canker ( Storer et al., 1997 ). These and other insects may also serve as wounding agents for fungal propagules already present on host surfaces. The suitability of a wound for infection may depend on how rapidly it dries out. Thus, superficial wounds may require ambient moisture for an infection to occur, which could impose environmental constraints on the above-ground activity of the pathogen. Indeed, where the foliar phase of pitch canker is a problem, infections appear to be associated with locations/seasons where atmospheric moisture is readily available and temperatures are relatively warm, such as in the south-eastern USA during summer thunderstorms ( Dwinell et al., 1985 ). In California, the disease is most severe in close proximity to the coast. The distribution of the disease also suggests that cooler temperatures are restrictive ( Gordon et al., 2001 ). At moderate temperatures, the pathogen survives for 1 year or more in infected wood. Spores can survive in soil for from several months to a year or more, depending on conditions.

At moderate temperatures, the pathogen survives for 1 year or more in infected wood. Spores can survive in soil for from several months to a year or more, depending on conditions. The climatic limitations on pitch canker are less likely to apply to the seedling phase of the disease because conditions that are conducive to root growth in soil would generally also be suitable for infection by F. circinatum .
 Sintomas: When seedling mortality results from sowing infested seed, damping-off may occur prior to or after emergence. In the latter case, the fungus typically rots the hypocotyl at or near the soil-line and the seedling collapses. It is also possible for post-emergence infection to occur via cotyledons. This manifests itself as necrosis moving basipetally from the still-attached seed coat through the cotyledons towards the stem. Either avenue of infection occurs early in the life of the seedling, which may appear little different from a seedling killed by any number of other pathogens. Infection can also occur via soilborne propagules. Root infections are most often observed on seedlings in nurseries or Christmas tree farms, but can also occur on exposed roots of larger trees in landscape plantings. In Christmas tree farms, the pathogen may extensively colonize the root system, causing a brown discolouration and disintegration of the cortex. Above-ground symptoms are generally not apparent until the pathogen has reached the root crown and girdled the stem. This results in a uniform loss of colour in the foliage (see Pictures), which fades first to a dull green, then yellow and finally brown (dead). Pitching is evident on the main stem near the soil-line, and removal of the bark reveals a resin-soaked

 Above-ground symptoms are generally not apparent until the pathogen has reached the root crown and girdled the stem. This results in a uniform loss of colour in the foliage (see Pictures), which fades first to a dull green, then yellow and finally brown (dead). Pitching is evident on the main stem near the soil-line, and removal of the bark reveals a resin-soaked phloem/cambium/xylem with a honey-brown to dark-brown discolouration. Pitch canker also causes symptoms through direct infections of branches and stems on trees of any age. This usually begins as branch dieback resulting from girdling at an infection site, which is often a cone node or non-cone branch whorl, but may also occur in inter-nodal regions. The earliest symptom is wilting of the needles distal to the infection site, which can be recognized by an accumulation of resin on the branch surface (see Pictures). Wilted needles lose their lustrous green colour and eventually become chlorotic, before turning red and finally brown; abscission tends to occur quickly and uniformly, leaving naked tips (see Pictures). The pace of this progression may vary depending on the season and the age of the infected branch. Early in the season, succulent branches may droop, giving the appearance of a shepherd's crook (see Pictures). Removal of the bark at an infection site reveals resin-soaked tissue with a brown discolouration. Individual infections do not progress very far axially along the infected stem, and their impact is typically limited to branch death distal to the infection. The disease intensifies through repeated infections (see Pictures), which can lead to extensive dieback in the canopy (see Pictures). Although initial infections are usually near branch tips, larger diameter branches and the main stem (trunk) of the tree may eventually sustain infections.

Although initial infections are usually near branch tips, larger diameter branches and the main stem (trunk) of the tree may eventually sustain infections. This process accelerates the decline of the tree and girdling of the main stem often leads to top-kill and, in some cases, death of the entire tree. Infections on the trunk of the tree often produce copious amounts of resin which can coat large areas of the bark (see Pictures).
