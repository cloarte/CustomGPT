RE: AWA License Application Packet 
 
Dear Applicant: 
 
Thank you for your interest in obtaining a license under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
(USDA) Animal Care (AC) program. Included in this packet are the required forms and information 
you will need to complete your application. Prior to submitting your application, we recommend 
using our Licensing and Registration Assistant to ensure your operation meets our requirements 
and receive guidance on what class of license you require. All application fees are non-refundable; 
therefore, if you are unsure whether a license is required, please contact Animal Care to discuss 
your specific business model before applying. 
 
The application process generally takes 4-6 months  to complete. However, under certain 
circumstances, your application may require further review. Some reasons an application requires 
further review could include but are not limited to the following: 
 
• Prior revocations or suspensions of a license or registration. 
• Prior pleas of nolo contendere (no contest) or prior  violations of any Federal, State, or local 
laws pertaining to animal cruelty, transportation, ownership, neglect, or welfare of animals. 
• If you are currently or would be operating in violation of or circumventing any other Federal, 
State, or local laws. 
• If you have made any false or fraudulent statements or provided false or fraudulent records to 
our department or other agencies. 
Once the application is processed , you will be contacted by a field inspector to schedule a pre -
licensing inspection. Prior to your inspection, you must have your veterinarian complete and sign

 circumventing any other Federal, 
State, or local laws. 
• If you have made any false or fraudulent statements or provided false or fraudulent records to 
our department or other agencies. 
Once the application is processed , you will be contacted by a field inspector to schedule a pre -
licensing inspection. Prior to your inspection, you must have your veterinarian complete and sign 
a Program of Veterinary Care Form (APHIS Form 7002 or 7002A). Your inspector will request 
and review this form during the inspection, so please keep these forms on hand and do not send 
them to the office. 
 
Once full compliance with the AWA regulations and standards has been demonstrated, a three-year 
license will be issued. Please note that by signing the application form, you are acknowledging that 
you have reviewed and understand the Act, regulations, and standards, and that you agree to remain 
in compliance at all times.  Failure to maintain compliance at any licensed insp ection site could 
result in enforcement action against your license, thereby impacting all inspection sites. Contact 
this office if you have any questions at 970-494-7478 or via email at AnimalCare@usda.gov.

RE: AWA License Application Packet 
 
Dear Applicant: 
 
Thank you for your interest in obtaining a license under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
(USDA) Animal Care (AC) program. Included in this packet are the required forms and information 
you will need to complete your application. Prior to submitting your application, we recommend 
using our Licensing and Registration Assistant to ensure your operation meets our requirements 
and receive guidance on what class of license you require. All application fees are non-refundable; 
therefore, if you are unsure whether a license is required, please contact Animal Care to discuss 
your specific business model before applying. 
 
The application process generally takes 4-6 months  to complete. However, under certain 
circumstances, your application may require further review. Some reasons an application requires 
further review could include but are not limited to the following: 
 
• Prior revocations or suspensions of a license or registration. 
• Prior pleas of nolo contendere (no contest) or prior  violations of any Federal, State, or local 
laws pertaining to animal cruelty, transportation, ownership, neglect, or welfare of animals. 
• If you are currently or would be operating in violation of or circumventing any other Federal, 
State, or local laws. 
• If you have made any false or fraudulent statements or provided false or fraudulent records to 
our department or other agencies. 
Once the application is processed , you will be contacted by a field inspector to schedule a pre -
licensing inspection. Prior to your inspection, you must have your veterinarian complete and sign

 circumventing any other Federal, 
State, or local laws. 
• If you have made any false or fraudulent statements or provided false or fraudulent records to 
our department or other agencies. 
Once the application is processed , you will be contacted by a field inspector to schedule a pre -
licensing inspection. Prior to your inspection, you must have your veterinarian complete and sign 
a Program of Veterinary Care Form (APHIS Form 7002 or 7002A). Your inspector will request 
and review this form during the inspection, so please keep these forms on hand and do not send 
them to the office. 
 
Once full compliance with the AWA regulations and standards has been demonstrated, a three-year 
license will be issued. Please note that by signing the application form, you are acknowledging that 
you have reviewed and understand the Act, regulations, and standards, and that you agree to remain 
in compliance at all times.  Failure to maintain compliance at any licensed insp ection site could 
result in enforcement action against your license, thereby impacting all inspection sites. Contact 
this office if you have any questions at 970-494-7478 or via email at AnimalCare@usda.gov.
