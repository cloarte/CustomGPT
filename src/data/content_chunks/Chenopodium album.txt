, more or less coated with white mealy pubescence. Cotyledons petiole, lanceolate-linear, mealy, bluish-grey with a reddish tinge beneath, 6–12 mm long and 1.5–4 mm broad (Korsmo et al., 1981). Roots stout and tapering at the end. Many branches may emerge from main tap root system. Epidermal cells are more or less polygonal in shape. Fewer, smaller stomata on upper compared to lower leaf surface (Srivastava, 1967). Stems erect, branched towards apex, 0.2–2 m tall, glabrous, furrowed, often with red or light-green streaks, branching varies from slight to extensive. Leaves alternate, simple ovate to rhomboid-oval, uppermost leaves mostly lanceolate, sometimes linear and sessile, glabrous, usually white with a mealy-covering, particularly on young leaves, all leaves densely covered with small, utriculate hairs. Inflorescence in irregular spikes clustered in panicles at the ends of the branches. Flower perfect, small, sessile, green; calyx of 5 sepals that are more or less keeled and nearly covering the mature fruit; petals 1; stamens 5, pistil 1, with 2 or 3 styles, ovary single-celled, attached at right angles to the flower axis. Fruits is an achene (seed covered by the thin papery pericarp). Seed nearly circular in outline, oval in cross section, sides convex, glossy, black, mean size 1.5 mm x 1.4 mm in diameter, weight 1.2 mg.

 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: C. album reproduces solely by seed. Individuals of this species demonstrate a great deal of plasticity in response to their edaphic and biotic environment, and seed production varies greatly according to these factors. Average seed production varies between 3000 and 20,000 seeds/plant Korsmo et al. (1981) , but as many as 50,000–70,000 seeds per plant have been found Mandal and Pal (1990). Seeds are able to remain viable for extended periods in the soil seed bank, perhaps for up to 40 years Toole and Brown (1946) . The seeds exhibit considerable polymorphy; some are smooth, some striate, and others possess a raised reticulum. Testa colour also varies significantly and can be black and shiny, brown or brownish-green. All of these variations in colour and form may be found in the seeds of a single plant ( Holm et al., 1977 ). It appears that different seed morphs vary in their dormancy and germination requirements. This variation enables the species to germinate under a range of environmental conditions and may contribute greatly to its success as a weed ( Maurya and Ambasht, 1973 ). C. album is autogamous but also wind pollinated, and flowers are occasionally visited by insects ( Blackwell and Powell, 1981 ). C. album has no specialized seed dispersal mechanisms, so that the majority of seeds simply fall to the ground around the parent plant. They are not buoyant, but may be transported long distances by water. A percentage of seed also passes unharmed through animals and may be transported in this way ( Holm et al., 1977 ). Typically,

They are not buoyant, but may be transported long distances by water. A percentage of seed also passes unharmed through animals and may be transported in this way ( Holm et al., 1977 ). Typically, freshly harvested seeds exhibit approximately 35% germinability. Low-temperature treatments of between 0°C and 5°C increase germination, as do alternating low and high temperatures, scarification and prolonged soaking over 20 days. Germination is slow for seeds following dry, indoor storage, but rapid for seeds overwintered in the field. In general, germination optima for this species are at 10°C in India, and 25°C in Canada, reflecting the fact that in temperate countries C. album usually behaves as a summer annual and in subtropical countries as a winter annual. Two distinct germination peaks have been recorded in Europe, one between March and May and a second between August and October ( Fryer and Makepeace, 1977 ). In colder climates maximum seedling emergence has been observed between May and July with a peak in the last two weeks of June ( Lapointe et al., 1985 ). The maximum depth from which buried seed is able to emerge is 5 cm ( Korsmo et al., 1981 ), and percentage germination is greatest from seeds lying at, or just below the soil surface. C. album will flower in any daylength, but an 8-hour photoperiod considerably hastens flowering and maturity. Larger, more vigorous plants result from a long photoperiod (16–18 hours), and for this reason the species is more extensively distributed in temperate zones and sparsely distributed around the equator ( Holm et al., 1977 ).

The detailed review by Bassett and Crompton (1978) provides some further information. C. album occurs from sea level to altitudes of 3600 m, and from latitudes 70°N to more than 50°S. It is a common weed of almost all cultivated crops and found on wasteland, in pastures and strips of uncultivated land, and along roadsides and riverbanks. It is tolerant of a wide range of cultural conditions, climates, soil types, fertility and pH. Growing in temperatures of 5–30°C it is frost tolerant. It is most vigorous in fertile, heavy and well-irrigated soils (reaching up to 2 m in height), often remaining as a dwarf in dryer and less fertile soils. The size, vigour and reproductive capacity of individual plants is affected by intraspecific competition, but less so by competition from wheat ( Williams, 1964 ; Koblihova et al., 1987 ). Seed production potential, therefore, varies greatly according to the density of weed populations, and agronomic practices which result in a thick canopy cover will lead to less seed return to the seed bank, as increased density results in shorter plants, fewer inflorescences and reduced seed production.

It is tolerant of a wide range of cultural conditions, climates, soil types, fertility and pH. Growing in temperatures of 5–30°C it is frost tolerant. It is most vigorous in fertile, heavy and well-irrigated soils (reaching up to 2 m in height), often remaining as a dwarf in dryer and less fertile soils. The size, vigour and reproductive capacity of individual plants is affected by intraspecific competition, but less so by competition from wheat ( Williams, 1964 ; Koblihova et al., 1987 ). Seed production potential, therefore, varies greatly according to the density of weed populations, and agronomic practices which result in a thick canopy cover will lead to less seed return to the seed bank, as increased density results in shorter plants, fewer inflorescences and reduced seed production.
