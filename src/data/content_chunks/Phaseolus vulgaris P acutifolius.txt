These are beans that ripen prior to harvest and are threshed dry fromthe pods. Only the ripe seeds are marketed. Four main types are grown asfollows: (1) Medium type includes Pinto, Great Northern, Sutter, Pink Bayo, andSmall Red or Mexican Red; (2) Pea or Navy; (3) Kidney; and (4) Marrow. Seedsvary in size from about 1/3 inch long in the pea or navy bean to 3/4 inch inthe Kidney. All plants are of bush type. They are usually cut or pulled whenmost pods are ripe, then vines and pods are allowed to dry before threshing.
The Tepary bean
P. acutifolius
, is native to southwestern U.S. andMexico and long grown by the Indians there. It is highly heat and droughtresistant, but eating quality is less desirable than
P. vulgaris
.Culture is similar to that of other dry or field beans.
Season, bloom to harvest
: 3 to 3.5 months.
Production in the U. S.:
900,000 tons.
Use
: Commercially canned, soup, cooked in homes.
Part of plant consumed
: Seed only.
