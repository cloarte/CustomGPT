 Invasion: Meloidogyne artielliahas the typical morphology and morphometry ofMeloidogynespp. The egg is similar to other species ofMeloidogyneand the most important stages are described here. The species was described byFranklin (1961)and later other authors described the species morphologically and morphometrically (Whitehead, 1968;Karssen and Hoenselaar, 1998;Imren et al., 2014). Morphometrical data of these populations are included in Table 1. Infective stage is the second-stage juvenile and this stage with males could be found in sampled soil. While females occur only in the roots.

 Reproduccion: Chromosome number is not available. Hybridization tests with closely related Meloidogyne species have not been performed. Meloidogyne artiellia reproduces asexually, but has the ability to reproduce sexually when conditions are appropriate ( Giorgi et al., 2002 ). Adults have been observed after 14-18 days following root penetration and optimal temperatures for nematode development (15-25ºC). Hatching starts at temperatures between 5 and 10ºC, but the optimal is at temperatures between 15 and 25ºC. Eggs will not hatch under extended dry periods but may persist in soil or dry roots awaiting more favourable moist soil conditions. Juveniles may become inactive under dry conditions. Longevity is not determined, but other female Meloidogyne species could be alive in the host for several months. Males do not feed on roots, are vermiform and move out of the root after they complete their development and they survive in the soil for several weeks. Humidity and optimal temperature are needed for hatching and host root penetration. It is not clear if root exudates stimulate the hatching, but eggs in egg masses hatch spontaneously in water if temperature is above 5ºC. At the end of the host crop, populations reach the maximal level. Each female lays in the egg mass from 110 to 596 eggs ( Fernández et al., 2005 ). The reproductive fitness, determined by the number of eggs per egg mass, was significantly influenced by the host plant (wheat is a better host than chickpea), nematode population, as well as the host plant × nematode population interaction ( Fernández et al., 2005 ). Nematodes must interact closely with the host plant in order to create the feeding site. There has been a difference detected in reproduction depending on the host ( Fernández et al., 2005 ). Plant senescence could influence the development of juveniles

Nematodes must interact closely with the host plant in order to create the feeding site. There has been a difference detected in reproduction depending on the host ( Fernández et al., 2005 ). Plant senescence could influence the development of juveniles and the ratio of females/males in Meloidogyne ( Eisenback, 1985 ), but it may not be so with M. artiellia . This species could interact with fungal vascular pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceris . In two genotypes of chickpea with complete resistance to Fusarium wilt, infection by M. artiellia overcame resistance to F. oxysporum f.sp . ciceri race 5 ( Castillo et al., 2003a ). Females develop after an accumulation of 230-240 degree days over 10ºC.
 Sintomas: Root galls are very small, difficult to detect and often are covered by large egg masses (see Pictures) and in some cases associated with a proliferation of lateral roots. Infected plants show chlorotic leaves and poor growth in patches ( Greco et al., 1992 ) (see Pictures). Symptoms may not be apparent until plants reach later stages of growth. Feeding side in the roots and the level of root infection could limit water uptake and cause physiological problems for the plant during periods of high-water demand, usually at the end of the crop cycle. Infested plants may appear wilted under hot and sunny conditions and symptoms may not be apparent until plants reach later stages of growth. In wheat, spikes are sparse and reduced in size and in chickpea, pods are few, small or without seeds ( Greco et al., 1992 ), and the reduction of protein content of chickpea seeds has been demonstrated ( Vito and

Inside the feeding sites are giant cells on which the nematode feeds, the number of nuclei per giant cell was significantly smaller, and the maximum diameters of nuclei and nucleoli were significantly greater in giant cells induced by M. artiellia isolates than in those induced by Meloidogyne arenaria , Meloidogyne incognita or Meloidogyne javanica using chickpea cv. UC 27 as hosts ( Vovlas et al., 2005b ) (see Pictures). This feeding site phenotype was also found in faba bean (cv. Minor) and rapeseed (var. oleifera ) ( Vovlas et al., 2005b ).
