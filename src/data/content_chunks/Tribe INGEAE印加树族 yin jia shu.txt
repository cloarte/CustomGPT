NielsenLeaves pinnate or bipinnate; stipules most often inconspicuous, sometimes spinescent; petiole, rachis, and pinnae most often with glands; leaflets opposite or (rarely) alternate, rarely 1-foliolate. Flowers heteromorphic or not, in heads, corymbs, umbels, racemes, spikes, or panicles, these again axillary or arranged in axillary and/or terminal panicle, cauliflory present in some genera. Calyx gamosepalous, valvate. Corolla gamopetalous, valvate. Stamens numerous, lower part of filaments united into a tube; anther glandless; pollen-grains usually collected into 2-6 masses in each locus. Ovaries 1 to many, free. Legumes various, dehiscent or not, straight, spirally contorted to curved, moniliform or not, segmented or not, funicular aril present in a few species. Seeds various, with pleurogram or not.About 35 genera and 930-970 species: mostly distributed in tropics; seven genera (four introduced) and 38 species (five endemic, seven intro­duced) in China.1Legume dehiscent into 2 valves(2)+Legume indehiscent or late dehiscent(4)2(1)Legume curved into a circle; stipules spinescent.33Pithecellobium+Legume straight or slightly curved; stipules not spinescent(3)3(2)Legume with thickened sutures, elastically dehiscing from apex and downward; seeds with pleurogram.32Calliandra+
