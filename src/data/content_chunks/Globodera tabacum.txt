There are three bands in the lateral field. The head is offset and bears 3-4 head annules. The stylet has three anchor-shaped, anteriorly facing knobs. The stylet conus and shaft are equal in length. One third of the body length is occupied by the oesophageal glands, which overlap the anterior part of the intestine. The median bulb is robust, rounded and approximately 70 µm from the head tip. The excretory pore is about 110 µm from the head tip. The tail is finely pointed and is 50-58 µm long. The hyaline portion of the tail is usually half the tail length.FemaleStylet length=23 µm (18.5-24 µm); Stylet base to dorsal oesophageal gland duct=5.5 µm (3.8-8.0 µm); Number of head annules=4; Body length (excluding neck)=464 µm (327-688 µm); Body width="310"

At this stage the female is white followed by a yellow to golden phase which lasts until formation of the brown cyst. The head is small and bears four annules. The excretory pore is located at the base of the neck and, if using the SEM, tubercles can sometimes be seen in this region (Mota and Eisenback, 1993a). The mid-body cuticle is covered with zig-zag markings, changing to parallel ridges in the fenestral area. The vulva is contained within an area of thin walled cuticle, having a circumfenestrate fenestration. The vulval slit is approximately 9-10 µm in length, flanked either side by a crescentic arrangement of tubercles, which are both wide and discrete. No underbridge is present. The anus is distinct.CystLength excluding the neck=550 µm (337-740 µm); Maximum width="500" µm (232-645 µm); Length of fenestra=27 µm (15-32 µm); Width of fenestra=22 µm (15-28 µm); Anus to fenestral edge=35 µm; Length of vulval slit=9-10 µm; Number of ridges=5

The stylet is strong and the three stylet knobs are well developed and rounded, sloping posteriorly. The median bulb is ellipsoidal and prominent, about 95 µm from the head end. The nerve ring is located anterior to the junction of the oesophagus and intestine, where it encircles the oesophagus. The excretory pore is 160 µm from the head end. The oesophageal glands overlap the intestine ventro-laterally. The tail is short and no bursa is present. The gubernaculum is 12 µm long. According toLownsbery and Lownsbery (1954)a phasmid can be located near the tail terminus. The spicules are approximately 34 µm in length, arcuate and single tipped, which is the normal state for Globodera.Other measurements can be found inLownsbery and Lownsbery (1954),Granek (1955),Green (1971),Miller and Gray (1972), Hesling (1973, 1978),Mulvey (1973),Behrens (1975),Mulvey and Golden (1983),Othman et al.

 Reproduccion: The life cycle and the biology of the G. tabacum complex are very similar to those of the potato cyst nematodes, although they have been studied in far less detail. Green and Miller (1969) conducted studies on inter-specific hybridization between G. rostochiensis, G. pallida and all members of the G. tabacum group. F1 progeny were produced but their viability was not tested. The crossing of G. rostochiensis with G. pallida seems to be the most difficult hybridization to achieve, but it is possible ( Miller, 1983 ; Stone, 1983 ). In the 1970s, G. tabacum, G. virginiae and G. solanacearum were still considered to be separate species but studies with sex attractants showed that interbreeding of the round cyst species from solanaceous hosts was possible ( Green and Plumb, 1970 ). Greet (1972) and Greet and Firth (1977) found little difference in the protein profiles of what is now recognized as the G. tabacum complex. This was substantiated by morphological and hybridization studies (Miller, unpublished; Miller, 1983 ). Stone (1983) designated G. virginiae and G. solanacearum as subspecises of G. tabacum.An undescribed species G. 'mexicana' ( Campos-Vela, 1967 ) was also considered to be part of the G. tabacum complex. Golden and Ellington (1972) considered G.

'mexicana' as conspecific with G. tabacum virginiae but Bossis and Mugniery (1993) disagreed. Recent studies, using sophisticated biochemical technology such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis ( Bossis and Mugniery, 1993 ), rDNA techniques ( Thiery and Mugniery, 1996 ) and other molecular approaches ( Thiery et al., 1997 ), suggest that G. 'mexicana' is very closely related to G. pallida and point out similarities and differences amongst six Globodera species. G. rostochiensis stands apart from the G. tabacum tabacum complex and G. pallida, whereas G. pallida and G. 'mexicana' have many more polypeptides in common than the other combinations of species tested. The hybridization of G. rostochiensis and G. pallida produced juveniles that had stylets more like G. pallida but with lips and oral disc more like G. rostochiensis ( Mugniery, 1979 ). The hybrid juveniles from G. pallida females crossed with G. rostochiensis males were successful in penetrating potato roots but died before moulting. Hybrid crosses between G. rostochiensis females and G. pallida males penetrated potato roots and produced males, which were not fertile.

Miller (unpublished), was able to produce hybrids of potato cyst nematodes with the G. tabacum tabacum complex for many generations.Host range tests do not always show consistent results, as various combinations of the G. tabacum complex can reproduce on some cultivars of potato ( Stelter, 1987 ; Stone and Miller, 1974 ) and potato cyst nematodes are capable of reproduction on tobacco (Parrot and Miller, 1977). Stone (1983) also noted that host range is not a reliable indicator of species differences. If hybridization occurs in the field, the resulting genotype may be more able to adapt to its environment than the parent and the 'standard' population would only be conserved in geographically isolated environments.Within Globodera spp. the first stage juvenile moults inside the egg and the second stage juvenile hatches. Recent experiments by Ambrogioni et al. (1995) on G. tabacum in Italy suggest that at 26°C two generations could be produced on crops of aubergine, each taking around 36 days to complete. At 20°C the time to complete one generation was 72 days and at 30°C the cycle was shortened to 32 days. The maximum number of generations produced on aubergines in Italy is three, whereas in the USA, Barker and Lucas (1984) reported four to five generations from tobacco fields. Globodera tabacum virginiae and G. tabacum solanacerum have temperature requirements and life cycles similar to those reported in Italy ( Miller and Gray 1968 , 1972).Glasshouse and laboratory tests showed that black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) a primary host of G. tabacum tabacum ( Lownsbery and Lownsbery, 1954 )

era tabacum virginiae and G. tabacum solanacerum have temperature requirements and life cycles similar to those reported in Italy ( Miller and Gray 1968 , 1972).Glasshouse and laboratory tests showed that black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) a primary host of G. tabacum tabacum ( Lownsbery and Lownsbery, 1954 ) stimulated much greater hatch than Rutgers tomato or tobacco '86-4'. After 10 weeks in pot experiments using the same hosts, S. nigrum and tomato stimulated greater hatch of second-stage juveniles than either tobacco or bare soil ( LaMondia, 1995 ).
 Sintomas: Tobacco cyst nematodes can cause severe stunting of the aerial parts of tobacco plants and the root system is also much smaller than normal ( Milne, 1972 ). Females and cysts, coloured yellow to dark brown, can normally be seen with the naked eye on infected plant roots, 6 to 8 weeks after planting.

Miller (unpublished), was able to produce hybrids of potato cyst nematodes with the G. tabacum tabacum complex for many generations.Host range tests do not always show consistent results, as various combinations of the G. tabacum complex can reproduce on some cultivars of potato ( Stelter, 1987 ; Stone and Miller, 1974 ) and potato cyst nematodes are capable of reproduction on tobacco (Parrot and Miller, 1977). Stone (1983) also noted that host range is not a reliable indicator of species differences. If hybridization occurs in the field, the resulting genotype may be more able to adapt to its environment than the parent and the 'standard' population would only be conserved in geographically isolated environments.Within Globodera spp. the first stage juvenile moults inside the egg and the second stage juvenile hatches. Recent experiments by Ambrogioni et al. (1995) on G. tabacum in Italy suggest that at 26°C two generations could be produced on crops of aubergine, each taking around 36 days to complete. At 20°C the time to complete one generation was 72 days and at 30°C the cycle was shortened to 32 days. The maximum number of generations produced on aubergines in Italy is three, whereas in the USA, Barker and Lucas (1984) reported four to five generations from tobacco fields. Globodera tabacum virginiae and G. tabacum solanacerum have temperature requirements and life cycles similar to those reported in Italy ( Miller and Gray 1968 , 1972).Glasshouse and laboratory tests showed that black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) a primary host of G. tabacum tabacum ( Lownsbery and Lownsbery, 1954 )

era tabacum virginiae and G. tabacum solanacerum have temperature requirements and life cycles similar to those reported in Italy ( Miller and Gray 1968 , 1972).Glasshouse and laboratory tests showed that black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) a primary host of G. tabacum tabacum ( Lownsbery and Lownsbery, 1954 ) stimulated much greater hatch than Rutgers tomato or tobacco '86-4'. After 10 weeks in pot experiments using the same hosts, S. nigrum and tomato stimulated greater hatch of second-stage juveniles than either tobacco or bare soil ( LaMondia, 1995 ).
 Sintomas: Tobacco cyst nematodes can cause severe stunting of the aerial parts of tobacco plants and the root system is also much smaller than normal ( Milne, 1972 ). Females and cysts, coloured yellow to dark brown, can normally be seen with the naked eye on infected plant roots, 6 to 8 weeks after planting.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology The life cycle and the biology of the G. tabacum complex are very similar to those of the potato cyst nematodes, although they have been studied in far less detail. Green and Miller (1969) conducted studies on inter-specific hybridization between G. rostochiensis, G. pallida and all members of the G. tabacum group. F1 progeny were produced but their viability was not tested. The crossing of G. rostochiensis with G. pallida seems to be the most difficult hybridization to achieve, but it is possible ( Miller, 1983 ; Stone, 1983 ). In the 1970s, G. tabacum, G. virginiae and G. solanacearum were still considered to be separate species but studies

 were produced but their viability was not tested. The crossing of G. rostochiensis with G. pallida seems to be the most difficult hybridization to achieve, but it is possible ( Miller, 1983 ; Stone, 1983 ). In the 1970s, G. tabacum, G. virginiae and G. solanacearum were still considered to be separate species but studies with sex attractants showed that interbreeding of the round cyst species from solanaceous hosts was possible ( Green and Plumb, 1970 ). Greet (1972) and Greet and Firth (1977) found little difference in the protein profiles of what is now recognized as the G. tabacum complex. This was substantiated by morphological and hybridization studies (Miller, unpublished; Miller, 1983 ). Stone (1983) designated G. virginiae and G. solanacearum as subspecises of G. tabacum.An undescribed species G. 'mexicana' ( Campos-Vela, 1967 ) was also considered to be part of the G. tabacum complex. Golden and Ellington (1972) considered G. 'mexicana' as conspecific with G. tabacum virginiae but Bossis and Mugniery (1993) disagreed. Recent studies, using sophisticated biochemical technology such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis ( Bossis and Mugniery, 1993 ), rDNA techniques ( Thiery and Mugniery, 1996 ) and other molecular approaches ( Thiery et al., 1997 ), suggest that G. 'mexicana' is very closely related to G. pallida and point out similarities and differences amongst six Globodera species.

G. rostochiensis stands apart from the G. tabacum tabacum complex and G. pallida, whereas G. pallida and G. 'mexicana' have many more polypeptides in common than the other combinations of species tested. The hybridization of G. rostochiensis and G. pallida produced juveniles that had stylets more like G. pallida but with lips and oral disc more like G. rostochiensis ( Mugniery, 1979 ). The hybrid juveniles from G. pallida females crossed with G. rostochiensis males were successful in penetrating potato roots but died before moulting. Hybrid crosses between G. rostochiensis females and G. pallida males penetrated potato roots and produced males, which were not fertile. No hybrids were able to reproduce on potato cultivars that were resistant to G. rostochiensis. Miller (unpublished), was able to produce hybrids of potato cyst nematodes with the G. tabacum tabacum complex for many generations.Host range tests do not always show consistent results, as various combinations of the G. tabacum complex can reproduce on some cultivars of potato ( Stelter, 1987 ; Stone and Miller, 1974 ) and potato cyst nematodes are capable of reproduction on tobacco (Parrot and Miller, 1977).
