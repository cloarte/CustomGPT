 Invasion: E. heterophylla is herbaceous, erect and 20-200 cm in height (depending on growing conditions). The most common size is 40-60 cm tall. Milky latex is present when most parts of the plant are broken. The stem is branched and cylindrical, with nodes at regular intervals. The surface is smooth and reddish-green.Obovate to lanceolate leaves are formed along the stem, with secondary branches sprouting from axillary buds. Basal leaves are long-petiolate and alternate. Upper leaves are sessile and opposite or verticillate, forming a cluster of bracts, often with a pale patch at the base, subtending the terminal inflorescence. The latter consists of a dense cluster of small, short-stalked cyathia. Each cyathium comprises a cup-shaped involucre with inconspicuous male flowers producing a single stamen only, and a female flower, without sepals or petals, producing a 3-lobed, yellowish-green fruit.E. heterophylla shows variation in morphological features, mainly in leaf shape. Such variability has led to divergent opinions about the different species of the genus.Oliveira and Sa-Haiad (1988)have made taxonomic studies of E. heterophylla and E. cyanthophora.

Storage of E. heterophylla seeds at 36°C for 2-12 weeks caused a significant decrease in dormancy as compared to corresponding storage at 5°C. Seed moisture levels below 7.7% did not affect viability at 5 or 25°C after a storage period of 3-9 months. Seed viability decreased rapidly when seeds were stored for 3 months at 25°C with a moisture content of 10.8%, or at 5 or 25°C with a moisture content of 18.6%. Seeds buried in the autumn at a depth of 5 cm germinated in the field 9 months later. Field germination decreased as sowing depth increased.E. heterophylla seeds germinate over a wide range of conditions, which explains why the plant is becoming an increasingly serious problem; germination was at least 95% when exposed to a solution of pH 2.5-10 or a solution with osmotic potential of up to -0.8 MPa. Light was not required for germination. Seed germination occured at temperatures ranging from 20-40°C with maximum germination (97%) at 35°C ( Brecke, 1995 ). Etejere amd Okoko (1989) reported 95% seed viability. Seed weight increased by 63% after 36 hours of water imbibition. Optimum germination of the seeds occurred at 30-35°C. The young seedlings emerged from depths of up to 9 cm with maximum emergence at 1-3 cm. Dorney and Wilson (1990) found that seedlings established best when left on the soil surface, particularly when covered by mulch.

Dorney and Wilson (1990) found that seedlings established best when left on the soil surface, particularly when covered by mulch. Seeds had no dormancy period and germinated in response to sufficient water. Machado-Neto and Pitelli (1980) studied the effect of sowing depth on emergence rate and found that the highest emergence rates occurred on the 5th day from seeds located at depths up to 2 cm, on the sixth day at 4-6 cm, and the seventh day at 8-10 cm. Average percentage germination was 21.3% with sowing at 0 cm and 79.0-84.7% at 2-10 cm; similar results were obtained by Cerdeira and Voll (1980). The data clearly demonstrated the ability of the weed to germinate from considerable depths and this is considered a factor in the aggressiveness of the plant.GrowthA regrowth of the axillary buds of young plants is observed if a mechanical treatment or contact herbicide destroys the upper leaves. This process occurs if enough light is received ( Kissman and Groth, 1993 ). Furthermore, Langston et al. (1984) have shown that E. heterophylla has unusual and remarkable ability to regenerate by adventitious buds developing from below the cotyledonary node after shoot excision. There was 100% recovery after such excision at cotyledon and 4-leaf stages. Of 17 weed species studied, the only others to show even partial recovery were Aeschynomene indica and A. virginica.E. heterophylla is a C4 plant and its growth habit is highly dependent on light intensity.

Paliwal and Ilangovan (1988) performed autoecological studies on several species, including E. heterophylla. They showed that photosynthetic processes and the rate of photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf age. For E. heterophylla a good correlation was evident between the photosynthetic rate, stomatal resistance, protein content, transpiration rate, biomass, photosynthetic pigments and nitrate reductase activity.Soyabean cultivars in competition with E. heterophylla at three densities and two periods of occurrence were studied by Chemale and Fleck (1982) in Brazil. Soyabean seed yield was reduced by weed competition; the number of pods and seeds decreasing with increasing weed density. Only the highest density reduced stem diameter and node numbers.Weed populations varied most markedly with changing seasons and different levels of fertilizer application in different crops. E. heterophylla was among the species most promoted by fertilizers ( Marnotte, 1984 ).Allelopathy Remison (1978) found that in the glasshouse, cowpea competition with E. heterophylla decreased the height of the plant, the number of nodes, peduncles and green leaves and the weight of pods and seeds and the decrease was greater with increasing density of the associated weed. In competition with the weed, cowpea did not respond to the application of fertilizers. In field experiments, competition from the natural weed flora affected the number of days to 50% flowering as well as other yield components of four cowpea cultivars studied.

Mohamed-Saleem and Fawusi (1983) studied the allelopathic effects of plant material of several plants, including that of E. heterophylla, on tomato, pepper and sorghum. They found that increasing amounts of decomposed weeds significantly reduced germination and seedling growth, although E. heterophylla had the least effect.Allelopathic effects of seven weed species on pumpkin and aubergine were studied under greenhouse conditions by Almodovar-Vega et al. (1988a, b). Root exudates from the roots of several plants, including E. heterophylla, decreased the vine length and dry weight of pumpkin seedlings when added to their growth medium.

EUPHORBIA HETEROPHYLLA L. Family: Euphorbiaceae Common names: Lechosa Euphorbia heterophylla is an annual plant with milky latex in all plant parts. It grows 30 to 100 cm tall and has simple or branched hollow stems with angular ribs. The leaves have variable shapes (as the species name suggests) both within and between populations. The lower leaves are alternate and the upper leaves are opposite and often have a whitish or bright red base. This coloration explains the English common name of wild poinsettia for this plant. The fruits are three-lobed and explode when ripe, dispersing the seeds 1 m or more from the parent plant. In tropical areas freshly harvested seeds are non-dormant, but in warm temperate regions they are dormant. This is an apparent adaptation to these environments as plants that started growing at the end of the season in subtropical areas would be killed by winter temperatures. Seeds germinate over an extended period in the field and plants grow very rapidly and thus are very competitive with crops. They can completely cover a soybean crop within 2 to 3 weeks after emergence. Plants may flower as early as 30 days after emergence. Pollination is by insects attracted to flowers by large amounts of nectar produced by glands on the flowers. Ripe seeds are formed 20 to 25 days later. Single plants may have 100 seeds at a given time and can produce over 4500 seeds during a season. Seeds germinate readily in alternating temperatures of 25 to 35 o C. Emergence is greatest when seeds are 0 to 8 cm deep (40 to 47%) and drops to 22% at 10 cm, 12% at 12 cm and zero at 14 cm. This ability to emerge from such depths adds to the competitive ability and difficulty in control of E. heterophylla. E. heterophylla originated in tropical America, but is now distributed in most of

 o C. Emergence is greatest when seeds are 0 to 8 cm deep (40 to 47%) and drops to 22% at 10 cm, 12% at 12 cm and zero at 14 cm. This ability to emerge from such depths adds to the competitive ability and difficulty in control of E. heterophylla. E. heterophylla originated in tropical America, but is now distributed in most of the tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Plants can be found from sea level to nearly 1400 m elevation, but it is only a serious weed in warm climates. It is found in cultivated crops, vegetables, pastures and wastelands and is particularly troublesome in soybeans, cowpeas, maize and sugarcane. It occurs as a weed of cowpeas in Nigeria; of cassava in Ghana; of citrus, avocado and mangos in Florida (U.S.A.); of soybeans in Nigeria, Brazil and U.S.A.; of cocoa, tea and upland rice in Sumatra; and of cotton in Israel. This illustrates its ability to grow and compete in many environments and cropping systems. E. heterophylla infests over 25% of the soybean fields in Brazil. Densities of 75 plants/m 2 reduced yield only 12%. Yield losses were much greater in the U.S.A. where 8 plants/m 2 competing for 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and full season lowered yields 19, 21 and 33%, respectively. Fifty plants/m 2 often resulted in crop failure. Six weeks free of E. heterophylla competition is usually adequate for maximum soybean yield. However, the sticky latex in the sap of late- emerging or non-competitive levels of this weed contaminates the grain with dirt and trash during harvest and may raise its moisture content. Yields of a semi-prostrate and an erect variety of cowpea in Nigeria were reduced 25 and 53% respectively, when 10

. heterophylla competition is usually adequate for maximum soybean yield. However, the sticky latex in the sap of late- emerging or non-competitive levels of this weed contaminates the grain with dirt and trash during harvest and may raise its moisture content. Yields of a semi-prostrate and an erect variety of cowpea in Nigeria were reduced 25 and 53% respectively, when 10 E. heterophylla plants/m 2 competed with the crop all season. Plants that emerged 20 days or more after planting had no effect on yield, but uncontrolled plants that emerge with the crop completely shade the crop in 6 weeks. This is the reason it is so competitive in most crops: its rapid early growth allows it to form a canopy over crops unless kept in check. Plants can emerge all season, and control of late emerging plants is also important to prevent a build-up of seeds in the soil. Several herbicides control E. heterophylla, including 2,4-D, aciflurofen, fomesafen, oxyflurofen, bentazon, lactofen, imazethapyr, imazaquin, and chlorimuron. Triazine herbicides such as atrazine and metribuzin can give acceptable control for several weeks (especially when rains are abundant following application) but seldom for the full season. The substituted ureas such as linuron and diuron have no effect on this weed. Extensive competition studies by weed scientists at North Carolina State University (U.S.A.) led to the development of a computer program (HERB) that predicts the impact of specific densities of uncontrolled E. heterophylla on soybean yield. With only 5 plants/9.5 m 2 , the predicted yield loss is 8%. The program then computes the value of the lost crop and determines the returns for various control strategies for expected yield and crop value based on control costs at current weed sizes and soil moisture levels

The program then computes the value of the lost crop and determines the returns for various control strategies for expected yield and crop value based on control costs at current weed sizes and soil moisture levels. For 5 plants/9.5 m 2 that are 5 to 10 cm tall and in a field with good soil moisture, three herbicides would give returns that exceed the costs. In most crops mechanical and manual control measures are effective if done on a timely basis several times a season. Soil disturbance creates conditions favorable for other seeds to germinate and since the weed is only slightly affected by shading, they can continue growing and competing. The integration of mechanical, manual, cultural and herbicide use into well planned management systems is the best approach to E. heterophylla control.

However, light increased germination at constant temperatures of 25 and 35°C, and decreased germination at alternating temperatures of 10 and 35°C. Storage of E. heterophylla seeds at 36°C for 2-12 weeks caused a significant decrease in dormancy as compared to corresponding storage at 5°C. Seed moisture levels below 7.7% did not affect viability at 5 or 25°C after a storage period of 3-9 months. Seed viability decreased rapidly when seeds were stored for 3 months at 25°C with a moisture content of 10.8%, or at 5 or 25°C with a moisture content of 18.6%. Seeds buried in the autumn at a depth of 5 cm germinated in the field 9 months later. Field germination decreased as sowing depth increased.E. heterophylla seeds germinate over a wide range of conditions, which explains why the plant is becoming an increasingly serious problem; germination was at least 95% when exposed to a solution of pH 2.5-10 or a solution with osmotic potential of up to -0.8 MPa. Light was not required for germination. Seed germination occured at temperatures ranging from 20-40°C with maximum germination (97%) at 35°C ( Brecke, 1995 ). Etejere amd Okoko (1989) reported 95% seed viability. Seed weight increased by 63% after 36 hours of water imbibition. Optimum germination of the seeds occurred at 30-35°C. The young seedlings emerged from depths of up to 9 cm with maximum emergence at 1-3 cm. Dorney and Wilson (1990) found that seedlings established best when left on the soil surface, particularly when covered by mulch. Seeds had no dormancy period and germinated in response to sufficient water. Mach

Dorney and Wilson (1990) found that seedlings established best when left on the soil surface, particularly when covered by mulch. Seeds had no dormancy period and germinated in response to sufficient water. Machado-Neto and Pitelli (1980) studied the effect of sowing depth on emergence rate and found that the highest emergence rates occurred on the 5th day from seeds located at depths up to 2 cm, on the sixth day at 4-6 cm, and the seventh day at 8-10 cm. Average percentage germination was 21.3% with sowing at 0 cm and 79.0-84.7% at 2-10 cm; similar results were obtained by Cerdeira and Voll (1980). The data clearly demonstrated the ability of the weed to germinate from considerable depths and this is considered a factor in the aggressiveness of the plant.GrowthA regrowth of the axillary buds of young plants is observed if a mechanical treatment or contact herbicide destroys the upper leaves. This process occurs if enough light is received ( Kissman and Groth, 1993 ). Furthermore, Langston et al. (1984) have shown that E. heterophylla has unusual and remarkable ability to regenerate by adventitious buds developing from below the cotyledonary node after shoot excision. There was 100% recovery after such excision at cotyledon and 4-leaf stages. Of 17 weed species studied, the only others to show even partial recovery were Aeschynomene indica and A. virginica.E. heterophylla is a C4 plant and its growth habit is highly dependent on light intensity.

Paliwal and Ilangovan (1988) performed autoecological studies on several species, including E. heterophylla. They showed that photosynthetic processes and the rate of photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf age. For E. heterophylla a good correlation was evident between the photosynthetic rate, stomatal resistance, protein content, transpiration rate, biomass, photosynthetic pigments and nitrate reductase activity.Soyabean cultivars in competition with E. heterophylla at three densities and two periods of occurrence were studied by Chemale and Fleck (1982) in Brazil. Soyabean seed yield was reduced by weed competition; the number of pods and seeds decreasing with increasing weed density. Only the highest density reduced stem diameter and node numbers.Weed populations varied most markedly with changing seasons and different levels of fertilizer application in different crops. E. heterophylla was among the species most promoted by fertilizers ( Marnotte, 1984 ).Allelopathy Remison (1978) found that in the glasshouse, cowpea competition with E. heterophylla decreased the height of the plant, the number of nodes, peduncles and green leaves and the weight of pods and seeds and the decrease was greater with increasing density of the associated weed. In competition with the weed, cowpea did not respond to the application of fertilizers. In field experiments, competition from the natural weed flora affected the number of days to 50% flowering as well as other yield components of four cowpea cultivars studied.

The yield of the climbing variety, Dinner, was least affected by competition whilst the semi-erect variety, Ife brown, was affected most. Mohamed-Saleem and Fawusi (1983) studied the allelopathic effects of plant material of several plants, including that of E. heterophylla, on tomato, pepper and sorghum. They found that increasing amounts of decomposed weeds significantly reduced germination and seedling growth, although E. heterophylla had the least effect.Allelopathic effects of seven weed species on pumpkin and aubergine were studied under greenhouse conditions by Almodovar-Vega et al. (1988a, b). Root exudates from the roots of several plants, including E. heterophylla, decreased the vine length and dry weight of pumpkin seedlings when added to their growth medium.

In Brazil, seeds germinate and seedlings emerge throughout most of the year. Seed longevity is high, and seeds may remain viable with a low dormancy level after being eaten by birds ( Kissman and Groth, 1993 ). Bannon et al.

EUPHORBIA HETEROPHYLLA L. Family: Euphorbiaceae Common names: Lechosa Euphorbia heterophylla is an annual plant with milky latex in all plant parts. It grows 30 to 100 cm tall and has simple or branched hollow stems with angular ribs. The leaves have variable shapes (as the species name suggests) both within and between populations. The lower leaves are alternate and the upper leaves are opposite and often have a whitish or bright red base. This coloration explains the English common name of wild poinsettia for this plant. The fruits are three-lobed and explode when ripe, dispersing the seeds 1 m or more from the parent plant. In tropical areas freshly harvested seeds are non-dormant, but in warm temperate regions they are dormant. This is an apparent adaptation to these environments as plants that started growing at the end of the season in subtropical areas would be killed by winter temperatures. Seeds germinate over an extended period in the field and plants grow very rapidly and thus are very competitive with crops. They can completely cover a soybean crop within 2 to 3 weeks after emergence. Plants may flower as early as 30 days after emergence. Pollination is by insects attracted to flowers by large amounts of nectar produced by glands on the flowers. Ripe seeds are formed 20 to 25 days later. Single plants may have 100 seeds at a given time and can produce over 4500 seeds during a season. Seeds germinate readily in alternating temperatures of 25 to 35 o C. Emergence is greatest when seeds are 0 to 8 cm deep (40 to 47%) and drops to 22% at 10 cm, 12% at 12 cm and zero at 14 cm. This ability to emerge from such depths adds to the competitive ability and difficulty in control of E. heterophylla. E. heterophylla originated in tropical America, but is now distributed in most of

 o C. Emergence is greatest when seeds are 0 to 8 cm deep (40 to 47%) and drops to 22% at 10 cm, 12% at 12 cm and zero at 14 cm. This ability to emerge from such depths adds to the competitive ability and difficulty in control of E. heterophylla. E. heterophylla originated in tropical America, but is now distributed in most of the tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Plants can be found from sea level to nearly 1400 m elevation, but it is only a serious weed in warm climates. It is found in cultivated crops, vegetables, pastures and wastelands and is particularly troublesome in soybeans, cowpeas, maize and sugarcane. It occurs as a weed of cowpeas in Nigeria; of cassava in Ghana; of citrus, avocado and mangos in Florida (U.S.A.); of soybeans in Nigeria, Brazil and U.S.A.; of cocoa, tea and upland rice in Sumatra; and of cotton in Israel. This illustrates its ability to grow and compete in many environments and cropping systems. E. heterophylla infests over 25% of the soybean fields in Brazil. Densities of 75 plants/m 2 reduced yield only 12%. Yield losses were much greater in the U.S.A. where 8 plants/m 2 competing for 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and full season lowered yields 19, 21 and 33%, respectively. Fifty plants/m 2 often resulted in crop failure. Six weeks free of E. heterophylla competition is usually adequate for maximum soybean yield. However, the sticky latex in the sap of late- emerging or non-competitive levels of this weed contaminates the grain with dirt and trash during harvest and may raise its moisture content. Yields of a semi-prostrate and an erect variety of cowpea in Nigeria were reduced 25 and 53% respectively, when 10

. heterophylla competition is usually adequate for maximum soybean yield. However, the sticky latex in the sap of late- emerging or non-competitive levels of this weed contaminates the grain with dirt and trash during harvest and may raise its moisture content. Yields of a semi-prostrate and an erect variety of cowpea in Nigeria were reduced 25 and 53% respectively, when 10 E. heterophylla plants/m 2 competed with the crop all season. Plants that emerged 20 days or more after planting had no effect on yield, but uncontrolled plants that emerge with the crop completely shade the crop in 6 weeks. This is the reason it is so competitive in most crops: its rapid early growth allows it to form a canopy over crops unless kept in check. Plants can emerge all season, and control of late emerging plants is also important to prevent a build-up of seeds in the soil. Several herbicides control E. heterophylla, including 2,4-D, aciflurofen, fomesafen, oxyflurofen, bentazon, lactofen, imazethapyr, imazaquin, and chlorimuron. Triazine herbicides such as atrazine and metribuzin can give acceptable control for several weeks (especially when rains are abundant following application) but seldom for the full season. The substituted ureas such as linuron and diuron have no effect on this weed. Extensive competition studies by weed scientists at North Carolina State University (U.S.A.) led to the development of a computer program (HERB) that predicts the impact of specific densities of uncontrolled E. heterophylla on soybean yield. With only 5 plants/9.5 m 2 , the predicted yield loss is 8%. The program then computes the value of the lost crop and determines the returns for various control strategies for expected yield and crop value based on control costs at current weed sizes and soil moisture levels

The program then computes the value of the lost crop and determines the returns for various control strategies for expected yield and crop value based on control costs at current weed sizes and soil moisture levels. For 5 plants/9.5 m 2 that are 5 to 10 cm tall and in a field with good soil moisture, three herbicides would give returns that exceed the costs. In most crops mechanical and manual control measures are effective if done on a timely basis several times a season. Soil disturbance creates conditions favorable for other seeds to germinate and since the weed is only slightly affected by shading, they can continue growing and competing. The integration of mechanical, manual, cultural and herbicide use into well planned management systems is the best approach to E. heterophylla control.
