Caprifoliaceae RUBINA AKHTER National Herbarium, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, Islamabad. Abelia triflora subsp. parvifolia Illustration Credit: S. Hameed Small or medium sized shrubs, erect or sometimes scandent, usually with soft wood and broad pith. Leaves opposite, simple, entire, exstipulate (stipulate in V. opulus). Flowers hermaphrodite, usually in cymes or panicles. Calyx adnate to the ovary, usually 5-fid or toothed. Corolla gamopetalous, tubular, rotate, salverform or 2-lipped, regular or irregular. Stamens inserted on corolla tube, alternating with lobes; anthers free. Ovary inferior, 2-54ocular; style terminal, usually simple, long and slender (short and divided in Viburnum); stigma capitate or lobed. Fruit a drupe or berry-like or capsular. A family of 12 genera and 450 species, mainly distributed in the temperate regions of northern hemisphere, mostly in the Himalaya and China. Some species are found in Australia and S. America. Represented in Pakistan by 4 genera and 27 species. The taxon Weigelia florida (Burge) A.DC. is reported to be cultivated at Abbottabad (R. R. Stewart, Ann. Cat. Vasc. Pl. W. Pak. & Kashm. 691.1972).
