According to some Biblical scholars, the Shittah tree is mentioned in the Bible
only once (
I will plant in the wilderness... the Shittah tree.
Isaiah
41), but its wood is referred to many times as shittium, which is the plural of
shittah in Hebrew.  Some even speculate that it was only natural that Moses
should turn to shittium when he came to build the Ark of the Covenant and the
Tabernacle and needed beams and timber.  No one can really be sure which
species of Acacia was meant.  Wood is white to yellow-brown, finely-striated
with dark lines, coarse-grained, soft, easy to work, polishes well, but
discolors eastly with mold and is susceptible to insect attack.  Ancient
Egyptians made coffins, some still intact, from the wood.  Nigerians used
sapling stems, or also the roots for spear shafts.  Tree also yields a gum of
good quality, inferior to that of
A. senegal
.  Systematic tapping has
produced a product of better color and taste.  Bark contains tannin and yields
a red liquid extract.  The gum is said to be edible.  The leaves are important

 that of
A. senegal
.  Systematic tapping has
produced a product of better color and taste.  Bark contains tannin and yields
a red liquid extract.  The gum is said to be edible.  The leaves are important
for forage and the wood for fuel where the trees are abundant.  In parts of
Africa the tree is important for livestock, natives driving their animals to
where it is common and lopping off branches for them, both leaves and young
pods being eaten.  The pods are sold, especially for fattening sheep.  The tree
is believed to provide the best firewood in Chad, and the best fodder in
Sahelian savannas (NAS, 1980a; Duke, 1983a).
Folk Medicine
The gum is believed to be aphrodisiac.  The bark decoction Is used for
dysentery and leprosy.  Tanganyikans use the bark as a stimulant in tropical
Africa.  The gum is used as emollient and astringent for colds, diarrhea,
hemorrhage and ophhthalmia.  Mixed with
Acacia sieberana
DC, it is used
for intestinal ailments on the Ivory Coast.  Wood used as a fumigant for
rheumatic pains, and to protect puerperal mothers from colds and fevers.
Eating the gum is supposed to afford some protection against bronchitis and
rheumatism (Duke, 1983a).
Chemistry
This species has been reported to contain 18–20% tannin.

Description
Tree 3–12 m tall, crown flat-topped; bark powdery, white to greenish-yellow or
orange-red; sparsely branched, the branches horizontal or ascending; young
branchlets with sparse hairs or almost glabrous, with numerous reddish sessile
glands; epidermis of twigs becoming reddish and shed annually; leaves often
with a large gland on petiole and between the top 1–2 pairs of pinnae; stipules
spinescent, up to 8 cm long, ant-galls present or absent; pinnae usually 3–7
pairs, the leaflets in 11–20 pairs, 3–8 cm long, 0.75–1 mm wide, sparingly
ciliolate or glabrous; lateral veins invisible beneath; flowers bright yellow,
in axillary, pedunculate heads 10–13 mm across, borne on terminal or short
lateral shoots of current season; involucel in lower half of peduncle 2–4 mm
long; apex of bracteoles rounded to elliptic, sometimes pointed; calyx 2–2.5 mm
long, puberulous in upper part; corolla 3.5–4 mm long, glabrous outside; pods
7–20 cm long, 0.5–0.9 cm in diameter, dehiscent, falcate, constricted between
seeds, glabrous except for sessile glands, 6–9-seeded; seeds elliptic, 7–9 mm
long, 4.5–5 mm wide, compressed,

long, 4.5–5 mm wide, compressed, minutely wrinkled, olive-brown to olive;
areole 5–6 mm long, 2.5–3.5 mm wide.
Germplasm
Species has several botanical varieties. The two main ones are:
A. seyal
var. fistula (Schweinf.) Oliv. (
A. fistula
Schweinf.), is white-barked
with some pairs of spines fused at base into 'ant-galls', 0.8–3 cm in diameter,
grayish or whitish, often marked with sienna-red and with longitudinal furrows
down center, more or less 2-lobed.  Found in Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique.
A. seyal
var.
multijuga
Schweinf. ex Baker f. (
A.
stenocarpa
Oliv., pro partem), a shrub or tree, usually less than 5 m tall,
sometimes up to 13 m, flattened crown; bark on main stem greenish-brown,
peeling in papery rolls; bark on branchlets red-brown, thorns straight, weak,
usually less than 2.5 cm long, sometimes absent; pinnae 4–12 pairs, leaflets
10–20 pairs; flowers golden-yellow; pod narrow-linear, strongly curved, up to
10 cm long, 0.6 cm wide, dehiscing on tree.

ery rolls; bark on branchlets red-brown, thorns straight, weak,
usually less than 2.5 cm long, sometimes absent; pinnae 4–12 pairs, leaflets
10–20 pairs; flowers golden-yellow; pod narrow-linear, strongly curved, up to
10 cm long, 0.6 cm wide, dehiscing on tree.  Common in overgrazed pastures and
widely distributed in East Africa.  Hybrids,
A. seyal
var.
fistula
X
A. xanthophloea
Benth., are known from woodlands on
black clay loams on flood plains in Malawi.  Pods are conspicuously irregular,
4–11 cm long, 6–10 mm wide, ill-formed and curved.  Assigned to the Africa
Center of Diversity, shittim wood or cultivars thereof is reported to exhibit
tolerance to high pH, heavy soil, insects, mycobacteria, poor soil, salt,
savanna, slope, and waterlogging.  (2
n
= 26.)
Distribution
Native to the Sahelian Zone from Senegal to Sudan, it also occurs in Egypt and
eastern and southern Africa, from Somalia to Mozambique and Namibia (NAS,
1980a).
Ecology
Trees thrive in
Sclerocarya caffra
woodlands, wooded grasslands and
especially on seasonally flooded black-cotton soils along water courses.
Requires a heavy clay-alluvium, but will grow on stony ground at base of hills.
Grows at 20–2,100 m altitude.  A gregarious savanna tree, ranging from
Subtropical Desert to Dry through Tropical Desert to Very Dry Forest Life

 on seasonally flooded black-cotton soils along water courses.
Requires a heavy clay-alluvium, but will grow on stony ground at base of hills.
Grows at 20–2,100 m altitude.  A gregarious savanna tree, ranging from
Subtropical Desert to Dry through Tropical Desert to Very Dry Forest Life
Zones, shittim wood is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 8.7–22.8 dm
(mean of 7 cases = 15.0 dm), annual mean temperature of 18.7–27.8°C 
(mean of 7
cases = 24.0°C) and pH of 5.0–8.0 (mean of 5 cases = 6.9).
Cultivation
Propagated from scarified seed.  large cuttings are said to strike root readity
in moist soils.
Harvesting
Pods, bark or wood are harvested in season from trees or shrubs in native
habitats.  Gum also obtained from native plantings, in manner similar to that
for other gum arabic plants.
Energy
The dense wood is highly prized for firewood, in areas where few other plants
survive.  Considered one of the best firewoods in Chad, it is used in the Sudan
to make fragrant fires over which women perfume themselves.
Biotic Factors
Following fungi reported on this plant:
Fomes rimosus
,
Ganoderma
lucidum, Leveillula taurica, Ravenelia volkensii, Trametes meyenii
, and
Uromyces schweinfurthii
.  Although the plant is reportedly resistant to
insect attacks, felled logs may be severely damaged by wood borers.
