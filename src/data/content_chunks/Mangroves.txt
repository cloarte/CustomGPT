These unique coastal ecosystems provide critical habitats for a myriad of marine and terrestrial wildlife. They play a vital role in coastal protection, with their intricate root systems acting as natural barriers that reduce the impact of waves, storm surges, and coastal erosion. Not only are they biodiversity hotspots, but mangroves are also significant in carbon sequestration, storing substantial amounts of carbon and thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. Globally, mangroves sequester carbon at rates higher than many terrestrial forests, storing approximately 11 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. They also improve water quality by filtering pollutants and trapping sediments, which enhances the health of coastal waters. Mangroves support the livelihoods of many coastal communities, providing resources such as timber and medicinal plants and sustaining fisheries. Mangroves provide pastures for camels on islands in the Red Sea that give high-quality nutrition to camels in coastal locations during the winter. © arabnews.com Challenges facing mangroves in the Middle East In the Middle East, mangroves are found along the coasts of countries such as Bahrain, Oman, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

 © arabnews.com Challenges facing mangroves in the Middle East In the Middle East, mangroves are found along the coasts of countries such as Bahrain, Oman, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These ecosystems face numerous challenges. In the UAE, coastal salinity has increased due to intense desalination activities , creating a hypersaline environment that stunts mangrove growth. Increased seawater temperatures from energy production and desalination practices, pollution from cement factories, rapid development of small islands, and construction of bridges have further stressed the mangrove ecosystems. FAO's " The World’s Mangroves 2000–2020 " report integrates remote sensing with local expertise to assess global mangrove areas and changes over two decades. The study estimated the total mangrove area in 2020 at 14.8 million ha , with nearly 44 percent in South and Southeast Asia. Despite a net decline of 284 000 ha over the 20-year period, the report shows that the annual rate of mangrove loss slowed from 0.12 percent in 2000–2010 to 0.07% in 2010–2020, highlighting the impact of conservation efforts. Recent assessments by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) highlight that the state of Arabian mangroves is now considered vulnerable due to climate change. Rising sea levels, more frequent cyclones, and altered freshwater flows are threatening these ecosystems, which are crucial for biodiversity conservation and coastal resilience. For instance, Oman’s mangroves, covering approximately 1 000 ha , have been impacted by human activities such as fuelwood harvesting and grazing of livestock, compounding the challenges posed by climate change.

Mangrove of the Red Sea , Sep 15, 2020 ©: Ahmed Fouad Oman's mangrove restoration In Oman, the Oman Blue Carbon project represents a groundbreaking initiative by the Environment Authority and MSA Green Projects Company. This ambitious initiative aims to plant 100 million mangrove trees across the Sultanate, significantly enhancing the natural environment. This could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 14 million tonnes and generate an estimated economic benefit of around $150 million in blue carbon credit certificates in favour of the Environment Authority. FAO plans to initiate a comprehensive mangrove restoration programme in Oman to safeguard and enhance mangrove ecosystems along its coastline. This joint effort can address the various threats facing Oman’s mangroves. Moreover, the collaboration will leverage mangroves’ significant potential for carbon sequestration, aligning with Oman’s national strategy to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This collaboration will aim to strengthen the implementation of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration in Oman, empower the fishers' communities and their accountability in restoring the mangrove for the benefit of their fishing practices, and leverage advanced monitoring techniques and innovative approaches like the FAO’s SEPAL platform to enhance the restoration monitoring techniques. Mangrove restoration initiatives in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is undertaking an ambitious initiative to restore its mangrove ecosystems. Mangroves in Saudi Arabia provide essential benefits, including acting as natural filters for pollutants, absorbing heavy metals, and offering habitats for 125 species of fish, crustaceans, and migratory birds. Mangrove swamps also offer valuable grazing areas for camels on Red Sea islands and provide nutritious forage for coastal camels during winter months. Mangroves absorb 70-90 percent of wave energy , protecting coastal communities from erosion and storm damage. These initiatives not only enhance environmental sustainability but also contribute to

Mangrove swamps also offer valuable grazing areas for camels on Red Sea islands and provide nutritious forage for coastal camels during winter months. Mangroves absorb 70-90 percent of wave energy , protecting coastal communities from erosion and storm damage. These initiatives not only enhance environmental sustainability but also contribute to the Kingdom's broader goals of tackling climate change, reducing carbon emissions, and improving the quality of life for its residents. Mangroves in the Kingdom, mainly found in fragmented stands along the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts, play a vital role in carbon sequestration and storm protection. In line with the Saudi Green Initiative launched in 2021, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia aims to plant 10 billion mangrove trees by 2030, significantly boosting the current coverage of approximately 35 500 ha along the Red Sea. Noteworthy projects include the Red Sea Global initiative , which seeks to plant 50 million mangroves by 2030. Under the Vision 2030 initiative, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture has implemented significant projects to enhance mangrove populations. For instance, they transplanted 250 000 mangrove seedlings in Yanbu and planted 1.7 million seedlings along the coasts to increase vegetative cover and support sustainable fisheries. Successful rehabilitation efforts have expanded mangrove areas, with projects in Yanbu notably increasing coverage from 0.011 km² in 1972 to 0.562 km² in 2013. Saudi Aramco has also contributed by planting 2 million mangrove trees along the eastern coast over an area of 60 km² and established the first mangrove park in Tarout Bay in 2020. They have also implemented monitoring initiatives on Tarout Island to protect mangroves from vandalism and pollution. These efforts underscore Saudi Arabia's commitment to preserving mangrove ecosystems and promoting sustainable development in coastal regions.

This commitment underscores Bahrain's proactive approach to climate mitigation and adaptation, leveraging natural solutions such as mangrove ecosystems to enhance resilience against climate impacts. The partnership between UN-Habitat and HSBC to restore mangroves in Tubli Bay, including Ras Sanad, not only aims to expand mangrove habitats but also seeks to integrate nature-based solutions into urban planning, fostering community well-being and biodiversity conservation while advancing global climate objectives.
