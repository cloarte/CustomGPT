 Reproduccion: Mating occurs outside the hive shortly after adult emergence ( Nielsen and Brister, 1977 ). Unlike many other moths, the mating system is based on female attraction by males using both olfactory and acoustical signals. Males produce short ultrasonic pulses when wings are fluttered. This call stimulates wing fanning by the virgin females, which produces a low-frequency sound that is detected by males. Males respond by releasing copious amounts of pheromone leading to approach by females ( Spangler, 1985 ). Mated females return to the hive at night to oviposit. Oviposition starts 24 h after mating and continues for four nights ( Nielsen and Brister, 1977 ). Up to 2241 eggs may be laid by a single female, with average numbers ranging from 500 ( Burges, 1978 ) to 700 ( Warren and Huddleston, 1962 ). The incubation period of eggs can last from a few days to more than 1 month, depending on temperature and other environmental factors. At 29-35°C, eggs hatch in 3-5 days, but at lower temperatures (10-16°C) the incubation period may extend to 35 days ( Shimanuki,

 1978 ) to 700 ( Warren and Huddleston, 1962 ). The incubation period of eggs can last from a few days to more than 1 month, depending on temperature and other environmental factors. At 29-35°C, eggs hatch in 3-5 days, but at lower temperatures (10-16°C) the incubation period may extend to 35 days ( Shimanuki, 1981 ; Williams, 1997 ). The neonate larva feeds initially on honey and pollen before tunnelling into the comb ( Nielsen and Brister, 1979 ). After the first day, the larva burrows into the cell wall and begins tunnelling toward the midrib of the comb, which it reaches in 6-8 days. As it advances into the comb, the larva will leave behind a trail of webs and frass. The feeding activity and larval behaviour inside the hive are described in detail by Nielsen and Brister (1979) . Larval development lasts 5-7 weeks at favourable temperatures (29-32°C) and high humidity ( Ellis et al., 2013 ). At lower temperatures, growth is slowed and the larvae may enter diapause for nearly 5 months ( Shimanuki, 1981 ). Upon completing its development, the last instar larva spins a silken cocoon for pupation. The duration of the pupal stage ranges from 8 to 62 days ( Shimanuki, 1981 ). At 32°C pupation is completed in 6-11 days, averaging 8 days ( Warren and Huddleston, 1962 ). Adult emergence generally occurs in the evening. Once out of the cocoon, the adult will leave the hive to expand its wings in a protected place near the colony from which it emerged ( Nielsen and Brister, 1977 ). In the tropics and warm temperate areas, G. mellonella can have as many as 4-6 generations annually, and all stages may be present at any time of the year. In cooler climates

 evening. Once out of the cocoon, the adult will leave the hive to expand its wings in a protected place near the colony from which it emerged ( Nielsen and Brister, 1977 ). In the tropics and warm temperate areas, G. mellonella can have as many as 4-6 generations annually, and all stages may be present at any time of the year. In cooler climates, however, temperatures limit the pest to one or two generations per year ( Burges, 1978 ). In these areas, the larvae undergo diapause during winter and adults fly during summer. The longevity of males is 2-28 days (average = 15 days), and that of females is 2-18 days (average = 7 days). Females that deposit a low number of eggs live longer than females of high fecundity ( Warren and Huddleston, 1962 ). Paddock (1918) reported an average longevity of 21 and 12 days for males and females, respectively. Adults have rudimentary mouthparts and do not feed. Larvae feed on honey, pollen, wax and bee exuviae, but will also attack bee brood if food is scarce ( Williams, 1997 ). In the laboratory, the larvae can be maintained on artificial diets containing honey and wheat products ( Ellis et al., 2013 ). Cannibalism has been reported in crowded conditions, when larvae cannot enlarge their tunnels without disturbing other larvae ( Nielsen and Brister, 1979 ; Williams, 1997 ).
 Sintomas: Larvae tunnel through the honeycombs leaving behind masses of white webs and debris (frass), which are characteristic signs of infestation. They do not cause direct injury to the bees, but the webbing can trap developing bee brood in the cells, which die of starvation, a condition known as galleriasis ( Williams, 1997 ; Ellis et al., 2013 ; Kwadha et al., 2017 ).

Older larvae may also chew the comb frame and other wooden parts of the hive producing distinct boat-shaped indentations to which they attach the cocoons ( Ellis et al., 2013 ). The white silken cocoons are also very distinctive.
