These cresses, related to water cress and horse-radish, are cultivatedsparingly for winter salads and pot herbs. Plants are naturalized in many partsof the U.S.  Plants are hardy biennials.  Leaves are generally entire butnotched, and smooth.  As grown under cultivation, leaf exposure and generalculture are similar to those of spinach and turnips for greens.  Portion of theplant consumed is the leaves.
