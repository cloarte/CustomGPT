 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: S. media is an annual, winter annual (capable of survival during milder winters) or sometimes perennial herb. Reproduction is predominantly by seed, although short-term vegetative reproduction by vegetative fragments can occur. The first flowers may be produced within 4-5 weeks of germination ( Whitehead and Sinha, 1967 ), and the first mature seeds within 5-7 weeks ( Salisbury, 1961 ). In warm areas, flowering has been observed year-round, and Goppert (1881) reported survival of plants at -10°C. S. media is highly phenotypically variable, even at a single site. Pobedimova (1929) tested the response of individuals to varying light fluxes and demonstrated that leaf size and hairiness of stems were affected. Flowering plants whose longest shoot lengths were 4 cm have been observed on gravelly paths, whilst in Scotland, UK, stem lengths up to 98 cm and leaves up to 45 mm were observed in a herring gull colony.Seed production is prolific. Champness and Morris (1948) recorded seed yields of between 5.5 and 10.8 kg/ha in pastures and arable lands, respectively, and Salisbury (1961) reported production of between 11 and 13 million seeds/ha.

Germination may occur year-round, depending on conditions, with distinct peaks in the UK in spring (March to May) and autumn ( Roberts and Feast, 1970 ). Seeds produced in differing habitats and geographical locations exhibit markedly different dormancy patterns and germination requirements. Seeds of plants from mild, maritime climates germinate relatively quickly after maturation, those from Arctic or Continental environments display little germination after 90 days, while those from Mediterranean areas need 40 to 50 days after-ripening before appreciable germination is observed. Laboratory trials have shown that germination is stimulated by moistening seeds with 0.2% potassium nitrate and keeping them in alternating temperatures between 20 and 30°C. In the field, seeds display three types of dormancy: innate (some seeds have an after-ripening requirement), enforced (seeds buried in soil remain dormant until conditions become favourable) and induced (seeds initially not possessing a light requirement can develop one during burial). This variation in germination requirement and dormancy characteristics may contribute greatly to the success of the species as a weed (Van der Vegte, 1978).Seeds have been reported to live for as long as 60 years ( Evans, 1962 ). In a long-term experiment, buried seed of S. media displayed 91 to 97% germination after 1 year and 6 to 22% germination after 10 years, no germination was observed after 16 years ( Toole and Brown, 1946 ). In a similar experiment, Darlington and Steinbauer (1961) found some germination after 30 years. In the field, seeds germinate on, and slightly below the soil surface ( Evans et al., 1974 ).

In the field, seeds germinate on, and slightly below the soil surface ( Evans et al., 1974 ). Very few seeds germinate from below 2 cm ( Chancellor, 1964 ).The majority of seeds are dispersed close to the parent plant. Long-distance dispersal may be brought about by animals, and viable seed has been found in the faeces of pigs, horses, cattle, deer, sparrows, quail and magpies. Seeds may also be transported by ants and have been found in the casts of earthworms ( McRill, 1974 ). Man has played a large part in the dispersal of this species through agricultural activities. The seed is able to survive immersion in seawater.Many aspects of the biology and ecology of S. media are reviewed in detail by Turkington et al. (1980) .
