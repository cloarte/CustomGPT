 Reproduccion: Genetics According to cytological, morphological and molecular data, S. halepense is a tetraploid species with a chromosome count of 2n = 40, arising as a natural hybrid between S. bicolor (2n=20), an annual African cultivated species and S. propinquum (2n=20), a perennial Asian species. S. halepense has a S. bicolor enriched allele composition and mutations in 5957 genes that differentiate it from its progenitors ( Paterson et al., 2020 ). There are a few reports of a tropical ecotype from Eurasia being diploid (2n=20) ( PPQ, 2022 ). Populations from the USA and Canada are of Mediterranean origin and are a tetraploid ecotype. Sorghum halepense can hybridize with S. bicolor (2n=20), and the progeny are usually sterile triploids which may be weedy in subsequent crops. Occasionally fertile hybrids occur, one of which is believed to be the origin of the fodder crop Columbus grass or black Sudan grass, S . x almum [ Sorghum almum ] (2n=40) in Argentina. Although hybridization with the crop sorghum is relatively rare and difficult to achieve in practice ( Dweikat, 2005 ), genetic studies by Morrell et al. (2005) suggest that there has been extensive introgression of genes from the crop into S. halepense in areas where the crop is commonly grown. Hybridization with auto-tetraploid sorghum is, however, relatively easy ( Liang et al., 1999 ). A study of populations of S. halepense in Kansas, USA showed high levels of genetic variability, suggesting that there is abundant reproduction from seed and only localized vegetative spread ( Camacho et al., 1993 ).

A study of populations of S. halepense in Kansas, USA showed high levels of genetic variability, suggesting that there is abundant reproduction from seed and only localized vegetative spread ( Camacho et al., 1993 ). Germplasm collections are stored at various institutions ( Millennium Seed Bank, 2023 ; USDA-ARS, 2023 ). DNA barcode information for the species is available for the species ( BOLDS, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Sorghum halepense reproduces vegetatively through its rhizomes and sexually by seeds. Most of the Sorghum species are self-crossers. Some outcrossing occurs in S. halepense by wind pollination,but it is primarily self-pollinated. A single plant may produce 80,000 or more seeds in one growing season ( Howard, 2004 ). Most ecotypes are dormant when first shed due to the mechanical restriction of the seed coat, with less than 10% germination at 20°C ( Taylorson and McWhorter, 1969 ). The extent of dormancy is influenced by environmental conditions during ripening, with greater germination levels being found in seeds which mature during periods of drought stress ( Benech-Arnold et al., 1992 ). Holm et al. (1977) suggest that seed which has lain in the field germinates readily after 1 year and that seedlings can emerge from seeds buried up to 15 cm deep although most arise from the top 7 cm. Seeds can remain viable in soil for at least 7 years ( Leguizamon, 1986 ; Uremİs and Uygur, 2005 ) and remain viable after passing through the guts of animals ( Holm et al., 1977 ). First year seeds have an 82% viability which drops to 62% viability in 2.5 years, 50% viability in

 arise from the top 7 cm. Seeds can remain viable in soil for at least 7 years ( Leguizamon, 1986 ; Uremİs and Uygur, 2005 ) and remain viable after passing through the guts of animals ( Holm et al., 1977 ). First year seeds have an 82% viability which drops to 62% viability in 2.5 years, 50% viability in 5 years to 2% in 6 years ( PPQ, 2022 ). Minimum, optimum and maximum temperatures for germination are 20°C, 25-30°C and 40°C, respectively (Uremis and Uygur, 1999). Light improves germination rate with warm temperatures (>34°C) and inhibits germination with cold temperatures (<22°C). Three to 6 weeks after emergence, seedlings have 5-7 leaves, and the first rhizomes begin to develop. Flowers are produced 7 weeks after seedling appearance ( PPQ, 2022 ). There are three components to the rhizome system ( Holm et al., 1977 ). The primary structures are important at the beginning of the growing season, providing buds for renewed growth. Extensions from the main rhizomes become secondary structures, giving rise to new plants. At flowering, tertiary rhizomes develop from the base of the plant and grow deeply until the onset of cold or dry weather, and these produce new plants the following season. Physiology and Phenology Sorghum halepense is a C4 plant and shows correspondingly rapid growth under warm and hot conditions. Two seed crops per year may be produced under good conditions, while under poor conditions, the resources are allocated to rhizomes at the expense of seed production ( Howard, 2004 ). Rhizome production has an optimum temperature near 30°C, and it is inhibited, as well as flowering, below 13-15°C ( Horowitz, 1972 ; Holm et al, 1977). Most of the ecotypes do not survive temperatures below

 produced under good conditions, while under poor conditions, the resources are allocated to rhizomes at the expense of seed production ( Howard, 2004 ). Rhizome production has an optimum temperature near 30°C, and it is inhibited, as well as flowering, below 13-15°C ( Horowitz, 1972 ; Holm et al, 1977). Most of the ecotypes do not survive temperatures below -3°C ( McWhorter, 1971a ). Rhizomes will not tolerate very low soil temperatures, being killed at -17°C, but surviving -9°C ( Stoller, 1977 ). Monaghan (1980) reports that the rhizome buds sprouting is suppressed by low temperatures, although some buds remain inactive even after returning to favourable growing conditions to ensure that the plant can re-establish after temporary adverse conditions. Relatively high temperatures of 23-30°C promote bud sprouting ( Hull, 1970 ). Fresh rhizomes are killed after 1-3 days on the soil surface at 50-60°C ( McWhorter, 1972 ). A day-length of 12 h is the optimum for flowering, above 14 h of light plants will fail to flower, and above 16 h, all growth processes are inhibited ( Howard, 2004 ). Sorghum halepense will tolerate a degree of flooding, with rhizome fragments germinating after being submerged for up to 4 weeks ( Horowitz, 1972 ). The species will likely survive fires by sprouting from rhizomes ( Howard, 2004 ). It is also most productive during rainy seasons ( PIER, 2023 ). Sorghum halepense can form cyanogenetic glycosides that are poisonous to livestock. The plants are most toxic when the leaves and culms are actively growing, during the seedling stage, and when sprouting after mowing or being heavily grazed. Also, plants are more toxic after droughts, extreme heat, frost or when plants are wet after rains or with

The plants are most toxic when the leaves and culms are actively growing, during the seedling stage, and when sprouting after mowing or being heavily grazed. Also, plants are more toxic after droughts, extreme heat, frost or when plants are wet after rains or with dew. The glycoside levels can vary among the grass populations ( Howard, 2004 ). Sorghum halepense is in flower from August to October, with seeds produced from September to October ( PROTA, 2023 ). Longevity Sorghum halepense is a perennial grass ( PIER, 2023 ). The normal productive life is 3-4 years, with the yield dropping sharply after the first 2 years ( PROTA, 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Sorghum halepense is best adapted to warm humid subtropical areas with summer-rainfalls, not growing well in strictly tropical areas. It does not thrive in coastal areas, although it is salt tolerant. It will not survive in areas with exceptionally cold winters. Itgrows on soils with a pH range of 4.9 to 8.2. Although it can grow in various types of soils, it is best adapted to porous fertile lowlands and river margins. It can tolerate droughts; the rhizomes will remain viable after drying to about 40% of their weight. It will not grow in the shade and for best growth, it requires a warm sunny position ( Howard, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Sorghum halepense tolerates an annual precipitation in the range of 450 to 1500 mm but prefers a range between 500-700 mm. It grows best in areas with an annual temperature in the range of 8.3 to 27.8°C. The species is not very winter hardy, tolerating occasional temperatures down to about -5°C as long as the

It grows best in areas with an annual temperature in the range of 8.3 to 27.8°C. The species is not very winter hardy, tolerating occasional temperatures down to about -5°C as long as the soil is not too wet. In northern climates with temperatures down to -17°C, the rhizomes must be deeply buried at least 20 cm in order to survive ( Howard, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ; Useful Tropical Plants, 2023 ).

SORGHUM HALEPENSE (L.) Pers. Family: Poaceae Synonyms: Andropogon halepensis (L.)Brot. Common names: Johnsongrass, Aleppo, Milletgrass, Sorgo de Alepo,   Zacate Johnson, Grama China, Cañuela, Don Carlos, Sorgho d'Alep, Herbe de Cuba, Gumai. A tufted perennial grass with tall erect culms up to 2-2.5 m height . Its purplish inflorescence is an open panicle with dissimilar spikelets, 4-7 mm long. Plants develop long rhizomes bearing buds, which germinate readily. Rhizome growth of johnsongrass is more abundant than the shoot growth and in some cases rhizome fresh weight reaches 90% of the whole-developed johnsongrass plant. Apical dominance is broken with rhizome fragmentation, which consistently stimulates lateral bud germination and each bud produces one shoot. It is present in many countries of the world. It prevails in hot climatic conditions and tends to be more productive during the rainy season in tropical areas. Reproduction is by seed and rhizome production. It grows and develops intensively in warm habitats, with air temperatures above 15C. Rhizomes are distributed mainly in the top 20 cm of the soil profile. Most are located in the first 15 cm, but up to 10% are found below 30 cm. Rhizome initiation usually takes place a month or 45 days after johnsongrass emergence and coincides with tillering or the 6-7 leaf stage of shoot growth. This process is commonly faster with plants developing from long rhizomes. Seed production is variable and dependent on several environmental factors. High seed production is found in plants with high tiller production. Production of seed may vary from 540 to 1440 kg/ha, but not all of them are able to germinate

ass emergence and coincides with tillering or the 6-7 leaf stage of shoot growth. This process is commonly faster with plants developing from long rhizomes. Seed production is variable and dependent on several environmental factors. High seed production is found in plants with high tiller production. Production of seed may vary from 540 to 1440 kg/ha, but not all of them are able to germinate immediately after ripening. The optimal air temperature for seed germination is within the range 25-30 o C. The seeds can remain viable in soil for periods of up to 6 years. In Mississippi (U.S.A.), germination of Johnsongrass decreased from 62% after being buried for 2.5 year to 37% after 5.5 year. Vigorous growth requires high light intensity and photoperiods of 12.5 hours are optimal for johnsongrass growth and development. Prevention of seed dispersal and rhizome production is an important measure to avoid high johnsongrass infestation in crop areas. Seeds are normally dispersed through wind, water, animals and contaminated crop seeds, therefore slashing the plants at the beginning of the flowering stage in field margins, ditchbanks, canals and crop land and/or avoiding animal grazing in infested areas help to prevent new johnsongrass infestations. Mechanical control of johnsongrass aims to prevent new rhizome production and must be implemented within the first month after shoot emergence. It is considered that cultivation is most effective when the grass is about 36 cm tall. This helps prevent plants from forming rhizomes or seeds. In arable land johnsongrass infestation may be reduced by dragging the rhizomes onto the soil surface with a sweep or spike-tooth tiller during land preparation as this facilitates desiccation by sunlight. Desiccation of rhizomes can be accelerated by cutting them into fragments less than 5 cm length. Rhizomes dried to 20%

 forming rhizomes or seeds. In arable land johnsongrass infestation may be reduced by dragging the rhizomes onto the soil surface with a sweep or spike-tooth tiller during land preparation as this facilitates desiccation by sunlight. Desiccation of rhizomes can be accelerated by cutting them into fragments less than 5 cm length. Rhizomes dried to 20% of their original weight completely lose their regenerative ability. In fruit tree orchards regular mowing when the shoots are 20-25 cm tall tends to deplete rhizome food reserves and limits further rhizome production. Crop competition. In annual crops such as potato and vegetables, sweet potato is considered an effective preceeding crop which smothers johnsongrass and other grassweed infestations. Pasturing over a period of several seasons is advocated as an effective method to reduce johnsongrass stand. Geese have also provided excellent control of johnsongrass and other grasses in cotton, but required a high level of management. Herbicides. Johnsongrass is not easily controlled with herbicides but several systemic foliarly-applied compounds can be effective. Glyphosate is useful in pre-planting treatment, applied to well-developed foliage 2-3 weeks before planting or seeding, and may also be used in fruit tree orchards. Post-emergence application of fluazifop-butyl, haloxyfop-methyl, fenoxaprop-ethyl, quizalofop-ethyl and sethoxydim are selective in broadleaf crops and provide control of seedlings and suppression of established plants. A single application of these herbicides is not usually enough to reduce heavy johnsongrass infestations below the economical threshold in the affected crops. In sugar cane, post-emergence treatment with compounds such as asulam, dalapon and MSMA have been selective in

hoxydim are selective in broadleaf crops and provide control of seedlings and suppression of established plants. A single application of these herbicides is not usually enough to reduce heavy johnsongrass infestations below the economical threshold in the affected crops. In sugar cane, post-emergence treatment with compounds such as asulam, dalapon and MSMA have been selective in the crop. These compounds are usually applied when the shoots are 20-25 cm high. Dalapon is less selective to sugar cane than asulam or MSMA, and application should be directly onto the weeds, avoiding any contact with cane foliage. Trifluralin as a soil-incorporated pre-planting treatment is effective for the reduction of johnsongrass stand from rhizomes. This treatment is most effective against short rhizomes (less than 10 cm) (McWhorter 1974). Good to excellent effectiveness is provided by a second treatment in the second year of a johnsongrass control program (McWhorter 1989). This treatment is selective in crops such as sugar cane, beans, soybeans, groudnut and cotton (McWhorter 1974; McWhorter 1977; Millhollon 1978; Kleifeld et al. 1986; Labrada et al. 1987). However, this treatment is not selective in all sugar cane varieties. Another useful dinitroaniline herbicide for the control of johnsongrass seedlings is pendimethalin. Pre-seeding soil-incorporated EPTC+ dichlormid is also effective for johnsongrass control in maize crop. It is important to stress that chemical control measures alone do not usually control johnsongrass. Furthermore, chemical treatments are not always economically feasible for smallholder farmers. Therefore, the best control option for this perennial weed is the integration of land preparation, crop rotation and rational chemical treatments. Johnsongrass is one of the major weeds

Furthermore, chemical treatments are not always economically feasible for smallholder farmers. Therefore, the best control option for this perennial weed is the integration of land preparation, crop rotation and rational chemical treatments. Johnsongrass is one of the major weeds in 30 different crops in 53 countries. In infested areas, johnsongrass competes severely with crops such as maize, sorghum, sugarcane, soybeans, groundnut, cotton, vegetables, fruits, tobacco, small grains, pastures and alfalfa. S. halepense is widespread as a weed in North, Central and South America, and in the Near East.

 Reproduccion: Genetics According to cytological, morphological and molecular data, S. halepense is a tetraploid species with a chromosome count of 2n = 40, arising as a natural hybrid between S. bicolor (2n=20), an annual African cultivated species and S. propinquum (2n=20), a perennial Asian species. S. halepense has a S. bicolor enriched allele composition and mutations in 5957 genes that differentiate it from its progenitors ( Paterson et al., 2020 ). There are a few reports of a tropical ecotype from Eurasia being diploid (2n=20) ( PPQ, 2022 ). Populations from the USA and Canada are of Mediterranean origin and are a tetraploid ecotype. Sorghum halepense can hybridize with S. bicolor (2n=20), and the progeny are usually sterile triploids which may be weedy in subsequent crops. Occasionally fertile hybrids occur, one of which is believed to be the origin of the fodder crop Columbus grass or black Sudan grass, S . x almum [ Sorghum almum ] (2n=40) in Argentina. Although hybridization with the crop sorghum is relatively rare and difficult to achieve in practice ( Dweikat, 2005 ), genetic studies by Morrell et al. (2005) suggest that there has been extensive introgression of genes from the crop into S. halepense in areas where the crop is commonly grown. Hybridization with auto-tetraploid sorghum is, however, relatively easy ( Liang et al., 1999 ). A study of populations of S. halepense in Kansas, USA showed high levels of genetic variability, suggesting that there is abundant reproduction from seed and only localized vegetative spread ( Camacho et al., 1993 ).

A study of populations of S. halepense in Kansas, USA showed high levels of genetic variability, suggesting that there is abundant reproduction from seed and only localized vegetative spread ( Camacho et al., 1993 ). Germplasm collections are stored at various institutions ( Millennium Seed Bank, 2023 ; USDA-ARS, 2023 ). DNA barcode information for the species is available for the species ( BOLDS, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Sorghum halepense reproduces vegetatively through its rhizomes and sexually by seeds. Most of the Sorghum species are self-crossers. Some outcrossing occurs in S. halepense by wind pollination,but it is primarily self-pollinated. A single plant may produce 80,000 or more seeds in one growing season ( Howard, 2004 ). Most ecotypes are dormant when first shed due to the mechanical restriction of the seed coat, with less than 10% germination at 20°C ( Taylorson and McWhorter, 1969 ). The extent of dormancy is influenced by environmental conditions during ripening, with greater germination levels being found in seeds which mature during periods of drought stress ( Benech-Arnold et al., 1992 ). Holm et al. (1977) suggest that seed which has lain in the field germinates readily after 1 year and that seedlings can emerge from seeds buried up to 15 cm deep although most arise from the top 7 cm. Seeds can remain viable in soil for at least 7 years ( Leguizamon, 1986 ; Uremİs and Uygur, 2005 ) and remain viable after passing through the guts of animals ( Holm et al., 1977 ). First year seeds have an 82% viability which drops to 62% viability in 2.5 years, 50% viability in

 arise from the top 7 cm. Seeds can remain viable in soil for at least 7 years ( Leguizamon, 1986 ; Uremİs and Uygur, 2005 ) and remain viable after passing through the guts of animals ( Holm et al., 1977 ). First year seeds have an 82% viability which drops to 62% viability in 2.5 years, 50% viability in 5 years to 2% in 6 years ( PPQ, 2022 ). Minimum, optimum and maximum temperatures for germination are 20°C, 25-30°C and 40°C, respectively (Uremis and Uygur, 1999). Light improves germination rate with warm temperatures (>34°C) and inhibits germination with cold temperatures (<22°C). Three to 6 weeks after emergence, seedlings have 5-7 leaves, and the first rhizomes begin to develop. Flowers are produced 7 weeks after seedling appearance ( PPQ, 2022 ). There are three components to the rhizome system ( Holm et al., 1977 ). The primary structures are important at the beginning of the growing season, providing buds for renewed growth. Extensions from the main rhizomes become secondary structures, giving rise to new plants. At flowering, tertiary rhizomes develop from the base of the plant and grow deeply until the onset of cold or dry weather, and these produce new plants the following season. Physiology and Phenology Sorghum halepense is a C4 plant and shows correspondingly rapid growth under warm and hot conditions. Two seed crops per year may be produced under good conditions, while under poor conditions, the resources are allocated to rhizomes at the expense of seed production ( Howard, 2004 ). Rhizome production has an optimum temperature near 30°C, and it is inhibited, as well as flowering, below 13-15°C ( Horowitz, 1972 ; Holm et al, 1977). Most of the ecotypes do not survive temperatures below

 produced under good conditions, while under poor conditions, the resources are allocated to rhizomes at the expense of seed production ( Howard, 2004 ). Rhizome production has an optimum temperature near 30°C, and it is inhibited, as well as flowering, below 13-15°C ( Horowitz, 1972 ; Holm et al, 1977). Most of the ecotypes do not survive temperatures below -3°C ( McWhorter, 1971a ). Rhizomes will not tolerate very low soil temperatures, being killed at -17°C, but surviving -9°C ( Stoller, 1977 ). Monaghan (1980) reports that the rhizome buds sprouting is suppressed by low temperatures, although some buds remain inactive even after returning to favourable growing conditions to ensure that the plant can re-establish after temporary adverse conditions. Relatively high temperatures of 23-30°C promote bud sprouting ( Hull, 1970 ). Fresh rhizomes are killed after 1-3 days on the soil surface at 50-60°C ( McWhorter, 1972 ). A day-length of 12 h is the optimum for flowering, above 14 h of light plants will fail to flower, and above 16 h, all growth processes are inhibited ( Howard, 2004 ). Sorghum halepense will tolerate a degree of flooding, with rhizome fragments germinating after being submerged for up to 4 weeks ( Horowitz, 1972 ). The species will likely survive fires by sprouting from rhizomes ( Howard, 2004 ). It is also most productive during rainy seasons ( PIER, 2023 ). Sorghum halepense can form cyanogenetic glycosides that are poisonous to livestock. The plants are most toxic when the leaves and culms are actively growing, during the seedling stage, and when sprouting after mowing or being heavily grazed. Also, plants are more toxic after droughts, extreme heat, frost or when plants are wet after rains or with

The plants are most toxic when the leaves and culms are actively growing, during the seedling stage, and when sprouting after mowing or being heavily grazed. Also, plants are more toxic after droughts, extreme heat, frost or when plants are wet after rains or with dew. The glycoside levels can vary among the grass populations ( Howard, 2004 ). Sorghum halepense is in flower from August to October, with seeds produced from September to October ( PROTA, 2023 ). Longevity Sorghum halepense is a perennial grass ( PIER, 2023 ). The normal productive life is 3-4 years, with the yield dropping sharply after the first 2 years ( PROTA, 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Sorghum halepense is best adapted to warm humid subtropical areas with summer-rainfalls, not growing well in strictly tropical areas. It does not thrive in coastal areas, although it is salt tolerant. It will not survive in areas with exceptionally cold winters. Itgrows on soils with a pH range of 4.9 to 8.2. Although it can grow in various types of soils, it is best adapted to porous fertile lowlands and river margins. It can tolerate droughts; the rhizomes will remain viable after drying to about 40% of their weight. It will not grow in the shade and for best growth, it requires a warm sunny position ( Howard, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Sorghum halepense tolerates an annual precipitation in the range of 450 to 1500 mm but prefers a range between 500-700 mm. It grows best in areas with an annual temperature in the range of 8.3 to 27.8°C. The species is not very winter hardy, tolerating occasional temperatures down to about -5°C as long as the

It grows best in areas with an annual temperature in the range of 8.3 to 27.8°C. The species is not very winter hardy, tolerating occasional temperatures down to about -5°C as long as the soil is not too wet. In northern climates with temperatures down to -17°C, the rhizomes must be deeply buried at least 20 cm in order to survive ( Howard, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ; Useful Tropical Plants, 2023 ).

Sorghum halepense will tolerate a degree of flooding, with rhizome fragments germinating after being submerged for up to 4 weeks ( Horowitz, 1972 ). The species will likely survive fires by sprouting from rhizomes ( Howard, 2004 ). It is also most productive during rainy seasons ( PIER, 2023 ). Sorghum halepense can form cyanogenetic glycosides that are poisonous to livestock. The plants are most toxic when the leaves and culms are actively growing, during the seedling stage, and when sprouting after mowing or being heavily grazed. Also, plants are more toxic after droughts, extreme heat, frost or when plants are wet after rains or with dew. The glycoside levels can vary among the grass populations ( Howard, 2004 ). Sorghum halepense is in flower from August to October, with seeds produced from September to October ( PROTA, 2023 ). Longevity Sorghum halepense is a perennial grass ( PIER, 2023 ). The normal productive life is 3-4 years, with the yield dropping sharply after the first 2 years ( PROTA, 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Sorghum halepense is best adapted to warm humid subtropical areas with summer-rainfalls, not growing well in strictly tropical areas. It does not thrive in coastal areas, although it is salt tolerant. It will not survive in areas with exceptionally cold winters. Itgrows on soils with a pH range of 4.9 to

 2 years ( PROTA, 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Sorghum halepense is best adapted to warm humid subtropical areas with summer-rainfalls, not growing well in strictly tropical areas. It does not thrive in coastal areas, although it is salt tolerant. It will not survive in areas with exceptionally cold winters. Itgrows on soils with a pH range of 4.9 to 8.2. Although it can grow in various types of soils, it is best adapted to porous fertile lowlands and river margins. It can tolerate droughts; the rhizomes will remain viable after drying to about 40% of their weight. It will not grow in the shade and for best growth, it requires a warm sunny position ( Howard, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Sorghum halepense tolerates an annual precipitation in the range of 450 to 1500 mm but prefers a range between 500-700 mm. It grows best in areas with an annual temperature in the range of 8.3 to 27.8°C. The species is not very winter hardy, tolerating occasional temperatures down to about -5°C as long as the soil is not too wet. In northern climates with temperatures down to -17°C, the rhizomes must be deeply buried at least 20 cm in order to survive ( Howard, 2004 ; PROTA, 2023 ; Useful Tropical Plants, 2023 ).

SORGHUM HALEPENSE (L.) Pers. Family: Poaceae Synonyms: Andropogon halepensis (L.)Brot. Common names: Johnsongrass, Aleppo, Milletgrass, Sorgo de Alepo,   Zacate Johnson, Grama China, Cañuela, Don Carlos, Sorgho d'Alep, Herbe de Cuba, Gumai. A tufted perennial grass with tall erect culms up to 2-2.5 m height . Its purplish inflorescence is an open panicle with dissimilar spikelets, 4-7 mm long. Plants develop long rhizomes bearing buds, which germinate readily. Rhizome growth of johnsongrass is more abundant than the shoot growth and in some cases rhizome fresh weight reaches 90% of the whole-developed johnsongrass plant. Apical dominance is broken with rhizome fragmentation, which consistently stimulates lateral bud germination and each bud produces one shoot. It is present in many countries of the world. It prevails in hot climatic conditions and tends to be more productive during the rainy season in tropical areas. Reproduction is by seed and rhizome production. It grows and develops intensively in warm habitats, with air temperatures above 15C. Rhizomes are distributed mainly in the top 20 cm of the soil profile. Most are located in the first 15 cm, but up to 10% are found below 30 cm. Rhizome initiation usually takes place a month or 45 days after johnsongrass emergence and coincides with tillering or the 6-7 leaf stage of shoot growth. This process is commonly faster with plants developing from long rhizomes. Seed production is variable and dependent on several environmental factors. High seed production is found in plants with high tiller production. Production of seed may vary from 540 to 1440 kg/ha, but not all of them are able to germinate

ass emergence and coincides with tillering or the 6-7 leaf stage of shoot growth. This process is commonly faster with plants developing from long rhizomes. Seed production is variable and dependent on several environmental factors. High seed production is found in plants with high tiller production. Production of seed may vary from 540 to 1440 kg/ha, but not all of them are able to germinate immediately after ripening. The optimal air temperature for seed germination is within the range 25-30 o C. The seeds can remain viable in soil for periods of up to 6 years. In Mississippi (U.S.A.), germination of Johnsongrass decreased from 62% after being buried for 2.5 year to 37% after 5.5 year. Vigorous growth requires high light intensity and photoperiods of 12.5 hours are optimal for johnsongrass growth and development. Prevention of seed dispersal and rhizome production is an important measure to avoid high johnsongrass infestation in crop areas. Seeds are normally dispersed through wind, water, animals and contaminated crop seeds, therefore slashing the plants at the beginning of the flowering stage in field margins, ditchbanks, canals and crop land and/or avoiding animal grazing in infested areas help to prevent new johnsongrass infestations. Mechanical control of johnsongrass aims to prevent new rhizome production and must be implemented within the first month after shoot emergence. It is considered that cultivation is most effective when the grass is about 36 cm tall. This helps prevent plants from forming rhizomes or seeds. In arable land johnsongrass infestation may be reduced by dragging the rhizomes onto the soil surface with a sweep or spike-tooth tiller during land preparation as this facilitates desiccation by sunlight. Desiccation of rhizomes can be accelerated by cutting them into fragments less than 5 cm length. Rhizomes dried to 20%

 forming rhizomes or seeds. In arable land johnsongrass infestation may be reduced by dragging the rhizomes onto the soil surface with a sweep or spike-tooth tiller during land preparation as this facilitates desiccation by sunlight. Desiccation of rhizomes can be accelerated by cutting them into fragments less than 5 cm length. Rhizomes dried to 20% of their original weight completely lose their regenerative ability. In fruit tree orchards regular mowing when the shoots are 20-25 cm tall tends to deplete rhizome food reserves and limits further rhizome production. Crop competition. In annual crops such as potato and vegetables, sweet potato is considered an effective preceeding crop which smothers johnsongrass and other grassweed infestations. Pasturing over a period of several seasons is advocated as an effective method to reduce johnsongrass stand. Geese have also provided excellent control of johnsongrass and other grasses in cotton, but required a high level of management. Herbicides. Johnsongrass is not easily controlled with herbicides but several systemic foliarly-applied compounds can be effective. Glyphosate is useful in pre-planting treatment, applied to well-developed foliage 2-3 weeks before planting or seeding, and may also be used in fruit tree orchards. Post-emergence application of fluazifop-butyl, haloxyfop-methyl, fenoxaprop-ethyl, quizalofop-ethyl and sethoxydim are selective in broadleaf crops and provide control of seedlings and suppression of established plants. A single application of these herbicides is not usually enough to reduce heavy johnsongrass infestations below the economical threshold in the affected crops. In sugar cane, post-emergence treatment with compounds such as asulam, dalapon and MSMA have been selective in

hoxydim are selective in broadleaf crops and provide control of seedlings and suppression of established plants. A single application of these herbicides is not usually enough to reduce heavy johnsongrass infestations below the economical threshold in the affected crops. In sugar cane, post-emergence treatment with compounds such as asulam, dalapon and MSMA have been selective in the crop. These compounds are usually applied when the shoots are 20-25 cm high. Dalapon is less selective to sugar cane than asulam or MSMA, and application should be directly onto the weeds, avoiding any contact with cane foliage. Trifluralin as a soil-incorporated pre-planting treatment is effective for the reduction of johnsongrass stand from rhizomes. This treatment is most effective against short rhizomes (less than 10 cm) (McWhorter 1974). Good to excellent effectiveness is provided by a second treatment in the second year of a johnsongrass control program (McWhorter 1989). This treatment is selective in crops such as sugar cane, beans, soybeans, groudnut and cotton (McWhorter 1974; McWhorter 1977; Millhollon 1978; Kleifeld et al. 1986; Labrada et al. 1987). However, this treatment is not selective in all sugar cane varieties. Another useful dinitroaniline herbicide for the control of johnsongrass seedlings is pendimethalin. Pre-seeding soil-incorporated EPTC+ dichlormid is also effective for johnsongrass control in maize crop. It is important to stress that chemical control measures alone do not usually control johnsongrass. Furthermore, chemical treatments are not always economically feasible for smallholder farmers. Therefore, the best control option for this perennial weed is the integration of land preparation, crop rotation and rational chemical treatments. Johnsongrass is one of the major weeds

Furthermore, chemical treatments are not always economically feasible for smallholder farmers. Therefore, the best control option for this perennial weed is the integration of land preparation, crop rotation and rational chemical treatments. Johnsongrass is one of the major weeds in 30 different crops in 53 countries. In infested areas, johnsongrass competes severely with crops such as maize, sorghum, sugarcane, soybeans, groundnut, cotton, vegetables, fruits, tobacco, small grains, pastures and alfalfa. S. halepense is widespread as a weed in North, Central and South America, and in the Near East.
