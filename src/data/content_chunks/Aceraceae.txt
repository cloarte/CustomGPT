35.Aceraceae槭树科 qi shu keAuthors:Tingzhi Xu,Yousheng Chen,Piet C. de Jong,Herman John Oterdoom&Chin-Sung ChangTrees, sometimes shrubs, deciduous or evergreen, andromonoecious, androdioecious, or dioecious (correct from a morphological view; flowers are functionally male or female). Winter buds imbricate or valvate. Leaves opposite, mostly simple and palmately lobed, sometimes leaves pinnately veined and entire or pinnately (7-)11-21-foliolate (Dipteronia), usually estipulate. Inflorescence a corymb, umbel, raceme, or panicle, terminal or lateral. Flowers bisexual (but functionally female) or unisexual, actinomorphic. Sepals (4 or)5, rarely 6, distinct or seldom connate below. Petals (4 or)5, rarely 6, imbricate, distinct, often as sepals, rarely absent. Stamens usually 8, sometimes 4-6 or 10-12; disk extrastaminal, amphistaminal, intrastaminal, or absent. Ovary superior, compressed, usually 2-loculed, with 2 ovules per locule; style usually bifurcate, forming 2 stigmas. Fruit a winged schizocarp, usually a double samara, usually 1-seeded, endosperm absent. Germination epigeous, rarely hypogeous.x= 9 or 13.Two genera and ca. 131 species: the genusAceris widespread in N temperate and some tropical regions; the genusDipteroniais endemic to China; two genera (one endemic) and 101 species (63 endemic, three introduced) in China.
