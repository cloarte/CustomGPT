Expert Working Group for the RNQP Project – Forestry Sector Paris, 2017-03-22/23 In the context of Regulation 2016/2031 of 26 October 2016 on protective measures against pests of plants, and its list of pests to be published in an implementing act in the following 3 years, EPPO has contracted a 2-year project with the EU Commission on Regulated Non-Quarantine Pests (RNQPs). RNQPs are defined in two International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM 16: Regulated non-quarantine pests: concept and application and ISPM 21: Pest risk analysis for regulated non-quarantine pests). More specifically article 36 of EU Regulation 2016/2031 defines RNQPs as pests with a clear taxonomic identity, present in the European Union territory, transmitted mainly through specific plants for planting, whose presence has an unacceptable economic impact as regards the intended use, and where feasible and effective measures are available. Article 37 of EU Regulation 2016/2031 regulates RNQPs for professional operators. The pests/entries that may fulfill that definition, and for which the specification requires the assessment of the relevance of the RNQP status, are those currently listed within the EU Marketing Directives on reproductive material, plus some proposed by the Annex Working Group (section 2) of the EU Commission and mainly coming from Annex IIA2 of EU Council Directive 2000/29/EC. Objective of the project The objective of this project is to propose a list of RNQPs for the EU. In addition, this list may serve as a basis for other EPPO member countries to establish their own regulations. In order to propose such a list of RNQPs, the work has been divided into two phases: Phase 1: to define a screening methodology Phase 2: to apply the methodology to specific pests Dothistroma septosporum (left) - Lecanosticta acicola (

Six 'Sector Expert Working Groups' (SEWGs) have been consituted to work on the following crops or groups of crops: 1) seed potatoes; 2) forestry; 3) agricultural plants; 4) vegetables; 5) ornamentals, and 6) fruit (including hop and grapevine). The ‘Forestry’ SEWG met in Paris on 2017-03-22/23, back to back with the Panel on Quarantine pests for forestry. As currently no pests are listed in the forestry Marketing Directive, for this sector the assessment focused on seven pests proposed by the Annex Working Group (section 2) of the EU Commission. The SEWG agreed a list of RNQPs for this Sector, as well as recommendations concerning tolerance levels and risk management measures for these pests. In the replies to the RNQP Questionnaire, many additional pests were proposed for a RNQP listing for this sector: this will require further evaluation in the coming years by the EU Commission or EPPO. Useful ref﻿erence﻿ Council Directive 1999/105/EC of 22 December 1999 on the marketing of forest reproductive material.
