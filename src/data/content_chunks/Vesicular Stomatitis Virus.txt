Breadcrumb Home Animals Animal Health Livestock and Poultry Disease Cattle and Bison Diseases Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Last Modified:  April 06, 2024 Vesicular stomatitis is a contagious disease of livestock, mainly affecting horses and cattle. Occasionally, this disease can infect swine, sheep, goats, llamas, alpacas, and even people. It is primarily transmitted by biting flies and midges. The disease causes blister-like sores, among other side effects. Although vesicular stomatitis rarely causes high mortality rates, it can impact animal movement and international trade, resulting in economic losses for livestock producers. Outbreaks usually occur during warmer months, often along waterways. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced several outbreaks since 1995, with the most widespread in 2019. What To Look For Clinical signs may appear 2 to 8 days after exposure. Here's what to look for: Drooling or frothing at the mouth The first sign of illness is often excessive salivation. If you look inside the mouth, you'll see blanched and raised blisters on the inner surfaces of the lips, gums, tongue, or dental pad. Lesions Blister-like lesions can form around the mouth, nose, sheath, udders, ears, and coronary band (where an animal's hairline meets their hooves). If lesions develop around the coronary band, lameness may occur. Fever You may notice a rise in body temperature before or at the same time lesions first appear. Reluctance to eat The blisters swell and break open, which causes mouth pain, discomfort, and reluctance to eat or drink. This can cause weight loss. How To Prevent This Disease Although experimental vaccines have been developed, none have been approved for use in horses. The best way to prevent the disease is by: Isolating new horses before introducing them to your herd. Controlling insects

. Reluctance to eat The blisters swell and break open, which causes mouth pain, discomfort, and reluctance to eat or drink. This can cause weight loss. How To Prevent This Disease Although experimental vaccines have been developed, none have been approved for use in horses. The best way to prevent the disease is by: Isolating new horses before introducing them to your herd. Controlling insects on your property with fly traps, sprays, and clean horse pens. Separating sick horses from healthy horses on your property. Handling healthy animals before sick animals. Washing and disinfecting your hands and boots after working with sick animals. If possible, change and wash your clothes as well. How It Is Treated Vesicular stomatitis is treated with supportive care. Since the lesions may be quite painful, your veterinarian may prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs. If your animal is having trouble eating, softening their grain in warm water could encourage them to eat more. Softening hay cubes can also help if they're having trouble eating grass and hay. If secondary infections develop around lesions, your veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics. Report Signs of Animal Disease Producers or owners who suspect an animal disease should contact their veterinarian to evaluate the animal or herd. Find an accredited veterinarian . Animal health professionals (veterinarians; diagnostic laboratories; public health, zoo, or wildlife personnel; and others) report diagnosed or suspected cases of nationally listed reportable animal diseases to APHIS Area Veterinarians in Charge and to the State animal health official as applicable under State reporting regulations.

2023-2024 Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) 
Situation Report – January 22, 2024  
Information current as of 8:00 am MST, 1/22/2024  
 
Since the last situation report (1/9/2024), there have been no new VSV-affected premises 
identified in the United States.  All confirmed cases in the 2023-2024 outbreak were vesicular 
stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV) serotype. Updates are as follows:   
 
California 
• No new suspect or confirmed positive premises identified since the last report 
• Since the last situation report (1/9/2024), the following previously confirmed positive 
premises were released from quarantine:  2 premises in Sacramento County.  
• The last VSV quarantines in California were released on January 18, 2024.        
      
 
Classification of Cases  
Premises that have diagnostic laboratory confirmation of VSV are categorized as confirmed 
positive premises.  Once a county is confirmed as VSV-positive, new equine premises presenting 
with clinical signs of VSV in that county are not required to be tested for confirmation of the 
disease, but the premises will be quarantined and classified as a suspect premises. Premises may 
also be classified as suspect if clinical animals on the premises fail to meet confirmed case 
definition, but there is diagnostic laboratory evidence of recent VSV infection.    
 
Quarantines 
Confirmed positive and suspect premises are quarantined for at least 14 days from the onset of 
lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.

also be classified as suspect if clinical animals on the premises fail to meet confirmed case 
definition, but there is diagnostic laboratory evidence of recent VSV infection.    
 
Quarantines 
Confirmed positive and suspect premises are quarantined for at least 14 days from the onset of 
lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.  
 
Epidemiology and Disease Control 
Vesicular stomatitis virus circulates annually between livestock and insect vectors in southern 
Mexico and only occasionally results in incursion to the U.S. when climatic and ecological 
factors support movement of VSV-infected insect vectors northward. Known competent vectors 
for transmission of VSV include black flies, sand flies, and biting midges (Culicoides spp.), but 
other insect vectors may also be involved.  Susceptible species are primarily equids (horses, 
donkeys, mules) and cattle, but can also include camelids (llamas, alpacas), swine, sheep, and 
goats.  Control measures on VSV suspect and confirmed positive premises include quarantine of 
all susceptible species, isolation of lesioned animals, enhanced biosecurity, and vector mitigation 
measures to reduce within-herd spread.

2023-2024 Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) 
Situation Report – January 22, 2024  
Information current as of 8:00 am MST, 1/22/2024  
 
Since the last situation report (1/9/2024), there have been no new VSV-affected premises 
identified in the United States.  All confirmed cases in the 2023-2024 outbreak were vesicular 
stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV) serotype. Updates are as follows:   
 
California 
• No new suspect or confirmed positive premises identified since the last report 
• Since the last situation report (1/9/2024), the following previously confirmed positive 
premises were released from quarantine:  2 premises in Sacramento County.  
• The last VSV quarantines in California were released on January 18, 2024.        
      
 
Classification of Cases  
Premises that have diagnostic laboratory confirmation of VSV are categorized as confirmed 
positive premises.  Once a county is confirmed as VSV-positive, new equine premises presenting 
with clinical signs of VSV in that county are not required to be tested for confirmation of the 
disease, but the premises will be quarantined and classified as a suspect premises. Premises may 
also be classified as suspect if clinical animals on the premises fail to meet confirmed case 
definition, but there is diagnostic laboratory evidence of recent VSV infection.    
 
Quarantines 
Confirmed positive and suspect premises are quarantined for at least 14 days from the onset of 
lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.
