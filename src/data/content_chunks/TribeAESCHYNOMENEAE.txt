Rudd’s revision of Aeschynomeneae (in R. M. Polhill & P. H. Raven, Advances Legume Syst. 1: 347-354. 1981). Recently, all members of Aeschynomeneae have been included in an enlarged Dalbergieae sensu lato (Lavin & Klitgaard in Lewis et al., Legumes World, 307-335. 2005). However, the two elements are so disparate morphologically that a conservative treatment has been adopted here, i.e., maintaining both tribes.The Aeschynomeneae contains members of economic importance. Notable among them is the worldwide cropArachis hypogaea(peanut). Cultivars of two additional species ofArachisand two ofStylosantheshave been introduced and grown as fodder plants in China.1Stipules not spurred, free or largely or partly adnate to petiole(2)+Stipules spurred below point of insertion, peltate or bilaterally auriculate(4)2(1)Stipules free, not adnate to petiole; leaflets 9-17 per leaf; flowers pedicellate, with a short hypanthium; calyx subequally 5-toothed; legume walls longitudinally parallel veined.59Ormocarpum+Stipules largely or partly adnate to petiole (pseudopetiole); leaflets 3 or 4 per leaf; flowers sessile, with a long hypanthium; calyx usually 2-lipped; legume walls reticulate veined(3
