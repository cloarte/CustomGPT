Heartworm Disease in Dogs  
Heartworm is a deadly parasite spread by mosquitoes. Left 
undetected, it causes lung disease, heart failure, and other major 
organ damage. Testing is the only way to know if your dogs have it. 
“Silent” Infection   
Adult worms and their microscopic offspring 
live in the blood stream of infected dogs. 
Mosquitoes pick up the offspring when they 
bite (feed from) an infected dog and carry them 
to the next dog they bite. These tiny offspring 
grow into large adult worms that can range 
from 6 to 12 inches in length. As the worms 
grow and reproduce, they interfere with blood 
flow throughout the dog’s body.
This happens silently over time. Most dogs 
don’t show symptoms until the infection  
is advanced.  
How To Protect Your Dogs 
All dogs are at risk.  It only takes one mosquito 
to infect a dog with heartworm and spread it to 
multiple dogs in your kennel. 
Dogs can get infected year-round, and they’re 
at risk whether housed outdoors or inside. 
Important steps to protect your dogs include:
1. ROUTINE TESTING.  Your veterinarian 
can detect heartworm disease with a quick 
blood test at annual checkups. Finding 
the disease early is critical for effective 
treatment and to minimize spread to  
other dogs.
2. PREVENTIVE CARE.  Heartworm is very 
easy

easy to prevent with medication. Ask your 
veterinarian about available options.
3. KEEP MOSQUITOES AWAY.  You can get 
rid of standing water at your property, 
use screens on windows, and take other 
proactive steps to control mosquitoes and 
minimize your dogs’ exposure.

Symptoms and Treatment
Symptoms usually don’t show up until late 
stages of infection. Dogs may have a dry, 
persistent cough; difficulty breathing; decreased 
activity; loss of appetite; and weight loss. 
Treatments require hospitalization and are  
often expensive and time consuming. More 
serious cases require surgery to physically 
remove the adult worms from the dog’s heart 
and blood vessels.
DID YOU KNOW?  
The mosquitoes that 
spread heartworm are 
commonly found indoors, 
even during the winter.
