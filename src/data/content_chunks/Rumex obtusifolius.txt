 Invasion: R. obtusifolius is an erect perennial herb, 40-150 cm tall, with a stout, branched taproot, extending to a depth of 150 cm in soils that allow deep root penetration. Over the taproot, adult plants develop a fleshy underground stem, 3-5 cm long, with a branched crown. Basal rosette leaves and leafy stems develop from the crown. Stems are stiff, glabrous, ribbed with reddish blotches. Basal and lower leaves are petioled, ovate-oblong, with a cordate base and a rounded apex, and have a large and paper-like ochrea. Upper leaves are narrow, ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate at the top with a pointed apex. Lamina are 10-30 cm long and 6-15 cm wide, becoming progressively smaller upwards, slightly wavy along their margins, green, may be reddish-veined, turning more reddish-purple with age.Inflorescences are 15-50 cm long racemes, with alternate leaves without petioles among the branches. Flowers, arranged in whorls, are small, with 6 inner valves, sometimes called tepals, which are 3-6 mm long and 2-3 mm wide, triangular to oblong-ovate, on pedicels 5-10 mm long, green in the beginning and reddish-brown at maturity. Fruit is a triangular achene, enclosed within three inner perianth segments, up to 5-6 mm long and 3 mm wide, with three to five teeth. The seeds are polymorphic, differing in size.

Adult R. obtusifolius plants in the close vicinity of the seedlings exert a negative influence on their survival ( Makuchi and Kanda, 1980 ).The plant is a hemicryptophyte and after overwintering regrowth from the rosette usually takes place in late February-March. New shoots are produced from buds on the underground stem. Inflorescences are first formed in early May and may be initiated until the first severe frost ( Cavers and Harper, 1964 ). Flowering and seed set can occur twice in one growing season, first flowers appearing in May-June and the second, after cutting and regrowth of shoots, in August-September. Individual plants may live for at least 5 years. Inflorescences are produced every year under normal conditions and plants do not usually die after producing seed.Reproductive BiologyReproduction is amphimictic. Flowers have no nectar and are mainly wind-pollinated. Most individuals are highly self-fertile, although there is variation in this respect between plants.Propagation is mainly by seeds, produced in very large numbers, varying from less than 100 to 60,000 per plant in a single year. Fruits can be blown for a considerable distance by wind, be carried floating on water, and be dispersed via the digestive system of birds and animals ( Cavers and Harper, 1964 ). Spines on the fruit assist in long-distance distribution by animals, attached to fur or feathers, and by humans.Seeds may remain viable for a long period when buried deeply in the soil; 83% germinated after burial for 21 years ( Toole and Brown, 1946 ).In a study carried out by Pino et al.

(1995) , R. obtusifolius plants showed a clonal growth system in which the roots branch after the first flowering and produce adventitious roots, which accumulate reserves over the next 2 years and separate from the original taproot in the fifth year. This 'phalanx' type of growth allows the plant to reproduce in areas where seedling establishment is inhibited by competition for space. It also has the capacity of vegetative propagation from fragments of root or underground stem split up by cultivation. This is a less important method of reproduction than through seeds; it can, however, significantly facilitate the spread of the species locally ( Brock, 1972 ; Pino et al., 1995 ).Environmental RequirementsGrowth and development are promoted by climatic conditions typical for temperate regions. Cavers and Harper (1964) state that for the UK there does not seem to be any climatic limitation of the species. It is present inside the Arctic Circle in Northern Scandinavia, can be found at various altitudes and was recorded at 3200 m in Mexico. R. obtusifolius can grow on a wide range of soils, except peat ( Cavers and Harper, 1964 ). Ellenberg (1974) classifies it as indifferent to pH but its growth is inhibited on the most acid soils. It is a typically nitrophilous plant ( Melzer et al., 1984 ) and shows high abundance on soils with high potassium concentrations ( Humphreys et al., 1999 ). It is favoured by humid conditions, but mature plants with a well-established root system are capable of withstanding severe drought periods.AssociationsNo mycorrhizal root symbionts have been recorded

Flowering and seed set can occur twice in one growing season, first flowers appearing in May-June and the second, after cutting and regrowth of shoots, in August-September. Individual plants may live for at least 5 years. Inflorescences are produced every year under normal conditions and plants do not usually die after producing seed.Reproductive BiologyReproduction is amphimictic. Flowers have no nectar and are mainly wind-pollinated. Most individuals are highly self-fertile, although there is variation in this respect between plants.Propagation is mainly by seeds, produced in very large numbers, varying from less than 100 to 60,000 per plant in a single year. Fruits can be blown for a considerable distance by wind, be carried floating on water, and be dispersed via the digestive system of birds and animals ( Cavers and Harper, 1964 ). Spines on the fruit assist in long-distance distribution by animals, attached to fur or feathers, and by humans.Seeds may remain viable for a long period when buried deeply in the soil; 83% germinated after burial for 21 years ( Toole and Brown, 1946 ).In a study carried out by Pino et al.

(1995) , R. obtusifolius plants showed a clonal growth system in which the roots branch after the first flowering and produce adventitious roots, which accumulate reserves over the next 2 years and separate from the original taproot in the fifth year. This 'phalanx' type of growth allows the plant to reproduce in areas where seedling establishment is inhibited by competition for space. It also has the capacity of vegetative propagation from fragments of root or underground stem split up by cultivation. This is a less important method of reproduction than through seeds; it can, however, significantly facilitate the spread of the species locally ( Brock, 1972 ; Pino et al., 1995 ).Environmental RequirementsGrowth and development are promoted by climatic conditions typical for temperate regions. Cavers and Harper (1964) state that for the UK there does not seem to be any climatic limitation of the species. It is present inside the Arctic Circle in Northern Scandinavia, can be found at various altitudes and was recorded at 3200 m in Mexico. R. obtusifolius can grow on a wide range of soils, except peat ( Cavers and Harper, 1964 ). Ellenberg (1974) classifies it as indifferent to pH but its growth is inhibited on the most acid soils. It is a typically nitrophilous plant ( Melzer et al., 1984 ) and shows high abundance on soils with high potassium concentrations ( Humphreys et al., 1999 ). It is favoured by humid conditions, but mature plants with a well-established root system are capable of withstanding severe drought periods.AssociationsNo mycorrhizal root symbionts have been recorded

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology GeneticsThe chromosome number is 2n = 40. Hybridization between R. obtusifolius and other members of the subgenus Rumex occurs frequently ( Cavers and Harper, 1964 ). The commonest hybrid is R. crispus x R. obtusifolius, described as R. acutus by Linnaeus and also as R. pratensis Mert & Koch. It can be recognized by intermediate leaves and tepals. This is the most fertile Rumex hybrid, and produces some viable seeds. Other hybrids, with R. longifolius, R. confertus, and R. patientia, are virtually sterile.Physiology and PhenologyGermination of R. obtusifolius seeds can occur in any month of the year ( Cavers and Harper, 1964 ), although it is concentrated in March-April and in August-October. The species shows very high sensitivity to light; germination of its seeds is controlled by phytochrome ( Taylorson and Hendricks, 1972 ) and is more rapid in the presence of light ( Milberg, 1997 ). Daylight or near-red light stimulates germination, whereas far-red light, increased by the presence of a leaf canopy, inhibits it ( Takaki et al., 1981 ).

 species shows very high sensitivity to light; germination of its seeds is controlled by phytochrome ( Taylorson and Hendricks, 1972 ) and is more rapid in the presence of light ( Milberg, 1997 ). Daylight or near-red light stimulates germination, whereas far-red light, increased by the presence of a leaf canopy, inhibits it ( Takaki et al., 1981 ). Seeds can also germinate in the absence of light after an exposure to alternating temperatures (van Assche and Vanlerberghe, 1989 ); this accounts for the spring flush of germination when the temperature fluctuations in the soil are very large. Constant temperatures induce secondary dormancy ( Roberts and Totterdell, 1981 ). Benvenuti et al. (2001) report that thermal optima for germination are between 20 and 25°C in light or in darkness. In their study seedlings did not emerge when seeds were buried at a depth of more than 8 cm. Seeds exhibit great within- and between-plant polymorphism, which enables germination under various environmental conditions ( Honek and Martinkovà, 2002 ). Unlike seeds buried in the autumn in the soil that pass through annual dormancy/non-dormancy cycles, the seeds continuously shed from dry standing shoots of R. obtusifolius become germinable all year round, after a short period of burial.In the seedling year most plants remain at the rosette stage and a long stout rootstock is produced, but flowering and seed set do not normally take place until the second year, unless competition from other plants is weak. A dense sward limits the juvenile growth and establishment of R. obtusifolius in grassland ( Jeangros and Nösberger, 1990 ). The establishment of young plants is favoured by frequent mowing ( Hongo, 1989 ). Adult R. obtusifolius plants in the close vicinity of the seedlings exert a
