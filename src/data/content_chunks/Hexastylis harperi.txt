Plant Notes:  Harper's Wild Ginger is a native herbaceous perennial in the Birthwort family (Aristolochiaceae). It is found in scattered locations in the upper Coastal Plain near the Fall Line and in the Piedmont. Harper's Wild Ginger occurs in sites that are persistently wet, but not sites that flood. It occurs in hillside seeps, forested bogs, and along spring runs. It is a perennial from a long creeping rhizome. The rhizomes are cord-like and creep just below the leaf litter or are shallowly buried. The leaves are cordate, evergreen, and leathery in texture. The leaves are widely spaced along the length of the rhizome. Leaves are typically dark green in color or with silver markings. The leaves are small for a Wild Ginger, often only one to three inches across. Leaves and rhizomes emit a strong odor of ginger when crushed. Flowers are urceolate (urn) to campanulate (bell) in shape with three spreading triangular calyx lobes. There are no petals. Flowers are often hidden by the leaf litter, and are thick and leathery in texture. They are mottled in greenish-yellow, white, and purple-mar

 and rhizomes emit a strong odor of ginger when crushed. Flowers are urceolate (urn) to campanulate (bell) in shape with three spreading triangular calyx lobes. There are no petals. Flowers are often hidden by the leaf litter, and are thick and leathery in texture. They are mottled in greenish-yellow, white, and purple-maroon. The fruit is a fleshy capsule containing up to fifteen seed. The seed have a white elaiosome along one side. The typical variety (var. shuttleworthii), also occurs in Alabama. It differs in having larger leaves that are crowded at the ends of short rhizomes. The typical variety has a more northern distribution, and occurs primarily on moist slopes under Mountain Laurel or Rhododendrons. Harper's Wild Ginger is listed as an S2 species in Alabama (typically 6 to 20 occurrences, few remaining individuals, acres, or miles of stream, or factors demonstrably making it very vulnerable in the state) and globally as a G4 species (imperiled globally because of rarity (6 - 20 occurrences, or few remaining acres, or miles of stream) or very vulnerable to extinction throughout its range because of other factors). In addition to Alabama, Harper’s Wild Ginger is also found in Georgia. First collected by Ro  ;
