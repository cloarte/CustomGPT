Maple sugar and syrup are obtained from the sap of these two speciesand are solely products of the United States and Canada. The Indians weremaking crude syrups and sugar from maple sap before the coming of white men.The preparation of maple sugar and syrup is strictly a farm industry, occurringfrom Kentucky northwest to Iowa, northeast to Maine and north into Canada.Native stands of these maple species are tapped to obtain the dilute juice orsap. The trees are not a cultivated crop, although competing useless trees maybe removed and maple stands may be thinned to promote better growth and sugaryield. Only a small proportion of the available trees of these species areactually tapped. It is estimated that more than 200 million such trees aregrowing in the United States, and less than 6 million are tapped.
The tapping is done by boring a small hole (under 0.5-inch diameter)horizontally into the tree so as to penetrate through the outer or sap wood. Onlarge trees up to four such taps may be made at one time. Tapered spouts(hollow tubes) are driven into the holes to fit tightly, and the sap flowsthrough this tube and is collected in sap buckets. it is important to protectthe buckets and contents from rain water. Tapping is done in late winter,before bud break. During periods when temperatures are above freezing at thisseason sap flow is quite abundant, A tap hole usuallv produces 5 to 15 gallonsof sap, though much more than that is sometimes obtained.

Portable tanks of various types are used to collect the sap, which ispoured into the tank through strainers. An alternative method is to use pipclines to carry the sap to the evaporation equipment.
Originally a single open kettle over a fire was used to evaporate the excesswater in the sap to produce syrup. Now multiple evaporators are mainly used,the syrup being transferred as it becomes more dense. Usually 2 or 3 transfersare made. Modem evaporating pans have flues in them through which the heat fromthe fuel passes to speed the process and codserve fuel. For standard-densitysyrup, concentration is to 65.5°Brix, which is about 86 percent solids byweight. If the sap tests 2.4°Brix, 34 gallons would be required to produce onegallon of syrup.
Slow evaporation--or longer heating time--in the final stages ofconcentration result in a darker colored syrup. More rapid evaporation at thisstage gives a lighter colored, higher grade syrup. Sensitive thermometers areused to determine when the syrup is concentrated to the standard of 65.5 Brix.The completed syrup contains solid granules, mainly calcium malate, termedsugar sand. For toable syrup these must be removed. On the farm they may beallowed to settle out or are removed by filtering. Centrifuging is efficient ifavailable.

To produce various types of maple sugar, the syrup is further heated andadditional water driven off. If heated to a boiling point of 230°F. and cooledrapidly without stirring a solid cake is formed. Stirring during coolingresults in crystal formation. For fine crystals the highly supersaturatedsolution is seeded with fine crystals and stirred rapidly, which results inrapid formation of great numbers of fine crystals.
Numerous products, as maple cream, or butters, soft-sugar candies, maplespread, and candies utilize maple syrup or sugar. Total maple syrup productionin the United States averaged approximately 1,400,000 gallons, 1961-66,inclusive. This includes that made into sugar. In addition about 800,000gallons of syrup and 5,145,000 pounds of sugar were imported annually fromCanada during those years.
