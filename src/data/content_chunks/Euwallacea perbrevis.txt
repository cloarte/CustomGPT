 Reproduccion: Browne (1961) reviewed the biology and ecology of E. perbrevis in South-East Asia. Muraleedharan (1986) described its biology on tea in India. Wood and Bright (1992) gave several hundred references relating to the biology, habits, taxonomy and control of E. perbrevis . The biology and ecology of E. perbrevis is probably very similar to that of other species in the E. fornicatus species complex. The major factors that determine the intensity of attacks on tea in southern India are the state of maturity of the branches, the height of pruning, the time of pruning, and the length of the pruning cycle ( Muraleedharan et al., 2003 ). The primary branches formed after pruning are more susceptible to attack, and attack densities are higher in blocks under a longer pruning cycle ( Muraleedharan et al., 2003 ). The distribution of attacks on tea plants is also discussed by Sivapalan (1975) . Adult females disperse during the day attacking hosts in a range 30-35 m, but they can travel 400 m ( Browne, 1961 ; Owens et al., 2019a ). Females bore a bifurcated or simple tunnel in the twigs or branches of the host, so that it encircles the stem. If the host material is of a small diameter, one or two branch tunnels may be constructed. These may be straight or spiral and are often longer than 5 cm. Egg-laying begins as soon as the entrance tunnel is completed. Eggs are laid singly or in small clusters.

Egg-laying begins as soon as the entrance tunnel is completed. Eggs are laid singly or in small clusters. In Malaysia, egg production continues fairly steadily for about 10 days, after which there is a marked decline, although laying may proceed at intervals for at least an additional 10 days. In Java, broods may include 15-20 individuals ( Kalshoven, 1958 ). In Sri Lanka, the maximum per brood was 34 individuals ( Gadd, 1941 ). In Malaysia, Browne (1961) reported that three galleries in Pajanelia sp. averaged 28.3 individuals per brood. Males are produced in much smaller numbers, and develop more rapidly than females. The males cannot fly and do not normally leave the parental gallery, although they sometimes emerge and crawl on the surface of the bark. Occasionally, these males may enter a gallery made by another female and mate with the females in that gallery system; thus a very small amount of cross-breeding occurs. The larvae live in the parental galleries. The female larvae pass through three instars ( Gadd, 1941 ; Browne, 1961 ). The larvae pupate together in the tunnels. After emergence from the pupal stage, the young females remain in the galleries for several days, during which time they are fertilized by their brothers. Mated females emerge through the original entrance tunnel and fly to new hosts. They fly during the day and are not attracted to light. In tea plantations they seldom fly higher than 2 m ( Judenko, 1956 ). In Malaysia, Browne (1961) found that the parent beetle raises only one brood, and dies when her offspring have flown. In the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia, the life-cycle takes 29-33 days. However, eggs continue to be produced for about 3 weeks and it is possible that the emergence of adults

In the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia, the life-cycle takes 29-33 days. However, eggs continue to be produced for about 3 weeks and it is possible that the emergence of adults from the host may continue for a similar period ( Browne, 1961 ). In southern India, Muraleedharan (1983) reported that the egg, larval and pupal stages lasted 8-10, 21-26 and 10-12 days, respectively. The developmental period varies with altitude, temperature and predation, but most of the new generation emerge about 5-6 weeks after the host is infested. Cooperband et al. (2016) found that adults develop in 22 days at 24°C, producing 68 female adults in 6 weeks, 7% of which are males. The ratio of females to males is low compared to many other ambrosia beetles. In Java, it has been estimated as 9:1 ( Kalshoven, 1958 ), and in Sri Lanka as 4:1 ( Beeson, 1941 ) and 3:1 ( Judenko, 1956 ). In Malaysia, Browne (1961) examined several complete broods and reported there were four or five females to each male. Like all ambrosia beetles, E. perbrevis feeds on a symbiotic fungus that is cultivated in the xylem of woody plants ( Batra, 1967 ). The symbiotic fungi, introduced into the gallery by the attacking female, serves as their source of nutrition for larvae, with severe pathogenic effects for some species. The spores of the ambrosia fungus are stored and carried in a specialized structure called mycangia ( Batra, 1963 ) located near the mandibles of the adult female ( Fernando, 1960 ).

The spores of the ambrosia fungus are stored and carried in a specialized structure called mycangia ( Batra, 1963 ) located near the mandibles of the adult female ( Fernando, 1960 ). The spores travel from the mycangia through ducts to the buccal cavity and are then deposited in the gallery using the mandibles and maxillae. Early work on the ambrosia fungi (e.g. Speyer, 1923 ; Gadd and Loos, 1947 ) should not be relied on, because of problems with fungal taxonomy and contamination of fungal cultures. In southern India, Mouli and Kumar (1988) found the fungus Fusarium tumidum in the tunnels of E. perbrevis in tea branches. Somasekhara et al. (2000) isolated the phytopathogen, Ceratocystis fimbriata , from E. perbrevis in wilting pomegranate trees in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Fusarium bugnicourtii is given as the ambrosia fungus by UPASI Tea Research Foundation, Kerala, India (2003a). Carrillo et al. (2016) found Fusarium sp. and Graphium sp. as the most common fungal symbionts associated with E. perbrevis in Florida. The vectorized fungus invades the vascular tissue of the host, causing necrosis, gum exudates, branch dieback, and potential mortality in several host species.

 Sintomas: E. perbrevis bores into the stems and branches of suitable hosts, initially visible as circular, 1.5 mm holes with white frass in addition to resin, latex or other plant host defences depending on the species attacked. In avocado growing in dry conditions, a white exudate forms, known as a ‘sugar volcano’ ( Eskalen et al., 2013 ). Repeated attacks by E. perbrevis in successive pruning cycles cause severe chronic debilitation of the tea bushes. Following attack, branches become weak, unproductive, wilted, susceptible to further attack, and usually eventually dieback of the branch. The physical damage to the branch may result in it breaking and falling. Trees and shrubs become weakened and disfigured from losing branches.

The males cannot fly and do not normally leave the parental gallery, although they sometimes emerge and crawl on the surface of the bark. Occasionally, these males may enter a gallery made by another female and mate with the females in that gallery system; thus a very small amount of cross-breeding occurs. The larvae live in the parental galleries. The female larvae pass through three instars ( Gadd, 1941 ; Browne, 1961 ). The larvae pupate together in the tunnels. After emergence from the pupal stage, the young females remain in the galleries for several days, during which time they are fertilized by their brothers. Mated females emerge through the original entrance tunnel and fly to new hosts. They fly during the day and are not attracted to light. In tea plantations they seldom fly higher than 2 m ( Judenko, 1956 ). In Malaysia, Browne (1961) found that the parent beetle raises only one brood, and dies when her offspring have flown. In the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia, the life-cycle takes 29-33 days. However, eggs continue to be produced for about 3 weeks and it is possible that the emergence of adults from the host may continue for a similar period ( Browne, 1961 ). In southern India, Muraleedharan (1983) reported that the egg, larval and pupal stages lasted 8-10, 21-26 and 10-12 days, respectively. The developmental period varies with altitude, temperature and predation, but most of the new generation emerge about 5-6 weeks after the host is infested. Cooperband et al. (2016) found that adults develop in 22 days at 24°C, producing 68 female adults in 6 weeks, 7% of which are males. The ratio of females to males is low compared to many other ambrosia beetles. In Java, it has been estimated

(2016) found that adults develop in 22 days at 24°C, producing 68 female adults in 6 weeks, 7% of which are males. The ratio of females to males is low compared to many other ambrosia beetles. In Java, it has been estimated as 9:1 ( Kalshoven, 1958 ), and in Sri Lanka as 4:1 ( Beeson, 1941 ) and 3:1 ( Judenko, 1956 ). In Malaysia, Browne (1961) examined several complete broods and reported there were four or five females to each male. Like all ambrosia beetles, E. perbrevis feeds on a symbiotic fungus that is cultivated in the xylem of woody plants ( Batra, 1967 ). The symbiotic fungi, introduced into the gallery by the attacking female, serves as their source of nutrition for larvae, with severe pathogenic effects for some species. The spores of the ambrosia fungus are stored and carried in a specialized structure called mycangia ( Batra, 1963 ) located near the mandibles of the adult female ( Fernando, 1960 ). The spores travel from the mycangia through ducts to the buccal cavity and are then deposited in the gallery using the mandibles and maxillae. Early work on the ambrosia fungi (e.g. Speyer, 1923 ; Gadd and Loos, 1947 ) should not be relied on, because of problems with fungal taxonomy and contamination of fungal cultures. In southern India, Mouli and Kumar (1988) found the fungus Fusarium tumidum in the tunnels of E. perbrevis in tea branches. Somasekhara et al.

(2000) isolated the phytopathogen, Ceratocystis fimbriata , from E. perbrevis in wilting pomegranate trees in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Fusarium bugnicourtii is given as the ambrosia fungus by UPASI Tea Research Foundation, Kerala, India (2003a). Carrillo et al. (2016) found Fusarium sp. and Graphium sp. as the most common fungal symbionts associated with E. perbrevis in Florida. The vectorized fungus invades the vascular tissue of the host, causing necrosis, gum exudates, branch dieback, and potential mortality in several host species.
