 Invasion: Pycnia and aecia are unknown. Uredinia are amphigenous, mostly hypophyllous, minute, scattered or in groups on discoloured lesions, subepidermal in origin, surrounded by paraphyses arising from peridioid pseudoparenchyma, also with hymenial paraphyses, opening through a central aperture, pulverulent, and yellowish-brown or pale cinnamon brown. Paraphyses are cylindric to clavate, 25-50 µm long and 6-14 µm wide, slightly to conspicuously thickened (up to 18 µm) apically, pale yellowish-brown to colourless. The urediniospores are almost sessile, obovoid to broadly ellipsoid, and 18-34 x 15-24 µm. The spore wall is uniformly ca 1 µm thick, minutely and densely echinulate, and colourless to pale yellowish-brown. Four to eight (mostly six, rarely two or ten) germ pores are equatorial or scattered on the equatorial zone, or occasionally scattered on and above the equatorial zone of the spore wall. Telia are hypophyllus, often intermixed with uredinia, pulvinate and crustose, chestnut-brown to chocolate-brown, subepidermal in origin, and 2- to 7-spore layered. The teliospores are one-celled, irregularly arranged, angularly subglobose, oblong to ellipsoid, and (10-)15-26 x 6-12 µm. The wall is uniformly ca 1 µm thick, sometimes slightly thickened (up to 3 µm) apically in the uppermost spores, colourless to pale yellowish-brown

 Reproduccion: Phakopsora pachyrhizi is believed to have a heteroecious life cycle. However, pycnial and aecial stages have not been found. In warm regions, volunteer crops, supplementary legume crops and wild species may harbour the fungus throughout the year or during seasons in which soyabeans are not cultivated, and may serve as the primary infection source. In colder regions where above-ground parts of annual hosts die during winter, no source of new infections in the soyabean-growing season has been identified. A temperature regime at which the maximum rate of urediniospore germination takes place seems to be 15-25°C. At optimum temperatures, urediniospores germinate in 1-1.5 h. Optimum temperatures for urediniospore germination were reported to be 15-24°C with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 28.5°C for Indian, Australian, Indonesian and Taiwanese isolates studied, although the optimum temperatures for the Indian isolate was narrower than other isolates ( Marchetti et al., 1976 ). Wang and Hartman (1992) obtained a similar result where the optimum temperatures for urediniospore germination were 15-25°C. Singh and Thapliyal (1977) reported that, in an Indian isolate, the minimum, optimum and maximum temperatures for urediniospore ger

 the Indian isolate was narrower than other isolates ( Marchetti et al., 1976 ). Wang and Hartman (1992) obtained a similar result where the optimum temperatures for urediniospore germination were 15-25°C. Singh and Thapliyal (1977) reported that, in an Indian isolate, the minimum, optimum and maximum temperatures for urediniospore germination on a glass slide were 20, 25 and 30°C, respectively. Urediniospore infection of soyabean leaves requires at least 6 h of dew period at optimum temperatures. Extended dew periods are needed for successful infection by urediniospores at temperatures higher or lower than the optimum. Using urediniospores of Indian, Australian, Indonesian and Taiwanese isolates, Marchetti et al. (1974) reported that the maximum infection of Wayne soyabean leaves occurred at 20-25°C with 10-12 h dew periods and at 15-17.5°C with 16-18 h dew periods. Kochman (1979) reported that optimum temperatures for rust development from the urediniospore infection were 17-27°C. According to Wang and Hartman (1992) , the minimum dew period for infection was 6 h at 20-25°C and 8-10 h at 15-17.5°C. A minimum night temperature below 15°C greatly reduced lesion number or completely prevented lesion development. Melching et al. (1989) reported that inoculations of susceptible soyabean cultivars with urediniospores at dew periods of less than 6 h resulted in no infection. In a 6 h dew period, trace levels of infection occurred at 18-26.5°C. Degrees of infection and intensities of lesion development increased with prolonged dew periods; in an 8 h dew period at 18-26.5°C, lesion intensities

 with urediniospores at dew periods of less than 6 h resulted in no infection. In a 6 h dew period, trace levels of infection occurred at 18-26.5°C. Degrees of infection and intensities of lesion development increased with prolonged dew periods; in an 8 h dew period at 18-26.5°C, lesion intensities were tenfold higher than those at 6 h at the corresponding temperatures. However, increasing dew duration above 13 h resulted in no significant increase in rust intensity at18-26.5°C. No lesions developed at 9 and 28.5°C, even with dew periods as long as 20 h. Germinability and infectivity of urediniospores are reduced by exposure of the spores to dry and high temperature conditions prior to germination. Singh and Thapliyal (1977) reported that, in an Indian isolate, prior exposure of urediniospores to 35°C for 6 h prevented germination. Similarly, Kochman (1979) reported that germination of urediniospores on water agar at 21°C was significantly reduced by prior exposure of the spores to 28.5-42.5°C for 8 h. According to Melching et al. (1989) , urediniospores on unwetted soyabean leaves progressively lost infectivity during sunny conditions, but exhibited enhanced infectivity after 1 or 2 days on dry foliage under cloudy conditions. After 8 days on dry foliage, no urediniospores were found to cause lesions following a 12 h dew period at 18°C. Spores on leaves exposed to 4 or 6 h of dew followed by drying for up to 4 days were able to infect when a 12 h dew period was provided, but were less infectious than spores that had not been exposed to a brief initial wetting.

Spores on leaves exposed to 4 or 6 h of dew followed by drying for up to 4 days were able to infect when a 12 h dew period was provided, but were less infectious than spores that had not been exposed to a brief initial wetting. The formation of teliospores seems to be induced when infected plants are subjected to a temperature range below 20°C for at least 15 days. Yeh et al. (1981a) reported that, on 20 soyabean cultivars and nine other legume plants, teliospores were successfully induced when the inoculated plants were subjected to 12 h photoperiods, under 60-100% RH and at temperatures of 15-24°C. In the field, teliospores were produced only when the average daily temperature was below 20°C and the maximum temperature above 29°C. Yeh et al. (1981b) further reported that telia and teliospores were formed on eight legume species when the infected hosts were inoculated and grown under a 12 h photoperiod (2060 lux), 60-100% RH, at a maximum day temperature of 24±1°C and a minimum night temperature of 15±1°C. Yeh et al. (1982) found that, by artificial inoculations of two cultivars, TK 5 and PI 230971, more telia were formed on TK 5 than on PI 230971. Sources of inoculum from either cultivar did not influence the production of telia. There was a positive correlation between inoculum concentration and telia production. Telia were formed on leaves after 2 weeks at 10°C and 15°C and 3 weeks at 20°C but not at 25°C. In the field, telia production was common when the daily temperatures remained below 20°C for less than 15 h

Poolpol and Pupipat (1985) reported that telia and teliospores were successfully induced only on soyabean cultivar SJ. 2 after soyabeans and 23 other leguminous plants were inoculated and kept in an incubator with a 12 h photoperiod at 6000 lux, 20-22°C day/17°C night cycle at 100% RH for 60 days. Dufresne et al. (1987) reported telial production in Taiwanese and Puerto Rican isolates. The two isolates were cultured on Williams soyabeans at two temperature and three light intensities. The Taiwanese isolate produced telia after 21 and 30 days and the Puerto Rican isolate produced telia after 34 and 35 days at 10 and 15°C, respectively. At low light intensity (3.9 µE/m²/sec), the Taiwanese and Puerto Rican isolates produced telia after 29 and 33 days, respectively; at intermediate light intensity (5.3 µE/m²/sec) after 26 and 36 days, respectively; and at high light intensity (6.1 µE/m²/sec) after 22 and 34 days, respectively. The Taiwanese isolate produced larger lesions with a higher percentage of telia than the Puerto Rican isolate. Saksirirat and Hoppe (1991) reported germination of teliospores.

Saksirirat and Hoppe (1991) reported germination of teliospores. After treatment with 10-12 cycles of 24 h wetting and 24 h drying periods at room temperature, 65-70% of teliospores germinated at 20°C under artificial illumination of 5000 lux at 12 h light/dark intervals. Only 25% of teliospores germinated when the telia were treated with seven wetting and drying cycles. Higher germination rates were observed when telia were stored at 5°C for 5-6 months. The thermal requirements for P. pachyrhizi spore germination were studied in detail by Blum et al. (2015) . The lower thermal threshold was 4°C, the upper threshold 34°C, and the optimal temperature for maximum germination was 22.2°C. Regarding photoperiod, maximum spore germination and maximum urediniospore germ tube length were found in the dark. Neither spore germination nor urediniospore germ tube growth was completely inhibited by exposure to continuous light. In detached leaves, spores were killed in 4 days at 40-50°C, 8 days at 30°C and 18 days at 25°C ( Twizeyimana and Hartman, 2010 ). Godoy and Flausino (2004) demonstrated that spores remained viable for 17 days on the laboratory bench, for 60 days in a refrigerator and 30 days in detached leaflets in the laboratory. Patil et al. (1998) reported spore viability for 45 days in detached, stacked leaves protected by tree shade.

 Sintomas: Infections occur mostly on leaves, often on petioles, and less frequently on stems. On susceptible species/cultivars, infections result in small yellowish-brown or greyish-brown spots or lesions (TAN-type) which are delimited by vascular bundles. Several pustules of urediniospores are formed on both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the lesion, but more frequently on the abaxial surface. The lesions coalesce, become dark brown and are covered by buff or pale-brown spore masses as sporulation progresses. Later in the season, the lesions become dark reddish-brown and crust-like; these are subepidermal telial clusters. When resistant species/cultivars are infected, minute, reddish-brown spots (RB-type) appear, on which only a few uredinial pustules are formed. Sporulation on RB-type lesions is much less than on TAN-type lesions.

arrival in the U.S. was classified as a select agent.  The National Plant Diagnostic Network had 
targeted Asian soybean rust as a priority for preparedness activities and had conducted first 
detection exercises in all soybean states prior to its arrival.  These exercises provided an 
opportunity for NPDN staff to work with university extension specialists, state and federal 
regulators, industry representatives and other crop health professionals to practice seamless chain 
of custody and communications protocols in the event of the occurrence of Asian soybean rust in 
the U.S.  NPDN conducted 22 multi-agency exercises in 34 states over a 2-year period.  These 
efforts strengthened working relationships among the various agencies, and provided a clear 
process for forwarding suspect samples as quickly as possible to APHIS for confirmation.   
Without question, the NPDN exercise program was crucial for the first detection.  On 
November 6, a researcher and NPDN first detector affiliated with Louisiana State University 
noticed a suspect plant in his soybean field plots and brought the diseased specimen to his 
laboratory for further analysis.  The sample was digitally imaged with an NPDN microscope and 
conveyed electronically to the APHIS National Identifier in Beltsville, MD, who suspected 
almost immediately that they were dealing with Asian soybean rust.  The physical specimen was 
sent by overnight mail to the APHIS identifier, the appropriate confirmatory tests were 
conducted, and within 72

 was digitally imaged with an NPDN microscope and 
conveyed electronically to the APHIS National Identifier in Beltsville, MD, who suspected 
almost immediately that they were dealing with Asian soybean rust.  The physical specimen was 
sent by overnight mail to the APHIS identifier, the appropriate confirmatory tests were 
conducted, and within 72 hours of retrieval of the diseased soybean sample from the field in 
Louisiana a confirmatory diagnosis was made.  On November 10, the Secretary of Agriculture 
formally announced to the nation that Asian soybean rust was present in the U.S.  By December 
1, the fungus had been confirmed in nine southern states.  Samples were triaged for APHIS by 
each state’s NPDN laboratory.  These laboratories received authorization from APHIS to provide 
confirmatory diagnoses for the soybean rust fungus as more disease specimens arrived during the 
ensuing months.  The triage role provided by NPDN relieved the APHIS national laboratory of 
an onslaught of samples that would have otherwise exceeded that laboratory’s capacity to 
process them in a timely manner.     
In 2005, the fungus was confirmed in other soybean states.  Between 2004 and 2011, 47 
NPDN labs tested 15,418 samples for the soybean rust pathogen.  Since the arrival of Asian 
soybean rust in the U.S., the NPDN has supported regulators, researchers, extension personnel, 
and industry by continuing to monitor and diagnose soybean samples through the Soybean Rust 
and Legume Sentinel Plot Project of the Integrated Pest Management Pest Information Platform 
for Extension and Education (IPM PIPE).

 Invasion: Pycnia and aecia are unknown. Uredinia are amphigenous, mostly hypophyllous, minute, scattered or in groups on discoloured lesions, subepidermal in origin, surrounded by paraphyses arising from peridioid pseudoparenchyma, also with hymenial paraphyses, opening through a central aperture, pulverulent, and yellowish-brown or pale cinnamon brown. Paraphyses are cylindric to clavate, 25-50 µm long and 6-14 µm wide, slightly to conspicuously thickened (up to 18 µm) apically, pale yellowish-brown to colourless. The urediniospores are almost sessile, obovoid to broadly ellipsoid, and 18-34 x 15-24 µm. The spore wall is uniformly ca 1 µm thick, minutely and densely echinulate, and colourless to pale yellowish-brown. Four to eight (mostly six, rarely two or ten) germ pores are equatorial or scattered on the equatorial zone, or occasionally scattered on and above the equatorial zone of the spore wall. Telia are hypophyllus, often intermixed with uredinia, pulvinate and crustose, chestnut-brown to chocolate-brown, subepidermal in origin, and 2- to 7-spore layered. The teliospores are one-celled, irregularly arranged, angularly subglobose, oblong to ellipsoid, and (10-)15-26 x 6-12 µm. The wall is uniformly ca 1 µm thick, sometimes slightly thickened (up to 3 µm) apically in the uppermost spores, colourless to pale yellowish-brown

 Reproduccion: Phakopsora pachyrhizi is believed to have a heteroecious life cycle. However, pycnial and aecial stages have not been found. In warm regions, volunteer crops, supplementary legume crops and wild species may harbour the fungus throughout the year or during seasons in which soyabeans are not cultivated, and may serve as the primary infection source. In colder regions where above-ground parts of annual hosts die during winter, no source of new infections in the soyabean-growing season has been identified. A temperature regime at which the maximum rate of urediniospore germination takes place seems to be 15-25°C. At optimum temperatures, urediniospores germinate in 1-1.5 h. Optimum temperatures for urediniospore germination were reported to be 15-24°C with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 28.5°C for Indian, Australian, Indonesian and Taiwanese isolates studied, although the optimum temperatures for the Indian isolate was narrower than other isolates ( Marchetti et al., 1976 ). Wang and Hartman (1992) obtained a similar result where the optimum temperatures for urediniospore germination were 15-25°C. Singh and Thapliyal (1977) reported that, in an Indian isolate, the minimum, optimum and maximum temperatures for urediniospore ger

 the Indian isolate was narrower than other isolates ( Marchetti et al., 1976 ). Wang and Hartman (1992) obtained a similar result where the optimum temperatures for urediniospore germination were 15-25°C. Singh and Thapliyal (1977) reported that, in an Indian isolate, the minimum, optimum and maximum temperatures for urediniospore germination on a glass slide were 20, 25 and 30°C, respectively. Urediniospore infection of soyabean leaves requires at least 6 h of dew period at optimum temperatures. Extended dew periods are needed for successful infection by urediniospores at temperatures higher or lower than the optimum. Using urediniospores of Indian, Australian, Indonesian and Taiwanese isolates, Marchetti et al. (1974) reported that the maximum infection of Wayne soyabean leaves occurred at 20-25°C with 10-12 h dew periods and at 15-17.5°C with 16-18 h dew periods. Kochman (1979) reported that optimum temperatures for rust development from the urediniospore infection were 17-27°C. According to Wang and Hartman (1992) , the minimum dew period for infection was 6 h at 20-25°C and 8-10 h at 15-17.5°C. A minimum night temperature below 15°C greatly reduced lesion number or completely prevented lesion development. Melching et al. (1989) reported that inoculations of susceptible soyabean cultivars with urediniospores at dew periods of less than 6 h resulted in no infection. In a 6 h dew period, trace levels of infection occurred at 18-26.5°C. Degrees of infection and intensities of lesion development increased with prolonged dew periods; in an 8 h dew period at 18-26.5°C, lesion intensities

 with urediniospores at dew periods of less than 6 h resulted in no infection. In a 6 h dew period, trace levels of infection occurred at 18-26.5°C. Degrees of infection and intensities of lesion development increased with prolonged dew periods; in an 8 h dew period at 18-26.5°C, lesion intensities were tenfold higher than those at 6 h at the corresponding temperatures. However, increasing dew duration above 13 h resulted in no significant increase in rust intensity at18-26.5°C. No lesions developed at 9 and 28.5°C, even with dew periods as long as 20 h. Germinability and infectivity of urediniospores are reduced by exposure of the spores to dry and high temperature conditions prior to germination. Singh and Thapliyal (1977) reported that, in an Indian isolate, prior exposure of urediniospores to 35°C for 6 h prevented germination. Similarly, Kochman (1979) reported that germination of urediniospores on water agar at 21°C was significantly reduced by prior exposure of the spores to 28.5-42.5°C for 8 h. According to Melching et al. (1989) , urediniospores on unwetted soyabean leaves progressively lost infectivity during sunny conditions, but exhibited enhanced infectivity after 1 or 2 days on dry foliage under cloudy conditions. After 8 days on dry foliage, no urediniospores were found to cause lesions following a 12 h dew period at 18°C. Spores on leaves exposed to 4 or 6 h of dew followed by drying for up to 4 days were able to infect when a 12 h dew period was provided, but were less infectious than spores that had not been exposed to a brief initial wetting.

Spores on leaves exposed to 4 or 6 h of dew followed by drying for up to 4 days were able to infect when a 12 h dew period was provided, but were less infectious than spores that had not been exposed to a brief initial wetting. The formation of teliospores seems to be induced when infected plants are subjected to a temperature range below 20°C for at least 15 days. Yeh et al. (1981a) reported that, on 20 soyabean cultivars and nine other legume plants, teliospores were successfully induced when the inoculated plants were subjected to 12 h photoperiods, under 60-100% RH and at temperatures of 15-24°C. In the field, teliospores were produced only when the average daily temperature was below 20°C and the maximum temperature above 29°C. Yeh et al. (1981b) further reported that telia and teliospores were formed on eight legume species when the infected hosts were inoculated and grown under a 12 h photoperiod (2060 lux), 60-100% RH, at a maximum day temperature of 24±1°C and a minimum night temperature of 15±1°C. Yeh et al. (1982) found that, by artificial inoculations of two cultivars, TK 5 and PI 230971, more telia were formed on TK 5 than on PI 230971. Sources of inoculum from either cultivar did not influence the production of telia. There was a positive correlation between inoculum concentration and telia production. Telia were formed on leaves after 2 weeks at 10°C and 15°C and 3 weeks at 20°C but not at 25°C. In the field, telia production was common when the daily temperatures remained below 20°C for less than 15 h

In the field, telia production was common when the daily temperatures remained below 20°C for less than 15 h and average temperatures did not exceed 25°C for at least 15 days. Poolpol and Pupipat (1985) reported that telia and teliospores were successfully induced only on soyabean cultivar SJ. 2 after soyabeans and 23 other leguminous plants were inoculated and kept in an incubator with a 12 h photoperiod at 6000 lux, 20-22°C day/17°C night cycle at 100% RH for 60 days. Dufresne et al. (1987) reported telial production in Taiwanese and Puerto Rican isolates. The two isolates were cultured on Williams soyabeans at two temperature and three light intensities. The Taiwanese isolate produced telia after 21 and 30 days and the Puerto Rican isolate produced telia after 34 and 35 days at 10 and 15°C, respectively. At low light intensity (3.9 µE/m²/sec), the Taiwanese and Puerto Rican isolates produced telia after 29 and 33 days, respectively; at intermediate light intensity (5.3 µE/m²/sec) after 26 and 36 days, respectively; and at high light intensity (6.1 µE/m²/sec) after 22 and 34 days, respectively. The Taiwanese isolate produced larger lesions with a higher percentage of telia than the Puerto Rican isolate. Saksirirat and Hoppe (1991) reported germination of teliospores.

Saksirirat and Hoppe (1991) reported germination of teliospores. After treatment with 10-12 cycles of 24 h wetting and 24 h drying periods at room temperature, 65-70% of teliospores germinated at 20°C under artificial illumination of 5000 lux at 12 h light/dark intervals. Only 25% of teliospores germinated when the telia were treated with seven wetting and drying cycles. Higher germination rates were observed when telia were stored at 5°C for 5-6 months. The thermal requirements for P. pachyrhizi spore germination were studied in detail by Blum et al. (2015) . The lower thermal threshold was 4°C, the upper threshold 34°C, and the optimal temperature for maximum germination was 22.2°C. Regarding photoperiod, maximum spore germination and maximum urediniospore germ tube length were found in the dark. Neither spore germination nor urediniospore germ tube growth was completely inhibited by exposure to continuous light. In detached leaves, spores were killed in 4 days at 40-50°C, 8 days at 30°C and 18 days at 25°C ( Twizeyimana and Hartman, 2010 ). Godoy and Flausino (2004) demonstrated that spores remained viable for 17 days on the laboratory bench, for 60 days in a refrigerator and 30 days in detached leaflets in the laboratory. Patil et al. (1998) reported spore viability for 45 days in detached, stacked leaves protected by tree shade.

 Sintomas: Infections occur mostly on leaves, often on petioles, and less frequently on stems. On susceptible species/cultivars, infections result in small yellowish-brown or greyish-brown spots or lesions (TAN-type) which are delimited by vascular bundles. Several pustules of urediniospores are formed on both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the lesion, but more frequently on the abaxial surface. The lesions coalesce, become dark brown and are covered by buff or pale-brown spore masses as sporulation progresses. Later in the season, the lesions become dark reddish-brown and crust-like; these are subepidermal telial clusters. When resistant species/cultivars are infected, minute, reddish-brown spots (RB-type) appear, on which only a few uredinial pustules are formed. Sporulation on RB-type lesions is much less than on TAN-type lesions.

Poolpol and Pupipat (1985) reported that telia and teliospores were successfully induced only on soyabean cultivar SJ. 2 after soyabeans and 23 other leguminous plants were inoculated and kept in an incubator with a 12 h photoperiod at 6000 lux, 20-22°C day/17°C night cycle at 100% RH for 60 days. Dufresne et al. (1987) reported telial production in Taiwanese and Puerto Rican isolates. The two isolates were cultured on Williams soyabeans at two temperature and three light intensities.

 kept in an incubator with a 12 h photoperiod at 6000 lux, 20-22°C day/17°C night cycle at 100% RH for 60 days. Dufresne et al. (1987) reported telial production in Taiwanese and Puerto Rican isolates. The two isolates were cultured on Williams soyabeans at two temperature and three light intensities. The Taiwanese isolate produced telia after 21 and 30 days and the Puerto Rican isolate produced telia after 34 and 35 days at 10 and 15°C, respectively. At low light intensity (3.9 µE/m²/sec), the Taiwanese and Puerto Rican isolates produced telia after 29 and 33 days, respectively; at intermediate light intensity (5.3 µE/m²/sec) after 26 and 36 days, respectively; and at high light intensity (6.1 µE/m²/sec) after 22 and 34 days, respectively. The Taiwanese isolate produced larger lesions with a higher percentage of telia than the Puerto Rican isolate. Saksirirat and Hoppe (1991) reported germination of teliospores. After treatment with 10-12 cycles of 24 h wetting and 24 h drying periods at room temperature, 65-70% of teliospores germinated at 20°C under artificial illumination of 5000 lux at 12 h light/dark intervals. Only 25% of teliospores germinated when the telia were treated with seven wetting and drying cycles. Higher germination rates were observed when telia were stored at 5°C for 5-6 months. The thermal requirements for P. pachyrhizi spore germination were studied in detail by Blum et al. (2015) . The lower thermal threshold was 4°C, the upper threshold 34°C, and the optimal temperature for maximum germination was 22.2°C. Regarding photoperiod, maximum spore ger

 at 5°C for 5-6 months. The thermal requirements for P. pachyrhizi spore germination were studied in detail by Blum et al. (2015) . The lower thermal threshold was 4°C, the upper threshold 34°C, and the optimal temperature for maximum germination was 22.2°C. Regarding photoperiod, maximum spore germination and maximum urediniospore germ tube length were found in the dark. Neither spore germination nor urediniospore germ tube growth was completely inhibited by exposure to continuous light. Longevity (Spore viability) In detached leaves, spores were killed in 4 days at 40-50°C, 8 days at 30°C and 18 days at 25°C ( Twizeyimana and Hartman, 2010 ). Godoy and Flausino (2004) demonstrated that spores remained viable for 17 days on the laboratory bench, for 60 days in a refrigerator and 30 days in detached leaflets in the laboratory. Patil et al. (1998) reported spore viability for 45 days in detached, stacked leaves protected by tree shade.

Case Study: Asian Soybean Rust 
The National Plant Diagnostic Network  
 
The pathogen that causes Asian soybean rust was identified in the United States for the first 
time in November of 2004.  Asian soybean rust is caused by a fungus that at the time of its 
arrival in the U.S. was classified as a select agent.  The National Plant Diagnostic Network had 
targeted Asian soybean rust as a priority for preparedness activities and had conducted first 
detection exercises in all soybean states prior to its arrival.  These exercises provided an 
opportunity for NPDN staff to work with university extension specialists, state and federal 
regulators, industry representatives and other crop health professionals to practice seamless chain 
of custody and communications protocols in the event of the occurrence of Asian soybean rust in 
the U.S.  NPDN conducted 22 multi-agency exercises in 34 states over a 2-year period.  These 
efforts strengthened working relationships among the various agencies, and provided a clear 
process for forwarding suspect samples as quickly as possible to APHIS for confirmation.   
Without question, the NPDN exercise program was crucial for the first detection.  On 
November 6, a researcher and NPDN first detector affiliated with Louisiana State University 
noticed a suspect plant in his soybean field plots and brought the diseased specimen to his 
laboratory for further analysis.  The sample was digitally imaged with an NPDN microscope and 
conveyed electronically to the APHIS National Identifier in Beltsville, MD, who suspected 
almost immediately that they were dealing with Asian soybean rust.  The physical specimen was 
sent by overnight mail to the APHIS identifier, the appropriate confirmatory tests were 
conducted, and within 72

 was digitally imaged with an NPDN microscope and 
conveyed electronically to the APHIS National Identifier in Beltsville, MD, who suspected 
almost immediately that they were dealing with Asian soybean rust.  The physical specimen was 
sent by overnight mail to the APHIS identifier, the appropriate confirmatory tests were 
conducted, and within 72 hours of retrieval of the diseased soybean sample from the field in 
Louisiana a confirmatory diagnosis was made.  On November 10, the Secretary of Agriculture 
formally announced to the nation that Asian soybean rust was present in the U.S.  By December 
1, the fungus had been confirmed in nine southern states.  Samples were triaged for APHIS by 
each state’s NPDN laboratory.  These laboratories received authorization from APHIS to provide 
confirmatory diagnoses for the soybean rust fungus as more disease specimens arrived during the 
ensuing months.  The triage role provided by NPDN relieved the APHIS national laboratory of 
an onslaught of samples that would have otherwise exceeded that laboratory’s capacity to 
process them in a timely manner.     
In 2005, the fungus was confirmed in other soybean states.  Between 2004 and 2011, 47 
NPDN labs tested 15,418 samples for the soybean rust pathogen.  Since the arrival of Asian 
soybean rust in the U.S., the NPDN has supported regulators, researchers, extension personnel, 
and industry by continuing to monitor and diagnose soybean samples through the Soybean Rust 
and Legume Sentinel Plot Project of the Integrated Pest Management Pest Information Platform 
for Extension and Education (IPM PIPE).
