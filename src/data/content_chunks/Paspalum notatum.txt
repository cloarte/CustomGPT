 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for Paspalum notatum is 2 n = 20, 30, 40, 50 ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ; Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2018 ; PROSEA, 2018 ).  This species includes several genotypes differing in both ploidy level and reproductive system. The diploid type (2 n =2 x = 20) is sexual and self-incompatible, while the tetraploid type (2 n =4 x = 40) is self-compatible, pseudogamous and apomictic. Apomixis in the tetraploid type can be either obligate or facultative.  The tetraploid types are usually considered as the typical form of P. notatum

Apomixis in the tetraploid type can be either obligate or facultative.  The tetraploid types are usually considered as the typical form of P. notatum in botanical terms, and the diploid types are often classified as botanical varieties. Triploid  (2 n =3 x =30) and even pentaploid (2 n =5 x = 50) individuals have also occasionally been collected from natural populations. Polyploidy and apomixis are important mechanisms in the evolution of the genus Paspalum ( Quarin et al., 2001 ; Cidade et al., 2008 ; PROSEA, 2018 ). Paspalum notatum has hermaphroditic flowers and different ploidy levels, which influences reproduction. The tetraploid types are generally considered apomicts, and reproduce by unfertilized but viable seeds. The diploid forms reproduce sexually, and are usually highly cross-pollinated. The sexually reproducing types are wind-pollinated ( Violi, 2000 ; Quarin et al., 2001 ; Cidade et al., 2008 ; PROSEA, 2018 ). The species is a heavy seeder and seed yields of 100-350 kg/ha have been reported. In China, Paspalum notatum has been recorded flowering and fruiting in September ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ). In Zimbabwe, it produces flowers from December to April ( Hyde et al., 2018 ). In Nicaragua, it has been recorded flowering and fruiting from June to August ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2018 ).

In Nicaragua, it has been recorded flowering and fruiting from June to August ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2018 ). In Costa Rica it has been recorded with flowers and fruits from June to December ( Hammel et al., 2003 ).  In the United States, inflorescences emerge from May to July and flowering usually occurs over a 4-week period. In Florida, seeds mature from June through the summer ( Violi, 2000 ). Paspalum notatum is a perennial grass. Paspalum notatum is used as a food-plant by the larval stage of Cnaphalocrocis trapezalis ( Hyde et al., 2018 ).  Root associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and the diazotrophic (nitrogen fixing) bacterium Azorhizophilus paspali have been reported ( Cook et al., 2005 ). Paspalum notatum is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical zones, at elevations from near sea level to 2000 m. It grows vigorously under high temperatures and long days. In temperate regions, the highest growth rates occur during the warmest months ( Newman et al., 2014 ). It prefers areas with mean annual temperature ranging from 18°C to 30°C (but can tolerate 5°C - 36°C) and mean annual rainfall in the range 900 – 2100 mm (but tolerates 750 - 2500 mm). It can grow on sandy and clay soil with pH in the range 5.5-6.5 (but tolerates 4.3 to 8.4). Some types are salt tolerant, withstanding up to 4500 ppm NaCl in irrigation water.  It has good drought tolerance and is fairly tolerant of flooding (plants can survive up to 36 days of flooding),

Some types are salt tolerant, withstanding up to 4500 ppm NaCl in irrigation water.  It has good drought tolerance and is fairly tolerant of flooding (plants can survive up to 36 days of flooding), but does not tolerate frosty conditions. It grows best in partially shaded areas, but can succeed in full sun and also in quite dense shade.  Although it prefers to grow in fertile soils, it can maintain dense stands on infertile soils, probably due to its association with nitrogen fixing bacteria ( Cook et al., 2005 ; Useful Tropical Plants, 2018 ; Heuzé and Tran, 2016 ).
