 Invasion: E. japonicusgrows as an evergreen shrub or small tree that can reach up to 3 m, sometimes dwarfed. Branches are grey-green to grey-brown, terete glabrous and sturdy. Twigs are green to light green, glabrous, and not evidently striate, especially when fresh. The petiole is 3-10 mm long. Leaf blades are leathery or thickly leathery, ovate, obovate, orbicular-ovate or long ovate, measuring (3-)5-10(-12) x (2-)3-5(-5.5) cm, base orbicular or semiorbicular, margin crenulate distally, nearly entire proximally, apex orbicular or semiorbicular; lateral veins 6-8 pairs, slightly visible or unclear, especially when dry. Leaves are often variegated in cultivated varieties. Cymes usually axillary, sometimes terminal, many branched with many flowers; peduncle up to 8 cm, sub-branches 2-4 cm; pedicel 4-7 mm. Flowers are 4-merous, 5-6 mm in diameter; sepals nearly orbicular; petals greenish white or yellowish green, sometimes cream, nearly orbicular. Capsule globose or subglob

Flowers are 4-merous, 5-6 mm in diameter; sepals nearly orbicular; petals greenish white or yellowish green, sometimes cream, nearly orbicular. Capsule globose or subglobose, brown or yellow-brown to red-brown, 6-9(-12) mm in diameter, 4-lobed. Seeds 2 per locule, 5 x 3.5 mm, dark brown, globose; aril orange-red (Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2017).
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: Cultivated / agricultural land, Rail / roadsides, Natural forests, Scrub / shrublands, Coastal areas
 Reproduccion: The chromosome number of E. japonicus is 2n = 32 ( Missouri Botanical Garden, 2017 ). E. japonicus reproduces by seed. Flowering occurs in early summer and flowers are pollinated by bees and flies. Seed is dormant when shed and requires stratification. Stored seeds require 3 months of cold stratification, and can take up to 18 months to germinate ( PFAF, 2017 ). Increasing the period of cold stratification can improve the rate of seed germination to 65% after 60 days germination. Soaking the seeds in gibberellin can further enhance germination. Optimum germination occurs at about 25 ° C ( Xue, 2011 ). For commercial purposes propagation can be obtained from cuttings ( Tawfik, 2001 ). E. japonicus is an evergreen shrub with a periodic growth pattern consisting of several growth flushes per year. In each flush, 9-11 nodes are added to the stem length.

 ( Xue, 2011 ). For commercial purposes propagation can be obtained from cuttings ( Tawfik, 2001 ). E. japonicus is an evergreen shrub with a periodic growth pattern consisting of several growth flushes per year. In each flush, 9-11 nodes are added to the stem length. Nodes formed at the beginning of a growth flush are short and bear scale-like leaves. In the middle of the flush, the nodes are longer and become shorter again toward the end of the flush ( Zieslin and Pines, 1987 ). Trees may live for up to 150 years ( Urban Forest Ecosystems Institute, 2017 ). E. japonicus tolerates temperatures as low as -10°C ( PFAF, 2017 ) and is rated by PFAF (2017) as being tolerant to both UK and USA hardiness zones 7 (down to -20°C). It also has a wide tolerance to different soil types and acidity levels and some tolerance of salinity ( Urban Forest Ecosystems Institute, 2017 ). It does not tolerate deep shade but has medium shade tolerance (Lin ShuYan, 2007). Plants are very tolerant of maritime exposure, succeeding even when grown on the seashore but they can be killed by cold drying winds ( Useful Tropical Plants, 2017 ). When grown as an ornamental, it tolerates light, medium and heavy (clay) soils, but prefers well-drained soil. It also tolerates acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. The plant prefers night temperatures of 4-12°C and day temperatures of 19°C or lower.
