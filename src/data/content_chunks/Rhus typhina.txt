 Invasion: R. typhinais a large, deciduous shrub to small tree, native to Canada and the USA, which can attain a height of 30-35 feet. Its root systems tend to be shallow and wide-spreading. It has pinnate leaves that can grow 12 to 24 inches long and are composed of many paired 2- to 5-inch-long leaflets, with a single terminal leaflet. The leaflets are dark-green and smooth above, and pale beneath, except along the midrib, turning bright colours before falling off in the autumn. The appearance of its branched stems, which are

. It has pinnate leaves that can grow 12 to 24 inches long and are composed of many paired 2- to 5-inch-long leaflets, with a single terminal leaflet. The leaflets are dark-green and smooth above, and pale beneath, except along the midrib, turning bright colours before falling off in the autumn. The appearance of its branched stems, which are covered with soft hairs, resembles that of deer antlers. Compact clusters of greenish-yellow flowers bloom from June to July. Fruit is produced on plants 3 to 4 years old, maturing from August to September. The fruiting head is a compact cluster of round, red, hairy fruits called drupes. Each drupe measures ¼ inch in diameter and contains one seed. Each cluster of drupes may contain 100 to 700 seeds. There are about 60,000 seeds per pound. Because most populations ofR. typhinaare dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants, only the female plants produce seeds. Occasionally, plants are found which have both male and female flowers. The germination of its seeds is enhanced by their passage through the digestive system of rabbits, ring-necked pheasants, and quail. The presence of fire also encourages increased germination (USDA-NRCS, 2009).

 Reproduccion: Chromosome number (2n) = 30 ( Missouri Botanical Garden, 2010 ). See Coombes (1994) for further information on the genetics of this species. This paper describes the botanical characteristics, nomenclature and origins of R. typhina . R. typhina can reproduce sexually by producing seeds or asexually by rhizomatous growth. Its seed germination rate is less than 20% due to a water-impermeable endocarp. Treatment with gibberellic acid (GA) (0-1000 mg/l) or cold stratification (0-30 days at 4°C) can improve germination ( Norton, 1985 ). Under natural conditions, the germination of its seeds can be enhanced by passage through the digestive system of rabbits, ring-necked pheasants and quail, or encouraged by the presence of fire ( Izhaki et al., 1992 ; USDA-NRCS, 2009 ). In China, reproduction is mainly via rhizomes (horizontal underground stems). With the spreading of rhizomes, an area can become populated by many related plants, with overlapping crowns that give the appearance of a dense colony, with an extensive rounded or flat top. As colonies enlarge, older plants tend to be located in the centre and younger plants emerge around the ever-expanding perimeter. R. typhina has a low nitrogen and soluble sugar content and high tannin content ( Li et al., 2007 ). This high antifeedant activity could distinctly inhibit the survival and fecundity of many

R. typhina has a low nitrogen and soluble sugar content and high tannin content ( Li et al., 2007 ). This high antifeedant activity could distinctly inhibit the survival and fecundity of many insects, especially spider mites [Tetranychidae]. R. typhina has a distinctive biomass allocation and growth strategy. The stem of the clonal ramet and the front part of the lateral root belong to the dominant and subdominant growth and the storage centre of photosynthetic products ( Zhang et al., 2005 , 2008). The front part of the lateral root diameter is twice as large as the back. This asymmetry of diameter of the clonal ramet root becomes more significant with increasing age and has little correlation to topography ( Zhang et al., 2004 ). Such pattern of biomass enables R. typhina to reproduce in a short time. As for newly emerged clonal ramets, the growth rate of the lateral branch and leaf is much faster than the height, which facilitates clonal ramets of R. typhina to form a dominant synusium ( Zhang et al., 2004 ). The clonal integration of R. typhina allow its ramets to be better adapted to weak light beneath its overstorey than other species such as Vitex negundo var. heterophylla , which further enhances its competition ability in the spreading area ( Zhang et al., 2007 ). R. typhina prefers a warm temperate climate, characterized by summer precipitation or a fully humid climate. In North America, its current range extends north to Quebec and south to Georgia, where mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 18°C and the maximum temperature in the hottest month is from 22 to 34ºC.

In China, its distribution area covers various climate types from a temperate continental arid to semi-arid climate, to a subtropical ocean climate, with an annual rainfall range from 300 to 1200 mm. R. typhina has a low fertility requirement, that enables it to endure diverse soil types from coarse to fine. It prefers the medium textured soils, but is not adapted to fine textured soils. The pH value range it can endure varies from 4.5 to 7.2 ( USDA-NRCS, 2009 ).
