 Reproduccion: Classical work by Storey (1939) , summarized by Bock (1974) and Rose (1978) , elucidated the vector relations of MSV. The virus may be acquired within 1 hour (minimum 15 seconds) of feeding on an infected source plant and, after a latent period of 6-12 hours at 30°C or 85 hours at 16°C, may be inoculated within 5 minutes of feeding on a suitable test plant. The virus is retained through moults but does not multiply within the vector.Several leafhopper species have been identified as vectors of MSV in nature ( Brunt et al., 1990 ) including: Cicadulina mbila, C. arachidis, C. bipunctella, C. triangula, C. bimaculata, C. similis, C. latens, C. ghaurii and C. parazeae. Nesoclutha declivata is the vector of Digitaria streak virus in India. Populations of several of the species, including the most important vector, C. mbila, can be divided into 'active' and 'inactive' vectors, i.e. those able or unable to transmit. The inability to transmit can be overcome by experimentally puncturing the gut wall or by injecting virus into the abdomen of 'inactive' individuals. The ability to transmit is inherited as a simple dominant, sex-linked gene, the effect of which is to allow the MSV virions to pass through the gut wall and into the haemolymph, from which they reach the salivary glands and can then be transmitted when the insect next feeds. Symptoms develop approximately 2 weeks after inoculation.MSV is not transmitted mechanically, by

. The ability to transmit is inherited as a simple dominant, sex-linked gene, the effect of which is to allow the MSV virions to pass through the gut wall and into the haemolymph, from which they reach the salivary glands and can then be transmitted when the insect next feeds. Symptoms develop approximately 2 weeks after inoculation.MSV is not transmitted mechanically, by pollen or via seed. Therefore the ecology and epidemidology of the disease depends entirely on the movements of its vector species which feed and reproduce readily on most major cereals and annual grass weeds, as well as on perennial and pasture grasses and, at lower densities, on natural grassland. There can be five to nine generations of leafhoppers per year, depending on temperature and rainfall. More eggs are laid at higher temperatures and during the wet season or on irrigated crops. The main flight period is at the end of the wet season, or at the flowering stage in cereal crops. Although leafhopper densities are low in natural grassland, these large areas are a major reservoir for the dispersal of MSV vectors. Of all the vectors, C. mbila flies furthest and most readily, and is the most important vector species.Cereal crops and young annual grains are colonized by predominantly female populations, and most transmission of MSV within crops is due to these immigrants. Progeny of these immigrants are not considered important for secondary spread within the crop, but are major sources of inoculum for crops planted close by, especially if there is a succession of irrigated maize plantings.
 Sintomas: Symptoms appear on the leaves 3-7 days after inoculation as pale spots or flecks, 0.5-2 mm in diameter. Symptomatology may vary depending on the host, cultivar or virus isolate. In severe cases, the initial pale spots become longer streaks which eventually coalesce. Maize plants infected before the

 Sintomas: Symptoms appear on the leaves 3-7 days after inoculation as pale spots or flecks, 0.5-2 mm in diameter. Symptomatology may vary depending on the host, cultivar or virus isolate. In severe cases, the initial pale spots become longer streaks which eventually coalesce. Maize plants infected before the 4-5 leaf stage can be severely stunted. In milder instances, the lesions do not develop to more than a few sparse flecks or dots. Isolates which infect grain crops cause an abnormal bunching of flowers and shoots. Some isolates from South Africa induce a reddish pigmentation on those leaves initially infected.Viruses are paired icosahedral particles (geminate), each particle measuring about 18 x 20 nm.
