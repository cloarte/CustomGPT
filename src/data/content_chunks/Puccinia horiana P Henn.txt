Breadcrumb Home Plants Plant Health Plant Pests and Diseases Chrysanthemum White Rust Chrysanthemum White Rust Last Modified:  March 03, 2024 Karen Snover-Clift, Cornell University, Bugwood.org Chrysanthemum white rust (CWR) is a serious fungal disease caused by Puccinia horiana P. Henn. It damages chrysanthemum plants and related species. CWR can spread rapidly in greenhouses and plant nurseries. Importation of certain chrysanthemum species are prohibited from several countries, territories, and possessions due to possible transportation of the fungus. CWR originated in eastern Asia and is now established in the Far East, Europe, Africa, Australia, Central America, and South America. Disease outbreaks in Canada and the U.S. have been quelled each time, as CWR has a limited host range and spreads inefficiently. What To Look For During hot and dry conditions, infected plants may not be symptomatic. Signs of disease usually appear during cooler, wet weather. Here's what to look for: Spots Small white or yellow spots, up to 4 mm wide, may be found on the upper surface of the leaf. These slightly dimpled spots become brown over time. Pustules These are light brownish yellow to pink-colored but become white as they age. Pustules form on the underside of the leaf, beneath the small spots. They're most common on young leaves and flower bracts but can be found on any green tissue and flowers. How to Prevent This Disease Best management practices include: Buying plants from reputable sources Using proper cultural techniques Scouting for disease symptoms Sanitation Applying fungicide (This will not eliminate the disease, but it can keep it from spreading. Make sure the fungicide is labeled for use against CWR in your State; follow all label directions.) Worker training and education How It Is Treated Options for managing CWR include: Rem
