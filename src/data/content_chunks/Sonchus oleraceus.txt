 Invasion: S. oleraceusis an annual and sometimes biennial herb, 40-150 cm tall, containing white latex in all plant parts. The taproot is upright with many branches, especially near the soil surface. Stem below synflorescence simple or branched, glabrous. Basal and lower stem leaves with basal portion petiole-like and attenuate, mostly smaller than middle stem leaves, otherwise similar. Middle and upper stem leaves extremely variable, elliptic, oblanceolate, or lanceolate, 6-20 × 2-9 cm, almost entire to ± irregularly, soft, glabrous, adaxially dull green, base auriculately clasping with auricles usually acutely prostrate, margin ± coarsely spinulosely dentate, apex acute; lateral lobes triangular to elliptic, usually recurved, apex acute to acuminate; terminal lobe larger than others, broadly triangular, broadly hastate, or obovate-cordate. Synflorescence shortly corymbiform or racemiform, with few to several capitula. The flower-head has a green involucre consisting of 27-35 lance-shaped bracts, 10-13 mm long and hairy while young. Each flower-head contains 80-250 ligulate flowers which are longer than the involucre. The flowers are yellow and the ligule is about as long as the corolla tub. Achenes are brown, 2.5-3.75 x 0.7-1 mm, oblanceolate, and transversely tuberculate-rugose. Thistledown is white and persistent. One plant may produce 4000-6000 seeds or more (Nyárády, 1965

 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for S. oleraceus is 2 n = 32 (Nyárády, 1965; Anghel et al., 1972 ; Boulos, 1976 ; Hutchinson et al., 1984 ; Ciocârlan, 1990 ) and in view of its worldwide distribution and abundance there is no threat of genetic erosion. S. oleraceus leaves have a great plasticity. They may show different incision degrees and different shapes of the terminal lobe. The foliar limb can be pinnatifid to pinnatisect, lyrate, runcinate or almost whole. Auricles are usually pointed, but may sometimes be rounded ( Gleason and Cronquist, 1991 ).

This variability may be due to the ease of cross-breeding between species of the Sonchus genus. Nyárády (1965) describes the hybrid Sonchus x clujensis , which resembles S. asper in its green, glossy, rigid leaves, the lower ones being thorny, and resembles S. oleraceus in its upper non-thorny leaves, with pointed auricles and completely verruculose achenes. Kirpichnikov (1964) notes Sonchus x rotundifolia , a hybrid between S. oleraceus and S. asper , while Hutchinson et al. (1984) cites the opinion of other authors who claim the existence of hybrids with S. tenerrimus . Flowers in S. oleraceus are hermaphrodite and self-fertile, an advantage in a pioneer species with fluctuating populations that occupies sometimes marginal environments (Stebbins, 1958, cited in Harper, 1977 ). Flowers are insect pollinated by bees and flies and seeds are produced through both selfing and outcrossing ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Salisbury (1962) , quoted in Lewin (1948) , estimated 140 as the average number of achenes per capitulum, and Salisbury (1964) estimated maximum seed production of about 40,000 for a large plant.

000 for a large plant. S. oleraceus is an annual or winter annual species, whose seeds can germinate at any time of the year if soil temperature and moisture are adequate. Autumn- and winter-germinated seedlings spend the winter and early spring months as low-growing rosettes, and the plants only bolt (form a flowering stem) in mid to late spring. Light seems to be essential for successful germination so that burial in the soil or a vegetation cover inhibits seed germination ( Sheldon 1974 ; Fenner, 1978 ). Seedling mortality can be high ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Emergence of seedlings takes place mainly during late spring in both Canada and Britain ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Plant development may be rapid: under certain conditions capitula may be produced within 6 weeks of germination ( Lewin, 1948 ) but this usually takes longer. Lewin (1948) observed that in Britain autumn-germinating plants produced a flowering stem in mid-March and flowered at the end of April. Seedlings germinating in March rarely flowered before the beginning of June. The plants are then in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The plants are annuals, emerging in the spring and flowering in the following summer, or winter annuals, emerging in the autumn, overwintering in rosette form, and flowering the following spring or summer. Lewin (1948) firmly asserted that ‘in no case does the individual survive after a single flowering season’. The species survives through seasons unfavourable to growth in the form of seeds. In laboratory storage, seeds can apparently survive for about 10 years ( Ewart, 1908 ): in the soil Roberts and Neilson (1981) observed survival of a very low proportion (3.4 to 5 % of seeds sown) of viable seeds after 5 years.

�. The species survives through seasons unfavourable to growth in the form of seeds. In laboratory storage, seeds can apparently survive for about 10 years ( Ewart, 1908 ): in the soil Roberts and Neilson (1981) observed survival of a very low proportion (3.4 to 5 % of seeds sown) of viable seeds after 5 years. Widderick et al. (2010) , in Australia, found that 12 % of seeds buried 10 cm deep survived after 30 months. The size and densities of populations depends on supply of seed and conditions for growth. Seedling mortality can be high, sometimes due to slug damage or damping-off fungi ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Guthrie-Smith (1953) reported that in his hill country property in New Zealand, S. oleraceus was a ‘most prominent fire plant, temporarily possessing hundreds of acres of newly burnt forest land.’ He went on to say that millions upon millions of seedlings emerged after bush or New Zealand flax ( Phormium tenax ) had been burned. Plants appear to grow best on fertile soils, but can survive and reproduce even on the bare sides of chalk or other cliffs, or on saline soils ( Lewin, 1948 ). Light and a lack of vegetation cover seem to be the major requirement of the species, which can grow in a large range of open environments from 70 o north to 50 o south, and from sea level up to 2650 m altitude. In desert areas it grows in wetter places, near springs and ponds and along washes ( Guertin, 2003 ). Seed germination can take place at temperatures ranging from 7°C to over 35°C. This species prefers light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. The plant prefers acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It requires moist soil ( PROTA, 2014 ). Together with

The plant prefers acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It requires moist soil ( PROTA, 2014 ). Together with other weeds, S. oleraceus forms many associations, such as Oxaleto-Chenopodietum polyspermi, Amarantho-Chenopodietum, Eclipta alba-Paspalum racemosum, and Nasturtium officinale-Commelina communis ( Lorenzoni, 1978 ; Gutte, 1978 ). Lewin (1948) said, ‘ S. oleraceus exhibits such a wide range of tolerances of soil conditions that it may be found associated with any other weeds of arable land.’ The same author goes on to list the species associated with this species as a pioneer species of bare chalk, as a weed of bombed sites in London in 1943, and as part of a community on maritime cliffs in the Channel Islands. Hutchinson et al. (1984) similarly says it is a pioneer species invading sites disturbed by man, such as roadsides, cultivated land, gravel pits, logged areas, but is also common in coastal areas.

 Invasion: S. oleraceusis an annual and sometimes biennial herb, 40-150 cm tall, containing white latex in all plant parts. The taproot is upright with many branches, especially near the soil surface. Stem below synflorescence simple or branched, glabrous. Basal and lower stem leaves with basal portion petiole-like and attenuate, mostly smaller than middle stem leaves, otherwise similar. Middle and upper stem leaves extremely variable, elliptic, oblanceolate, or lanceolate, 6-20 × 2-9 cm, almost entire to ± irregularly, soft, glabrous, adaxially dull green, base auriculately clasping with auricles usually acutely prostrate, margin ± coarsely spinulosely dentate, apex acute; lateral lobes triangular to elliptic, usually recurved, apex acute to acuminate; terminal lobe larger than others, broadly triangular, broadly hastate, or obovate-cordate. Synflorescence shortly corymbiform or racemiform, with few to several capitula. The flower-head has a green involucre consisting of 27-35 lance-shaped bracts, 10-13 mm long and hairy while young. Each flower-head contains 80-250 ligulate flowers which are longer than the involucre. The flowers are yellow and the ligule is about as long as the corolla tub. Achenes are brown, 2.5-3.75 x 0.7-1 mm, oblanceolate, and transversely tuberculate-rugose. Thistledown is white and persistent. One plant may produce 4000-6000 seeds or more (Nyárády, 1965

 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for S. oleraceus is 2 n = 32 (Nyárády, 1965; Anghel et al., 1972 ; Boulos, 1976 ; Hutchinson et al., 1984 ; Ciocârlan, 1990 ) and in view of its worldwide distribution and abundance there is no threat of genetic erosion. S. oleraceus leaves have a great plasticity. They may show different incision degrees and different shapes of the terminal lobe. The foliar limb can be pinnatifid to pinnatisect, lyrate, runcinate or almost whole. Auricles are usually pointed, but may sometimes be rounded ( Gleason and Cronquist, 1991 ). This variability may be due to the ease of cross-breeding between species of the Sonchus genus. Nyárády (1965) describes the hybrid Sonchus

This variability may be due to the ease of cross-breeding between species of the Sonchus genus. Nyárády (1965) describes the hybrid Sonchus x clujensis , which resembles S. asper in its green, glossy, rigid leaves, the lower ones being thorny, and resembles S. oleraceus in its upper non-thorny leaves, with pointed auricles and completely verruculose achenes. Kirpichnikov (1964) notes Sonchus x rotundifolia , a hybrid between S. oleraceus and S. asper , while Hutchinson et al. (1984) cites the opinion of other authors who claim the existence of hybrids with S. tenerrimus . Flowers in S. oleraceus are hermaphrodite and self-fertile, an advantage in a pioneer species with fluctuating populations that occupies sometimes marginal environments (Stebbins, 1958, cited in Harper, 1977 ). Flowers are insect pollinated by bees and flies and seeds are produced through both selfing and outcrossing ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Salisbury (1962) , quoted in Lewin (1948) , estimated 140 as the average number of achenes per capitulum, and Salisbury (1964) estimated maximum seed production of about 40,000 for a large plant.

000 for a large plant. S. oleraceus is an annual or winter annual species, whose seeds can germinate at any time of the year if soil temperature and moisture are adequate. Autumn- and winter-germinated seedlings spend the winter and early spring months as low-growing rosettes, and the plants only bolt (form a flowering stem) in mid to late spring. Light seems to be essential for successful germination so that burial in the soil or a vegetation cover inhibits seed germination ( Sheldon 1974 ; Fenner, 1978 ). Seedling mortality can be high ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Emergence of seedlings takes place mainly during late spring in both Canada and Britain ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Plant development may be rapid: under certain conditions capitula may be produced within 6 weeks of germination ( Lewin, 1948 ) but this usually takes longer. Lewin (1948) observed that in Britain autumn-germinating plants produced a flowering stem in mid-March and flowered at the end of April. Seedlings germinating in March rarely flowered before the beginning of June. The plants are then in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The plants are annuals, emerging in the spring and flowering in the following summer, or winter annuals, emerging in the autumn, overwintering in rosette form, and flowering the following spring or summer. Lewin (1948) firmly asserted that ‘in no case does the individual survive after a single flowering season’. The species survives through seasons unfavourable to growth in the form of seeds. In laboratory storage, seeds can apparently survive for about 10 years ( Ewart, 1908 ): in the soil Roberts and Neilson (1981) observed survival of a very low proportion (3.4 to 5 % of seeds sown) of viable seeds after 5 years.

�. The species survives through seasons unfavourable to growth in the form of seeds. In laboratory storage, seeds can apparently survive for about 10 years ( Ewart, 1908 ): in the soil Roberts and Neilson (1981) observed survival of a very low proportion (3.4 to 5 % of seeds sown) of viable seeds after 5 years. Widderick et al. (2010) , in Australia, found that 12 % of seeds buried 10 cm deep survived after 30 months. The size and densities of populations depends on supply of seed and conditions for growth. Seedling mortality can be high, sometimes due to slug damage or damping-off fungi ( Hutchinson et al., 1984 ). Guthrie-Smith (1953) reported that in his hill country property in New Zealand, S. oleraceus was a ‘most prominent fire plant, temporarily possessing hundreds of acres of newly burnt forest land.’ He went on to say that millions upon millions of seedlings emerged after bush or New Zealand flax ( Phormium tenax ) had been burned. Plants appear to grow best on fertile soils, but can survive and reproduce even on the bare sides of chalk or other cliffs, or on saline soils ( Lewin, 1948 ). Light and a lack of vegetation cover seem to be the major requirement of the species, which can grow in a large range of open environments from 70 o north to 50 o south, and from sea level up to 2650 m altitude. In desert areas it grows in wetter places, near springs and ponds and along washes ( Guertin, 2003 ). Seed germination can take place at temperatures ranging from 7°C to over 35°C. This species prefers light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. The plant prefers acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It requires moist soil ( PROTA, 2014 ). Together with

The plant prefers acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It requires moist soil ( PROTA, 2014 ). Together with other weeds, S. oleraceus forms many associations, such as Oxaleto-Chenopodietum polyspermi, Amarantho-Chenopodietum, Eclipta alba-Paspalum racemosum, and Nasturtium officinale-Commelina communis ( Lorenzoni, 1978 ; Gutte, 1978 ). Lewin (1948) said, ‘ S. oleraceus exhibits such a wide range of tolerances of soil conditions that it may be found associated with any other weeds of arable land.’ The same author goes on to list the species associated with this species as a pioneer species of bare chalk, as a weed of bombed sites in London in 1943, and as part of a community on maritime cliffs in the Channel Islands. Hutchinson et al. (1984) similarly says it is a pioneer species invading sites disturbed by man, such as roadsides, cultivated land, gravel pits, logged areas, but is also common in coastal areas.
