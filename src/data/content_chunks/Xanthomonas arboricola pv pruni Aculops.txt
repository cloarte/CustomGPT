47 th Meeting of the Panel on Efficacy Evaluation of Fungicides and Insecticides Paris, 2018-11-20/22 The Panel on Efficacy Evaluation of Fungicides and Insecticides met in Paris, at the EPPO Headquarters on 2018-11/20-22. The Panel continued its main task of developing Standards for conducting field trials to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and insecticides. Xanthomonas arboricola pv . pruni on plum Courtesy: U. Mazzucchi (IT) Healthy peaches Courtesy: Ilya Mityushev (RU) Aonidiella aurantii on lemon Courtesy: Ilya Mityushev (RU) New and revised Standards The following Standards were discussed and considered ready to be sent for country consultation: Leaf and plant hoppers on grapes; Aculops lycopersici on tomato; Revision of PP 1/74 Scales on citrus mainly to include Aonidiella aurantii a major pest in citrus not covered by the current Standard as well as other relevant minor scale species; Root knot nematodes ( Meloidogyne spp.) in outdoor crops. A separate draft on Root knot nematodes in protected conditions was also discussed and will be finalized after the meeting; Two new Standards on bacterial diseases: one for Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae on stone fruit and the other on Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni . Both need further expert input after the meeting before being sent to country consultation; Standards on evaluation of mating disruption techniques : the Panel worked on the revision of EPPO Standard PP 1/264 Mating disruption pheromones which will become a General Standard and on two new additional Specific Standards on the evaluation of the efficacy of mating disruption techniques against Lepidoptera pests in grapevine, pome and stone fruits.

 after the meeting before being sent to country consultation; Standards on evaluation of mating disruption techniques : the Panel worked on the revision of EPPO Standard PP 1/264 Mating disruption pheromones which will become a General Standard and on two new additional Specific Standards on the evaluation of the efficacy of mating disruption techniques against Lepidoptera pests in grapevine, pome and stone fruits. The first focussing on trials under field conditions and the other under semi-field conditions. Further expert input is needed on the three drafts before country consultation. Other topics discussed The possibility of preparing a Standard on the efficacy evaluation of products for the control of grapevine trunk diseases on grapevine was discussed. Thanks are due to Mr Lecompte, researcher at INRA Bordeaux, who remotely gave a presentation to assist the Panel. Researchers from the Emphasis H2020 project also participated remotely to present research outputs that could be used for the revision of the EPPO Standards on oilseed rape pests and for Phytophthora spp. The Panel on Efficacy Evaluation of Fungicides and Insecticides will next meet on 2019-11-26/28 (venue to be determined).
