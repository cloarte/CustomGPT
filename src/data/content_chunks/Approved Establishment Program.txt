Approved Establishment Program: Ensuring Imported Animal 
Trophies Do Not Introduce Foreign Animal Diseases 
As pa
rt of its mission to protect American agriculture, the 
United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 
works to keep foreign animal diseases out of the United 
States.  This work is wide-ranging, and includes a few 
things people may not think of as threats.  Animal trophies 
– whether for display at a museum or personal use – can
potentially carry pests and diseases found in their country
of origin.  However, proper processing will destroy any
disease agents.
The 
Role of Approved Establishments 
To ensure the safe importation of trophies, APHIS 
developed the Approved Establishment program.  The 
Approved Establishment program ensures these materials 
are appropriately handled and treated to prevent the 
introduction of foreign animal diseases. 
Unle
ss accompanied by an APHIS import permit or a 
foreign government certificate that shows specific 
processing is complete, animal trophies and other animal 
hides or feathers from certain regions of the world must be 
sent directly to an Approved Establishment for processing 
or sent to an Approved Warehouse for short term storage 
before processing at an Approved Establishment. 
App
roved Establishments are private taxidermy facilities 
that carry out the specific types of processing needed to 
kill any potential foreign animal disease agents.  USDA 
annually inspects and approves all Approved 
Establishments.  There are also Approved Warehouses that 
can store these types of trophies and materials prior to 
processing.  When leaving the Approved Warehouse, the

Unfinished animal trophies, hides 
and feathers that come from 
areas of the world with the 
following foreign animal diseases 
must undergo special processing 
to protect against introducing 
those diseases into the U.S.: 
• highly pathogenic avian
influenza (for bird/poultry
items)
• virulent Newcastle disease
(for bird/poultry items)
• foot-and-mouth disease (for
split-hooved animal items)
• African swine fever (for
swine items)
The fol
lowing items may enter 
without a permit or foreign 
certificate and do not need to go 
to an approved establishment: 
• finished/mounted trophies
• cleaned and dried bones,
antlers, horns and hooves
being used as trophies
• flint dried or hard dried hides
from countries without
African swine fever
• trophy/display materials from
rabbits, rodents, fish,
shellfish and non-human
primates
These items may still fall under 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention import restrictions.

causing agents.  After the processing is complete, they will release the materials back to the 
hunter or importer. 
How the 
Approved Establishment Program Works 
The Approved Establishment program requires cooperation between importers (hunters and 
brokers), the Approved Establishments, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and USDA.  
To import an animal trophy or materials through this program, follow these steps: 
1. Before heading overseas, know what country the animal/material will be originating from
and
 check to see if it will require processing at an Approved Establishment.  You can find
information about the animal health status of the country of origin and how that affects
your import on our website
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/approved_establishments.
2. If you have questions, contact the APHIS animal import team at
APIE@usda.gov.
3. If it requires processing at an Approved Establishment, find one that handles t
he species
you are seeking to import.  USDA maintains a database of Approved Establishments and
Warehouses, which is sortable by state and item type:
https://vsapps.aphis.usda.gov/vsps/public/AESearch.do?method=unspecified.

4. While you are overseas, package your trophy securely and ship it back to the U.S., along
with any required documents/paperwork.
5. The shipment must be sent directly to your chosen Approved Establishment or Approved
Warehouse.
6. Before the trophy arrives, notify C BP at the port of entry for your trophy/materials.  A list
of contacts is available at: https://www.cbp.gov/contact/ports.
7. CBP officers will inspect the shipment, check the paperwork and authorize the 
movement
of the material to an Approved Establishment or Warehouse of your choosing.
8. The Approved Establishment receives the shipment directly from the port, or from an
Approved Warehouse, and completes the required processing.
9. The trophy/materials
 are released back to the hunter or importer.
USDA does not charge hunters or importers for using the Approved Establishment program.  
However, as privately owned businesses, the Approved Establishments and Approved 
Warehouses will charge you for their services. There may al so be costs involved if you choose to 
use a broker or log
istics provider to ease the process. 
Keep in mind, there may also be separate import restrictions from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Ser
vice (FWS) and/or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Please check with 
those Agencies before importing any trophies or materials.
