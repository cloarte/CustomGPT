 Reproduccion: The adults emerge in early spring after overwintering in galleries; swarming and dispersal occurs from March to May, with another possible dispersal flight during June ( UK Beetles, 2021 ). The females of T. domesticum secrete an aggregation hormone that attracts other adults to the trees. Mating occurs on the host trunks and, afterwards, the females bore short, 5-7 cm deep galleries with small notches at regular intervals through the sapwood in which they deposit an egg. Only one hole is formed for both entrance and exit ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; UK Beetles, 2021 ). Trypodendron species are monogamous. The female is joined in the gallery by the male who stays and helps with keeping it clean ( Wegensteiner et al., 2016 ). Gaubicher et al. (2003) indicate that the parental care continues until pupation is completed and that males might be also guarding the female as well as cleaning the gallery. Fungal spores intentionally carried by the adults germinate in the galleries. The growing fungus is then used as food by both the adults and larvae over the winter. The parents remain in the gallery until pupation occurs ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). Trypodendron domesticum attacks stressed, dying trees or recently dead trees or logs ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). The insects are attracted to hardwoods by the volatile chemicals produced by the phloem and sapwood when the trees are weakened or enter initial stages of decay ( Gaubicher et al., 2003 ).

 Trypodendron domesticum attacks stressed, dying trees or recently dead trees or logs ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). The insects are attracted to hardwoods by the volatile chemicals produced by the phloem and sapwood when the trees are weakened or enter initial stages of decay ( Gaubicher et al., 2003 ). The chemicals produced include ethanol, 2-methoxy-phenol, and methyl-butanol isomers ( Holighaus and Schütz, 2006 ). According to Ramisch (1986) , they are also visually stimulated by the silhouettes of the tree trunks. Conifers, however, produce monoterpenes and verbenone which act as repellents to T. domesticum and are consequently not attacked ( Byers, 1992 ). Adults of T. domesticum occur year-round, overwintering in galleries on trunks of the host species ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). In most areas the adults become active when temperatures exceed 15°C for several days, emerging in the early spring in March to April and extending until May, with another re-emergence from May to June ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; Hiskes and Dugas, 2013 ). Franjević (2013) however, reports in Croatia state that T. domesticum emerges at temperatures above 9°C in January. This early swarming lasts until March and is interrupted by cold periods and bad weather. A second swarming occurs by the end of April into mid-May. Trypodendron domesticum is reported as having one generation per year that has a staggered development, with adults found from March to June ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). Two generations per year have been reported in some parts of Europe ( UK Beetles, 2021 ). Adults of T. domesticum occur year-round, overwintering in galleries on trunks of the host species ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). The species is reported as being univoltine

 year that has a staggered development, with adults found from March to June ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). Two generations per year have been reported in some parts of Europe ( UK Beetles, 2021 ). Adults of T. domesticum occur year-round, overwintering in galleries on trunks of the host species ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). The species is reported as being univoltine ( Jackson et al. 2011 ), but also as bivoltine with two generations, or a sister generation, each year in parts of Europe ( Parini and Petercord, 2006 ; UK Beetles, 2021 ). According to Parini and Petercord (2006) , T. domesticum has a first flight out of the galleries by mid- to end of March. It might be followed by a second flight of the stragglers, due to an interruption caused by unfavourable atmospheric conditions from the middle of April to the beginning of May. A third flight can be seen regularly from the end of May to the beginning of June. The authors argue that this third flight is from a possible second generation, and indicative of the species being bivoltine in central to south-eastern Europe. A study in central Europe found that the abundances of males and females in T. domesticum are fairly even ( Lukášová and Holuša, 2014 ). Trypodendron species have independently evolved a nutritional mutualism with various fungal species. They actively farm one or several fungal mutualists in tunnel systems (galleries) bored on recently dead or stressed host plant species. The fungi serve as the food source for both the adults and the larvae ( Holuša et al., 2021 ). There is a lack of thorough understanding of the fungal community that is associated with Trypodendron species. These fungal communities include xylobiontic and saproxylic fungi.

There is a lack of thorough understanding of the fungal community that is associated with Trypodendron species. These fungal communities include xylobiontic and saproxylic fungi. In their galleries, these beetles actively farm one or several fungi species, to be used as their food source ( Lehenberger et al., 2018 ; 2019). Fungi reported to be farmed by T. domesticum include Ophiostoma bacillisporum , Ceratocystis torulosa , Cystobasidium laryngis , Irpex lacteus , Leptographium spp., Ophiostoma arduennense , Phialophora fastigiata [ Cadophora fastigiata ], Phialophoropsis sp., Lentinus substrictus , Polyporus lepideus , Bjerkandera adusta , Trametes versicolor , Trametes ochracea , Aureobasidium pullulans and Pseudogymnoascus pannorum ( Carlier et al., 2006 ; Metzler and Hecht, 2006 ; Jackson et al., 2011 ; Jankowiak et al., 2018 ; Lehenberger et al., 2018 ; 2019). Trypodendron domesticus is also apparently associated with beech trees that have suffered lesions caused by the fungal pathogen Nectria coccinea [ Neonectria coccinea ], and by the beech-bark scale Cryptococcus fagisuga ( Grüner and Metzler, 2006 ; Petercord, 2006 ). Henin et al. (2003) also report the presence of dying mosses in beech trees later attacked by T. domesticum and Trypodendron signatum in Belgium.

(2003) also report the presence of dying mosses in beech trees later attacked by T. domesticum and Trypodendron signatum in Belgium. The authors acknowledge that this possible relationship needs further research. Attacks of T. domesticus on beech trees are also reported as being followed by a white rot, mainly caused by the fungus Fomes fomentarius (Lösekrug,1988). Trypodendron domesticum lives in temperate forests and require suitable temperatures for both larval and fungal development ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). It attacks hardwoods that are sick, stressed, dying or recently dead, or harvested wood with a high moisture content ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; Gossner et al., 2019 ). The beetles bore galleries in the wood to breed and overwinter, flying out when the temperature is above 15°C for several days ( Hiskes and Dugas, 2013 ). The adults have been reported as emerging in Croatia at temperatures above 9°C ( Franjević, 2013 ).
 Sintomas: Trypodendron domesticum is a secondary pest that does not consume wood but builds galleries in unhealthy, injured, stressed, dying or recently dead trees, or harvested logs. The damage caused by T. domesticum to the trees and logs includes boring the sapwood to lay eggs and for fungi cultivation, dark staining and discolouration of the wood associated with the fungi, and powdery dust produced by the beetles during excavation ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; Hiskes and Dugas, 2013 ). In Germany, the attacks to beech trees by T. domesticum are usually seen on the lower 2-3 m part of the trunk, especially the sunny side of the stem, and it

The damage caused by T. domesticum to the trees and logs includes boring the sapwood to lay eggs and for fungi cultivation, dark staining and discolouration of the wood associated with the fungi, and powdery dust produced by the beetles during excavation ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; Hiskes and Dugas, 2013 ). In Germany, the attacks to beech trees by T. domesticum are usually seen on the lower 2-3 m part of the trunk, especially the sunny side of the stem, and it

 staining and discolouration of the wood associated with the fungi, and powdery dust produced by the beetles during excavation ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; Hiskes and Dugas, 2013 ). In Germany, the attacks to beech trees by T. domesticum are usually seen on the lower 2-3 m part of the trunk, especially the sunny side of the stem, and it is rapidly followed by white rot caused by fungi ( Lösekrug, 1988 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Reproductive Biology The adults emerge in early spring after overwintering in galleries; swarming and dispersal occurs from March to May, with another possible dispersal flight during June ( UK Beetles, 2021 ). The females of T. domesticum secrete an aggregation hormone that attracts other adults to the trees. Mating occurs on the host trunks and, afterwards, the females bore short, 5-7 cm deep galleries with small notches at regular intervals through the sapwood in which they deposit an egg. Only one hole is formed for both entrance and exit ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; UK Beetles, 2021 ). Trypodendron species are monogamous. The female is joined in the gallery by the male who stays and helps with keeping it clean ( Wegensteiner et al., 2016 ). Gaubicher et al. (2003) indicate that the parental care continues until pupation is completed and that males might be also guarding the female as well as cleaning the gallery. Fungal spores intentionally carried by the adults germinate in the galleries. The growing fungus is then used as food by both the adults and larvae over the winter. The parents remain in the gallery until pupation occurs ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). Physiology and Phenology Trypodendron domesticum attacks stressed, dying trees or

The growing fungus is then used as food by both the adults and larvae over the winter. The parents remain in the gallery until pupation occurs ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). Physiology and Phenology Trypodendron domesticum attacks stressed, dying trees or recently dead trees or logs ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). The insects are attracted to hardwoods by the volatile chemicals produced by the phloem and sapwood when the trees are weakened or enter initial stages of decay ( Gaubicher et al., 2003 ). The chemicals produced include ethanol, 2-methoxy-phenol, and methyl-butanol isomers ( Holighaus and Schütz, 2006 ). According to Ramisch (1986) , they are also visually stimulated by the silhouettes of the tree trunks. Conifers, however, produce monoterpenes and verbenone which act as repellents to T. domesticum and are consequently not attacked ( Byers, 1992 ). Adults of T. domesticum occur year-round, overwintering in galleries on trunks of the host species ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). In most areas the adults become active when temperatures exceed 15°C for several days, emerging in the early spring in March to April and extending until May, with another re-emergence from May to June ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; Hiskes and Dugas, 2013 ). Franjević (2013) however, reports in Croatia state that T. domesticum emerges at temperatures above 9°C in January. This early swarming lasts until March and is interrupted by cold periods and bad weather. A second swarming occurs by the end of April into mid-May.

2013) however, reports in Croatia state that T. domesticum emerges at temperatures above 9°C in January. This early swarming lasts until March and is interrupted by cold periods and bad weather. A second swarming occurs by the end of April into mid-May. Longevity Trypodendron domesticum is reported as having one generation per year that has a staggered development, with adults found from March to June ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). Two generations per year have been reported in some parts of Europe ( UK Beetles, 2021 ). Activity Patterns Adults of T. domesticum occur year-round, overwintering in galleries on trunks of the host species ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). The species is reported as being univoltine ( Jackson et al. 2011 ), but also as bivoltine with two generations, or a sister generation, each year in parts of Europe ( Parini and Petercord, 2006 ; UK Beetles, 2021 ). According to Parini and Petercord (2006) , T. domesticum has a first flight out of the galleries by mid- to end of March. It might be followed by a second flight of the stragglers, due to an interruption caused by unfavourable atmospheric conditions from the middle of April to the beginning of May. A third flight can be seen regularly from the end of May to the beginning of June. The authors argue that this third flight is from a possible second generation, and indicative of the species being bivoltine in central to south-eastern Europe. Population Size and Density A study in central Europe found that the abundances of males and females in T. domesticum are fairly even ( Lukášová and Holuša, 2014 ).

ensity A study in central Europe found that the abundances of males and females in T. domesticum are fairly even ( Lukášová and Holuša, 2014 ). Nutrition Trypodendron species have independently evolved a nutritional mutualism with various fungal species. They actively farm one or several fungal mutualists in tunnel systems (galleries) bored on recently dead or stressed host plant species. The fungi serve as the food source for both the adults and the larvae ( Holuša et al., 2021 ). Associations There is a lack of thorough understanding of the fungal community that is associated with Trypodendron species. These fungal communities include xylobiontic and saproxylic fungi. In their galleries, these beetles actively farm one or several fungi species, to be used as their food source ( Lehenberger et al., 2018 ; 2019). Fungi reported to be farmed by T. domesticum include Ophiostoma bacillisporum , Ceratocystis torulosa , Cystobasidium laryngis , Irpex lacteus , Leptographium spp., Ophiostoma arduennense , Phialophora fastigiata [ Cadophora fastigiata ], Phialophoropsis sp., Lentinus substrictus , Polyporus lepideus , Bjerkandera adusta , Trametes versicolor , Trametes ochracea , Aureobasidium pullulans and Pseudogymnoascus pannorum ( Carlier et al., 2006 ; Metzler and Hecht, 2006 ; Jackson et al., 2011 ; Jankowiak et al., 2018 ; Lehenberger et al., 2018 ; 2019).

annorum ( Carlier et al., 2006 ; Metzler and Hecht, 2006 ; Jackson et al., 2011 ; Jankowiak et al., 2018 ; Lehenberger et al., 2018 ; 2019). Trypodendron domesticus is also apparently associated with beech trees that have suffered lesions caused by the fungal pathogen Nectria coccinea [ Neonectria coccinea ], and by the beech-bark scale Cryptococcus fagisuga ( Grüner and Metzler, 2006 ; Petercord, 2006 ). Henin et al. (2003) also report the presence of dying mosses in beech trees later attacked by T. domesticum and Trypodendron signatum in Belgium. The authors acknowledge that this possible relationship needs further research. Attacks of T. domesticus on beech trees are also reported as being followed by a white rot, mainly caused by the fungus Fomes fomentarius (Lösekrug,1988). Environmental Requirements Trypodendron domesticum lives in temperate forests and require suitable temperatures for both larval and fungal development ( Jackson et al., 2011 ). It attacks hardwoods that are sick, stressed, dying or recently dead, or harvested wood with a high moisture content ( Jackson et al., 2011 ; Gossner et al., 2019 ). The beetles bore galleries in the wood to breed and overwinter, flying out when the temperature is above 15°C for several days ( Hiskes and Dugas, 2013 ). The adults have been reported as emerging in Croatia at temperatures above 9°C ( Franjević, 2013 ).
