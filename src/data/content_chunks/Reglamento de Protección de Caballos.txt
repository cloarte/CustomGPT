Animal Care Tech Note
The Horse Protection Act: Records and Reporting 
Requirements for Horse Show, Exhibition, Sale, and 
Auction Managers 
Congress enacted the Horse Protection Act (HPA) to end 
the cruel and inhumane practice of soring horses. The 
HPA requires horse event management—any person or 
entity who organizes, controls, administers or is otherwise 
responsible for organizing, directing, or administering 
any horse show, horse exhibition, horse sale, or horse 
auction—to establish and maintain records; submit records, 
reports, and other information; and permit access to and 
copying of records. This tech note summarizes what you, 
the horse event manager, must know to comply with these 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
Access to Records
As a horse event manager, you must provide representatives 
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Horse Protection 
Inspectors (HPI) unlimited access to any records required to 
be kept or otherwise maintained by regulation. This includes:
 Allowing APHIS representatives and HPIs to examine 
and make copies of such records pertaining to any horse 
during business hours or other mutually agreed upon time
 Providing a room, table, or other facilities necessary to 
properly examine and copy such records
Reporting 
As a horse event manager, you must report certain 
information at specific intervals before and after each event.
(Unless otherwise noted, address means street address or 
post office box number and zip code.) 
At Least 30 Days Before the Event
Under §11.14 of the HPA regulations, you must submit to the 
APHIS Administrator the following information:
