Plant Notes:  Crossvine is a native woody perennial vine in the Bignonia family (Bignoniaceae). It can be found throughout Alabama. Crossvine grows in bottomland forest, in mesic woodlands, on fences, and along woodland edges. It is a high climbing vine reaching lengths of 30-50 feet. The bark is grayish brown and scaley. When cut in cross section, the phloem forms a distinct “X” within the stem. The plant climbs by tendrils. Leaves are opposite, petiolate, and compound with two leaflets and a terminal tendril. The tendrils are branched and end in adhesive discs. The leaflets are oblong to lanceolate in outline, entire, glabrous, and thick in texture. The leaves are semi-evergreen and dark green to purplish in color. Fragrant flowers are produced in axillary clusters of 2-5 flowers. The individual flowers have a campanulate calyx with 5 tiny lobes. The corolla is cylindrical-campanulate with 5 spreading lobes. The corolla is red to orange, often with a yellow throat. The fruit is a flattened leathery to woody capsule. Crossvine is often available from nurseries. It can be used as a cover for fences, arbors, or walls. Several horticultural selections are available with different colored flowers.—
