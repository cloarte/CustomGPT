atais evergreen with a dense crown, foliage an unusually deep, vivid green. Crown habit in young trees pointed, usually somewhat irregular in outline reflecting a complex branching pattern, varying from narrow and spire-like on many infertile sites to broad and coarse under high fertility; in old trees rounded or even flattened at top. Persistent, usually large cones are generally a conspicuous feature. Tree height in mainland California and Guadalupe Island generally reaches 20-35 m, depending on site, rarely over 40 m (Lindsay, 1932); on Cedros Island it tends to be less. Mature dbh in native stands tend to be extremely variable depending on stocking as well as site; in dense stands typically reaching 40-75 cm, but isolated trees can be far larger, well over 100 cm, with a maximum of over 200 cm. In exotic plantings, ultimate height, while also varying widely with site, tends to be greater, generally ranging from 30 m to 50-55 m, with rare trees reaching 60 m. Ultimate stem diameters of closed stands, which are seldom actually reached, would typically be larger, probably 50-85 cm, with isolated trees ranging to over 250 cm.

 Reproduccion: The patterns of genetic variation in P. radiata and history of its genetic improvement are outlined by Burdon (1992, 2000). Advances in genetic knowledge and developments concerning genetic improvement are covered in Burdon and Moore (1997) . Intensive provenance testing has been done, albeit belatedly, in New Zealand and Australia and to a lesser extent in Chile and South Africa ( Burdon, 1992 ; Johnson et al., 1997 ; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998).

Intensive provenance testing has been done, albeit belatedly, in New Zealand and Australia and to a lesser extent in Chile and South Africa ( Burdon, 1992 ; Johnson et al., 1997 ; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998). Differences among the mainland provenances are subtle, but definite, involving soil and climatic tolerances and disease resistance, rather than growth potential. The two island provenances are distinctive in morphology, having higher wood density and slower growth. Guadalupe is slightly slower and Cedros substantially so, but hybrids with mainland stock tend to match the growth rates of the mainland parents. No native provenance is completely devoid of advantages. Domesticated stocks are evidently derived entirely from Monterey and Año Nuevo, mainly the latter. For most purposes this has provided a near-optimal genetic base for adaptation and intensive breeding, but further importations of native-provenance material were indicated and have been carried out. The Guadalupe provenance is of interest for hybridizing with already domesticated stocks, for straighter stems, higher wood density and some possible climatic tolerances. The Monterey provenance, which is generally under-represented in land-race stocks, has superior tolerance of poor soils. The Cambria provenance is of interest for Western Australia. Domesticated stocks differ appreciably from their progenitor stocks, although this is only in part attributable to responses to natural and silvicultural selection in adoptive environments. Genetic variation between individual trees exists, often at notably high levels, for a wide range of traits, including: cone size and morphology, branching characteristics, stem form, phenology, soil tolerances, frost resistance, brows resistance, resistance to certain diseases, secondary metabolites, and numerous wood properties ( Burdon, 1992 ; Matheson et al., 1997 ; Shelbourne, 1997 ). This has been demonstrated in both pure studies of the species' genetic architecture and in the course

 of traits, including: cone size and morphology, branching characteristics, stem form, phenology, soil tolerances, frost resistance, brows resistance, resistance to certain diseases, secondary metabolites, and numerous wood properties ( Burdon, 1992 ; Matheson et al., 1997 ; Shelbourne, 1997 ). This has been demonstrated in both pure studies of the species' genetic architecture and in the course of progeny testing select material. Adverse genetic correlations, which form important breeding constraints, exist between wood density and stem volume, and between distance between clusters of branches on the one hand, and knot characteristics, general stem form and early growth rate on the other. Genotype x site interactions, involving changes of genotypic rankings among sites, are sometimes important for stem diameter growth but tend to be less important for other traits ( Burdon et al., 1997b ). The major breeding programmes generally involve large, elaborately structured breeding populations that are designed to give cumulative gains over successive generations. Native-population material is being kept ex situ as back-up gene resources, but its perpetuation requires increased commitment ( Eldridge, 1997 ). CalEPPC (1999) record a threat to the native form from invasive P. radiata cultivars which can spread pine pitch canker disease to the native trees. The phenology of P. radiata has been reviewed by Lavery (1986) and Burdon (1994) . The role of temperature appears to lie essentially in short-term control of the rate at which growth can occur, with no actual meristematic extension appearing to occur with prevailing above-ground temperatures below about 5°C. Indeed, low temperatures do not appear to impose any true dormancy, although they can cause hardening against frost. The photoperiodic control appears to be at least in part through daylength shift, rather than absolute daylength, with increasing daylength promoting a more active phenological state, although experimentally applied long days can have the

The photoperiodic control appears to be at least in part through daylength shift, rather than absolute daylength, with increasing daylength promoting a more active phenological state, although experimentally applied long days can have the same effect. High nitrogen status appears to reduce the seasonal fluctuations in vegetative phenological state. In any event, P. radiata has a long, almost completely opportunistic growing season, which evidently accounts for its high growth rate. However, after the juvenile stage, extension of shoots and foliage tends to be concentrated in the spring although in milder climates it can be well underway by late winter. Shoot extension shows its main morphological discontinuity after the summer solstice; however, even in post-juvenile trees, shoot extension can proceed facultatively on the leader well ahead of the main spring flush. Diameter growth can occur throughout the year, temperatures permitting. Remarkably, it may in milder climates show an upsurge, which is evidently related to the switch from producing latewood in one growth ring to earlywood in the next, immediately after the winter solstice even though temperatures are still dropping. The pollination season is earlier than in any other pine. It can begin very soon after the winter solstice, but can be as long as four months later on cold sites, suggesting that it occurs as soon as temperatures permit after the solstice. At low latitudes, vegetative phenology tends be become more related to rainfall fluctuations, while flowering tends to be sparse with no coherent season, leading to little or no seed being produced. Reproductive behaviour of P. radiata is covered by Burdon and Miller (1992) . Like pines in general, it is a hermaphrodite, but is incompletely self-fertile ( Griffin and

 vegetative phenology tends be become more related to rainfall fluctuations, while flowering tends to be sparse with no coherent season, leading to little or no seed being produced. Reproductive behaviour of P. radiata is covered by Burdon and Miller (1992) . Like pines in general, it is a hermaphrodite, but is incompletely self-fertile ( Griffin and Lindgren, 1985 ) and shows inbreeding depression ( Wilcox, 1983 ). It is wind-pollinated, with pollen production beginning on all trees at an early age, generally around 5-6 years, but depending somewhat on site and provenance. Onset of female flowering can begin at about the same age, but can vary very widely among individuals leading to a long straggle in onset of seed production. Amount of flowering and seed production show limited fluctuations from year to year. Sensitivity of seed production to stocking is limited by the fact that even when crowded, the main stem can produce cones. Reproductive activity is generally promoted by warm, low-rainfall sites, especially near the sea. Cones are serotinous, capable of remaining unopened for a number of years in absence of hot, dry conditions, and can remain attached long after opening. The serotinous cones store cumulative seed crops and make long-term seed storage a natural phenomenon. A very high germination rate is possible. For detailed descriptions and reviews see Scott (1960) , Poynton (1979), Lavery (1986) , Booth and McMurtrie (1988) , Burdon and Miller (1992) , Lewis and Ferguson (1993), Madgwick (1994) and Burdon (2000). P. radiata thrives in mild, mesic, oceanic climates in the latitudinal range 33-46°.

It can tolerate annual rainfall as low as 300 mm, or even less if fogs bring occult precipitation, but generally needs 500 mm to be an economic crop. Productivity tends to increase strongly as precipitation increases towards 1000 mm. As precipitation exceeds 2000 mm, problems tend to arise with disease or leached soils, but some plantations have succeeded well with over 2500 mm. A winter rainfall pattern is generally conducive to tree health, but much of the area where the species is grown successfully, including many of the most productive sites, has a distributed rainfall. Freezing continental air masses are fatal if too cold or exposure too prolonged. Damp heat is very unfavourable, leading to disease. However, the species is unusually tolerant of 'white' frost (radiation frost, characterised by frozen dewfall) in the growing season (up to 6°C). Provenances vary in frost resistance ( Hood and Libby, 1980 ; Burdon, 1992 ) and heritable tree-to-tree variation has also been shown ( Menzies et al., 1987 ). Hail damage, which is often accompanied by damp heat, often leads to fatal infection by wound pathogens. Snowfalls, especially if wet, can be very damaging. Within this latitudinal zone, the upper altitudinal limit for successful planting generally ranges from 1250 m at 33°N to 400-500 m at 46°N. Prolonged drought, particularly with high temperatures, can be fatal. A secondary geographic 'window', in which plantations can be grown with some success, exists near the Equator (Burdon, 2000) at high altitudes, generally 2500-3500 m, and with moderate rainfall of 800-1200 mm per annum.

Between the Equator and about 32°N, very few satisfactory sites exist, though isolated trees can often thrive where closed stands fail through disease. Like most of the genus, P. radiata is relatively undemanding in its soil requirements, maintaining its performance well over microsite variations. However, it tends to require higher soil fertility than many pines, in accordance with its high growth potential and coastal origin. Apart from nitrogen being a frequent limiting factor, outright deficiencies have occurred in phosphorus, boron, magnesium, zinc, calcium, potassium, (contentiously) sulphur, copper and (generally with high pH) manganese (Burdon, 2000). Fertilizers can generally be used effectively to correct these deficiencies. A wide range of soil textures is tolerated, from coarse vesicular material or gravelly or rocky soils, through sands and loams, to heavy clays, although some such tolerances are conditional upon climate. Deep, well-drained soils are preferred, particularly with abundant rainfall. Waterlogging is not tolerated. Partial waterlogging of clay soils in winter can lead to temporary instability of young trees which leads to permanent butt deformation. On fluvial gravels severe gales can cause widespread windthrow. Native provenances vary markedly in tolerance of certain infertile soils ( Burdon, 1992 , 2000; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998).

Such variation also exists at the individual-tree level. Physiography is seldom a limiting factor in itself, although it may be associated with outcropping rock, lack of cold air drainage on flats or in hollows, or drifting of snow. Preferences for aspect vary with climate, but are often weak. Within its native range, P. radiata is generally the sole high-forest species. In Australia, P. radiata has invaded Eucalypt forests with a consequent reduction in species diversity ( Luken and Thieret, 1997 ). For more detailed descriptions and reviews see Scott (1960) , Poynton (1977) , Lavery (1986) , Booth and McMurtrie (1988) , Burdon and Miller (1992) , Lewis and Ferguson (1993, Ch. 1), Madgwick (1994) and Burdon (2001) , Mead (2013, Ch. 2) and Burdon et al. (2017, Ch. 5). Many statements that are well covered in these references, especially the last three, are not specifically referenced. Pinus radiata thrives in mild, mesic, oceanic climates in the latitudinal range 33-46°, but can tolerate higher latitudes of up to 55° in the British Isles. It can tolerate annual rainfalls of as low as 300 mm, or even less if fogs bring occult precipitation, but generally needs 500 mm to be an economic crop. Productivity tends to increase strongly as precipitation increases towards 1000 mm, but optimal precipitation increases with rooting depth ( Mead, 2013 , Ch. 2). As precipitation exceeds 2000 mm, problems tend to arise with disease or leached soils, but some plantations have succeeded well with over 2500 mm.

A winter rainfall pattern is generally conducive to tree health, but much of the area where the species is grown successfully, including many of the most productive sites, has a distributed rainfall. Remarkably, in almost no location where the species grows successfully as an exotic does the climate closely match the natural habitat. Freezing continental air masses are fatal if too cold or exposure too prolonged. Damp heat is very unfavourable, leading to disease. However, the species is unusually tolerant of 'white' frost (radiation frost, characterized by frozen dewfall) in the growing season (up to -6°C), with well-hardened plants tolerating -17°C in winter.

 tolerance of certain infertile soils ( Burdon, 1992 , 2000; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998). Such variation also exists at the individual-tree level. Physiography is seldom a limiting factor in itself, although it may be associated with outcropping rock, lack of cold air drainage on flats or in hollows, or drifting of snow. Preferences for aspect vary with climate, but are often weak. Associations Within its native range, P. radiata is generally the sole high-forest species. In Australia, P. radiata has invaded Eucalypt forests with a consequent reduction in species diversity ( Luken and Thieret, 1997 ). Climate For more detailed descriptions and reviews see Scott (1960) , Poynton (1977) , Lavery (1986) , Booth and McMurtrie (1988) , Burdon and Miller (1992) , Lewis and Ferguson (1993, Ch. 1), Madgwick (1994) and Burdon (2001) , Mead (2013, Ch. 2) and Burdon et al. (2017, Ch. 5). Many statements that are well covered in these references, especially the last three, are not specifically referenced. Pinus radiata thrives in mild, mesic, oceanic climates in the latitudinal range 33-46°, but can tolerate higher latitudes of up to 55° in the British Isles. It can tolerate annual rainfalls of as low as 300 mm, or even less if fogs bring occult precipitation, but generally needs 500 mm to be an economic crop. Productivity tends to increase strongly as precipitation increases towards 1000 mm, but optimal precipitation increases with rooting depth ( Mead, 2013 , Ch. 2). As precipitation exceeds 2000 mm, problems tend to arise with disease or leached soils, but some plantations have succeeded well with over 2500 mm.

 to be an economic crop. Productivity tends to increase strongly as precipitation increases towards 1000 mm, but optimal precipitation increases with rooting depth ( Mead, 2013 , Ch. 2). As precipitation exceeds 2000 mm, problems tend to arise with disease or leached soils, but some plantations have succeeded well with over 2500 mm. A winter rainfall pattern is generally conducive to tree health, but much of the area where the species is grown successfully, including many of the most productive sites, has a distributed rainfall. Remarkably, in almost no location where the species grows successfully as an exotic does the climate closely match the natural habitat. Freezing continental air masses are fatal if too cold or exposure too prolonged. Damp heat is very unfavourable, leading to disease. However, the species is unusually tolerant of 'white' frost (radiation frost, characterized by frozen dewfall) in the growing season (up to -6°C), with well-hardened plants tolerating -17°C in winter. Provenances vary in frost resistance ( Hood and Libby, 1980 ; Burdon, 1992 ) and heritable tree-to-tree variation has also been shown ( Menzies et al., 1987 ). Hail damage, which is often accompanied by damp heat, often leads to fatal infection by wound pathogens. Snowfalls, especially if wet, can be very damaging. Within this latitudinal zone, the upper altitudinal limit for successful planting generally ranges from 1250 m at Lat. 33° to 400-500 m at 46°. Prolonged drought, particularly with high temperatures, can be fatal. The maximum mean annual temperature for satisfactory performance is probably around 17°C. A secondary geographic 'window', in which plantations can be grown with some success, exists near the Equator ( Burdon, 2001 ; Burdon et al., 2017 , Ch. 5), at high altitudes (generally 2500-3500 m), and moderate rainfall (800-

A secondary geographic 'window', in which plantations can be grown with some success, exists near the Equator ( Burdon, 2001 ; Burdon et al., 2017 , Ch. 5), at high altitudes (generally 2500-3500 m), and moderate rainfall (800-1200 mm). Between there and about Latitude 32°, very few satisfactory sites exist. Often isolated trees can thrive where closed stands fail through disease. Soil and Physiography For more detailed descriptions and reviews see Scott (1960) , Poynton (1977) , Lavery (1986) , Burdon and Miller (1992) , Lewis and Ferguson (1993, Ch. 6), Madgwick (1994) , Burdon (2001) , Mead (2013, Ch. 2) and Burdon et al. (2017, Ch. 5). Like most of the genus, P. radiata is relatively undemanding in its soil requirements, maintaining its performance well over microsite variations. However, it tends to require higher soil fertility than many pines, in accordance with its high growth potential and coastal origin. Apart from nitrogen being a frequent limiting factor, outright deficiencies have occurred in phosphorus, boron, magnesium, zinc, calcium, potassium, (contentiously) sulphur, copper, and (generally with high pH) manganese ( Burdon, 2001 ). Fertilizers can generally be used effectively to correct these deficiencies. A wide range of soil textures is tolerated, from coarse vesicular material or gravelly or rocky soils, through sands and loams, to heavy clays, although some such tolerances are conditional upon climate. Deep, well-drained soils are preferred, particularly with abundant rainfall. Waterlogging is not tolerated. Partial waterlogging of clay soils in winter can lead to temporary instability of young

Crown habit in young trees pointed, usually somewhat irregular in outline reflecting a complex branching pattern, varying from narrow and spire-like on many infertile sites to broad and coarse under high fertility; in old trees rounded or even flattened at top. Persistent, usually large cones are generally a conspicuous feature. Tree height in mainland California and Guadalupe Island generally reaches 20-35 m, depending on site, rarely over 40 m (Lindsay, 1932); on Cedros Island it tends to be less. Mature dbh in native stands tend to be extremely variable depending on stocking as well as site; in dense stands typically reaching 40-75 cm, but isolated trees can be far larger, well over 100 cm, with a maximum of over 200 cm. In exotic plantings, ultimate height, while also varying widely with site, tends to be greater, generally ranging from 30 m to 50-55 m, with rare trees reaching 60 m. Ultimate stem diameters of closed stands, which are seldom actually reached, would typically be larger, probably 50-85 cm, with isolated trees ranging to over 250 cm.

 Reproduccion: The patterns of genetic variation in P. radiata and history of its genetic improvement are outlined by Burdon (1992, 2000). Advances in genetic knowledge and developments concerning genetic improvement are covered in Burdon and Moore (1997) . Intensive provenance testing has been done, albeit belatedly, in New Zealand and Australia and to a lesser extent in Chile and South Africa ( Burdon, 1992 ; Johnson et al., 1997 ; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998).

Intensive provenance testing has been done, albeit belatedly, in New Zealand and Australia and to a lesser extent in Chile and South Africa ( Burdon, 1992 ; Johnson et al., 1997 ; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998). Differences among the mainland provenances are subtle, but definite, involving soil and climatic tolerances and disease resistance, rather than growth potential. The two island provenances are distinctive in morphology, having higher wood density and slower growth. Guadalupe is slightly slower and Cedros substantially so, but hybrids with mainland stock tend to match the growth rates of the mainland parents. No native provenance is completely devoid of advantages. Domesticated stocks are evidently derived entirely from Monterey and Año Nuevo, mainly the latter. For most purposes this has provided a near-optimal genetic base for adaptation and intensive breeding, but further importations of native-provenance material were indicated and have been carried out. The Guadalupe provenance is of interest for hybridizing with already domesticated stocks, for straighter stems, higher wood density and some possible climatic tolerances. The Monterey provenance, which is generally under-represented in land-race stocks, has superior tolerance of poor soils. The Cambria provenance is of interest for Western Australia. Domesticated stocks differ appreciably from their progenitor stocks, although this is only in part attributable to responses to natural and silvicultural selection in adoptive environments. Genetic variation between individual trees exists, often at notably high levels, for a wide range of traits, including: cone size and morphology, branching characteristics, stem form, phenology, soil tolerances, frost resistance, brows resistance, resistance to certain diseases, secondary metabolites, and numerous wood properties ( Burdon, 1992 ; Matheson et al., 1997 ; Shelbourne, 1997 ).

 of traits, including: cone size and morphology, branching characteristics, stem form, phenology, soil tolerances, frost resistance, brows resistance, resistance to certain diseases, secondary metabolites, and numerous wood properties ( Burdon, 1992 ; Matheson et al., 1997 ; Shelbourne, 1997 ). This has been demonstrated in both pure studies of the species' genetic architecture and in the course of progeny testing select material. Adverse genetic correlations, which form important breeding constraints, exist between wood density and stem volume, and between distance between clusters of branches on the one hand, and knot characteristics, general stem form and early growth rate on the other. Genotype x site interactions, involving changes of genotypic rankings among sites, are sometimes important for stem diameter growth but tend to be less important for other traits ( Burdon et al., 1997b ). The major breeding programmes generally involve large, elaborately structured breeding populations that are designed to give cumulative gains over successive generations. Native-population material is being kept ex situ as back-up gene resources, but its perpetuation requires increased commitment ( Eldridge, 1997 ). CalEPPC (1999) record a threat to the native form from invasive P. radiata cultivars which can spread pine pitch canker disease to the native trees. The phenology of P. radiata has been reviewed by Lavery (1986) and Burdon (1994) . The role of temperature appears to lie essentially in short-term control of the rate at which growth can occur, with no actual meristematic extension appearing to occur with prevailing above-ground temperatures below about 5°C. Indeed, low temperatures do not appear to impose any true dormancy, although they can cause hardening against frost. The photoperiodic control appears to be at least in part through daylength shift, rather than absolute daylength, with increasing daylength promoting a more active phenological state, although experimentally applied long days can have the

 with prevailing above-ground temperatures below about 5°C. Indeed, low temperatures do not appear to impose any true dormancy, although they can cause hardening against frost. The photoperiodic control appears to be at least in part through daylength shift, rather than absolute daylength, with increasing daylength promoting a more active phenological state, although experimentally applied long days can have the same effect. High nitrogen status appears to reduce the seasonal fluctuations in vegetative phenological state. In any event, P. radiata has a long, almost completely opportunistic growing season, which evidently accounts for its high growth rate. However, after the juvenile stage, extension of shoots and foliage tends to be concentrated in the spring although in milder climates it can be well underway by late winter. Shoot extension shows its main morphological discontinuity after the summer solstice; however, even in post-juvenile trees, shoot extension can proceed facultatively on the leader well ahead of the main spring flush. Diameter growth can occur throughout the year, temperatures permitting. Remarkably, it may in milder climates show an upsurge, which is evidently related to the switch from producing latewood in one growth ring to earlywood in the next, immediately after the winter solstice even though temperatures are still dropping. The pollination season is earlier than in any other pine. It can begin very soon after the winter solstice, but can be as long as four months later on cold sites, suggesting that it occurs as soon as temperatures permit after the solstice. At low latitudes, vegetative phenology tends be become more related to rainfall fluctuations, while flowering tends to be sparse with no coherent season, leading to little or no seed being produced. Reproductive behaviour of P. radiata is covered by Burdon and Miller (1992) . Like pines in general, it is a hermaphrodite, but is incompletely self-fertile ( Griffin and

 vegetative phenology tends be become more related to rainfall fluctuations, while flowering tends to be sparse with no coherent season, leading to little or no seed being produced. Reproductive behaviour of P. radiata is covered by Burdon and Miller (1992) . Like pines in general, it is a hermaphrodite, but is incompletely self-fertile ( Griffin and Lindgren, 1985 ) and shows inbreeding depression ( Wilcox, 1983 ). It is wind-pollinated, with pollen production beginning on all trees at an early age, generally around 5-6 years, but depending somewhat on site and provenance. Onset of female flowering can begin at about the same age, but can vary very widely among individuals leading to a long straggle in onset of seed production. Amount of flowering and seed production show limited fluctuations from year to year. Sensitivity of seed production to stocking is limited by the fact that even when crowded, the main stem can produce cones. Reproductive activity is generally promoted by warm, low-rainfall sites, especially near the sea. Cones are serotinous, capable of remaining unopened for a number of years in absence of hot, dry conditions, and can remain attached long after opening. The serotinous cones store cumulative seed crops and make long-term seed storage a natural phenomenon. A very high germination rate is possible. For detailed descriptions and reviews see Scott (1960) , Poynton (1979), Lavery (1986) , Booth and McMurtrie (1988) , Burdon and Miller (1992) , Lewis and Ferguson (1993), Madgwick (1994) and Burdon (2000). P. radiata thrives in mild, mesic, oceanic climates in the latitudinal range 33-46°.

 Miller (1992) , Lewis and Ferguson (1993), Madgwick (1994) and Burdon (2000). P. radiata thrives in mild, mesic, oceanic climates in the latitudinal range 33-46°. It can tolerate annual rainfall as low as 300 mm, or even less if fogs bring occult precipitation, but generally needs 500 mm to be an economic crop. Productivity tends to increase strongly as precipitation increases towards 1000 mm. As precipitation exceeds 2000 mm, problems tend to arise with disease or leached soils, but some plantations have succeeded well with over 2500 mm. A winter rainfall pattern is generally conducive to tree health, but much of the area where the species is grown successfully, including many of the most productive sites, has a distributed rainfall. Freezing continental air masses are fatal if too cold or exposure too prolonged. Damp heat is very unfavourable, leading to disease. However, the species is unusually tolerant of 'white' frost (radiation frost, characterised by frozen dewfall) in the growing season (up to 6°C). Provenances vary in frost resistance ( Hood and Libby, 1980 ; Burdon, 1992 ) and heritable tree-to-tree variation has also been shown ( Menzies et al., 1987 ). Hail damage, which is often accompanied by damp heat, often leads to fatal infection by wound pathogens. Snowfalls, especially if wet, can be very damaging. Within this latitudinal zone, the upper altitudinal limit for successful planting generally ranges from 1250 m at 33°N to 400-500 m at 46°N. Prolonged drought, particularly with high temperatures, can be fatal. A secondary geographic 'window', in which plantations can be grown with some success, exists near the Equator (Burdon, 2000) at high altitudes, generally 2500-3500 m, and with moderate rainfall of 800-1200 mm per annum.

A secondary geographic 'window', in which plantations can be grown with some success, exists near the Equator (Burdon, 2000) at high altitudes, generally 2500-3500 m, and with moderate rainfall of 800-1200 mm per annum. Between the Equator and about 32°N, very few satisfactory sites exist, though isolated trees can often thrive where closed stands fail through disease. Like most of the genus, P. radiata is relatively undemanding in its soil requirements, maintaining its performance well over microsite variations. However, it tends to require higher soil fertility than many pines, in accordance with its high growth potential and coastal origin. Apart from nitrogen being a frequent limiting factor, outright deficiencies have occurred in phosphorus, boron, magnesium, zinc, calcium, potassium, (contentiously) sulphur, copper and (generally with high pH) manganese (Burdon, 2000). Fertilizers can generally be used effectively to correct these deficiencies. A wide range of soil textures is tolerated, from coarse vesicular material or gravelly or rocky soils, through sands and loams, to heavy clays, although some such tolerances are conditional upon climate.

Such variation also exists at the individual-tree level. Physiography is seldom a limiting factor in itself, although it may be associated with outcropping rock, lack of cold air drainage on flats or in hollows, or drifting of snow. Preferences for aspect vary with climate, but are often weak. Within its native range, P. radiata is generally the sole high-forest species. In Australia, P. radiata has invaded Eucalypt forests with a consequent reduction in species diversity ( Luken and Thieret, 1997 ). For more detailed descriptions and reviews see Scott (1960) , Poynton (1977) , Lavery (1986) , Booth and McMurtrie (1988) , Burdon and Miller (1992) , Lewis and Ferguson (1993, Ch. 1), Madgwick (1994) and Burdon (2001) , Mead (2013, Ch. 2) and Burdon et al. (2017, Ch. 5). Many statements that are well covered in these references, especially the last three, are not specifically referenced. Pinus radiata thrives in mild, mesic, oceanic climates in the latitudinal range 33-46°, but can tolerate higher latitudes of up to 55° in the British Isles. It can tolerate annual rainfalls of as low as 300 mm, or even less if fogs bring occult precipitation, but generally needs 500 mm to be an economic crop. Productivity tends to increase strongly as precipitation increases towards 1000 mm, but optimal precipitation increases with rooting depth ( Mead, 2013 , Ch. 2). As precipitation exceeds 2000 mm, problems tend to arise with disease or leached soils, but some plantations have succeeded well with over 2500 mm.

As precipitation exceeds 2000 mm, problems tend to arise with disease or leached soils, but some plantations have succeeded well with over 2500 mm. A winter rainfall pattern is generally conducive to tree health, but much of the area where the species is grown successfully, including many of the most productive sites, has a distributed rainfall. Remarkably, in almost no location where the species grows successfully as an exotic does the climate closely match the natural habitat. Freezing continental air masses are fatal if too cold or exposure too prolonged. Damp heat is very unfavourable, leading to disease. However, the species is unusually tolerant of 'white' frost (radiation frost, characterized by frozen dewfall) in the growing season (up to -6°C), with well-hardened plants tolerating -17°C in winter. Provenances vary in frost resistance ( Hood and Libby, 1980 ; Burdon, 1992 ) and heritable tree-to-tree variation has also been shown ( Menzies et al., 1987 ). Hail damage, which is often accompanied by damp heat, often leads to fatal infection by wound pathogens. Snowfalls, especially if wet, can be very damaging. Within this latitudinal zone, the upper altitudinal limit for successful planting generally ranges from 1250 m at Lat. 33° to 400-500 m at 46°. Prolonged drought, particularly with high temperatures, can be fatal. The maximum mean annual temperature for satisfactory performance is probably around 17°C.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics The patterns of genetic variation in P. radiata and history of its genetic improvement are outlined by Burdon (1992, 2000). Advances in genetic knowledge and developments concerning genetic improvement are covered in Burdon and Moore (1997) . Intensive provenance testing has been done, albeit belatedly, in New Zealand and Australia and to a lesser extent in Chile and South Africa ( Burdon, 1992 ; Johnson et al., 1997 ; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998). Differences among the mainland provenances are subtle, but definite, involving soil and climatic tolerances and disease resistance, rather than growth potential.

 Africa ( Burdon, 1992 ; Johnson et al., 1997 ; Burdon et al., 1997a , 1998). Differences among the mainland provenances are subtle, but definite, involving soil and climatic tolerances and disease resistance, rather than growth potential. The two island provenances are distinctive in morphology, having higher wood density and slower growth. Guadalupe is slightly slower and Cedros substantially so, but hybrids with mainland stock tend to match the growth rates of the mainland parents. No native provenance is completely devoid of advantages. Domesticated stocks are evidently derived entirely from Monterey and Año Nuevo, mainly the latter. For most purposes this has provided a near-optimal genetic base for adaptation and intensive breeding, but further importations of native-provenance material were indicated and have been carried out. The Guadalupe provenance is of interest for hybridizing with already domesticated stocks, for straighter stems, higher wood density and some possible climatic tolerances. The Monterey provenance, which is generally under-represented in land-race stocks, has superior tolerance of poor soils. The Cambria provenance is of interest for Western Australia. Domesticated stocks differ appreciably from their progenitor stocks, although this is only in part attributable to responses to natural and silvicultural selection in adoptive environments. Genetic variation between individual trees exists, often at notably high levels, for a wide range of traits, including: cone size and morphology, branching characteristics, stem form, phenology, soil tolerances, frost resistance, brows resistance, resistance to certain diseases, secondary metabolites, and numerous wood properties ( Burdon, 1992 ; Matheson et al., 1997 ; Shelbourne, 1997 ). This has been demonstrated in both pure studies of the species' genetic architecture and in the course of progeny testing select material. Adverse genetic correlations, which form important breeding constraints, exist between wood density and stem volume, and between distance between

 resistance to certain diseases, secondary metabolites, and numerous wood properties ( Burdon, 1992 ; Matheson et al., 1997 ; Shelbourne, 1997 ). This has been demonstrated in both pure studies of the species' genetic architecture and in the course of progeny testing select material. Adverse genetic correlations, which form important breeding constraints, exist between wood density and stem volume, and between distance between clusters of branches on the one hand, and knot characteristics, general stem form and early growth rate on the other. Genotype x site interactions, involving changes of genotypic rankings among sites, are sometimes important for stem diameter growth but tend to be less important for other traits ( Burdon et al., 1997b ). The major breeding programmes generally involve large, elaborately structured breeding populations that are designed to give cumulative gains over successive generations. Native-population material is being kept ex situ as back-up gene resources, but its perpetuation requires increased commitment ( Eldridge, 1997 ). CalEPPC (1999) record a threat to the native form from invasive P. radiata cultivars which can spread pine pitch canker disease to the native trees. Physiology and Phenology The phenology of P. radiata has been reviewed by Lavery (1986) and Burdon (1994) . The role of temperature appears to lie essentially in short-term control of the rate at which growth can occur, with no actual meristematic extension appearing to occur with prevailing above-ground temperatures below about 5°C. Indeed, low temperatures do not appear to impose any true dormancy, although they can cause hardening against frost. The photoperiodic control appears to be at least in part through daylength shift, rather than absolute daylength, with increasing daylength promoting a more active phenological state, although experimentally applied long days can have the same effect. High nitrogen status appears to reduce the seasonal fluctuations in vegetative phenological state. In any event, P.

, although they can cause hardening against frost. The photoperiodic control appears to be at least in part through daylength shift, rather than absolute daylength, with increasing daylength promoting a more active phenological state, although experimentally applied long days can have the same effect. High nitrogen status appears to reduce the seasonal fluctuations in vegetative phenological state. In any event, P. radiata has a long, almost completely opportunistic growing season, which evidently accounts for its high growth rate. However, after the juvenile stage, extension of shoots and foliage tends to be concentrated in the spring although in milder climates it can be well underway by late winter. Shoot extension shows its main morphological discontinuity after the summer solstice; however, even in post-juvenile trees, shoot extension can proceed facultatively on the leader well ahead of the main spring flush. Diameter growth can occur throughout the year, temperatures permitting. Remarkably, it may in milder climates show an upsurge, which is evidently related to the switch from producing latewood in one growth ring to earlywood in the next, immediately after the winter solstice even though temperatures are still dropping. The pollination season is earlier than in any other pine. It can begin very soon after the winter solstice, but can be as long as four months later on cold sites, suggesting that it occurs as soon as temperatures permit after the solstice. At low latitudes, vegetative phenology tends be become more related to rainfall fluctuations, while flowering tends to be sparse with no coherent season, leading to little or no seed being produced. Reproductive Biology Reproductive behaviour of P. radiata is covered by Burdon and Miller (1992) . Like pines in general, it is a hermaphrodite, but is incompletely self-fertile ( Griffin and Lindgren, 1985 ) and shows inbreeding depression ( Wilcox, 1983 ). It is wind-pollinated

 to little or no seed being produced. Reproductive Biology Reproductive behaviour of P. radiata is covered by Burdon and Miller (1992) . Like pines in general, it is a hermaphrodite, but is incompletely self-fertile ( Griffin and Lindgren, 1985 ) and shows inbreeding depression ( Wilcox, 1983 ). It is wind-pollinated, with pollen production beginning on all trees at an early age, generally around 5-6 years, but depending somewhat on site and provenance. Onset of female flowering can begin at about the same age, but can vary very widely among individuals leading to a long straggle in onset of seed production. Amount of flowering and seed production show limited fluctuations from year to year. Sensitivity of seed production to stocking is limited by the fact that even when crowded, the main stem can produce cones. Reproductive activity is generally promoted by warm, low-rainfall sites, especially near the sea. Cones are serotinous, capable of remaining unopened for a number of years in absence of hot, dry conditions, and can remain attached long after opening. The serotinous cones store cumulative seed crops and make long-term seed storage a natural phenomenon. A very high germination rate is possible.
