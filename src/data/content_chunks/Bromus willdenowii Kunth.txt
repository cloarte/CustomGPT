Rescuegrass
Gramineae, Poaceae
Bromus willdenowii
Kunth.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This bunch grass is native in Argentina, but was introduced into theSouthern States around 1850. It is now naturalized there in many areas. It is a short-lived perennial, adapted to humid areas with mild winters. Plants reach up to 3 feet, with leaves up to a foot long and about 0.25 inch wide. Young plants are pubescent, but mature plants are sparingly so. Growth occursthroughout the winter, the plants becoming mature in early summer. On strongsoils, a good amount of forage palatable to livestock is produced. Seed isproduced in quantity, and stands are readily obtained by seeding.
