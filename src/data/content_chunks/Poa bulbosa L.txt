Magness et al. 1971
This is a cool-season bunchgrass believed native to Southern Asia and theMediterranean Area. It is now found in nearly all temperate and subtropicalregions. In this country it is grown mainly in the Pacific Area, especiallySouthern Oregon and Northern California. Its distinctive feature is that itforms small, true bulbs at the base and small bulblets in the panicle. Itrarely forms true seeds but is propagated by planting the bulblets, which canbe handled in harvesting and planting much as though they were seed. The stemsreach to 18 inches high. Growth starts in the fall and continues through winterand spring in mild climates. It ceases when the bulblets form about mid-May.
