ion: The chromosome number reported for D. eriantha is 2n= 18, 36, 40 ( Tropical Forages, 2016 ). Various cultivars have been developed to adapt to different conditions ( Tropical Forages, 2016 ). DNA barcode information for the species is available at the Barcode of Life Data Systems ( BOLDS, 2016 ). Reproductive Biology D. eriantha reproduces mostly vegetatively by stolons and by seed ( Tropical Forages, 2016 ). Seeds are usually not viable or have a low percentage viability (O’Connor and Pickett, 1992). When reproducing by seeds, avoidance of competition in the early stages is needed ( PROTA, 2016 ). Physiology and Phenology D. eriantha is a fast-growing summer perennial grass ( PROTA, 2016 ). It flowers throughout most of the growing season with a peak during the summer ( Tropical Forages, 2016 ). Associations D. eriantha is usually planted with legumes, and generally not with other grasses ( Tropical Forages, 2016 ). Allsopp (1998) reports associations with arbuscular mycorrhizas but without further details. Environmental Requirements D. eriantha grows best on sands and sandy loam soils, tolerating loams, clay loams and clays. Soil pH range from 4.4 to 9.1. The species has low to moderate salt and alkalinity tolerance, and moderate tolerance to aluminium. The species is frost sensitive and has a low shade tolerance. It is fire tolerant ( Tropical Forages, 2016 ). Its optimal growth is between 16° and 29°C ( Heuzé et al., 2015 ). It is tolerant to droughts and water logging ( Encyclopedia of Life, 2016 ).
