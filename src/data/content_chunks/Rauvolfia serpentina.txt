 Habitat: Protected agriculture (e.g. glasshouse production), Managed forests, plantations and orchards, Natural forests, Natural grasslands, Riverbanks, Scrub / shrublands
 Reproduccion: There are some historical germplasm collections reported at USDA facilities ( USDA-ARS, 2020 ). The chromosome number reported for R. serpentina is 2n=22 ( Ammal, 1962 ). The species has been studied extensively for developing in vitro propagation methods including multiple shoot formation, lateral bud proliferation and somatic embryogenesis ( Mitra and Chaturvedi, 1970 ; Patil and Jayanthi, 1997 ; Krishnan et al., 2011 ). A new cultivar with a high root yield and high seed germination is reported for India, but no further details are available ( Hanelt, 2020 ).

 embryogenesis ( Mitra and Chaturvedi, 1970 ; Patil and Jayanthi, 1997 ; Krishnan et al., 2011 ). A new cultivar with a high root yield and high seed germination is reported for India, but no further details are available ( Hanelt, 2020 ). Rauvolfia serpentina is propagated via seeds, root cuttings, stem cuttings and root stumps ( Dutta et al., 1963 ). The quickest propagation method is by root cuttings ( Monachino, 1954 ). A single plant yields about 75 seeds with a reported germination of 10-50%. For a maximum germination, the seeds should be collected near October which is near the end of the reproductive season ( Dutta et al., 1963 ). The seeds take 2 or 3 months to germinate and heat scarification is recommended ( Monachino, 1954 ). The seedlings are ready to be transplanted about 75 days after sowing ( Dutta et al., 1963 ). In vitro propagation methods have been developed but are not used on a large commercial scale because of the high cost of the tissue-cultured production ( Mitra and Chaturvedi, 1970 ; Patil and Jayanthi, 1997 ; Krishnan et al., 2011 ). Rauvolfia serpentina is a perennial shrub ( PFAF, 2020 ). It will go into dormancy and lose all leaves, flowers and fruits when the temperature falls to 10°C; from December to early March. The species requires ample amount of water and might need irrigation in cultivation ( Dutta et al., 1963 ). The species flowers from April to July and fruits from July to September. Plants under greenhouse cultivation usually do not produce fruits ( Monachino, 1954 ). Rauvolfia serpentina is shrub from the tropics and subtropics of Asia that prefers clay to loamy-clay soils, although it can grow in all

 need irrigation in cultivation ( Dutta et al., 1963 ). The species flowers from April to July and fruits from July to September. Plants under greenhouse cultivation usually do not produce fruits ( Monachino, 1954 ). Rauvolfia serpentina is shrub from the tropics and subtropics of Asia that prefers clay to loamy-clay soils, although it can grow in all soil types as long as they are well-drained and fertile ( Varadarajan, 1963 ; PFAF, 2020 ). Dutta et al. (1963) report that sandy soils can retard its growth and promote diseases. The preferred soil pH is acidic to neutral from 4 to 6.3 but will tolerate a pH up to 7 ( Varadarajan, 1963 ; PFAF, 2020 ). R. serpentina can grow both in full sun and in shade ( PFAF, 2020 ). It grows best in areas with an annual temperature of 22-30°C, but can grow in ranges from 10°C to 36°C and it is even reported as tolerating temperatures down to 4°C ( Varadarajan, 1963 ; PFAF, 2020 ). The preferred annual rainfall is in the range of 1500 to 3500 mm, but tolerates 580 to 4500 mm ( Varadarajan, 1963 ; PFAF, 2020 ).
