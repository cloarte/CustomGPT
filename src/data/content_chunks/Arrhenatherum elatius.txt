Tall oatgrass
Gramineae, Poaceae
Arrhenatherum elatius
(L.) Presl

Magness et al. 1971
Tall oatgrass, native to Europe, was brought to the United States earlyin the last century. It is now grown widely in the central and northern states,and in the Pacific Northwest. It is a hardy, upright perennial bunchgrassreaching to 5 feet, with many leaves. The seed head resembles that of oats,hence the name. It tends to grow in bunches and is well adapted to lighttextured soils. It is suitable for pastures and yields a palatable hay. It isfrequently seeded in combination with other grasses and legumes as sweet and red clovers. It is shorter lived than most bunchgrasses.
