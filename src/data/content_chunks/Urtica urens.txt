 Reproduccion: Plants are diploid and have chromosome numbers that vary from 2 n = 24 to 2 n = 26 ( Woodland et al., 1976 ; Corsi et al., 1999 ). The flowers of U. urens are monoecious and wind-pollinated. Pollen release in members of the genus Urtica is unique. Immature stamens are bent towards the centre of the flower. When the anthers mature, the stamens suddenly straighten, shooting pollen into the wind. Plants are cross-pollinated and produce 100-1300 seeds, weighing 0.5 mg each. Seeds are rich in oily endosperm and do not float on water ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Seeds can remain viable for 20-100 years in the soil. Emergence is enhanced by soil disturbance and mostly occurs from within the top 2.5 cm of soil. Only 4% viable seed remained in the soil after 6 years of cultivation, compared with 39% viable seed in undisturbed soil ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Seed germination is optimal at 25°C and decreases rapidly at temperatures below 20°C ( Andersen, 1968 ). Germination is greater in darkness than in light.

Seed germination is optimal at 25°C and decreases rapidly at temperatures below 20°C ( Andersen, 1968 ). Germination is greater in darkness than in light. Most seedlings appear in spring, but emergence continues through to mid-summer. Few plants emerge from late summer to early winter. Plants flower from late spring to autumn and are killed by frost. In China, U. urens has been recorded flowering from May to July and fruiting from August to September ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2017 ). Urtica urens is light-loving and most competitive in full sunlight, whereas the perennial U. dioica is better adapted to shade ( Corre, 1984 ). When drought-stressed, this species flowers several days earlier than normal and the number of nodes with inflorescences drops from eight to four per plant ( Boot et al., 1986 ). Occasionally, it flowers and sets seed when only 8-10 cm tall and before the cotyledonary leaves have dropped off. Several successions of inflorescences are usually found on early emerging plants. Seeds formed early in the season may produce new plants in the same year. Each stinging hair on U. urens is a tapered, elongated cell, constricted just below the tip, with a bulbous base embedded in the multicellular pedestal. At the slightest touch, the tip breaks off and the hair becomes a miniature hypodermic needle that penetrates the skin and injects its irritating chemicals. The tip of the hair is high in silica, but the silica concentration decreases towards the base, where it is replaced by calcium ( Thurston and Lersten, 1969 ).

The tip of the hair is high in silica, but the silica concentration decreases towards the base, where it is replaced by calcium ( Thurston and Lersten, 1969 ). Each hair is 100 µm long and has 10 µg of fluid that contains histamine and acetylcholine. Stem hairs have 2.5 times more acetylcholine than leaf hairs, whereas upper and lower surface leaf hairs have equal concentrations. The leaf itself has nearly as much histamine and acetylcholine as the leaf hairs. Crushed leaves can also give a stinging sensation, but are not as irritating as the hairs. The stinging reaction disappears within 1-3 h for most people, but the hairs can remain in the tissue and cause pain for 24-36 h. Plants are not considered toxic to livestock, but cause the same irritating reaction in all animals ( Everist, 1974 ). Urtica urens is an annual herb ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2017 ). In Europe, U. urens is one of the food plants of the butterflies Aglais urticae and Apion urticarium . In New Zealand, it is a food plant for the New Zealand red admiral butterfly Bassaris gonerilla [ Vanessa gonerilla ], and in Australia and New Zealand, it is food for the yellow admiral butterfly Bassaris itea [ Vanessa itea ]. Urtica urens is frequently found on light-textured soils, especially those rich in organic matter. It responds well to nitrogen and entire plants contain over 5% N. It can be found growing at elevations ranging from near sea level up to 2000 m. It is adapted to grow in extremely dry areas (rainfall less than 100 mm/year) with a dry season lasting 8-12 months (Chileflora, 2005-
