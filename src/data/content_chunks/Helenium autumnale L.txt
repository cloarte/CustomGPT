Plant Notes:  Fall Sneezeweed is a native herbaceous perennial in the Sunflower family (Asteraceae). It occurs statewide in Alabama. Fall Sneezeweed grows along creek and rivers, in low hardwood forests, in roadside ditches, and in low meadows and pastures. It has erect stems from one to four feet in height. The leaves are sessile or clasp the winged stems. The flowers are produced in heads. The ray and disc flowers are yellow. The ray flowers are triangular and notched. Despite its common name, this plant is insect pollinated and does not cause hay fever. The common name comes from the use of dried leaves and flowers as a snuff in the past. Fall Sneezeweed prefers wet or moist soils in full sun. It flowers over a long period of time—from late August until sometimes into November. Fall Sneezeweed is available from several nurseries. It can also be grown from seed. --A. Diamond  ;
