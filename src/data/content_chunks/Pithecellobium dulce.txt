Even more recent introductions (although based on larger numbers of parent trees, e.g. Hughes and Styles (1984) ), sampled only one or two provenances. Limited selection for large pods containing small seeds and red arils has been undertaken in the Philippines to obtain selected clones with sweeter, dry and mealy and less astringent arils ( Sunarjono and Coronel, 1991 ).

ono and Coronel, 1991 ). A variegated mutant has been used as an ornamental pot plant ( Sunarjono and Coronel, 1991 ) and as a garden plant in Hawaii ( Neal, 1965 ). However, it is unlikely that P. dulce , with its very limited commercial potential, will ever be the focus of more intensive genetic improvement. Trees flower when 4-8 years of age, over an extended period of the year, with a peak in the dry season and pods ripen 2-4 months after flowering. Flowers are pollinated by a wide range of generalist insect pollinators, including large and small bees. The seeds remain attached to the pods after they open. Pods often ripen over a long period of the year rather than synchronously over a shorter period. There are approximately ten seeds in each pod ( Brewbaker, 1992 ) and 9000-26,000 seeds/kg (Parrotta, 1991; Stewart et al., 1992 ). Seeds are dispersed by birds attracted by the red pods and sweet fleshy white, pale pink, or occasionally red arils which persist after the pods open. Seeds germinate within 1-2 days and a germination rate of 20-70% can be expected. Pithecellobium dulce is comparatively fast-growing, often being considered intermediate between slow-growing Prosopis and fast-growing Leucaena ( Brewbaker, 1992 ). On most sites, growth rates of <1 m height per year are normal and it may take 40 years to reach full size ( Luna, 1996 ). Trees start to flower and fruit at 4-8 years of age. Flowering and fruiting can occur throughout the year as moisture permits, but usually flowering peaks during the dry season with pods ripening 2-4 months later. Trees are generally evergreen or almost so, even in seasonally dry climates, as leaf fall and flush of new leaves often overlap. Pithecellob

Flowering and fruiting can occur throughout the year as moisture permits, but usually flowering peaks during the dry season with pods ripening 2-4 months later. Trees are generally evergreen or almost so, even in seasonally dry climates, as leaf fall and flush of new leaves often overlap. Pithecellobium dulce is a hardy, nitrogen-fixing tree that tolerates harsh sites, heat and drought and heavy cutting. It can also withstand poor and saline soils ( Brewbaker, 1992 ). Beyond the fact that it does not withstand heavy frost, P. dulce is not exacting in its climatic requirements. It grows well in dry and subhumid areas, but thrives best in dry hot tropical and subtropical climates, with rainfall between 700 and 1800 mm and a 4- to 6-month dry season ( Brewbaker, 1992 ; Luna, 1996 ). It can withstand considerable heat and drought and is naturalized in India in areas with temperature maxima as high as 48°C and annual rainfall as low as 250 mm ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ; Hocking, 1993 ). The species prefers well-drained soil but can tolerate heavy clay soils including black cotton vertisols ( Sunarjono and Coronel, 1991 ). In its native range, P. dulce grows on young superficial, often extremely rocky, shallow and skeletal soils, primarily of volcanic origin in areas where soils have often suffered severe abuse through slash and burn agriculture, desiccation and erosion. It is also found along river banks on alluvial soils and sands. It is known to tolerate moderate salinity in areas with a high brackish water table ( Luna, 1996 ). P. dulce is thus extremely adaptable in terms of both its soil and climatic requirements and is found at altitudes up to 1550 m. In Nicaragua

P. dulce is thus extremely adaptable in terms of both its soil and climatic requirements and is found at altitudes up to 1550 m. In Nicaragua, where it is common, it has been reported at altitudes between 0 and 100 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2016 ), while in Peru, it can be found in disturbed areas at elevations of 0-500 m ( Peru Checklist, 2016 ). In Panama, the species has been reported growing between 0 and 1000 m ( Panama Checklist, 2016 ). Pithecellobium dulce occurs in a wide range of habitats and some of the species with which it is associated are: Prosopis pallida , Bursera sp., Ipomoea sp., Caesalpinia sp. Erythroxylon sp., Haematoxylon brasiletto [ Haematoxylum brasiletto ], Gliricidia sepium , Guaiacum sp., Ficus sp., Celtis iguana , Swietenia humilis , Byrsonima crassifolia , Enterolobium cyclocarpum , Lemaireocereus and Opuntia sp. (Parrotta, 1991). This species is noted to form associations with Rhizobium bacteria ( Brewbaker, 1992 ) and it is widely reported to be nitrogen-fixing with no apparent nodulation problems where introduced ( Allen and Allen, 1981 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology The biological and ecological characteristics of P. dulce have been summarized by Streets (1962) , National Academy of Sciences, USA (1980) , Sunarjono and Coronel (1991) , Parrotta (1991), Brewbaker (1992) , Stewart et al. (1992) , Hocking (1993) and Luna (1996) . Genetics There have been few, if any, attempts to systematically explore, evaluate and improve the genetic material used in the planting of P. dulce . It is likely that currently used seed sources are derived from landrace material comprising, in most areas, an extremely narrow genetic base. Many early introductions are known to be from a single or a few trees. Even more recent introductions (although based on larger numbers of parent trees, e.g. Hughes and Styles (1984) ), sampled only one or two provenances. Limited selection for large pods containing small seeds and red arils has been undertaken in the Philippines to obtain selected clones with sweeter, dry and mealy and less astringent arils ( Sunarjono and Coronel, 1991 ). A variegated mutant has been used as an ornamental pot plant ( Sunarjono and Coronel, 1991 ) and as a garden plant in Hawaii ( Neal, 1965 ). However, it is unlikely that P. dulce , with its very limited commercial potential, will ever be the focus of more intensive genetic improvement. Reproductive Biology Trees flower when 4-8 years of age, over an extended period of the year, with a peak in the dry season and pods ripen 2-4 months after flowering. Flowers are pollinated by a wide range of generalist

 However, it is unlikely that P. dulce , with its very limited commercial potential, will ever be the focus of more intensive genetic improvement. Reproductive Biology Trees flower when 4-8 years of age, over an extended period of the year, with a peak in the dry season and pods ripen 2-4 months after flowering. Flowers are pollinated by a wide range of generalist insect pollinators, including large and small bees. The seeds remain attached to the pods after they open. Pods often ripen over a long period of the year rather than synchronously over a shorter period. There are approximately ten seeds in each pod ( Brewbaker, 1992 ) and 9000-26,000 seeds/kg (Parrotta, 1991; Stewart et al., 1992 ). Seeds are dispersed by birds attracted by the red pods and sweet fleshy white, pale pink, or occasionally red arils which persist after the pods open. Seeds germinate within 1-2 days and a germination rate of 20-70% can be expected. Physiology and Phenology Pithecellobium dulce is comparatively fast-growing, often being considered intermediate between slow-growing Prosopis and fast-growing Leucaena ( Brewbaker, 1992 ). On most sites, growth rates of <1 m height per year are normal and it may take 40 years to reach full size ( Luna, 1996 ). Trees start to flower and fruit at 4-8 years of age. Flowering and fruiting can occur throughout the year as moisture permits, but usually flowering peaks during the dry season with pods ripening 2-4 months later. Trees are generally evergreen or almost so, even in seasonally dry climates, as leaf fall and flush of new leaves often overlap. Environmental Requirements Pithecellobium dulce is a hardy, nitrogen-fixing tree that tolerates harsh sites, heat and drought and heavy cutting. It can also withstand poor and saline

 the dry season with pods ripening 2-4 months later. Trees are generally evergreen or almost so, even in seasonally dry climates, as leaf fall and flush of new leaves often overlap. Environmental Requirements Pithecellobium dulce is a hardy, nitrogen-fixing tree that tolerates harsh sites, heat and drought and heavy cutting. It can also withstand poor and saline soils ( Brewbaker, 1992 ). Beyond the fact that it does not withstand heavy frost, P. dulce is not exacting in its climatic requirements. It grows well in dry and subhumid areas, but thrives best in dry hot tropical and subtropical climates, with rainfall between 700 and 1800 mm and a 4- to 6-month dry season ( Brewbaker, 1992 ; Luna, 1996 ). It can withstand considerable heat and drought and is naturalized in India in areas with temperature maxima as high as 48°C and annual rainfall as low as 250 mm ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ; Hocking, 1993 ). The species prefers well-drained soil but can tolerate heavy clay soils including black cotton vertisols ( Sunarjono and Coronel, 1991 ). In its native range, P. dulce grows on young superficial, often extremely rocky, shallow and skeletal soils, primarily of volcanic origin in areas where soils have often suffered severe abuse through slash and burn agriculture, desiccation and erosion. It is also found along river banks on alluvial soils and sands. It is known to tolerate moderate salinity in areas with a high brackish water table ( Luna, 1996 ). P. dulce is thus extremely adaptable in terms of both its soil and climatic requirements and is found at altitudes up to 1550 m. In Nicaragua, where it is common, it has been reported at altitudes between 0 and 100 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2016 ), while in Peru, it can be found

 a high brackish water table ( Luna, 1996 ). P. dulce is thus extremely adaptable in terms of both its soil and climatic requirements and is found at altitudes up to 1550 m. In Nicaragua, where it is common, it has been reported at altitudes between 0 and 100 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2016 ), while in Peru, it can be found in disturbed areas at elevations of 0-500 m ( Peru Checklist, 2016 ). In Panama, the species has been reported growing between 0 and 1000 m ( Panama Checklist, 2016 ). Associations Pithecellobium dulce occurs in a wide range of habitats and some of the species with which it is associated are: Prosopis pallida , Bursera sp., Ipomoea sp., Caesalpinia sp. Erythroxylon sp., Haematoxylon brasiletto [ Haematoxylum brasiletto ], Gliricidia sepium , Guaiacum sp., Ficus sp., Celtis iguana , Swietenia humilis , Byrsonima crassifolia , Enterolobium cyclocarpum , Lemaireocereus and Opuntia sp. (Parrotta, 1991). This species is noted to form associations with Rhizobium bacteria ( Brewbaker, 1992 ) and it is widely reported to be nitrogen-fixing with no apparent nodulation problems where introduced ( Allen and Allen, 1981 ).
