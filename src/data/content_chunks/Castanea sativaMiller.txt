Castanea sativaMiller - Sweet Chestnut  -Fagaceae© Alan Hill© Alan Hill© Alan Hill(Map updated: March 2008)This is the tree which yields the edible chestnut, as opposed to the unrelated horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). It is not a native but has been grown in Ireland for many centuries. The tree is also sometimes called the Spanish chestnut, a reference to the fact that Spain is one of the older sources of imported 'nuts' (seeds).Probably all the trees in Northern Ireland are planted individuals; most are found in demesne woodland. There is no evidence of this species producing self-sown trees in the region.All names:Castanea sativaMiller;Castanea castanea(L.)
