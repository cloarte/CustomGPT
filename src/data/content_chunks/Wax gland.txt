Wax glandWax producing organsWax glands are normally clustered cells sometimes encircled by a rim, in which case they are called wax plates or wax gland plates.
Marginal wax glandsMarginalwax glands are typically symmetrically located on on the right and left margins of all or mostabdominalsegments. They may also be located on thethorax.The arrows point to marginal wax glands, with one of them circled to highlight it.Marginal wax glandsAlthough usually clustered in groups, sometimes wax glands are found singly or arrayed in a line.These wax glands encircle the entire body of the aphidCerataphis brasiliensis. They are located all around the margins of this flattened species.Marginal and spinal wax glandsSome aphids have bothmarginalandspinalwax glands.Here the spinal wax glands are pointed to with white arrows, the marginal glands with black arrows.Caudal wax glandIn rare cases, wax glands can be found in other locations.Here the wax gland is located in theanalregion of theabdomenofGreenidea psidii.
