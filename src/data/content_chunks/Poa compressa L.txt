Canada bluegrass

Poa compressa

Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This grass, like Kentucky bluegrass, is native to Europe but is extensivelynaturalized in Northern States. The foliage is a distinctive bluegreen in color. It spreads by underground rhizomes. It is adapted to open, rather poor, dry soils and under these conditions may be better than Kentucky blue for pastures or lawns. Forage is highly palatable and nutritions. Seed production is good, and propagation is by seeding.
