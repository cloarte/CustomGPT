 Reproduccion: Genetics Cuscuta europaea is a diploid with chromosome number 2n=14 ( García and Castroviejo, 2003 ; Guerra and García, 2004 ). Chromosomes are holocentric, lacking localized centromeres as all the other species of subgenus Cuscuta ( Ibiapino et al., 2022 ). Oliveira et al. (2020) showed that the spindle attachment sites are not correlated with the discrete distribution of the histone variant CENH3 along the chromosomes suggesting a CENH3-free mechanism of kinetochore positioning. Cuscuta europaea has satellite-rich heterochromatic genome regions resulting in heterochromatic bands along the chromosomes. Vondrak et al. (2021) used ultra-long read sequencing techniques to investigate the complex internal structure of these regions. The chloroplast genome of C. europaea is much reduced (approximately 98,000 base pairs) compared to green relatives and lacking one of the inverted repeats ( Pan et al., 2023 ). García and Martín (2007) found almost identical ITS sequences from individuals of India and Europe suggesting a low genetic diversity in the species range and supported by the low morphological variation.

The species has not been reported as a parental for species of hybrid origin in the genus. Reproductive Biology Cuscuta species are propagated mainly by seed, though individual plants may spread vegetatively over many separate host plants. Stem fragments may also be able to establish new plants, though it is not known whether this can occur with C. europaea . Wright et al. (2012) surveyed the diversity of pollen and ovule production in 128 species of Cuscuta and found a relation Pollen/Ovule of 232.6 for a specimen of C. europaea from Finland. It was assigned to category 3 of Cruden's (1977) mating system, suggesting that the species has facultative autogamous flowers. Low P/O ratios are characteristic of species of disturbed habitats in agreement with the ecology of C. europaea . Plitmann (1991) found a P/O of 409.1 for individuals from Lebanon and Turkey indicating that pollen production is a variable feature in C. europaea . Physiology and Phenology Cuscuta species are obligate parasites with negligible chlorophyll, totally dependent on attachment to a host plant within a few days after germination. Germination does not depend on the presence of host plants but occurs over a prolonged period as there is a proportion of hard-coated seeds which gradually become permeable and allow absorption of water. This ensures that not too many seeds germinate at one time in the possible absence of a potential host plant. In many species, there is also an innate dormancy which is broken by chilling over the winter. In eastern Lithuania, germination of C. europaea was shown

This ensures that not too many seeds germinate at one time in the possible absence of a potential host plant. In many species, there is also an innate dormancy which is broken by chilling over the winter. In eastern Lithuania, germination of C. europaea was shown to be abundant after rain at the end of May and beginning of June ( Gal'vidis, 1993 ). The length of the seedling rarely exceeds 10 cm and if a host is not located, the seedling dies within a few days. Once contact with a stem or other object is made, the shoot will twine around it, whether living or inanimate and the root and shoot base below this point will soon die. The coiling action requires blue or far-red light and is suppressed under red light or darkness. If a suitable host stem is found, several coils will develop, with pre-haustorial swellings on the inner face of the coiled stem, from which full haustoria develop in the presence of cytokinins, which derive partly from the parasite and partly from the host. Intrusive organs develop from the haustorium and searching hyphae penetrate the host tissues by a combination of separation and penetration of cells (these processes are reviewed by Parker and Riches, 1993 ). Connections are then formed by a bridge of tracheids with the host xylem, while connection with the phloem via plasmodesmata between searching hyphae and host parenchyma cells has also been confirmed by Dörr (1987) . Once the haustorial connection is complete, new flower and shoot buds develop close by. Fritsche et al. (1958) provide detailed observations on the growth and flowering of C. europaea .

(1958) provide detailed observations on the growth and flowering of C. europaea . Environmental Requirements Cuscuta europaea grows better under sunny and warm conditions tolerating climates with wet summers contrary to other species that prefer dry summers. It is found on hosts growing mostly on wet and nitrophilous soils requiring moist soil to germinate. The mainly temperate distribution of C. europaea suggests that this species is dependent on a cool or cold winter period for 'stratification' and breakage of seed dormancy. Summer temperature is important in the distribution of the species in N Europe ( Verdcourt, 1947 ).

In eastern Lithuania, germination of C. europaea was shown to be abundant after rain at the end of May and beginning of June ( Gal'vidis, 1993 ). The length of the seedling rarely exceeds 10 cm and if a host is not located, the seedling dies within a few days. Once contact with a stem or other object is made, the shoot will twine around it, whether living or inanimate and the root and shoot base below this point will soon die. The coiling action requires blue or far-red light and is suppressed under red light or darkness. If a suitable host stem is found, several coils will develop, with pre-haustorial swellings on the inner face of the coiled stem, from which full haustoria develop in the presence of cytokinins, which derive partly from the parasite and partly from the host. Intrusive organs develop from the haustorium and searching hyphae penetrate the host tissues by a combination of separation and penetration of cells (these processes are reviewed by Parker and Riches, 1993 ). Connections are then formed by a bridge of tracheids with the host xylem, while connection with the phloem via plasmodesmata between searching hyphae and host parenchyma cells has also been confirmed by Dörr (1987) .

(1958) provide detailed observations on the growth and flowering of C. europaea . Environmental Requirements Cuscuta europaea grows better under sunny and warm conditions tolerating climates with wet summers contrary to other species that prefer dry summers. It is found on hosts growing mostly on wet and nitrophilous soils requiring moist soil to germinate. The mainly temperate distribution of C. europaea suggests that this species is dependent on a cool or cold winter period for 'stratification' and breakage of seed dormancy. Summer temperature is important in the distribution of the species in N Europe ( Verdcourt, 1947 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics Cuscuta europaea is a diploid with chromosome number 2n=14 ( García and Castroviejo, 2003 ; Guerra and García, 2004 ). Chromosomes are holocentric, lacking localized centromeres as all the other species of subgenus Cuscuta ( Ibiapino et al., 2022 ). Oliveira et al. (2020) showed that the spindle attachment sites are not correlated with the discrete distribution of the histone variant CENH3 along the chromosomes suggesting a CENH3-free mechanism of kinetochore positioning. Cuscuta europaea has satellite-rich heterochromatic genome regions resulting in heterochromatic bands along the chromosomes. Vondrak et al. (2021) used ultra-long read sequencing techniques to investigate the complex internal structure of these regions. The chloroplast

H3 along the chromosomes suggesting a CENH3-free mechanism of kinetochore positioning. Cuscuta europaea has satellite-rich heterochromatic genome regions resulting in heterochromatic bands along the chromosomes. Vondrak et al. (2021) used ultra-long read sequencing techniques to investigate the complex internal structure of these regions. The chloroplast genome of C. europaea is much reduced (approximately 98,000 base pairs) compared to green relatives and lacking one of the inverted repeats ( Pan et al., 2023 ). García and Martín (2007) found almost identical ITS sequences from individuals of India and Europe suggesting a low genetic diversity in the species range and supported by the low morphological variation. The species has not been reported as a parental for species of hybrid origin in the genus. Reproductive Biology Cuscuta species are propagated mainly by seed, though individual plants may spread vegetatively over many separate host plants. Stem fragments may also be able to establish new plants, though it is not known whether this can occur with C. europaea . Wright et al. (2012) surveyed the diversity of pollen and ovule production in 128 species of Cuscuta and found a relation Pollen/Ovule of 232.6 for a specimen of C. europaea from Finland. It was assigned to category 3 of Cruden's (1977) mating system, suggesting that the species has facultative autogamous flowers. Low P/O ratios are characteristic of species of disturbed habitats in agreement with the ecology of C. europaea . Plitmann (1991) found a P/O of 409.1 for individuals from Lebanon and Turkey indicating that pollen production is a variable feature in C. europaea .

 with the ecology of C. europaea . Plitmann (1991) found a P/O of 409.1 for individuals from Lebanon and Turkey indicating that pollen production is a variable feature in C. europaea . Physiology and Phenology Cuscuta species are obligate parasites with negligible chlorophyll, totally dependent on attachment to a host plant within a few days after germination. Germination does not depend on the presence of host plants but occurs over a prolonged period as there is a proportion of hard-coated seeds which gradually become permeable and allow absorption of water. This ensures that not too many seeds germinate at one time in the possible absence of a potential host plant. In many species, there is also an innate dormancy which is broken by chilling over the winter. In eastern Lithuania, germination of C. europaea was shown to be abundant after rain at the end of May and beginning of June ( Gal'vidis, 1993 ).
