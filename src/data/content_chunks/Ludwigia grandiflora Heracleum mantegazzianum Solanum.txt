EPPO Training course on the EPPO Prioritization process for invasive alien plants Paris, EPPO Headquarters, 2013-03-12/14 EPPO organized a training course on the EPPO prioritization process for invasive alien plants attended by 11 participants from 9 countries. The training course consisted of general presentations spread over the 2 first days on the following topics: EPPO activities on Pest Risk Analysis; Definitions and concepts related to biological invasions; EPPO Standard on the Prioritization process for invasive alien plants; Applications  of the prioritization process in different countries (in particular in France) including its comparison with other methods; Insights on uncertainties when performing prioritization assessments. Participants - View more pictures Participants had the opportunity to test the process for the invasive alien plants Ludwigia grandiflora, Heracleum mantegazzianum and Solanum elaeagnifolium during the course using the CAPRA software which provides a computer version of the prioritization process, and to discuss differences between assessments. Remarks and guidance were provided to each participant on their individual assessments for these species. Participants also assessed individually or in groups three species of concern for their country that they had selected and collected information on prior to the meeting. Participants had the opportunity to present the outcomes of their assessments to the other participants and to provide recommendations on how to improve the process and its computer version. The participants also shared experience on how to use the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Niche Model . The participants were also presented other EPPO standards and publications relevant to invasive alien plants: the National Regulatory Control Measures, the EPPO Reporting Service, and the EPPO Bulletin. Presentations The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) and Pest Risk Analysis Ms Brunel (EPPO) Underlying definitions and concepts related to biological invasions Mr Brundu, University of Sassari (IT) The EPPO
