 Habitat: Managed forests, plantations and orchards, Protected agriculture (e.g. glasshouse production), Wetlands, Riverbanks, Lakes, Rivers / streams, Ponds
 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for I. aquatica is 2 n = 30 ( Westphal, 1992 ). Some partial DNA sequences have been determined for this species, as listed in the Genbank database (see list in Atlas of Living Australia, 2018 ). For further information on chromosome counts, see Missouri Botanical Garden (2018) . A number of cultivars is reported for I. aquatica ( Snyder et al., 1981 ). Two main wild biotypes are reported throughout South East Asia ( Cornelis et al., 1985 ; Westphal, 1992 ). The first, known as ‘Red’, has green/purple stems, dark green leaves with sometimes purple petioles and veins, and light purple to white flowers; the second, known as ‘White’, has green/white stems, green leaves with green/white petioles and white flowers. Vegetative multiplication is very important in the propagation of I. aquatica , by the stems rooting at nodes and also by stolons ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ; Schardt and Schmitz, 1990 ). Roots are produced at stem nodes that come in contact with water or moist soil. New plants can root within a week ( Satpathy, 1964 ). Once roots are established, the plant grows as a trailing vine. Stems that have grown out over water have round, hollow stems and petiolate, basally lobed leaves. Reproduction is also by seed, mostly during the dry season, when it grows on temporary flooded land.

pathy, 1964 ). Once roots are established, the plant grows as a trailing vine. Stems that have grown out over water have round, hollow stems and petiolate, basally lobed leaves. Reproduction is also by seed, mostly during the dry season, when it grows on temporary flooded land. Fresh, mature seeds display primary dormancy within 15 days after harvest. Natural germination occurs following an after-ripening period and scarification of the seed coat. Dormancy can be broken by various methods of scarification, such as naturally occurring abrasion by soil particles, prolonged microbial attack or ingestion by animals ( Datta and Biswas, 1970 ). Germination rates of I. aquatica seeds are usually less than 60%, with black-seeded types showing higher germination rates than light-coloured seeds. Two to three weeks after sowing, the plants start developing strong lateral branches. After this, the main axis and both lateral branches produce about one leaf every 2-3 days. Flowering starts 48-63 days after sowing ( Westphal, 1992 ). Although flowering and fruiting in India occur during the rainy season, generally flowering is observed throughout the year ( Flora of Pakistan, 2018 ; India Biodiversity Portal, 2018 ). Under good conditions, I. aquatica can produce 190,000 kg fresh weight biomass per ha in 9 months. It flowers in the warm months and produces 175-245 seeds per plant during the peak season (Langeland and Burks, 1998). Ipomoea aquatica can behave as an aquatic, semi-aquatic or as a terrestrial plant with reduced leaves and stems in dry months. When soil moisture is lacking, it may appear to be in hibernation ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Under dry land conditions, I. aquatica will grow as an erect herb ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). It can then become an annual plant, when the dry conditions do not allow its survival

 semi-aquatic or as a terrestrial plant with reduced leaves and stems in dry months. When soil moisture is lacking, it may appear to be in hibernation ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Under dry land conditions, I. aquatica will grow as an erect herb ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). It can then become an annual plant, when the dry conditions do not allow its survival. Annual production of I. aquatica in Hong Kong has been estimated at 3-5 million kg ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). When grown as a crop, yields of up to 100,000 kg/ha have been reported in Hong Kong ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). Similar yields were reported in field trials in south Florida ( Snyder et al., 1981 ). Under optimum conditions, it can grow up to 16 cm per day ( Gilbert, 1984 ). Under upland cultivation, yields range from 7 to 30 tonnes/ha of fresh produce per crop. Under wet cultivation, annual yields are estimated to be from 24 to 100 tonnes/ha. Annual production of I. aquatica in Thailand is reported to be 90 tonnes/ha. In Malaysia, the species is cultivated commercially on 600-1100 ha with a total production of 60,000-220,000 tonnes/year. The submerged components of I. aquatica show some resistance to adverse conditions, ensuring perpetuation of the species when favourable conditions return. Nitrogen and phosphorus are important growth factors in this species. I. aquatica shows a high absorption capacity for ammonium-nitrogen. Potassium and calcium were relatively high, whereas magnesium and sodium were low in the habitats studied ( Chin and Fong, 1978 ). Ipomoea aquatica grows as a perennial in humid sub-tropical and tropical climates and as an annual in drier, much cooler climates. Plants are damaged at temperatures below 10°C ( Iplantz, 2023 ).

Ipomoea aquatica grows as a perennial in humid sub-tropical and tropical climates and as an annual in drier, much cooler climates. Plants are damaged at temperatures below 10°C ( Iplantz, 2023 ). Ipomoea aquatica is adapted to a warm, moist climate and is confined to the tropics and to subtropical zones; it cannot survive frost ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ). It grows poorly when temperatures are below 23.9°C ( Harwood and Sytsma, 2003 ). Ipomoea aquatica is thought to be a quantitative short-day plant. It produces optimum yields in the lowland humid tropics that have stable high temperatures and short-day conditions. Optimum growth occurs in full sunlight. Marshy lands and waterlogged soils are ideal for its growth. Shallow ponds, ditches, peripheries of deep ponds, tanks and slopes of wet soils are also suitable. It is adapted to a wide range of soil conditions, with clay soils (heavy or silty) being generally suitable. Soils with a high percentage of organic matter are preferred. The optimum pH range for growth is 5.3-8.5 ( Tiwari and Chandra, 1985 ; Westphal, 1992 ). Low temperature, shade and salinity are limiting factors for growth of I. aquatica . It grows poorly in cold weather but can tolerate light frost that affects only the outer leaves ( Snyder et al., 1981 ). The seeds can withstand some freezing ( Gilbert, 1984 ). Huang (1981) observed that it does not grow at day/night temperatures below 20°/15°C. It has low shade tolerance: plants grown in the shade are weak and thin (Tiwara and Chandra, 1985).

 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: Managed forests, plantations and orchards, Protected agriculture (e.g. glasshouse production), Wetlands, Riverbanks, Lakes, Rivers / streams, Ponds
 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for I. aquatica is 2 n = 30 ( Westphal, 1992 ). Some partial DNA sequences have been determined for this species, as listed in the Genbank database (see list in Atlas of Living Australia, 2018 ). For further information on chromosome counts, see Missouri Botanical Garden (2018) . A number of cultivars is reported for I. aquatica ( Snyder et al., 1981 ). Two main wild biotypes are reported throughout South East Asia ( Cornelis et al., 1985 ; Westphal, 1992 ). The first, known as ‘Red’, has green/purple stems, dark green leaves with sometimes purple petioles and veins, and light purple to white flowers; the second, known as ‘White’, has green/white stems, green leaves with green/white petioles and white flowers. Vegetative multiplication is very important in the propagation of I. aquatica , by the stems rooting at nodes and also by stolons ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ; Schardt and Schmitz, 1990 ). Roots are produced at stem nodes that come in contact with water or moist soil. New plants can root within a week ( Satpathy, 1964 ). Once roots are established, the plant grows as a trailing vine. Stems that have grown out over water have round, hollow stems and petiolate, basally lobed leaves. Reproduction is also by seed, mostly during the dry season, when it grows on temporary flooded land. Fresh, mature seeds display primary dormancy within 15 days after harvest. Natural germination occurs

pathy, 1964 ). Once roots are established, the plant grows as a trailing vine. Stems that have grown out over water have round, hollow stems and petiolate, basally lobed leaves. Reproduction is also by seed, mostly during the dry season, when it grows on temporary flooded land. Fresh, mature seeds display primary dormancy within 15 days after harvest. Natural germination occurs following an after-ripening period and scarification of the seed coat. Dormancy can be broken by various methods of scarification, such as naturally occurring abrasion by soil particles, prolonged microbial attack or ingestion by animals ( Datta and Biswas, 1970 ). Germination rates of I. aquatica seeds are usually less than 60%, with black-seeded types showing higher germination rates than light-coloured seeds. Two to three weeks after sowing, the plants start developing strong lateral branches. After this, the main axis and both lateral branches produce about one leaf every 2-3 days. Flowering starts 48-63 days after sowing ( Westphal, 1992 ). Although flowering and fruiting in India occur during the rainy season, generally flowering is observed throughout the year ( Flora of Pakistan, 2018 ; India Biodiversity Portal, 2018 ). Under good conditions, I. aquatica can produce 190,000 kg fresh weight biomass per ha in 9 months. It flowers in the warm months and produces 175-245 seeds per plant during the peak season (Langeland and Burks, 1998). Ipomoea aquatica can behave as an aquatic, semi-aquatic or as a terrestrial plant with reduced leaves and stems in dry months. When soil moisture is lacking, it may appear to be in hibernation ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Under dry land conditions, I. aquatica will grow as an erect herb ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). It can then become an annual plant, when the dry conditions do not allow its survival

 semi-aquatic or as a terrestrial plant with reduced leaves and stems in dry months. When soil moisture is lacking, it may appear to be in hibernation ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Under dry land conditions, I. aquatica will grow as an erect herb ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). It can then become an annual plant, when the dry conditions do not allow its survival. Annual production of I. aquatica in Hong Kong has been estimated at 3-5 million kg ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). When grown as a crop, yields of up to 100,000 kg/ha have been reported in Hong Kong ( Edie and Ho, 1969 ). Similar yields were reported in field trials in south Florida ( Snyder et al., 1981 ). Under optimum conditions, it can grow up to 16 cm per day ( Gilbert, 1984 ). Under upland cultivation, yields range from 7 to 30 tonnes/ha of fresh produce per crop. Under wet cultivation, annual yields are estimated to be from 24 to 100 tonnes/ha. Annual production of I. aquatica in Thailand is reported to be 90 tonnes/ha. In Malaysia, the species is cultivated commercially on 600-1100 ha with a total production of 60,000-220,000 tonnes/year. The submerged components of I. aquatica show some resistance to adverse conditions, ensuring perpetuation of the species when favourable conditions return. Nitrogen and phosphorus are important growth factors in this species. I. aquatica shows a high absorption capacity for ammonium-nitrogen. Potassium and calcium were relatively high, whereas magnesium and sodium were low in the habitats studied ( Chin and Fong, 1978 ). Ipomoea aquatica grows as a perennial in humid sub-tropical and tropical climates and as an annual in drier, much cooler climates. Plants are damaged at temperatures below 10°C ( Iplantz, 2023 ).

Ipomoea aquatica grows as a perennial in humid sub-tropical and tropical climates and as an annual in drier, much cooler climates. Plants are damaged at temperatures below 10°C ( Iplantz, 2023 ). Ipomoea aquatica is adapted to a warm, moist climate and is confined to the tropics and to subtropical zones; it cannot survive frost ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ). It grows poorly when temperatures are below 23.9°C ( Harwood and Sytsma, 2003 ). Ipomoea aquatica is thought to be a quantitative short-day plant. It produces optimum yields in the lowland humid tropics that have stable high temperatures and short-day conditions. Optimum growth occurs in full sunlight. Marshy lands and waterlogged soils are ideal for its growth. Shallow ponds, ditches, peripheries of deep ponds, tanks and slopes of wet soils are also suitable. It is adapted to a wide range of soil conditions, with clay soils (heavy or silty) being generally suitable. Soils with a high percentage of organic matter are preferred. The optimum pH range for growth is 5.3-8.5 ( Tiwari and Chandra, 1985 ; Westphal, 1992 ). Low temperature, shade and salinity are limiting factors for growth of I. aquatica . It grows poorly in cold weather but can tolerate light frost that affects only the outer leaves ( Snyder et al., 1981 ). The seeds can withstand some freezing ( Gilbert, 1984 ). Huang (1981) observed that it does not grow at day/night temperatures below 20°/15°C. It has low shade tolerance: plants grown in the shade are weak and thin (Tiwara and Chandra, 1985). I. aquatica is not tolerant of brackish or salt water ( Backer and Br
