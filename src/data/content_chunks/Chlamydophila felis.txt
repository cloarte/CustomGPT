On the day the IFA procedure is conducted, dilute the Anti-mouse FITC 
Conjugate with DPBS to its previously determined optimal working 
concentration. 
 
3.4   Preparation of the sample 
 
3.4.1   The initial test of a Test Vaccine will be with a single vial (a single sample 
from 1 vial). On the day of inoculation, using a sterile 1.0-mL syringe and an 18-
gauge x 1 1/2-inch needle, rehydrate a vial of the Test Vaccine by transferring 1.0 
mL for 1-mL-dose vaccines, 0.5 mL for 1/2-mL-dose vaccines, etc., of the 
provided diluent into the vial containing the lyophilized Test Vaccine; mix by 
vortexing. Incubate for 15 ± 5 minutes at room temperature. 
  
3.4.2   For multifraction feline “C. psittaci” vaccines (C. felis vaccines), 
neutralize the nonchlamydophila fractions with antiserum specific to each virus 
fraction. 
 
1.   Prepare dilutions of each neutralizing Monospecific Antiserum 
(nonchlamydophila) according to the CVB Reagent Data Sheet or the

2.   With a 200-µL pipettor and a different tip, dispense 200 µL of each 
Monospecific Antiserum into a 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube, labeled 10-1. 
For example, to neutralize the 3 viral fractions of a feline Chlamydophila 
felis/FVR/FCV/FPV vaccine, dispense 200 µL of each of the FVR, FCV, 
and FPV working dilution antisera into the tube labeled 10-1; add 1.2 mL 
of Chlamydophila Diluent to obtain a final volume of 1.8 mL. 
 
3.   Pipette 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to the labeled tube to 
yield a 10-1 dilution; mix by vortexing.  
 
4.   Incubate at 36°± 2°C for 30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For Test Vaccines containing only a feline chlamydophila fraction, 
prepare the 10-1 dilution by adding 200 µL of the Test Vaccine to 1.8 mL of  
Chlamydophila Diluent in a 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube, labeled 10-1; mix by

10-2 dilution of Test Vaccine = 8/8 wells IFA positive 
10-3 dilution of Test Vaccine = 5/8 wells IFA positive 
10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 1/8 wells IFA positive 
10-5 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/8 wells IFA positive

 Test Vaccine = 1/8 wells IFA positive 
10-5 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/8 wells IFA positive 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (X - d/2 + [d ● S]) where: 
 
X = reciprocal log10 of highest dilution with all wells IFA positive(2) 
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) 
S = sum of proportions of wells IFA positive for all dilutions tested starting at X:

8 +  8 +  8 +  8 =    8 = 1.75 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (2 – 1/2) + (1 ● 1.75) = 3.25 
 
Adjust the titer to the recommended Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A.  divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose 
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for this C. felis 
Test Vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL) 
 
Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine added to each well of the Test Plate 
(for this C. felis Test Vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.1 mL) 
 
  1 mL dose  
  0.1 mL = 10 
 
B.  calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine titer as illustrated below: 
 
 Log of 10 = 1.0 
 
Test Vaccine Titer = 3.25 + 1.0 = 4.25

5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   For a valid assay 
 
5.1.1   The Cell Culture Controls shall not exhibit intracytoplasmic fluorescent 
inclusions, significant degradation of the cell sheet, CPE, or cloudy media that 
would indicate contamination. 
 
5.1.2   The calculated FAID50 titer of the Chlamydophila Positive Control must 
fall within plus or minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as 
established by a minimum of 10 previously determined chlamydophila titrations. 
 
5.1.3   The lowest inoculated dilution of the Positive Control must induce specific 
IFA in 100% of the wells (8/8). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are 
IFA positive at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as “greater than or

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lamydophila titrations. 
 
5.1.3   The lowest inoculated dilution of the Positive Control must induce specific 
IFA in 100% of the wells (8/8). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are 
IFA positive at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as “greater than or 
equal to” the calculated titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, the highest (most 
dilute) must exhibit no IFA staining (0/8). 
 
5.1.4   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO 
TEST and can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.2   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is equal to or greater than the titer 
specified in the APHIS filed Outline of Production, the Test Vaccine is considered 
SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is lower than the titer specified in 
the APHIS filed Outline of Production, the Test Vaccine shall be retested in accordance 
with the 9 CFR, Part 113.8(b).

1.  Introduction 
 
This Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) describes a titration method for assaying live cell 
culture-adapted Chlamydophila felis (formerly feline Chlamydia psittaci) vaccines for potency. 
The method uses a McCoy cell line as the test system. The presence or absence of the 
chlamydophila agent is determined by staining inoculated cell cultures by an indirect fluorescent 
antibody (IFA) method using a monoclonal antibody (MAb)

On the day the IFA procedure is conducted, dilute the Anti-mouse FITC 
Conjugate with DPBS to its previously determined optimal working 
concentration. 
 
3.4   Preparation of the sample 
 
3.4.1   The initial test of a Test Vaccine will be with a single vial (a single sample 
from 1 vial). On the day of inoculation, using a sterile 1.0-mL syringe and an 18-
gauge x 1 1/2-inch needle, rehydrate a vial of the Test Vaccine by transferring 1.0 
mL for 1-mL-dose vaccines, 0.5 mL for 1/2-mL-dose vaccines, etc., of the 
provided diluent into the vial containing the lyophilized Test Vaccine; mix by 
vortexing. Incubate for 15 ± 5 minutes at room temperature. 
  
3.4.2   For multifraction feline “C. psittaci” vaccines (C. felis vaccines), 
neutralize the nonchlamydophila fractions with antiserum specific to each virus 
fraction.

Chlamydophila Positive Control dilutions (dilutions 10-3 through 10-7 for the example in 
Section 3.3.2(2)). Change tips between each unique sample (e.g., each Test Vaccine and 
the Chlamydophila Positive Control), but tip changes are not necessary between each 
dilution in a series if pipetting from the most dilute to the most concentrated within that 
series (e.g., 10-7 through 10-3) (Appendices I and II).   
 
4.3   Dispense 100 µL of Chlamydophila Diluent to each of 8 wells which serve as 
uninoculated cell culture controls (Cell Culture Controls) (Appendices I and II). 
 
4.4   Seal each McCoy Plate by placing around the upper side of each plate sufficient 
1/2-inch labeling tape to maintain the plate’s lid in place.

30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
4.13   Decant the MAb; wash the cells twice by pipetting and decanting 200 µL/well of 
DPBS. The first wash is decanted immediately after delivering the DPBS, whereas the 
second wash is allowed to remain for 10 ± 5 minutes before decanting. Decant and blot 
the plate.  
 
4.14   Pipette 90 ± 10 µL of the Working Anti-mouse FITC Conjugate into each well of 
the McCoy Plates.  
 
4.15   Incubate the McCoy Plates in a high humidity aerobic incubator at 36°± 2°C for 
30 ± 5 minutes.

5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   For a valid assay 
 
5.1.1   The Cell Culture Controls shall not exhibit intracytoplasmic fluorescent 
inclusions, significant degradation of the cell sheet, CPE, or cloudy media that 
would indicate contamination. 
 
5.1.2   The calculated FAID50 titer of the Chlamydophila Positive Control must 
fall within plus or minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as 
established by a minimum of 10 previously determined chlamydophila titrations. 
 
5.1.3   The lowest inoculated dilution of the Positive Control must induce specific 
IFA in 100% of the wells (8/8). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are 
IFA positive at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as “greater than or

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lamydophila titrations. 
 
5.1.3   The lowest inoculated dilution of the Positive Control must induce specific 
IFA in 100% of the wells (8/8). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are 
IFA positive at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as “greater than or 
equal to” the calculated titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, the highest (most 
dilute) must exhibit no IFA staining (0/8). 
 
5.1.4   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO 
TEST and can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.2   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is equal to or greater than the titer 
specified in the APHIS filed Outline of Production, the Test Vaccine is considered 
SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is lower than the titer specified in 
the APHIS filed Outline of Production, the Test Vaccine shall be retested in accordance 
with the 9 CFR, Part 113.8(b).
