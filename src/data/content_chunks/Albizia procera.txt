Uses
Tree cultivated for shade and timber.  Wood rather similar to
Albizia
lebbeck
but lighter and softer (sp. gra. 0.60 air dry weight of sapwood ca
460 kg/m
3
of heartwood 640 kg/m
3
).  The heartwood is durable even in exposed
situtations.  It can be worked to a good surface that polishes well.  Wood is
used chiefly for construction, furniture, carts and carriages, cane crushers,
carvings, boats and oars, rice pounders, and, of course, fuel.  In Australia,
the tree is reagarded as a good cattle feed and as a sign of good country for
farming sugarcane.  Leaves said to be insecticidal (Kirtikar and Basu, 1975).
Bark used for fish poison. The tree yields a reddish-brown gum.
Folk Medicine
Leaves are poulticed onto ulcers in India.  Bark considered useful in
pregnancy and stomachache.  Bark given with salt as a medicine for water
buffalo.
Chemistry
Bark, leaf, and root contain saponin.  Hydrolysis of the saponin yields
machaerinic acid.  Tree contains some HCN.  Leaf and fruit have given positive
tests for haemolysis.  A new pent

Chemistry
Bark, leaf, and root contain saponin.  Hydrolysis of the saponin yields
machaerinic acid.  Tree contains some HCN.  Leaf and fruit have given positive
tests for haemolysis.  A new pentacyclic triterpenic acid, procera acid, was
isolated from the seed (List & Horhammer, 1969–1979).  The gum contains
aldobiuronic acid and the disaccharide 3-0-D-galactopyranosyl-L-arabinose.
Degraded gum from
Albizia procera
contains D-galactose, D-mannose,
D-glucuronic acid, and 4-0-mehtyl-D-glucuronic acid.  Complete methylation and
subsequent hydrolysis of the product afford 2,4-di-0-methyl-D-galactose (3
moles), 3,4,6-tri-0-methyl-L-arabinose.  Perceragenin C

Description
An erect, slightly pubescent or nearly glabrous tree, 10–25 m high.
Leaves about 40 cm long; pinnae about 4–12, 15–20 cm long; leaflets 12–20,
oblong-elliptic, rounded or retuse, 2–5 cm long, oblique.  Panicles terminal or
in the upper axils, up to 20 cm long, diffuse; flowers 1–1.5 across.  Pod long

aves about 40 cm long; pinnae about 4–12, 15–20 cm long; leaflets 12–20,
oblong-elliptic, rounded or retuse, 2–5 cm long, oblique.  Panicles terminal or
in the upper axils, up to 20 cm long, diffuse; flowers 1–1.5 across.  Pod long,
thin, smooth, flattened, 10–15 cm long, 2–2.4 cm broad, containing 8–10 seeds
(Li, 1963).
Germplasm
Reported from the Indochina-Indonesia and Hindustani Centers of
Diversity, tall albizia, or cvs thereof, is reported to tolerate drought, and
stony, dry, and shallow soils.  (2
n
= 26)
Distribution
Native to tropical Asia and Australia, now widely cultivated in the
tropics.
Ecology
Ranging from Tropical Very Dry through Tropical Moist Forest Life Zones,
tall albizia is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 8.8 to 29 dm (mean
of 25 cases = 16.8) and annual temperature of 24.7 to 26.3°C (mean of 12 cases
25.3).
Cultivation
Soak seed a few seconds in boiling water (removed from source of heat)
and soak overnight.  Directly sow seed in prepared pots (in 10–15 mm
polyethylene bags) using 50:50 sandy loam:potting soil.  Spray insecticides
twice a month for two months and as often as necessary thereafter.  Place
seedlings in shade, watering at least every other day.  Harden off after 3–4
months.  Regulate exposure to sun and water until seedlings are hardened.

seedlings in shade, watering at least every other day.  Harden off after 3–4
months.  Regulate exposure to sun and water until seedlings are hardened.
Space at 3 x 3 m, marking with Stakes.  Set out in early morning and/or late
afternoon at beginning of rainy season, when seedlings are about 4–7 months old
(Canopy, 1981).  Trees are easily propagated, using seedlings or stumps (NAS,
1979).
Harvesting
Tree is cut as needed for fuel, timber, or charcoal.
Yields and Economics
Should yield about like
Albizia lebbeck
.  In Java, annual wood
production of 10 m3/ha is recorded.  Trees may attain 1 m DBH at 12 years, 2
m at 30 years.
Energy
Pods and fallen leaves may be considered as undesirable litter or as
potential energy sources.  It seems probable that if
Albizia lebbeck
fruits can yield 10 barrels of ethanol per hectare, this species could do as
well.  The species was increased in Puerto Rico during the 1940's because it
seemed "a promising rapid-growing fuelwood species for the coastal and lower
mountain regions."
Biotic Factors
Wood is relatively resistant to attack by dry-wood termites.  Most of
the Puerto Rican introductions have suffered severely from a fungus disease
which causes disback or death (Little and Wadsworth, 1964). Browne (1968)
lists:  Fungi.
