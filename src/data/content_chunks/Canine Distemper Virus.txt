2.  Use the Vero Plates within 4 hours. 
 
3.3.2   Preparation of CDV Positive Control 
 
1.  On the day of test initiation, rapidly thaw a vial of CDV Positive 
Control in a 36°± 2°C water bath.  
 
2.  Dispense 1.8 mL of MEM into sufficient 12 x 75-mm polystyrene 
tubes to bracket the expected endpoint according to the CVB Reagent 
Data Sheet; appropriately label (e.g., 5 tubes, labeled 10-1 through 10-5, 
respectively). 
 
3.  With a 200-µL pipettor, transfer 200 µL of the CDV Positive Control 
to the first tube, labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing. 
 
4.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the 10-1 labeled tube 
(Step 3) to the 10-2 tube; mix by vortexing. 
 
5.  Repeat Step 4 for each of the subsequent dilutions, transferring 200 
µL of the previous dilution to the next dilution tube, until the tenfold 
dilution series is completed.

3.4.2   For multifraction CDV Test Vaccines, neutralize the non-CDV fractions 
with antiserum specific to each virus fraction. It is not necessary to neutralize 
canine parvovirus (CPV) since CPV is not expected to replicate in Vero cells.

CDV fractions 
with antiserum specific to each virus fraction. It is not necessary to neutralize 
canine parvovirus (CPV) since CPV is not expected to replicate in Vero cells.  
 
1.  Prepare 1:2 dilutions of each neutralizing non-CDV antiserum by 
mixing equal volumes of antiserum and DPBS. 
 
2.  Dispense 200 µL of each of the required  neutralizing antisera into a 
12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube labeled 10-1 and q.s. with MEM to 1.8 mL. 
For example, to neutralize the CPI and CAV components in a 4-fraction 
CDV/CPV/CPI/CAV vaccine, dispense 200 µL of each of the diluted CPI 
and CAV antisera into the tube labeled 10-1; add 1.4 mL of MEM to obtain 
a final volume of 1.8 mL. 
 
3.  Pipette 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to the labeled tube to 
yield a 10-1 dilution; mix by vortexing. 
 
4.  Incubate at room temperature for 30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For Test Vaccines not containing CPI or CAV, the 10-1 dilution is 
prepared by adding 200 µL of the Test Vaccine to 1.8 mL of MEM in a 12 x  
75-mm polystyrene tube, labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing.

2.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the tube labeled 10-1 to 
the 10-2 tube; mix by vortexing. 
 
3.  Repeat Step 2 by transferring 200 µL from the previous dilution to the 
next dilution tube, until the tenfold dilution series is completed.  
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   Label the Vero Plates and inoculate each of 5 wells/dilution with 100 µL of 
dilutions 10-5 through 10-2 of the Test Vaccine. In a similar manner, inoculate 5 
wells/dilution of the CDV Positive Control (with dilutions 10-5 through 10-2 from Section 
3.3.2). Change tips between each unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine and the

CDV Positive Control), but tip changes are not necessary between each dilution in a 
series if pipetting from the most dilute to the most concentrated within that series (e.g.,  
10-5 through 10-2). 
 
4.2   Five uninoculated wells serve as negative cell controls. 
 
4.3   Incubate Vero Plates in a 36°± 2°C CO2 incubator for 7 days ± 1 day. 
 
4.4   After incubation, read the Vero Plate at 100X magnification on an inverted light 
microscope and examine cells for CDV CPE. 
 
4.4.1   Wells displaying 1 or more CPE foci, characterized by cell fusion and 
lysis, are considered to be positive for CDV.  
 
4.4.2   Results are recorded as the number of CPE positive wells versus total 
number of wells examined for each dilution of the Test Vaccine and the CDV 
Positive Control. 
 
4.5   Calculate the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the Test Vaccine and 
the CDV Working Positive Control using the method of Spearman-Kärber as modified by 
Finney. 
 
Example:

10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 4/5 wells CPE positive 
10-5  dilution of Test Vaccine = 2/5 wells CPE positive 
10-6 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/5 wells CPE positive 
 
Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine Titer = (X – d/2 + [d ● S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells CPE positive (3) 
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) 
S = sum of proportions of wells CPE positive for all dilutions tested:

Adjust the titer to the recommended Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A. divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose 
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for this test 
CDV vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL) 
 
Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine added to each well of the 
Test Plate (for this CDV test vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.1 mL) 
 
1 mL dose = 10 
                0.1 mL 
 
B. calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine titer as illustrated 
below: 
 
Log of 10 = 1.0 
 
Test Vaccine titer = 4.7 + 1.0 = 5.7 
 
Therefore the titer of the CDV Test Vaccine is 105.7 TCID50/mL. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
Valid Assay 
 
5.1    The calculated titer of the CDV Positive Control must fall within plus or minus 2 
standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a minimum of 10 
previously determined titers. 
 
5.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CDV Positive  Control must induce CPE in 
100% of the wells (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are CPE positive 
at the
Text Len: 1228
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
) of its mean titer, as established from a minimum of 10 
previously determined titers. 
 
5.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CDV Positive  Control must induce CPE in 
100% of the wells (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are CPE positive 
at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as “greater than or equal to” the calculated 
titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, the highest (most dilute) must exhibit no CPE 
(0/5). 
 
5.3    The uninoculated cell controls must not exhibit any CPE or cloudy media that 
would indicate contamination. 
 
5.4    If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice.

5.5    If the validity requirements are met and the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater 
than or equal to the titer contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is 
considered SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.6    If the validity requirements are met but the titer of the Test Vaccine is lower than 
the required minimum titer contained in the APHIS filed Outline of Production for the

and 3 Test Vaccine. Each additional Vero Plate allows testing of 4 
additional Test Vaccines. 
 
2.  Use the Vero Plates within 4 hours. 
 
3.3.2   Preparation of CDV Positive Control 
 
1.  On the day of test initiation, rapidly thaw a vial of CDV Positive 
Control in a 36°± 2°C water bath.  
 
2.  Dispense 1.8 mL of MEM into sufficient 12 x 75-mm polystyrene 
tubes to bracket the expected endpoint according to the CVB Reagent 
Data Sheet; appropriately label (e.g., 5 tubes, labeled 10-1 through 10-5, 
respectively). 
 
3.  With a 200-µL pipettor, transfer 200 µL of the CDV Positive Control 
to the first tube, labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing. 
 
4.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the 10-1 labeled tube 
(Step 3) to the 10-2 tube; mix by vortexing. 
 
5.  Repeat Step 4 for each of the subsequent dilutions, transferring 200 
µL of the previous dilution to the next dilution tube, until the tenfold 
dilution series is completed.

CDV fractions 
with antiserum specific to each virus fraction. It is not necessary to neutralize 
canine parvovirus (CPV) since CPV is not expected to replicate in Vero cells.  
 
1.  Prepare 1:2 dilutions of each neutralizing non-CDV antiserum by 
mixing equal volumes of antiserum and DPBS. 
 
2.  Dispense 200 µL of each of the required  neutralizing antisera into a 
12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube labeled 10-1 and q.s. with MEM to 1.8 mL. 
For example, to neutralize the CPI and CAV components in a 4-fraction 
CDV/CPV/CPI/CAV vaccine, dispense 200 µL of each of the diluted CPI 
and CAV antisera into the tube labeled 10-1; add 1.4 mL of MEM to obtain 
a final volume of 1.8 mL. 
 
3.  Pipette 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to the labeled tube to 
yield a 10-1 dilution; mix by vortexing. 
 
4.  Incubate at room temperature for 30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For Test Vaccines not containing CPI or CAV, the 10-1 dilution is 
prepared by adding 200 µL of the Test Vaccine to 1.8 mL of MEM in a 12 x  
75-mm polystyrene tube, labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing.

1.  Dispense 1.8 mL of MEM into each of 4, 12 x 75-mm polystyrene 
tubes, labeled 10-2 through 10-5. 
 
2.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the tube labeled 10-1 to 
the 10-2 tube; mix by vortexing. 
 
3.  Repeat Step 2 by transferring 200 µL from the previous dilution to the 
next dilution tube, until the tenfold dilution series is completed.  
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   Label the Vero Plates and inoculate each of 5 wells/dilution with 100 µL of 
dilutions 10-5 through 10-2 of the Test Vaccine. In a similar manner, inoculate 5 
wells/dilution of the CDV Positive Control (with dilutions 10-5 through 10-2 from Section 
3.3.2). Change tips between each unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine and the

CDV Positive Control), but tip changes are not necessary between each dilution in a 
series if pipetting from the most dilute to the most concentrated within that series (e.g.,  
10-5 through 10-2). 
 
4.2   Five uninoculated wells serve as negative cell controls. 
 
4.3   Incubate Vero Plates in a 36°± 2°C CO2 incubator for 7 days ± 1 day. 
 
4.4   After incubation, read the Vero Plate at 100X magnification on an inverted light 
microscope and examine cells for CDV CPE. 
 
4.4.1   Wells displaying 1 or more CPE foci, characterized by cell fusion and 
lysis, are considered to be positive for CDV.  
 
4.4.2   Results are recorded as the number of CPE positive wells versus total 
number of wells examined for each dilution of the Test Vaccine and the CDV 
Positive Control. 
 
4.5   Calculate the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the Test Vaccine and 
the CDV Working Positive Control using the method of Spearman-Kärber as modified by 
Finney. 
 
Example:

Example:

10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 4/5 wells CPE positive 
10-5  dilution of Test Vaccine = 2/5 wells CPE positive 
10-6 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/5 wells CPE positive 
 
Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine Titer = (X – d/2 + [d ● S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells CPE positive (3) 
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) 
S = sum of proportions of wells CPE positive for all dilutions tested: 
 
5     4     2     0    11

Adjust the titer to the recommended Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A. divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose 
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for this test 
CDV vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL) 
 
Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine added to each well of the 
Test Plate (for this CDV test vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.1 mL) 
 
1 mL dose = 10 
                0.1 mL 
 
B. calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine titer as illustrated 
below: 
 
Log of 10 = 1.0 
 
Test Vaccine titer = 4.7 + 1.0 = 5.7 
 
Therefore the titer of the CDV Test Vaccine is 105.7 TCID50/mL. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
Valid Assay 
 
5.1    The calculated titer of the CDV Positive Control must fall within plus or minus 2 
standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a minimum of 10 
previously determined titers. 
 
5.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CDV Positive  Control must induce CPE in 
100% of the wells (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are CPE positive 
at the
Text Len: 1228
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
) of its mean titer, as established from a minimum of 10 
previously determined titers. 
 
5.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CDV Positive  Control must induce CPE in 
100% of the wells (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or more wells are CPE positive 
at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as “greater than or equal to” the calculated 
titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, the highest (most dilute) must exhibit no CPE 
(0/5). 
 
5.3    The uninoculated cell controls must not exhibit any CPE or cloudy media that 
would indicate contamination. 
 
5.4    If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice.

5.5    If the validity requirements are met and the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater 
than or equal to the titer contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is 
considered SATISFACTORY.
