HOSTS
This pest attacks papaya.
DISTRIBUTION
This mite was first found in Hawaii on papaya farms in Kahuku, Oahu in 1990 and was later found on farms in Kaaawa and Haleiwa (Hamasaki and Heu, 1991). It has not been reported on any other islands. This mite is a minor pest of papaya in the Philippines.
DAMAGE
In Hawaii this mite attacks both fruits and leaves (Hamasaki and Heu, 1991). The mite feeds by rupturing the cells and sucking the sap from the skin which produces scars on the fruit. Damage is more evident on older fruit. Feeding by large numbers of mites causes the surface to take on a brown and slightly roughened appearance. Heavily infested fruits may also have a white powdery material on the surface that resembles spray residue. Closer examination of the white material reveals that it is composed of large numbers of mite skins which are shed during development. Damage to leaves can result in the rolling of leaf edges and the leaves take on a discolored sheen. In the Philippines this mite does not attack the papaya fruit directly and damage is restricted to rolling leaf edges (Jeppson, et .al., 1975).
