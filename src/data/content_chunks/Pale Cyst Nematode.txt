The field is declared positive for PCN (infested). Pressure washing and steam sanitation requirements are 
implemented for all equipment in contact with field soil. Additional regulatory requirements are implemented for 
moving commodities from the field. Growing PCN host crops (or host weed species) is prohibited**. The field is 
eligible to receive available program-sponsored eradication treatments. Without treatments the timeline to full 
eradication is at least 30 years. For deregulation, the field must complete a stepwise series of tests to 
demonstrate that the infestation has been fully eradicated.

Summary: A primary mechanism for a field to become regulated as an associated field is exposure to soil or other regulated articles from a pale cyst 
nematode (PCN) infested field. Pressure washing sanitation requirements are implemented for all equipment in contact with field soil. Other regulatory 
requirements are implemented for movement of commodities from the field. To become deregulated, the field must complete a series of two full-field 
delimiting surveys, each following harvest of a host crop (PCN-susceptible potatoes), at a rate of 8,000 cc soil per acre (equivalent to approximately 20 
pounds of soil per acre). 
If a host crop was grown and harvested any time after the exposure event, the field is eligible to receive the first delimiting survey towards deregulation. 
If a host crop has not been grown in the field since the time of exposure, a baseline field survey at the delimiting survey rate is required as soon as 
practicable and does not count toward the two delimiting surveys following a host crop required for deregulation.
