Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a blood-borne disease spread by 
ticks. It can affect horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras. 
EP is endemic in most tropical and temperate areas of the world 
with ticks capable of carrying the disease. In the United States, 
EP is endemic only in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
However, isolated outbreaks have occurred in horses on the 
U.S. mainland. Also, many areas of our country have climates 
and tick vectors suitable for the disease to establish itself here. 
If you’re a horse owner or veterinarian, you need to know about 
the risks of EP transmission in the United States. The following 
information describes the disease and how to help protect the 
U.S. horse industry from it.
EP is a foreign animal disease in the United States. 
You must report any detection of EP to your State 
Veterinarian (usaha.org/saho) and/or USDA Area 
Veterinarian in Charge (aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/
contacts/field-operations-districts.pdf).    
How USDA Protects Equine Health
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) protects our Nation’s 
horse industry from EP in several ways:
• USDA regulates equine imports and maintains tick control 
and surveillance programs. 
• We require a negative EP test for most imported horses to 
enter the United States. EP-positive horses can only enter 
the country temporarily under special arrangements, such 
as for international equine events like the World Equestrian 
Games.
• USDA has laboratories approved to test horses for EP. We 
notify the World Organization for Animal Health

• USDA has laboratories approved to test horses for EP. We 
notify the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) if 
an outbreak occurs here. 
• We also offer a supervised EP-treatment program. See 
more detail on the next page under “Treatment.”
Transmission
Two parasites, Babesia caballi and Theileria (formerly Babesia) 
equi, cause this disease. In most cases, horses that survive the 
acute phase of infection continue to carry the parasites. These 
“chronic carriers” become potential sources of infection for 
other horses. 
Equine Piroplasmosis
The disease spreads naturally via tick bites. It can also spread 
through contact with blood-contaminated equipment or blood 
products. 
Tick Bites 
Ticks become infected with EP when they ingest blood from 
infected equines. The ticks then spread it by biting uninfected 
equines. 
EP is carried by Ixodid or “hard” ticks of various genera. The United 
States is home to several tick species capable of carrying this 
disease: 
• Cayenne tick (Amblyomma [cajennense] mixtum)
• Tropical horse tick (Dermacentor nitens) 
• Winter tick (D. albopictus) 
• American dog tick (D. variabilis)
• Southern cattle tick (Rhipicephalus [Boophilus] microplus)

• American dog tick (D. variabilis)
• Southern cattle tick (Rhipicephalus [Boophilus] microplus)
• Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis)
Although these ticks could host and transmit EP, current 
surveillance shows no natural tick-borne transmission of EP on  
the U.S. mainland.
Contaminated Blood  
Equipment contaminated with EP-infected blood can also spread 
the disease. This may include injectable, surgical, dental, or 
tattoo equipment. 
The most common routes of transmission in recent U.S. cases 
include:

racing career. Former Quarter Horse racehorses should also be 
tested as part of prepurchase examinations.   
Clinical Signs
In most cases, an EP-infected horse can take 10 to 30 days to 
show signs of the disease. Acute cases of EP may be mild or 
more severe. Mild forms of the disease cause horses to appear 
weak and show lack of appetite. More severe clinical signs 
include fever, anemia, yellowish mucous membranes, a swollen 
abdomen, and/or labored breathing. Other signs of EP can 
include central nervous system disturbances, roughened hair 
coats, constipation, col

 severe. Mild forms of the disease cause horses to appear 
weak and show lack of appetite. More severe clinical signs 
include fever, anemia, yellowish mucous membranes, a swollen 
abdomen, and/or labored breathing. Other signs of EP can 
include central nervous system disturbances, roughened hair 
coats, constipation, colic, and hemoglobinuria (a condition 
which gives urine a red color). In some cases, death may occur. 
Yet, the disease may not affect all horses equally. Some may 
show few or no clinical signs in the acute phase and no obvious 
decrease in performance. Horses in the chronic phase of 
infection usually show no clinical signs other than anemia, or 
they may exhibit weight loss, poor performance, and loss  
of condition.
Diagnosis
Testing at a USDA-approved laboratory can diagnose EP. Some 
U.S. equine events or racetracks may require a negative EP test 
before allowing horses to compete. 
Veterinarians: If you suspect EP, contact State or Federal animal 
health officials before you collect any samples. 
Treatment
Historically, EP-infected animals would be euthanized, exported 
from the United States, or quarantined for the rest of their lives. 
Today, USDA offers a treatment program for EP-infected horses. 
Imidocarb dipropionate is the drug used to treat EP infection. 
An accredited veterinarian performs the treatment, with 
oversight from State and Federal animal health officials. 
This program has been successful in clearing most horses 
of infection over time. Treated horses are released from 
quarantine once they test negative for EP. 
Prevention

Prevention
There is no vaccine for EP. To prevent infections, avoid (1) 
bites by infected ticks, (2) contact with blood-contaminated

• Reuse of needles, syringes, or intravenous administration 
tubing between horses
• Blood-contamination of multidose drug vials
• Administration of contaminated blood or plasma products
• Direct blood transfusion between horses 
Rarely, in utero transmission from mare to foal has also been 
reported.
History
The United States identified natural tick-borne transmission 
of EP in Florida in the early 1960s, primarily due to B. caballi. 
In response, we began a State-Federal EP control program in 
Florida to eradicate the disease and tropical horse ticks. The 
program used quarantine and drug treatment for infected 
equines, tick treatment for infected and exposed animals and 
premises, and movement controls to prevent EP spread. As a 
result of this lengthy eradication campaign, the United States 
was declared EP-free in 1988.
Another outbreak of tick-transmitted EP  was not identified in 
the United States until 2009. Over 400 horses

was declared EP-free in 1988.
Another outbreak of tick-transmitted EP  was not identified in 
the United States until 2009. Over 400 horses from a large ranch 
in south Texas were found to be infected with T . equi. Ticks 
linked to the outbreak included cayenne tick (A. [cajennense] 
mixtum) and American dog tick (D. variabilis). The Texas ranch 
had another site in Brazil, where EP was endemic. Movement 
of horses between these two ranches was likely the source of 
the outbreak. In cooperation with State, federal, and academic 
partners and ranch personnel, we eradicated T . equi from the 
Texas ranch by quarantining the premises long-term, culling 
infected horses or treating them with imidocarb dipropionate, 
and mitigating tick vectors with acaricide.   
Epidemiology
In recent years, EP transmission in the United States has  
been from:
• Illegal imports of infected horses or blood products from 
countries where the disease is endemic.  
• Unhygienic practices that transfer blood from an infected 
horse to uninfected horses. 
This has caused clusters of infection in epidemiologically 
related populations, particularly Quarter Horses involved in 
unsanctioned horse racing. 
We can avoid these modes of transmission by: 
1. Testing horses for EP, as required during legal import, or 
before their use as blood donors. 
2. Sanitizing dental and surgical equipment between horses,
