28.TribeTRIFOLIEAE车轴草族 che zhou cao zuAuthors:Zhi Wei&Michael A. VincentHerbs, rarely shrubs. Leaves pinnately or digitately 3-foliolate, rarely 1- or 5-7-foliolate; stipules mostly adnate to petiole, rarely nearly free (Parochetus); leaflets estipellate, veins mostly extended to teeth on margin. Inflorescences various, often capitate or spicate racemes, rarely flowers 1-3 axially; bracts present; bracteoles absent. Calyx campanulate, 5-lobed. Corolla papilionaceous. Stamens diadelphous (9+1) or monadelphous; free parts of filaments filiform or dilated upward; anthers dimorphic or monomorphic (Ononis). Ovary with 1 to numerous ovules; style glabrous. Legumes various: straight, falcate, spirally coiled, or ovate, included in or exserted from calyx, dehiscing by one or both sutures or indehiscent.
