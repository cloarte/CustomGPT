Domestic Quarantine for Box Tree Moth (Cydalima perspectalis) and Establishment of 
Conditions for the Interstate Movement of Regulated Articles of Buxus Species 
DA-2024-17 
May 22, 2024 
Effective immediately, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in cooperation 
with State Agricultural Authorities of the impacted States, is updating the box tree moth (BTM; 
Cydalima perspectalis) quarantined areas and establishing the conditions for the interstate 
movement of regulated articles of Buxus species, commonly called boxwood, from BTM-
quarantined areas.  
This Federal Order is issued in accordance with the regulatory authority provided by the Plant 
Protection Act of June 20, 2000, as amended, Section 412(a), 7 U.S.C. 7712(a). The Act 
authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to prohibit or restrict the movement in interstate 
commerce of any plant, plant part, or article, or means of conveyance, if the Secretary 
determines the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the dissemination of a plant pest 
within the United States.  
This Federal Order establishes quarantined areas in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and 
Ohio, and expands the quarantined areas in Michigan and New York for BTM to align with 
interior quarantines established in these States. Specifically, this Federal Order a) establishes a 
BTM quarantine in the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts, b) adds all of Clinton, Eaton, 
Ingham, Jackson, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne Counties to the 
BTM quarantines previously established in Lenaw

interior quarantines established in these States. Specifically, this Federal Order a) establishes a 
BTM quarantine in the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts, b) adds all of Clinton, Eaton, 
Ingham, Jackson, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne Counties to the 
BTM quarantines previously established in Lenawee and Washtenaw Counties and parts of 
Jackson and Monroe Counties in Michigan, c) adds all of Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, 
Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chemung, Chenango, Clinton, Cortland, Franklin, Genesee, Herkimer, 
Jefferson, Lewis, Livingston, Madison, Monroe, Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Oswego, Otsego, 
Tioga, Tompkins, Saint Lawrence, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Wyoming, and Yates 
Counties to the BTM quarantines previously established in Eerie, Niagara, and Orleans Counties 
in New York, and d) establishes quarantines in Butler, Clermont, Hamilton, and Warren 
Counties in Ohio, as well as the portions of Montgomery County, Ohio, to the south of Interstate 
70; and the portions of Greene County that are west of SR 68 to the north of Xenia, and west of 
interstate 42 to the south of Xenia in Ohio. This Federal Order supersedes Federal Orders DA-
2022-13 and DA-2023-18, to include these new areas and to incorporate changes to the 
requirements for interstate movement of regulated articles.  
To prevent the spread of BTM, APHIS considers it necessary to regulate the interstate movement 
of regulated articles of boxwood from quarantined areas.

 Federal Order supersedes Federal Orders DA-
2022-13 and DA-2023-18, to include these new areas and to incorporate changes to the 
requirements for interstate movement of regulated articles.  
To prevent the spread of BTM, APHIS considers it necessary to regulate the interstate movement 
of regulated articles of boxwood from quarantined areas. Therefore, effective immediately, 
APHIS prohibits the interstate movement of regulated articles of boxwood from quarantined 
areas, unless in accordance with this Federal Order.  
Boxwood plants may only be moved interstate from a quarantined area from an establishment 
operating under a compliance agreement, and only if accompanied by a certificate issued by a 
State Agricultural Authority certifying that the requirements of this Federal Order and the 
compliance agreement have been met. These requirements will prevent producers and 
distributors of boxwood from moving infested plants interstate. State Agricultural Authorities 
may prescribe additional safeguards and protocols. 
All other regulated articles of boxwood, including plant parts, pieces, cuttings, clippings, debris, 
and any portion of the plant, alive or dead, except for decorative purposes, are prohibited from 
movement. 
This Federal Order and additional information about BTM are located on the APHIS box tree 
moth webpage. For additional information, please contact the National Policy Manager, Allen 
Proxmire, at allen.proxmire@usda.gov or ( 480) 392-8754.  
  
A. Quarantined Areas 
 
The Administrator may designate a whole state or an area less than an entire state if the
