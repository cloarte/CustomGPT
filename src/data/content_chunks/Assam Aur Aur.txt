Southeast Asia is regarded as a major center of origin and evolution of manycultivated crops particularly tropical fruits.  A great variety of fruits, somewild, others cultivated are located in Brunei.  Species of
Artocarpus
,
Durio, Garcinia, Mangifera, Musa,
and
Nephelium
, to mention onlya few, occur as scattered species amidst forest trees or growing alongsidehomes, in backyards or mixed orchards.  These indigenous species together withintroduced cultivars represent invaluable genetic resources waiting to becollected, identified, and tested for commercial development.
One of these potential new fruit crops is
Garcinia hombrioniana
Pierre,locally called Assam Aur Aur, a close relative of the mangosteen,

The dried crimson rind of the fruit for example, is commerciallyimportant and used extensively as sour relish in curries and culinary dishesrequiring an acidulous base.  Demand for this condiment is seeminglyunsatisfiable and at every fruit season, housewives gather the fruits, removethe pulp, and sun-dry the rind (

).  The market price is attractive andkeeping quality for properly dried pulp is good.
BOTANY
Origin
Assam Aur Aur is native to the Brunei Bay region of the states of Sabah andSarawak of Malaysia and Brunei.  The tree probably originated in therainforests and was cultivated in the coastal and riverine regions to serve theculinary uses of the early settlers.  Currently, the distribution is stillrestricted to the riverine and coastal alluvial regions.  Some trees are foundin the interior settlements, probably introduced, as coastal and riverinedwellers moved to settle inland.  The fruit has never achieved the importanceof mangosteen and early explorers and naturalists have largely neglected thesmall fruit for the larger, sweeter mangosteen.
Morphology
Assam Aur Aur is a handsome evergreen closely resembling the mangosteen inshape and canopy structure, except that Assam Aur Aur has smaller, moreelliptical leaves.  Mature trees can reach 10 m in height with numerousradially arranged spreading branches.  Much of the leaves are held by tertiarybranches.  Inflorescence are borne on these branchlets in clusters of not morethan five small flowers.  Very little is known about the morphology of theflowers and owing to the smallness and almost fused structures,

 leaves.  Mature trees can reach 10 m in height with numerousradially arranged spreading branches.  Much of the leaves are held by tertiarybranches.  Inflorescence are borne on these branchlets in clusters of not morethan five small flowers.  Very little is known about the morphology of theflowers and owing to the smallness and almost fused structures, the flowershave received very little attention.  It is likely that the flowers arehermaphroditic and the few seeds produced apomictic.  Seedlings derived fromseeds are always identical to the mother plant; there is no known geneticvariation.  Subtle differences in size (3 to 5 cm in diameter) and shape offruits could be attributed to environmental influence.  The population isgenerally homogeneous making selection for superior types difficult.  However,this homogeneous attribute can be advantageous as fruit and fruit productsderived from the fruits are fairly uniform.
HORTICULTURE
Culture
Assam Aur Aur is a tropical species requiring humid conditions of uniformannual rainfall exceeding 2,000 mm and mean temperature of 27°C.  The treeshows a wide range of soil adaptability and will grow on damp alluvial soil aswell as free draining upland soils.  However, the preference is forwell-drained fertile alluvial soil where water is not limiting.
Seeds, with the pulp removed, germinate within one week and can be shown directinto plastic bags.  Early growth requires protection from full sunlight; 50%shading is recommended and progressively removed to harden the seedlings forfield planing when 6 to 8 months old.
There is no commercial planting of Assam Aur Aur to provide culturalrecommendations.  However, based on observations and experiences, trees growbest at 5 m spacing.

into plastic bags.  Early growth requires protection from full sunlight; 50%shading is recommended and progressively removed to harden the seedlings forfield planing when 6 to 8 months old.
There is no commercial planting of Assam Aur Aur to provide culturalrecommendations.  However, based on observations and experiences, trees growbest at 5 m spacing.  Nurse shade between 50 to 60% is essential at planting.Growth is rapid.  Prunning of lower branches, weeding, and fertilization willbring the trees to bear after four years.  Recommended fertilizers consist ofNPK (12-5-14) to enhance fruiting.  Mulching with dry litter will help toretain soil moisture and prevent erosion which appears to be essential forhealthy growth of the plant.
As long as the trees are healthy, problems of diseases appear minimal.However, ripe fruits are susceptible to infection by fruit flies (
Dacus
spp) causing damage to the pulp.  The rind is unaffected and can still beprocessed into condiments.  Fruit fly damage is more prevalent when few fruitsare in season.  Spraying with insecticides may reduce the damage, but,generally control of fruit fly is difficult in the tropics.
UTILIZATION
Bruneians, for centuries, have found many uses for the fruits.  The youngfruits that drop to the ground are collected and sliced into thin pieces orchunks and sun-dried.  The final product is a fig brown condiment ready to givethe needed tang to Brunei dishes.  Currently, there is a limited amount in themarket.  The mature fruit has multiple uses with a fragrance reminiscent ofapricot.  Early Bruneians fermented the pulp into organic vinegar.  The flavoris distinct, fruity, and strong.  In

ried.  The final product is a fig brown condiment ready to givethe needed tang to Brunei dishes.  Currently, there is a limited amount in themarket.  The mature fruit has multiple uses with a fragrance reminiscent ofapricot.  Early Bruneians fermented the pulp into organic vinegar.  The flavoris distinct, fruity, and strong.  In recent years, efforts of the Department ofAgriculture have produced suitable cordials and jams from the pulp (
Fig. 3
).The quality of the cordial is still questionable but the jams have penetrated alimited market.  Research is still in progress.
The greatest commercial value of the fruit is the crimson rind.  Dried in thesun, the shiny rind turns dull mauve in the process.  Packed into small plasticbags, the rind is ready for sale as an essential ingredient for many Bruneidishes.  The best condiment exudes some oil when pressed between fingers andquality rind, properly dried, will eventually turn black without being moldy(
Fig. 4
).  Dark colored rind does not affect the culinary quality.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
Assam Aur Aur has tremendous opportunity as a specially fruit.  Strongpromotional support will strengthen marketing.  The research programs of theDepartment of Agriculture can explore postharvest and handling technology toestablish quality and standards.  However, it is the inherent quality of fruitthat will attract connoisseurs.  The strategy is to introduce this fruit intospecially markets.
Another area of interest is the acidulous quality of the rind.  It is alreadyin great demand.  Opportunity exists for more systematic and scientificapproach to rind processing, packaging, and marketing.  Greater efforts will berequired to evaluate value-added products such as jams,
