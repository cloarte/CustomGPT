Encephalitis Cases in the United States 
January 1 – December 31, 2017 
 
This report is a descriptive summary of U.S. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases reported to the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2017. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) branch collaborates with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) and State veterinary and public health officials to facilitate communication about 
arbovirus disease cases in horses and confirm equine cases in each State. CDC collects arbovirus case 
information using its ArboNET reporting system, an electronic surveillance and reporting system used to 
track and report arboviral activity in humans and animals. During the transmission season, VS 
disseminates the equine arbovirus case information to State animal health officials for confirmation and 
posts the number of confirmed cases to the USDA equine infectious anemia disease information Web 
site (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/equine-health). This site also provides specific case 
definitions. In this document, ‘reported cases’ of EEE may include presumptive positive and confirmed 
positive cases.

2017 Summary of Eastern Equine 
Encephalitis Cases in the United States 
January 1 – December 31, 2017 
 
This report is a descriptive summary of U.S. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases reported to the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2017. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) branch collaborates with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) and State veterinary and public health officials to facilitate communication about 
arbovirus disease cases in horses and confirm equine cases in each State. CDC collects arbovirus case 
information using its ArboNET reporting system, an electronic surveillance and reporting system used to 
track and report arboviral activity in humans and animals. During the transmission season, VS 
disseminates the equine arbovirus case information to State animal health officials for confirmation and 
posts the number of confirmed cases to the USDA equine infectious anemia disease information Web 
site (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/equine-health). This site also provides specific case

positive cases.   
 
In 2017, 86 equine cases of EEE were reported from 13 States. Figure 1 shows the annual number of 
equine EEE cases reported in the U.S. from 2004 through 2017. Figure 2 shows the number of equine
