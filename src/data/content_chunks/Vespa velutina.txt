Breadcrumb Home Plants Plant Health Plant Pests and Diseases Yellow-Legged Hornet Yellow-Legged Hornet Last Modified:  June 17, 2024 The yellow-legged hornet ( Vespa velutina ) is a social wasp species that constructs nests above ground made from paper-like materials. These nests can be found hanging in trees and on structures such as barns, garages and sheds. Nests can be large and contain up to 6,000 workers. Yellow-legged hornets feed on a variety of insects, including honeybees. If allowed to establish in the United States, these invasive pests could threaten populations of domestic and feral honey bees – some of which are already endangered – and other native pollinators. Their presence could also disrupt the pollination of many crops. What To Look For The yellow-legged hornet is not native to the United States, but it can be mistaken for a few domestic species. Take a look below at its distinctive markings. Then review images of the look-alike species side by side with the yellow-legged hornet in the "Yellow-Legged Hornet Look-Alikes" section. These other species are more likely to be found in the United States and do not pose a significant environmental or agricultural threat. In fact, some of these look-alikes can be beneficial pollinators. Body length From 0.7 to 1 inch long Coloration Head: Mostly black with some front-facing yellow or orange and black eyes Thorax: Mostly solid dark brown or black Abdomen: Alternating bands of dark brown or black and yellow or orange Legs: Brown or black near the body, ending in yellow segments Yellow-legged hornets have a “wasp waist” between the thorax and abdomen.

Find your State plant regulatory official Find your State plant health director In Georgia only , people should report potential sightings of the yellow-legged hornet through the Georgia Department of Agriculture’s online form . Controlling Yellow-Legged Hornets Expand All Collapse All Current Status The yellow-legged hornet was first detected in the United States when a beekeeper in Savannah, GA, found an unusual hornet on his property and reported it to the Georgia Department of Agriculture. On August 9, 2023, APHIS confirmed the University of Georgia’s identification of this insect as a yellow-legged hornet. Fourteen days later, a Georgia Department of Agriculture team safely eradicated the hornet nest in Savannah. APHIS and Georgia officials continue to monitor the area for any other nests. Since the initial detection in Georgia, yellow-legged hornets have also be found in South Carolina. The pest has not been found in any other State or Territory.

Life Cycle and Biology Spring: A fertilized queen emerges after surviving the winter. She enters a brief pre-nesting stage. The queen feeds on sap while her ovaries develop, and she looks for a suitable nesting site. She usually nests above ground, in trees. Summer: Once the queen selects a suitable site, she enters a solitary phase. During this time, she alone is responsible for building a nest, foraging, laying eggs, and caring for young. The queen later becomes completely nest-bound, and the workers assume all duties outside of the nest. Late Summer/Early Fall: When temperatures start to peak in summer, the colony begins producing males and the next year’s queens. To obtain food with higher protein for the developing “reproductives,” yellow-legged hornets may attack honey bee hives in the late summer/early fall. Yellow-legged hornets may attack other social bees and wasps at this time. Fall: Males develop and leave the nest before females. They will perch at the

 males and the next year’s queens. To obtain food with higher protein for the developing “reproductives,” yellow-legged hornets may attack honey bee hives in the late summer/early fall. Yellow-legged hornets may attack other social bees and wasps at this time. Fall: Males develop and leave the nest before females. They will perch at the entrance of nests waiting to mate with the new queens, which emerge about 1 month later. New queens must mate before waiting out the winter because males will not be present when the queens emerge the following spring. Winter: After mating, a new queen will remain in a sheltered spot to survive the colder months. The cycle begins again the following spring when the new queens emerge. Print
