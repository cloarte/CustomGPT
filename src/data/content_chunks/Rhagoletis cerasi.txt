1. Introduction 
 
 
 
 
 
New Pest Response Guidelines (NPRGs) are developed by Plant Protection and 
Quarantine (PPQ) in preparation for the plant health emergencies that occur when 
a new pest with the potential to seriously impact U.S. plant resources arrives in 
the U.S. 
The purpose of an NPRG is to provide the basic information likely to be needed 
by the initial PPQ response team in the first 30 to 60 days following a detection of 
the pest in the U.S. 
This guideline for European cherry fruit fly (ECFF), R. cerasi (Linnaeus), 
includes the following: 
♦ Summary of relevant pest biology  
♦ Guide to identification or screening for the pest in the field 
♦ Preliminary method for conducting a delimiting survey 
♦ Eradication and control options 
♦ Summary of knowledge gaps 
Note: This document is based on the best information available at the time of 
development; however, at the time

 the following: 
♦ Summary of relevant pest biology  
♦ Guide to identification or screening for the pest in the field 
♦ Preliminary method for conducting a delimiting survey 
♦ Eradication and control options 
♦ Summary of knowledge gaps 
Note: This document is based on the best information available at the time of 
development; however, at the time of the emergency new scientific and technical 
information may be identified. In addition, each pest incursion has unique, site-
specific characteristics that are impossible to predict. Therefore, this document 
should be considered a general guideline only. As the pest situation evolves and 
new information is gathered, the response implemented—i ncluding survey 
protocols— may need to be modified from the original recommendations. 
 Additional documentation in Appendix D includes specific information for 
grower host certification.

Pest Summary 
Rhagoletis cerasi is univoltine and oligophagous (Boller and Prokopy, 1976) and 
is considered an important and highly destructive pest of Prunus avium (L.) L. 
(sweet cherries) in Europe (Daniel and Baker, 2013; Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Larvae develop inside the cherries, and without effective control methods, 100 
percent of the fruit can be infested (Daniel and Baker, 2013; Fimiani, 1983).  
Justification 
A photograph of a new fruit fly was taken in an urban park in Mississauga, 
Ontario, on 15 July 2015 (NAPPO, 2016). At the time, the fruit fly was tentatively 
identified as

percent of the fruit can be infested (Daniel and Baker, 2013; Fimiani, 1983).  
Justification 
A photograph of a new fruit fly was taken in an urban park in Mississauga, 
Ontario, on 15 July 2015 (NAPPO, 2016). At the time, the fruit fly was tentatively 
identified as R. cerasi, and an initial detection survey was conducted by the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). On 27 June 2016, the CFIA confirmed 
the detection of R. cerasi in association with Lonicera spp. (NAPPO, 2016). 
 
Key Information 
♦ Rhagoletis cerasi has a limited host range, infesting only Prunus spp. and 
Lonicera spp. (Daniel and Grunder, 2012) 
♦ Without appropriate control measures, infestations can reach 100 percent, 
which can reduce marketable yields (Alford, 2007; Daniel and Grunder, 
2012) 
♦ Infested fruit damage tolerance levels in infested areas is typically set at 2 
percent of infested fruit. Additionally, infested fruit cannot be sorted out, 
therefore the whole lot is rejected if tolerance levels are exceeded (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012)

Biology and Ecology 
Rhagoletis cerasi is a univoltine (one generation per year) and oligophagous 
species with economic-pest status on sweet cherry. Its life cycle depends on the 
availability of Prunus and Lonicera spp. (honeysuckle) fruit (Daniel and Grunder, 
2012). Two putative genetic host races, distinguished by observed oviposition 
preference for P. avium or Lonicera xylosteum L., have been described by Boller 
et al. (1998) in terms of phenological differences (the timing of adult emergence 
from pupae relative to the timing of the host fruit-development stage) and 
behavioral differences (plasticity of host choice by ovipositing females; 
sensitivity to the host-marking pheromone deposited on host fruit by females after 
oviposition). However, in looking for genetic differences between the two 
phenotypes, only one of six examined allozyme loci suggested genetically distinct

races (Schwarz et al., 2003). Infection by one or more strains of Wolbachia may 
contribute to genetic differences among geographically dispersed populations 
(putative genetically distinct northern and southern races) via reproductive 
isolation through the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic 
incompatibility (Arthofer et al., 2009b; Riegler and Stauffer, 2002); although the 
potential contribution of other factors (geographic isolation; host distribution) has 
not been refuted (Augustinos et al., 2014). For

 races) via reproductive 
isolation through the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic 
incompatibility (Arthofer et al., 2009b; Riegler and Stauffer, 2002); although the 
potential contribution of other factors (geographic isolation; host distribution) has 
not been refuted (Augustinos et al., 2014). For the objectives and audience of this 
NPRG, the difference in emergence time of adults from pupae that developed 
beneath cherry trees, relative to those that developed beneath honeysuckle bushes, 
may be the most relevant distinction for those charged with responding to 
detection of an introduction of R. cerasi in a newly-invaded landscape (see 
Timing of Surveys, below). 
This species overwinters as diapausing pupae in soil proximal to the host (cherry 
or honeysuckle) (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Maximum emergence of adults 
occurs after approximately 180 days at temperatures below 5 °C during a pupal 
hibernation period of 9–10 months (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). However, Moraiti 
et al. (2014) showed that pupae collected from sites representing a wide range of 
host and climatic conditions accommodated varying temperature regimes through 
varying diapause duration. Fly emergence usually occurs from mid-May to mid-
June in southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria (latitudes 46–48 °N) when 
temperatures are above 15 °C. The emergence of adults from pupae in soil 
beneath Lonicera spp. lags a few days behind that of adults that emerge from 
pupae proximal to cherries (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

 °N) when 
temperatures are above 15 °C. The emergence of adults from pupae in soil 
beneath Lonicera spp. lags a few days behind that of adults that emerge from 
pupae proximal to cherries (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Based on variation in fly fitness, larval nutrition, host phenology and ambient 
temperatures, the period of adult emergence, flight, mating and oviposition can 
range from 7–11 weeks. Estimates of the life span of adults in the field range from 
4–7 weeks (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Eggs are oviposited into host fruit (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). There are three 
instars between the egg and adult stages; larval development occurs in host fruit. 
Embryonic development after oviposition into host fruit takes 2–10 days, 
depending on temperature. The duration of larval development varies with 
temperature and host quality. Larval development concludes when pre-pupal 
larvae emerge from host fruit, drop to proximal soil and burrow to a depth of 2 to 
5 cm beneath the surface to pupate (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Rhagoletis cerasi overwinters in the pupal stage in soil beneath perennial hosts 
(cherry and honeysuckle) (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). The duration and success 
of pupal development and adult emergence are influenced by host nutritional 
quality during the larval stage and soil temperature. Most adults emerge at the 
conclusion of one cycle of winter diapause; however, for varying percentages of

quality during the larval stage and soil temperature. Most adults emerge at the 
conclusion of one cycle of winter diapause; however, for varying percentages of 
  Pest Overview 
2018-03 R. cerasi 3-3 
individuals, pupation continues through two or more winters, thus ensuring 
survival during years when cherry fruits are not produced (Daniel and Grunder, 
2012).  This multiyear overwintering strategy should be considered when 
quarantine regulations are enacted. 
Models exist for predicting adult emergence based on soil temperature at 5 cm 
depth (Daniel, 2014). Adult emergence begins after 430 degree days above the 
pupal (soil) developmental threshold temperature of 5 °C (Daniel, 2014).  
The preoviposition period lasts six to 13 days, during which maturation of gonads 
concludes while adults feed on bacterial colonies inhabiting the surface of  host 
leaves and fruit, honeydew, extrafloral nectaries and bird feces (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012).  
Adults aggregate onto sunlit portions of the host when the temperature is above 
15 °C to mate (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Ambient conditions favorable to 
mating and oviposition most often occur on the southeast portion of the host. 
Fecundity ranges from 30–200 eggs per female; fertility ranges from 54–100 
percent (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Males guard individual cherries and emit a species-specific pheromone (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012). The relative importance of this pheromone and of host 
quality cues to the selection of an oviposition host is unclear. After forced

 from 54–100 
percent (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Males guard individual cherries and emit a species-specific pheromone (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012). The relative importance of this pheromone and of host 
quality cues to the selection of an oviposition host is unclear. After forced 
copulation with a male guarding the host cherry, the female pierces the cherry 
with her ovipositor and oviposits a single egg in the fruit; she then marks the 
cherry with a host-marking pheromone to preserve the resource for the single egg. 
However, during years of heavy infestation, multiple larvae have been found in a 
single cherry (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Factors determining the time of oviposition initiation include the nutritional state 
of females, ambient temperature and degree of cherry fruit maturity (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012). The time between mating and oviposition is unclear; it may be 
based on insolation and temperature. High levels of infestation are associated with 
prolonged periods of sunny weather and temperatures above 15 °C (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012) 
Oviposition occurs at midday on sunny days when temperatures are above 16 °C 
(Daniel and Grunder, 2012). The fruit fly prefers sweet cherries over Prunus 
cerasus L. (sour cherries), consistent with research demonstrating that subsequent 
larval development is more rapid and successful in pulp of lower acidity and 
higher sugar content. In sweet cherries, the preferred oviposition host is a fruit 
with pulp thickness of 5 mm or more, a hardened pit and a color stage 
transitioning from green to yellow (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Within orchards,

berries as oviposition hosts (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

Dispersal 
Natural Dispersal 
Rhagoletis cerasi rarely move far from their host plants, and disperse only when 
deprived of suitable fruits for oviposition due to early harvest or frost (Boller and 
Prokopy, 1976; Daniel and Grunder, 2012). It is at this point that females, 
followed by males, move from tree to tree until they find a suitable host. 
Laboratory studies have shown that R. cerasi is capable of flying more than 1 km 
in 24 hours (as cited in Daniel and Baker (2013)), although studies conducted 
under field conditions indicated that their maximum flight distance is between 
100 and 500 m, and in unique cases, as far as 3 km when no landing platforms are 
available (as cited in Daniel and Grunder (2012)). Within orchards, 95 percent of 
adults move to adjacent, late-ripening trees, and from there to Lonicera spp. 
bushes (Daniel and Grunder, 2012; Les

100 and 500 m, and in unique cases, as far as 3 km when no landing platforms are 
available (as cited in Daniel and Grunder (2012)). Within orchards, 95 percent of 
adults move to adjacent, late-ripening trees, and from there to Lonicera spp. 
bushes (Daniel and Grunder, 2012; Leski, 1963). Wind may also play a role in 
dispersal of adults (Daniel and Baker, 2013; Thiem, 1934). 
Human-Assisted Spread 
Movement of infested fruit is most likely the primary way R. cerasi is spread with 
human assistance (Daniel, 2017). It is nearly impossible to sort out infested 
cherries, and when marketed, the consumer will eventually notice the larvae. 
Thereafter, if put on a compost pile, larvae that survive and form pupae might be 
able to overwinter (Daniel, 2017).  
The movement of plants for planting could possibly involve soil infested with R. 
cerasi pupae (Landry and Mordecai, 2016). Larvae develop inside the fruit and 
drop to the soil under the tree canopy to pupate and overwinter (Boller, 1966).  
 
Potential Pathways of Introduction 
The introduction of R. cerasi into the U.S. would most likely be through the 
importation of infested cherry fruit. Between 1988 and 2016, R. cerasi immatures 
have been intercepted 114 times in fruit in baggage at U.S. ports of entry (PestID, 
2017). Although there is no indication of an open commercial pathway of 
commercial cherry fruit imported from regions where R. cerasi is known to be 
established (Landry and Mordecai, 2016), there is evidence of other Tephritidae

entering the country, primarily in passenger baggage (Bigsby et al., 2016; 
Liebhold et al., 2006).

Further analysis on fruit fly interceptions at U.S. ports-of-entry from 2005 
through 2014 indicated that Tephritidae were intercepted on items for 
consumption (fruit) 96.8 percent of the time and that 96.2 percent of all pest 
interceptions were in international passenger baggage (Bigsby et al., 2016).

Potential Distribution in the United States 
Boller and Remund (1983) determined that emergence of R. cerasi requires 430 
degree-days above a base developmental temperature of 5 °C. Various other 
studies conducted also determined that in order for the maximum emergence of R. 
cerasi adults to occur, temperatures had to be below 5 °C for approximately 180 
days (Daniel and Grunder, 2012; Leski, 1963; Thiem, 1934; Vallo et al., 1976).  
Moraiti et al. (2014) recently determined that diapause termination could 
successfully occur with winter temperatures at 8 °C and that diapause intensity 
and temperature requirements can vary depending on the geographic origin of the 
population.  
Tart cherry distribution in the U.S. is mainly in Michigan, while sweet cherries

Larvae 
Larval development occurs within the host fruit, where larvae feed on fruit pulp; 
neonates tunnel toward the cherry pit to avoid predators and parasitoids. There are 
three instars; mature third instar larvae are translucent white and measure 
approximately 6 mm long (Fig. 4-4) (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

hatch (image credit Claudia Daniel, Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL) 
Pupae 
Prepupal third instars form exit holes in the fruit skin as they emerge to drop to 
the soil beneath the host, where they quickly burrow and pupate (Fig. 4-5). The 
depth of pupation varies with soil texture, from 2 cm in clay soils to 5 cm in sandy 
soils. The puparium is cylindrical, approximately 2 × 4 mm and straw yellow. 
Pupae are the overwintering stage and remain in the soil for 9–10 months, as 
studied in Germany, Switzerland and Austria (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

Signs and Symptoms 
Larval maturation within cherry fruit is associated with sunken brown lesions 
(Fig. 4-6) (Noma et al., 2010). Exit holes remain after the pre-pupal larvae exit 
the cherry fruit to pupate in soil beneath the host (Fig. 4-7) (Daniel and Grunder, 
2012).

5. Delimitation Survey 
 
 
 
 
When one or more European cherry fruit flies are collected in an area, implement 
a delimiting survey immediately to determine the population distribution. The 
standard fruit fly delimitation design that has been approved for all other exotic 
tephritids is recommended. Collection of adults can be accomplished with trap 
and lure combinations. An alternative method that can also be used is sweep 
netting (Jackson and Moylett, 2016). 
During ECFF outbreaks, the USDA and relevant State Departments of 
Agriculture will operate under Unified Command and each agency will designate 
an incident commander to be responsible for the overall project and 
administrative functions. 
If circumstances warrant, the Unified Command may request the assistance of 
APHIS–PPQ’s Incident Management Team. The project will use the Incident 
Command System in handling the project activities.

Delimitation Area 
The total delimitation area may depend on information from trace-back and trace-
forward investigations; pest identification; the nearby host distribution, including 
the extent of natural and artificial dispersal; agency resources and logistics. The 
delimiting survey boundaries can be as specific as production sites or as broad as 
political or geographical boundaries.  
Along with other factors, the delimited area depends on the flight capacity of the 
exotic pest. The delimitation area may also be influenced by other specifics that 
are only known at the time of introduction. For instance, the location of 
introduction, occurrence of high-risk pathways, density and distribution of hosts 
near the initial detection area, wind direction and available surveillance resources 
at the time of introduction all may influence the delimitation area.

exotic pest. The delimitation area may also be influenced by other specifics that 
are only known at the time of introduction. For instance, the location of 
introduction, occurrence of high-risk pathways, density and distribution of hosts 
near the initial detection area, wind direction and available surveillance resources 
at the time of introduction all may influence the delimitation area. 
The range of dispersal of R. cerasi is determined by the availability of host fruit; 
thus, the delimited area can be determined by host distribution.  
Traps and Placement 
The CAPS approved method is a protein-baited yellow sticky card with a lure of 
ammonium acetate in a polycon dispenser (Molet and Moylett, 2016). Place traps 
around the perimeter of the orchard and in the middle section of the tree canopy 
on the outside edge of the tree with the yellow surface of the trap facing outward 
(Molet and Moylett, 2016). Traps may also be placed in honeysuckle. If the main 
stem is large enough, hang the trap; if not, use a wooden or metal stake placed in 
close proximity to the host, making sure the trap is level with the crown of the 
plant (Molet and Moylett, 2016). 
Following the confirmation of a detected specimen as ECFF, increase trap 
densities in the core square-mile area within 24-48 hours. Optimally, place traps 
over an 81-square mile area in a 100-50-25-20-10 array (Fig. 5-1) (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2003). This includes a core mile area surrounded by four concentric 
buffer square miles for a total of approximately 81 square miles depending on the 
factors mentioned above. Increase trap densities in the

over an 81-square mile area in a 100-50-25-20-10 array (Fig. 5-1) (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2003). This includes a core mile area surrounded by four concentric 
buffer square miles for a total of approximately 81 square miles depending on the 
factors mentioned above. Increase trap densities in the remainder of the trapping 
area from the core outward, if possible, within 72 hours of the find (Table 5-1) 
(USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2003). Reduce overall trap numbers if there are areas that 
do not support hosts. For example, if any square mile of the area contains only 25 
percent hosts, then the total numbers recommended in that square mile would be 
  Delimitation Survey 
2018-03 R. cerasi 5-3 
reduced by approximately 75 percent.

Trap Servicing 
During the first week, service traps in the core mile daily. If you find a second fly 
during this first week of intensive trapping, service traps in the core area twice 
weekly and place increased emphasis on servicing traps in the buffer areas in an 
effort to better delimit the infestation (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2003). Traps in the 
eight square miles around the core need to be serviced every two days. Check all 
other traps at least once within the first week. Service all traps weekly for three 
life cycles of the fly beyond the last fly detected. Relocate traps to available 
preferred hosts as practical (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2003). 
Once the ammonium acetate dispenser has been expelled, discard the polycon and 
replace it with a new pre-loaded polycon (Molet and Moylett, 2016). Polycon

Other Survey Techniques for Delimitation 
Overwintering pupae are found in soil proximal to the host, at a depth of 2–5 cm, 
varying with soil texture from clayey to sandy (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). A 
method for sampling soil and extracting pupae has been described for the Western 
cherry fruit fly (AliNiazee, 1974). 
Sampling of Soil for Pupae 
The soil depth at which the 2 × 4 mm pupae have been reported to pupate has 
ranged from 2 cm in clay soils to 5 cm in sandy soils (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
AliNiazee (1974) described a wet-sieving method for surveying cherry orchard 
soils in western Oregon (Albany) for pupae of the western cherry fruit fly. Most 
pupae were found within 10 cm of the soil surface; however, up to 12.5 percent of 
pupae in a sampled area were found at a depth of 15.24 cm.  
♦ Collect soil beneath host using a sample size of 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm 
diameter × 2.5 cm depth., down to 15.

Visual Inspection for Larvae during Delimiting Survey 
In addition to flight-interception trapping of adults, larval surveys are conducted 
in host fruit (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Signs and symptoms of R. cerasi larval 
activity in cherries include presence of ovipositing adults on fruit, darkening of 
fruit, soft spots on fruit, exit holes on fruit made by mature (pre-pupal) larvae, 
shriveled or wilted fruit and rotten fruit (USDA-APHIS-PPQ-CPHST, 2016). 
Additionally, fruits may be sliced to actively look for larvae. A method of

Additionally, fruits may be sliced to actively look for larvae. A method of 
  Delimitation Survey 
2018-03 R. cerasi 5-5 
surveying cherry and honeysuckle fruit for larvae is described by Daniel and 
Grunder (2012): 
♦ Collect 100 ripe cherries or Lonicera spp. berries 
♦ Crush fruits to a degree sufficient to dislodge and separate the pits 
♦ Add the de-pitted fruits to a 1,000-ml aqueous solution containing 
350 g salt 
♦ After 10 minutes of immersion, count floating larvae 
 
Timing of Surveys 
Rhagoletis cerasi is univoltine and overwinters as pupae in soil proximal to the 
host. Pupal diapause concludes after 180 days below 5 °C; adult emergence 
occurs after 430 day-degrees above that temperature (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
The period of adult emergence, flight, mating and oviposition can range from 7–
11 weeks, coinciding with temperatures above 15 °C (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Adult emergence begins after 430 degree days above the pupal (soil) 
developmental threshold temperature of 5 °C (Daniel, 2014). Models exist for 
predicting adult emergence based on soil temperature at 5 cm depth (Daniel, 
2014). The emergence of adults from pupae in soil beneath Lonicera spp. lags a 
few days behind that of adults that emerge from pupae proximal to cherries 
(Daniel and Gru
Text Len: 1449
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
al threshold temperature of 5 °C (Daniel, 2014). Models exist for 
predicting adult emergence based on soil temperature at 5 cm depth (Daniel, 
2014). The emergence of adults from pupae in soil beneath Lonicera spp. lags a 
few days behind that of adults that emerge from pupae proximal to cherries 
(Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
After adult emergence and feeding on the host and in the vicinity of the host to 
promote sexual maturity, mating and oviposition occurs where the host fruit is 
exposed to sunlight. Adults prefer sweet cherries  over sour cherries; in sweet 
cherries, the preferred oviposition host is a fruit with pulp thickness of 5 mm or 
more, a hardened pit and a color stage transitioning from green to yellow (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012). Larvae develop in cherries until they have matured and leave 
the fruit to pupate in adjacent soil or until fruit are harvested or destroyed by 
disease organisms or weather events (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Guidance for CAPS suggests surveying for R. cerasi adults in the U.S. from May 
through July, when weather conditions are hot and dry (USDA-APHIS-PPQ-
CPHST, 2016). Survey of cherry fruit for larvae can begin soon after oviposition 
begins in mid-June and when host fruit starts to become available (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ-CPHST, 2016).

6. Eradication and Control 
Procedures 
 
 
This chapter presents known control options available for this pest and 
summarizes how widely used they are in the United States. 
This information can be used by PPQ decision-makers after a detection to assess 
the suitability of potential actions to eradicate, contain or suppress R. cerasi. The 
efficacy and feasibility of each control option will depend on the pest situation at 
the time of detection. Factors such as where the pest is detected (i.e., natural or 
urban environment, agricultural crops, greenhouses), how widespread the pest is, 
the climatic region, the time of year, the phenology of the host and what current 
practices are already in place contribute to determining whether a particular 
control option is appropriate. With respect to detection of an introduction of 
Rhagoletis cerasi, in the absence of recurring introductions, the prospect of 
eradicating a small, geographically isolated population of this oligophagous, 
univoltine species is favored by its susceptibility to three classes of chemical

Environmental Assessment and Public Notifications Regarding 
Eradication Treatments 
At the time of an eradication treatment, a site specific Environmental Assessment 
will be completed and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) signed, and 
the public will be notified regarding the findings.  
The purpose of notification is to comply with state/federal law and present 
accurate information in an understandable and non-threatening format to 
concerned groups. Local and state elected representatives of the residents in the 
treatment area will be notified and apprised of major developments before and 
during treatment. During ground treatment activities, any resident whose property 
will be treated with foliar sprays following the discovery of infested fruit on or 
near their property will be notified in writing prior to treatment. Treatment notices 
include the name of the pest to be eradicated, the material to be used and a phone 
number to call in case of additional questions on project operations. Following 
treatment, a completion notice is left detailing any precautions the homeowner 
should take, including harvest intervals on treated fruit. Treatment without prior 
notification may be necessary on a

include the name of the pest to be eradicated, the material to be used and a phone 
number to call in case of additional questions on project operations. Following 
treatment, a completion notice is left detailing any precautions the homeowner 
should take, including harvest intervals on treated fruit. Treatment without prior 
notification may be necessary on a small number of properties if active larvae are 
detected. However, reasonable efforts will be made to contact the homeowner.  
In the event of aerial treatment operations, notification will be made either by 
hand delivery or first class mail at least 72 hours before the first pesticide 
application begins, or in a declared emergency situation, at least 24 hours before 
treatment (USDA-APHIS, 2015). The information contained in the notice will 
include that noted above plus the aerial treatment boundaries and the number of a 
toll-free hotline to answer health related questions. 
 
Eradication Methods and Procedures 
Control Tactics 
Ground control is comprised of three elements: foliar bait spray treatments of 
host and/or non-host plants with hand or mechanical ground spray equipment, soil 
drenching hosts around larval or mated female detections and removal of all fruit 
(fruit removal). Foliar bait spray treatments target the adult life stage of the fruit 
fly. Soil drenching under the drip-line of a host plant targets the larval or pupae 
stage in the soil. Fruit removal is conducted in order to break the life cycle by 
eliminating any potential hosts for egg oviposition and larval development.

  Control Options 
2018-03 R. cerasi 6-3 
The following outline has been developed to provide direction through the initial 
stages of a ground control program: 
♦ Control triggers are met, fly identification is confirmed and a treatment 
area is defined based on fly distribution and the current action plan 
♦ State Agricultural authorities and regulations are required and used for 
official plant pest eradication and pesticide treatments for intrastate 
quarantines. Federal and state program officials must work together on 
control and eradication of plant pests 
♦ Compliance with the Endangered Species Act and NEPA: A site specific 
Environmental Assessment will be required and prepared by the APHIS 
Environmental Risk Assessment Staff (ERAS). Also, sensitive 
environmental sites to be excluded from treatment are identified in 
cooperation with the Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and local government agencies 
 Environmental and Biological Assessments conducted prior to 
treatment 
♦ The Public Information Officer (PIO) must issue a public notification via 
the news media at least 24 hours in advance of treatment. This notification 
should include treatment area boundaries, common roadways and 
landmarks for reference, anticipated dates of treatment, information about 
the pesticide used and the program help-line telephone number 
♦ Equipment and personnel are mobilized. All control equipment is brought 
to a suitable location. Control personnel are contacted for immediate 
deployment: strike teams consisting of three to four 2-person units are 
assigned to sections of the treatment area, depending on equipment used.

Treatment Notification 
The following procedures pertain to foliar bait spays and soil drench applications 
by ground-based treatment crews: 
♦ Notify the property owner 24 hours before treatment 
 Leave a Pre-Treatment Notification Form at the residence on the 
front door or in another visible place (do not leave the form in the 
property’s USPS mailbox) 
 If contact is made and permission is granted, begin treatment 
♦ When beginning treatment, attempt to make contact with the 
resident/homeowner 
 If contact is made and permission is granted, begin treatment 
 If no contact is made, begin treatment and leave a Post-Treatment

 If the property owner refuses, then treatment is not conducted on 
the property 
IMPORTANT: EVERY PROPERTY THAT IS NOT TREATED, FOR 
WHATEVER REASON, MUST BE RECORDED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. 
Control Staging Area 
A location should be selected that has the following characteristics: 
♦ Close to the treatment area

♦ Equipped with a suitable office space and electricity 
♦ Permeable area for mixing (if practical) 
♦ Inconspicuous (out of sight of the public and press)

Foliar Bait Spray Treatments 
Foliar bait spray treatment refers to the use of ground-control equipment, such as 
pump-up hand held sprayers, backpack sprayers, vehicle-mounted tank sprayers, 
etc., to apply bait spray directly to the underside of foliage on hosts and non-
hosts. Fruit flies are attracted to the protein hydrolysate and ingest the material, 
thereby receiving a lethal dose of the pesticide. 
♦ Personnel numbers are dependent on the size of the area to be treated and 
the density of hosts and properties in that area 
 A two-person team can treat approximately 40 to 50 properties per 
day, based on host and property density 
♦ Use the following formula to estimate the resources needed in urban or 
residential areas: 
 Assumptions: high density area = 2500 properties/mi2 
 Two-person team can treat 50 properties/day or 350 properties/7-
day week 
 No. of sq. mi. to treat × 2500 = X; X/350 = no. of control units 
needed for weekly application 
 Note: this calculation is for the number of two-person teams and 
does not include strike team leaders or other support personnel.

Equipment for use in urban areas includes the following: 
♦ Two-gallon pump-up sprayers have been the most efficient. Plastic 
sprayers are lightweight and economical. In order to minimize clogging, 
the sprayers and nozzles should be rinsed out at the end of each day 
♦ Truck mounted sprayers: conduct calculations to determine the amount of 
material that can be applied using the minimum settings of the spray 
nozzle. A 100–200-ft hose can be used as long as you have sufficient 
pressure 
♦ A supply truck should be stationed close to the treatment area in order to 
refill the sprayers with bait spray as needed throughout the day

Chemicals 
There are only two approved bait-insecticides for fruit fly eradication 
programs: GF-120 Naturalyte® (Spinosad, Dow AgroSciences LLC, 
Indianapolis, IN), an organically certified mixture of spinosad and fruit fly 
bait, and malathion2 (various manufacturers) plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait 
(Miller Chemical and Fertilizer Corp., Hanover, PA).  
Instructions for applying foliar bait sprays 
GF-120 Naturalyte® (GF-120 NF) and malathion/Nu-Lure® bait-sprays must 
be applied as a low volume application, either as a hand-wand spot-spray or 
with ultra–low volume application equipment.  
Hand-wand spray equipment for the bait-spray applications includes 2 to 4-
gallon backpack sprayers and 1 to 5-gallon (pump-up) sprayers. Larger 
capacity spray equipment (ultra–low volume) may be used that can be 
adjusted or retooled to apply large droplet sizes (4-6 mm). 
Application Procedures: Proper application techniques ensure 1) coverage 
of the target plants and 2) that an accurate dosage is applied for optimal 
fly control

2 Not all crops or this defined application regime are listed on malathion labels. If your crop is not listed on the 
malathion label, malathion is illegal to use on your crop. Therefore, the GF-120 NF might be the only treatment 
option unless a Special Local Needs label can be obtained under the authority of §24(c) of FIFRA for the use of 
a federally registered malathion product to meet special local needs of the program.

♦ Spot treatments should be made by applying the bait spray to the 
underside of the canopy in order to reduce direct exposure to sun and 
rain 
♦ A large spray droplet size of 4 to 6 mm is recommended to optimize the 
length of bait attractiveness 
♦ Begin applications as soon as monitoring indicates flies are present. 
Applications should be made every 7 to 14 days. Always refer to the 
label for timing and frequency of applications 
♦ All treatments on a property should be recorded 
♦ GF-120 NF will allow 1–3 oz of bait spray per host or non-host plant. 
If the average is four hosts or non-hosts per property, then a property 
would receive an average of 12 oz of bait spray (3 oz × 4 hosts/non-
hosts). If there are fewer than four hosts on a property, non-hosts 
should be used so at least four hosts or non-hosts are treated on each 
property

Mixing instructions for GF-120 Naturalyte® fruit fly bait 
GF‐120 NF is a concentrate that must be diluted with water before use. The 
dilution rate is 1:1.5 (GF‐120 NF: water). For example, to make 10 liters of 
spray solution, mix 4 liters of GF‐120 NF with 6 liters of water. 
♦ Add water (one half of the total volume of water) to the mixing tank 
and start the agitation system 
♦ Add the full amount of GF-120 NF 
♦ Use the remaining water (the second half of the total volume of water) 
to rinse the GF-120 containers 
♦ Before disposal, empty GF-120 NF containers will need to be triple-
rinsed; the rinsate from this process should be used in the mixing of 
the spray solution 
♦ Dispose of rinsed GF-120 NF containers appropriately 
♦ Agitate the spray solution for at least 5 minutes to ensure uniformity 
before dispensing it into individual sprayers

Mixing instructions for Malathion/Nu-Lure® 
Malathion plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait Mixture: The only approved insecticide to 
mix with Nu-Lure® Insect Bait is malathion. There are numerous malathion 
brands with different amounts of a.i. Use a malathion product that is labeled 
for your crop. You must apply 0.18 pounds of a.i. per acre. The amount of 
product that is applied per acre will vary with the malathion formulation you 
purchase.  
Following are some examples using the formula to calculate the amount of

The effectiveness of Nu-Lure® may be decreased or slowed when applied over 
copper spray residues or when sprayed in tank mixes with copper.  
Calibration of Spray Equipment: Note the following when calibrating spray 
equipment. 
♦ Have all calibration equipment on hand: graduated cylinder, buckets, 
stopwatch and recording material 
♦ Test the spray pattern and adjust for a large spray droplet size of 4–6 mm 
♦ Place the spray nozzle into a graduated cylinder and note the time it takes 
to spray out the desired amount (i.e., 1–3 oz). This is the amount of time it 
will take to apply 1–3 oz when conducting the treatments

Soil drenches 
The use of soil drench under the drip line of host trees where invasive fruit fly 
species have been detected has historically been a key pest control component 
used in regulatory quarantine and eradication. In addition, soil drenches are 
also used as a regulatory treatment in the certification process to allow 
movement of known host nursery stock in containers outside of fruit fly 
quarantine areas as described in Title 7 of the CFR.  
Lambda-cyhalothrin (Warrior II with Zeon Technology®, Syngenta Crop 
Protection, LLC. Greensboro, NC) is used as a soil drench to kill larvae and 
pupae in the soil and may be applied around mated female and larval detection 
sites or in fruit fly host production nurseries under quarantine. No other 
insecticides are currently available for regulatory soil treatments in fruit fly 
eradication programs. Lambda-cyhalothrin is a synthetic pyrethroid 
insecticide and acaricide.  
Applications of lambda-cyhalothrin could occur within the drip line of fruit-
bearing fruit fly host plants that are located within a 200 m radius from the

A Special Local Needs (SLN) label needs to be obtained/registered for this 
use. Work with your State Department of Agriculture Pesticide Registration 
Office.  
Application Rate: Apply 0.4 lbs a.i./acre, which equates to a single maximum 
rate of 0.0092 lbs a.i./1,000 sq. ft. of soil surface. This equals 0.56 fl oz of 
product in 15.5 gallons of water/1,000 ft2.  
Mixing Instructions: Mix 0.73 fl oz of product in 20 gallons of water to form a 
solution/suspension. Fifteen and one-half (15.5) gallons will treat 1,000 ft2 of 
surficial soil.  
Application within Drip Line of Fruit Bearing Host Plants: Applications will be 
made by or under the supervision of a licensed state or federal employee. Prior 
to application of the pesticide mixture, if necessary, remove all fruit from 
plant and pre-drench the areas to be treated with sufficient water to break the 
surface tension of soil and thereby allow adequate penetration by the 
insecticide. Based on risk assessment, drench the soil under the drip line of 
host plants located within a 200 m radius from a mated female or larval

host plants located within a 200 m radius from a mated female or larval 
detection. Make treatments such that no surface liquid remains in order to 
avoid non-target exposure of humans, animals and non-target species. In areas 
where absorption is slow, applicators will remain on-site until the application 
has been absorbed into the soil.  
Applications on Regulated Host Nursery Stock: Applications are to be made 
by a licensed applicator under the supervision of the appropriate state or 
federal official. Chemigation is not allowed. Apply to nursery stock using 
equipment that generates a coarse, low pressure spray. Make applications 
using sufficient volume to soak the entire contents of the nursery stock 
container.  
Do not drench to the point of runoff. Do not allow offsite movement of the 
treatment solution from treated area into sewers, drains, gutters or to any area 
where drainage to sewers, storm drains, water bodies or aquatic habitats can 
occur.

Larval Survey 
Fruit fly host material on a property where a fly has been detected must be 
inspected for possible larval infestation. Small circular oviposition scars are 
occasionally visible, indicating a potential infestation. In the absence of visible 
scars, 100 or more pieces of host material (preferred hosts if available) should be 
cut open at random and examined for larvae. First and second instar larvae are 
small and may be feeding immediately under the surface of the skin; therefore 
fruit cutting should be left to experienced personnel. Fruit fly host material on 
properties adjacent to a detection should also be inspected for larval infestation. 
If two or more flies are detected in close proximity, fruit cutting may be extended 
to all properties in a 200 m radius, concentrating on preferred hosts if available. 
Fruit can be inspected on the property

 therefore 
fruit cutting should be left to experienced personnel. Fruit fly host material on 
properties adjacent to a detection should also be inspected for larval infestation. 
If two or more flies are detected in close proximity, fruit cutting may be extended 
to all properties in a 200 m radius, concentrating on preferred hosts if available. 
Fruit can be inspected on the property or double-bagged and taken to another 
inspection site within the quarantine area. Do not move fruit fly host material out 
of the quarantine area.  
Fruit Removal 
If there is evidence of a breeding population (larval or gravid/mated female), all 
fruit fly host material will be removed from all hosts within 200 m of a known 
infestation, safeguarded by double-bagging, and taken to a project-approved 
incinerator or landfill site for burial under at least one foot of fill. These activities 
must be completed on a daily basis. 
Fruit removal is the physical removal of host fruit from plants or ground where 
fruit may have fallen, occurs at the detection sites and may extend outward to 200 
m, depending on the severity of the infestation.

Alternative Control Techniques 
This section outlines alternate control treatments. These techniques are not 
applicable for quarantine purposes. 
The economic objective of the control measures presented is to keep the 
maximum larval infestation of fresh market cherries to less than or equal to 2 
percent of the marketed crop, and of canning cherries to less than or equal to 6 
percent (Daniel and Baker, 2013). Sweet cherries with greater levels of larval 
infestation are sold to distillers at a greatly reduced price (Daniel and Baker, 
2013). 
Yellow sticky traps are used to mass trap as well as monitor the timing and 
density of moth emergence to guide timing of insecticide application (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012). However, sticky trap results cannot be used to monitor for 
economic threshold because other variables in levels of larval infestation of fruit 
include the weather conditions during oviposition and the crop load–relative 
numbers of mated females (Daniel, 2014). 
Mass Trapping 
Mass trapping with yellow sticky traps is used in organic cherry orchards as an 
alternative to chemical sprays (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). A field-tested 
prototype of an improved trap, with advantages over the widely used Rebell® 
amarillo cross-shaped sticky trap, was described by Daniel (2014). 
Adults are visibly distinct, as described in Chapter 4 and illustrated in Figs. 4-1 
and 4-2, and are trapped with yellow sticky traps placed in cherry trees or near 
honeysuckle (Daniel et al., 2014). A sticky trap of three-dimensional design 
(visible from all directions) with a primary reflectance peak at 500–550 nm and a 
secondary reflectance peak at 300–400 nm was found

(visible from all directions) with a primary reflectance peak at 500–550 nm and a 
secondary reflectance peak at 300–400 nm was found to capture the most flies 
and to be the most practical trap among tested designs (Daniel et al., 2014). 
Sanitation 
For varieties that allow it (i.e., early-maturing), cherry harvest should occur 
before mature pre-pupal larvae exit the host fruit to pupate in the soil. 
Unharvested infested cherries are a source of larvae and pupae for the next 
generation, and thus should be removed (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). To facilitate

complete and early harvest, trees should be appropriately pruned and tree height 
limited to 10-m (Daniel, 2014). 
Cultural Controls 
Fly emergence can be delayed by leaving grass growing uncut beneath tree 
canopies until shortly before harvest. The longer grass maintains the soil in a 
cooler state and thus can delay completion of fly development (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012).  
The emergence of adults from the soil can be reduced by covering the soil beneath 
tree canopies with white, fine-meshed (0.8 mm) netting. In two orchards over two 
years, soil netting reduced adult trap captures by 77 percent relative to un-netted 
controls; larval infestation of cherries was reduced 91 percent compared to 
controls (Daniel and Baker, 2013).

ies with white, fine-meshed (0.8 mm) netting. In two orchards over two 
years, soil netting reduced adult trap captures by 77 percent relative to un-netted 
controls; larval infestation of cherries was reduced 91 percent compared to 
controls (Daniel and Baker, 2013). 
Netting (1.3 mm) developing cherries in orchards of dwarf trees protected by hail 
net or from rain by plastic covers is reported to a be cost effective means of 
excluding reproductive adults from host fruit (Daniel, 2014). 
For new plantings, choose varieties that accommodate mechanical harvesting, 
which is more rapid than manual harvest (Daniel, 2014). 
Behavioral Control 
The efficacy of the sterile insect technique (the release of sterile males in numbers 
that result in an economically significant reduction in the number of fertilized 
eggs oviposited) has been demonstrated; however, the narrow host range of this 
species requires a mass rearing technique based on an alternative host or artificial 
host that has yet to be developed (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Biological Control 
Foliar application of Beauvaria bassiana (entomopathogenic fungus, formulated 
as "Naturalis®-L" bioinsecticide) is effective in organic cherry orchards (Daniel, 
2014). 
The efficacy of prospective soil treatments based on entomopathogenic 
nematodes and fungi versus pupae has been demonstrated in laboratory 
experiments (Daniel and Baker, 2013). However, efficacy could not be proven 
under field conditions; among unpublished results, nematodes were not effective, 
and fungi were only effective in years with heavy rainfall and persistent very wet 
soil conditions (Daniel, 2017).

and fungi were only effective in years with heavy rainfall and persistent very wet

Rhagoletis cerasi populations in Europe have been found to be infected with 
  Control Options 
2018-03 R. cerasi 6-13 
distinct strains of Wolbachia, intracellular bacteria suspected of being agents of 
cytoplasmic incompatibility between infected populations. When males infected 
with one strain mated with uninfected females or with females infected with a 
different Wolbachia strain, the resulting embryos died; when males and females 
infected with the same Wolbachia strain mated, the resulting embryos developed 
(Riegler and Stauffer, 2002). Thus, through the mechanism of cytoplasmic 
incompatibility, infection with distinct strains of Wolbachia was found to have 
resulted in geographically distinct R. cerasi populations in Europe (Arthofer et al., 
2009a). The prospect of applying cytoplasmic incompatibility, based on 
Wolbachia infection, to prevent an introduced population from becoming 
established has been proposed, but has not developed and implemented (Riegler 
and Stauffer, 2002). The limiting factor for this approach is the mass rearing of R. 
cerasi (Daniel, 2017). The challenges to mass rearing of R. cerasi include the 
following: 
1. Rhagoletis cerasi only oviposits in round objects, which are more 
expensive to produce than simpler oviposition substrates.

 limiting factor for this approach is the mass rearing of R. 
cerasi (Daniel, 2017). The challenges to mass rearing of R. cerasi include the 
following: 
1. Rhagoletis cerasi only oviposits in round objects, which are more 
expensive to produce than simpler oviposition substrates. 
2. Rhagoletis cerasi marks the oviposition site after oviposition, which 
results in only one egg/oviposition substrate and makes frequent 
replacement of oviposition substrate necessary and very labor intensive. 
3. Usually, under field conditions, only one larva per cherry is found. If two 
larvae meet within a fruit, they attack each other, and the older larva 
typically kills the younger one. Therefore, during laboratory rearing, 
larvae need to be kept individually, which can be costly in labor and 
materials. 
4. There is only one generation per year with a long obligatory winter 
diapause, making the rearing of a single generation very slow with high 
facilities costs.

New technology, research or assessment is needed to: 
♦ Determine the efficacy of sentinel cages for monitoring adult emergence 
♦ With the objective of increasing the ratio of actionable information to 
surveillance costs, identify existing or prospective networks by which soil 
temperature can be monitored in real time in order to identify when to 
begin monitoring host space for active adults  
♦ Optimize mass rearing of R. cerasi to facilitate inundative Wolbachia

Area 
 
Thirty-Day Pre-Harvest Treatment Program for Fresh Fruit and 
Vegetables  
GF-120 NF or Malathion/Nu-Lure® Bait Treatments 
1. If your farm is within the fruit fly quarantine area, but not in the 0.5 mile arc 
core area, and your crop is on the host list, you must sign a compliance 
agreement with the Fruit Fly Eradication Program and follow a specific 30-
day pre-harvest bait-spray treatment before harvesting your produce. Please 
call the Program Regulatory Office to sign a compliance agreement.

core area, and your crop is on the host list, you must sign a compliance 
agreement with the Fruit Fly Eradication Program and follow a specific 30-
day pre-harvest bait-spray treatment before harvesting your produce. Please 
call the Program Regulatory Office to sign a compliance agreement.  
2. Keep detailed records of your bait-sprays (i.e., GF-120 NF or malathion plus 
Nu-Lure®) purchases, use rates, use pattern and dates of application. 
3. Bait-spray applications must begin 30 days prior to harvest, with applications 
made every 6–10 days and continued throughout the harvest season. 
Note: If a quarantine fruit fly is trapped on or near your site (within a 0.5-mile 
arc) anytime during the 30-day pre-harvest period, you will be disqualified 
from the pre-harvest treatment option. Post-harvest treatments, if available, 
will apply in such cases. Examples of post-harvest treatments will include 
methyl bromide fumigations and cold treatments, among others. 
4. There are only two approved bait-insecticides for fruit fly eradication 
programs: GF-120 Naturalyte® (Spinosad, Dow AgroSciences LLC, 
Indianapolis, IN), an organically certified mixture of spinosad and fruit fly 
bait, and malathion3 (various manufacturers) plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait 
(Miller Chemical and Fertilizer Corp., Hanover, PA).

3 Not all crops or this defined application regime are listed on malathion labels. If your crop is not listed on the 
malathion label, it is illegal to use on your crop. Therefore, the GF-120 NF might be the only treatment option 
unless a Special Local Needs label can be obtained under the authority of §24(c) of FIFRA for the use of a 
federally registered malathion product to meet special local needs of the program.

Instructions for Applying the Bait-Sprays 
Malathion/Nu-Lure® and GF-120 NF bait-sprays  
This must be applied at a low volume application either as a hand-wand type 
spot-spray or with ultra-low volume application equipment. 
Spot-spray equipment for the bait-spray applications include a 2 to 4-gallon 
backpack sprayer and a 1 to 5-gallon (hand-wand type pump-up) sprayer. 
Larger capacity spray equipment (ultra-low volume) that can be adjusted or 
retooled to apply large droplet sizes (4–6 mm) may be used; however, contact 
the Program Regulatory office to be sure your

backpack sprayer and a 1 to 5-gallon (hand-wand type pump-up) sprayer. 
Larger capacity spray equipment (ultra-low volume) that can be adjusted or 
retooled to apply large droplet sizes (4–6 mm) may be used; however, contact 
the Program Regulatory office to be sure your application method meets the 
application requirements for the harvest certification program. 
GF-120 NF Naturalyte® fruit fly bait (EPA Reg. No. 62719-498)  
This is used as a very low volume hand-wand–type spot-spray application. 
This is NOT a high volume air-blast or high volume hand-gun type 
application. You must follow the label directions on the concentrations and 
mixing. 
The proper GF-120 NF rate is 20 oz of GF-120 NF mixed with 30 oz of water 
(this is a dilution rate of 1:1.5) per acre. The reasons for this rate and dilution 
are as follows:  
a. This is the most effective concentration (i.e., attracts and kills fruit 
flies better). 
b. The efficacy of GF-120 NF lasts longer at this rate. 
c. At this dilution rate (1:1.5), the material is least affected by rain. 
Application Directions: 
1. Use a large spray droplet size (4–6 mm). Set your nozzle tip or use nozzle 
tips that provide large droplets.  
2. Calibrate your spray equipment to deliver sufficient amounts with every 
burst of spray so that you can distribute 50 oz of material (20 oz GF-120 + 
30 oz water) throughout an acre of plants.  
3. Direct the bait spray to one
Text Len: 1431
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 mm). Set your nozzle tip or use nozzle 
tips that provide large droplets.  
2. Calibrate your spray equipment to deliver sufficient amounts with every 
burst of spray so that you can distribute 50 oz of material (20 oz GF-120 + 
30 oz water) throughout an acre of plants.  
3. Direct the bait spray to one or two spots (areas) on the inner canopy of the 
plant, spraying the underside of leaves on the inside of the canopy. This 
reduces the direct sun exposure and the potential for washing off of the 
material by rainfall. The idea is to create an area where a fruit fly would 
feed on the bait/insecticide and perish. This is not a contact insecticide. 
4. The pattern of application throughout the treated acre may depend upon 
plant type, size and spacing. The perimeter and inside of the planting 
should be sprayed. The main goal is to be sure to equally distribute the 50 
oz of bait spray (20 oz GF-120 + 30 oz water) throughout the entire one 
  Fruit and Vegetable Growers 
2018-03 R. cerasi C-3 
acre.  
♦ For example: In tree crops, spot treat every third or fourth tree around 
the perimeter, then inside the acre, spray every fourth to fifth tree in 
every fourth row. To be most effective, the pattern should change 
slightly with each successive application 
♦ For example: In vegetable crops, spot treat the perimeter and then spot 
treat at a reasonable distance down every fifth or sixth row. To be most 
effective, the pattern should change slightly with each successive 
application 
The REI (restricted entry interval) and pre-harvest interval for GF-120 NF 
is four hours.

The REI (restricted entry interval) and pre-harvest interval for GF-120 NF

Malathion plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait mixture 
The only approved insecticide to mix with Nu-Lure® Insect Bait is malathion. 
There are numerous malathion brands with different amounts of active 
ingredients (a.i.). Use a malathion product that is labeled for your crop. 
However, you must apply 0.18 lbs of a.i. per acre. The amount of product that 
is applied per acre will vary with the malathion formulation you purchase. 
Following are some examples using the formula to calculate the amount of 
product you need to apply 0.18 lbs a.i. malathion per acre:  
♦ GOWAN® Malathion 8 Flowable— 8 lbs a.i./gallon (128 oz) 
8 lbs a. i. gallon⁄
128 oz/gallon = Need 0.18 lbs acre⁄

Bonide Malathion 4.37 5.3 oz 9.6 oz 10–40 gallons 
It is critical to follow the label directions on the rates allowed per application, 
number of applications allowed per year and the application interval. If the 
interval is long (i.e., every 30 days) or the number of applications allowed in a 
  Fruit and Vegetable Growers 
2018-03 R. cerasi C-4 
year too low (i.e., no more than four), then the Malathion must be rotated with the 
GF-120 applications. 
This is also a low volume application and may be applied in the same way as the 
GF-120 NF spot treatment type application or with spray equipment that is 
capable of applying 10–40 gallons of material (Malathion/Nu-Lure® plus water) 
per acre with the proper droplet size (4–6 mm). Contact the Program Regulatory 
office to be sure it meets the application requirements for the harvest certification 
program.  
Malathion products must be applied at the rate of 0.18 lbs per acre as a foliar bait-
spray treatment at a 6 to 10-day interval for the 30-day pre-harvest treatment, and

 (4–6 mm). Contact the Program Regulatory 
office to be sure it meets the application requirements for the harvest certification 
program.  
Malathion products must be applied at the rate of 0.18 lbs per acre as a foliar bait-
spray treatment at a 6 to 10-day interval for the 30-day pre-harvest treatment, and 
continued at intervals of 6 to 10 days throughout the harvest season. 
♦ The water used for the solution should be buffered to pH 7.0 with an 
available buffer material 
♦ You must mix the Malathion with Nu-Lure® Insect Bait. Follow the label 
and calculations above for proper use and rates. The Nu-Lure® rate is 9.6 
fl oz/acre 
♦ Mix the Malathion plus the Nu-Lure® in 10 to 40 gallons of water. Apply 
the bait spray as a spot spray equally throughout the acre, treating the 
perimeter and inside of the planting in a similar pattern to the GF-120 NG 
application described above 
♦ Growers with crops not listed on a Malathion label should use the GF-120 
NF 
The effectiveness of Nu-Lure® may be decreased or slowed when applied over 
copper spray residues or when sprayed in tank mixes with copper.  
In addition to the bait-insecticide application procedures, all producers must 
follow the compliance agreement for moving produce from their farm in and out 
of the quarantine area.

1. Introduction 
 
 
 
 
 
New Pest Response Guidelines (NPRGs) are developed by Plant Protection and 
Quarantine (PPQ) in preparation for the plant health emergencies that occur when 
a new pest with the potential to seriously impact U.S. plant resources arrives in

information may be identified. In addition, each pest incursion has unique, site-
specific characteristics that are impossible to predict. Therefore, this document 
should be considered a general guideline only. As the pest situation evolves and 
new information is gathered, the response implemented—i ncluding survey 
protocols— may need to be modified from the original recommendations. 
 Additional documentation in Appendix D includes specific information for

Pest Summary 
Rhagoletis cerasi is univoltine and oligophagous (Boller and Prokopy, 1976) and 
is considered an important and highly destructive pest of Prunus avium (L.) L. 
(sweet cherries) in Europe (Daniel and Baker, 2013; Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Larvae develop inside the cherries, and without effective control methods, 100 
percent of the fruit can be infested (Daniel and Baker, 2013; Fimiani, 1983).  
Justification 
A photograph of a new fruit fly was taken in an urban park in Mississauga, 
Ontario, on 15 July 2015 (NAPPO, 2016). At the time, the fruit fly was tentatively 
identified as

Justification 
A photograph of a new fruit fly was taken in an urban park in Mississauga, 
Ontario, on 15 July 2015 (NAPPO, 2016). At the time, the fruit fly was tentatively 
identified as R. cerasi, and an initial detection survey was conducted by the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). On 27 June 2016, the CFIA confirmed 
the detection of R. cerasi in association with Lonicera spp. (NAPPO, 2016). 
 
Key Information 
♦ Rhagoletis cerasi has a limited host range, infesting only Prunus spp. and 
Lonicera spp. (Daniel and Grunder, 2012) 
♦ Without appropriate control measures, infestations can reach 100 percent, 
which can reduce marketable yields (Alford, 2007; Daniel and Grunder, 
2012) 
♦ Infested fruit damage tolerance levels in infested areas is typically set at 2 
percent of infested fruit. Additionally, infested fruit cannot be sorted out, 
therefore the whole lot is rejected if tolerance levels are exceeded (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012)

Biology and Ecology 
Rhagoletis cerasi is a univoltine (one generation per year) and oligophagous 
species with economic-pest status on sweet cherry. Its life cycle depends on the 
availability of Prunus and Lonicera spp. (honeysuckle) fruit (Daniel and Grunder, 
2012). Two putative genetic host races, distinguished by observed oviposition 
preference for P. avium or Lonicera xylosteum L., have been described by Boller 
et al. (1998) in terms of phenological differences (the timing of adult emergence 
from pupae relative to the timing of the host fruit-development stage) and 
behavioral differences (plasticity of host choice by ovipositing females; 
sensitivity to the host-marking pheromone deposited on host fruit by females after 
oviposition). However, in looking for genetic differences between the two 
phenotypes, only one of six examined allozyme loci suggested genetically distinct

races (Schwarz et al., 2003). Infection by one or more strains of Wolbachia may 
contribute to genetic differences among geographically dispersed populations 
(putative genetically distinct northern and southern races) via reproductive 
isolation through the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic 
incompatibility (Arthofer et al., 2009b; Riegler and Stauffer, 2002); although the 
potential contribution of other factors (geographic isolation; host distribution) has 
not been refuted (Augustinos et al., 2014). For

 races) via reproductive 
isolation through the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic 
incompatibility (Arthofer et al., 2009b; Riegler and Stauffer, 2002); although the 
potential contribution of other factors (geographic isolation; host distribution) has 
not been refuted (Augustinos et al., 2014). For the objectives and audience of this 
NPRG, the difference in emergence time of adults from pupae that developed 
beneath cherry trees, relative to those that developed beneath honeysuckle bushes, 
may be the most relevant distinction for those charged with responding to 
detection of an introduction of R. cerasi in a newly-invaded landscape (see 
Timing of Surveys, below). 
This species overwinters as diapausing pupae in soil proximal to the host (cherry 
or honeysuckle) (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Maximum emergence of adults 
occurs after approximately 180 days at temperatures below 5 °C during a pupal 
hibernation period of 9–10 months (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). However, Moraiti 
et al. (2014) showed that pupae collected from sites representing a wide range of 
host and climatic conditions accommodated varying temperature regimes through 
varying diapause duration. Fly emergence usually occurs from mid-May to mid-
June in southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria (latitudes 46–48 °N) when 
temperatures are above 15 °C. The emergence of adults from pupae in soil 
beneath Lonicera spp. lags a few days behind that of adults that emerge from 
pupae proximal to cherries (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

 °N) when 
temperatures are above 15 °C. The emergence of adults from pupae in soil 
beneath Lonicera spp. lags a few days behind that of adults that emerge from 
pupae proximal to cherries (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Based on variation in fly fitness, larval nutrition, host phenology and ambient 
temperatures, the period of adult emergence, flight, mating and oviposition can 
range from 7–11 weeks. Estimates of the life span of adults in the field range from 
4–7 weeks (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Eggs are oviposited into host fruit (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). There are three 
instars between the egg and adult stages; larval development occurs in host fruit. 
Embryonic development after oviposition into host fruit takes 2–10 days, 
depending on temperature. The duration of larval development varies with 
temperature and host quality. Larval development concludes when pre-pupal 
larvae emerge from host fruit, drop to proximal soil and burrow to a depth of 2 to 
5 cm beneath the surface to pupate (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Rhagoletis cerasi overwinters in the pupal stage in soil beneath perennial hosts 
(cherry and honeysuckle) (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). The duration and success 
of pupal development and adult emergence are influenced by host nutritional 
quality during the larval stage and soil temperature. Most adults emerge at the 
conclusion of one cycle of winter diapause; however, for varying percentages of

quality during the larval stage and soil temperature. Most adults emerge at the 
conclusion of one cycle of winter diapause; however, for varying percentages of 
  Pest Overview 
2018-03 R. cerasi 3-3 
individuals, pupation continues through two or more winters, thus ensuring 
survival during years when cherry fruits are not produced (Daniel and Grunder, 
2012).  This multiyear overwintering strategy should be considered when 
quarantine regulations are enacted. 
Models exist for predicting adult emergence based on soil temperature at 5 cm 
depth (Daniel, 2014). Adult emergence begins after 430 degree days above the 
pupal (soil) developmental threshold temperature of 5 °C (Daniel, 2014).  
The preoviposition period lasts six to 13 days, during which maturation of gonads 
concludes while adults feed on bacterial colonies inhabiting the surface of  host 
leaves and fruit, honeydew, extrafloral nectaries and bird feces (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012).  
Adults aggregate onto sunlit portions of the host when the temperature is above 
15 °C to mate (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Ambient conditions favorable to 
mating and oviposition most often occur on the southeast portion of the host. 
Fecundity ranges from 30–200 eggs per female; fertility ranges from 54–100 
percent (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Males guard individual cherries and emit a species-specific pheromone (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012). The relative importance of this pheromone and of host 
quality cues to the selection of an oviposition host is unclear. After forced

 from 54–100 
percent (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Males guard individual cherries and emit a species-specific pheromone (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012). The relative importance of this pheromone and of host 
quality cues to the selection of an oviposition host is unclear. After forced 
copulation with a male guarding the host cherry, the female pierces the cherry 
with her ovipositor and oviposits a single egg in the fruit; she then marks the 
cherry with a host-marking pheromone to preserve the resource for the single egg. 
However, during years of heavy infestation, multiple larvae have been found in a 
single cherry (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Factors determining the time of oviposition initiation include the nutritional state 
of females, ambient temperature and degree of cherry fruit maturity (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012). The time between mating and oviposition is unclear; it may be 
based on insolation and temperature. High levels of infestation are associated with 
prolonged periods of sunny weather and temperatures above 15 °C (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012) 
Oviposition occurs at midday on sunny days when temperatures are above 16 °C 
(Daniel and Grunder, 2012). The fruit fly prefers sweet cherries over Prunus 
cerasus L. (sour cherries), consistent with research demonstrating that subsequent 
larval development is more rapid and successful in pulp of lower acidity and 
higher sugar content. In sweet cherries, the preferred oviposition host is a fruit 
with pulp thickness of 5 mm or more, a hardened pit and a color stage 
transitioning from green to yellow (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Within orchards,

berries as oviposition hosts (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

Dispersal 
Natural Dispersal 
Rhagoletis cerasi rarely move far from their host plants, and disperse only when 
deprived of suitable fruits for oviposition due to early harvest or frost (Boller and 
Prokopy, 1976; Daniel and Grunder, 2012). It is at this point that females, 
followed by males, move from tree to tree until they find a suitable host. 
Laboratory studies have shown that R. cerasi is capable of flying more than 1 km 
in 24 hours (as cited in Daniel and Baker (2013)), although studies conducted 
under field conditions indicated that their maximum flight distance is between 
100 and 500 m, and in unique cases, as far as 3 km when no landing platforms are 
available (as cited in Daniel and Grunder (2012)). Within orchards, 95 percent of 
adults move to adjacent, late-ripening trees, and from there to Lonicera spp. 
bushes (Daniel and Grunder, 2012; Les

100 and 500 m, and in unique cases, as far as 3 km when no landing platforms are 
available (as cited in Daniel and Grunder (2012)). Within orchards, 95 percent of 
adults move to adjacent, late-ripening trees, and from there to Lonicera spp. 
bushes (Daniel and Grunder, 2012; Leski, 1963). Wind may also play a role in 
dispersal of adults (Daniel and Baker, 2013; Thiem, 1934). 
Human-Assisted Spread 
Movement of infested fruit is most likely the primary way R. cerasi is spread with 
human assistance (Daniel, 2017). It is nearly impossible to sort out infested 
cherries, and when marketed, the consumer will eventually notice the larvae. 
Thereafter, if put on a compost pile, larvae that survive and form pupae might be 
able to overwinter (Daniel, 2017).  
The movement of plants for planting could possibly involve soil infested with R. 
cerasi pupae (Landry and Mordecai, 2016). Larvae develop inside the fruit and 
drop to the soil under the tree canopy to pupate and overwinter (Boller, 1966).  
 
Potential Pathways of Introduction 
The introduction of R. cerasi into the U.S. would most likely be through the 
importation of infested cherry fruit. Between 1988 and 2016, R. cerasi immatures 
have been intercepted 114 times in fruit in baggage at U.S. ports of entry (PestID, 
2017). Although there is no indication of an open commercial pathway of 
commercial cherry fruit imported from regions where R. cerasi is known to be 
established (Landry and Mordecai, 2016), there is evidence of other Tephritidae

Further analysis on fruit fly interceptions at U.S. ports-of-entry from 2005 
through 2014 indicated that Tephritidae were intercepted on items for 
consumption (fruit) 96.8 percent of the time and that 96.2 percent of all pest 
interceptions were in international passenger baggage (Bigsby et al., 2016).

Boller and Remund (1983) determined that emergence of R. cerasi requires 430 
degree-days above a base developmental temperature of 5 °C. Various other 
studies conducted also determined that in order for the maximum emergence of R. 
cerasi adults to occur, temperatures had to be below 5 °C for approximately 180 
days (Daniel and Grunder, 2012; Leski, 1963; Thiem, 1934; Vallo et al., 1976).  
Moraiti et al. (2014) recently determined that diapause termination could 
successfully occur with winter temperatures at 8 °C and that diapause intensity 
and temperature requirements can vary depending on the geographic origin of the 
population.  
Tart cherry distribution in the U.S. is mainly in Michigan, while sweet cherries

Larvae 
Larval development occurs within the host fruit, where larvae feed on fruit pulp; 
neonates tunnel toward the cherry pit to avoid predators and parasitoids. There are 
three instars; mature third instar larvae are translucent white and measure 
approximately 6 mm long (Fig. 4-4) (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

Pupae 
Prepupal third instars form exit holes in the fruit skin as they emerge to drop to 
the soil beneath the host, where they quickly burrow and pupate (Fig. 4-5). The 
depth of pupation varies with soil texture, from 2 cm in clay soils to 5 cm in sandy 
soils. The puparium is cylindrical, approximately 2 × 4 mm and straw yellow. 
Pupae are the overwintering stage and remain in the soil for 9–10 months, as 
studied in Germany, Switzerland and Austria (Daniel and Grunder, 2012).

Signs and Symptoms 
Larval maturation within cherry fruit is associated with sunken brown lesions 
(Fig. 4-6) (Noma et al., 2010). Exit holes remain after the pre-pupal larvae exit 
the cherry fruit to pupate in soil beneath the host (Fig. 4-7) (Daniel and Grunder, 
2012).

5. Delimitation Survey 
 
 
 
 
When one or more European cherry fruit flies are collected in an area, implement 
a delimiting survey immediately to determine the population distribution. The 
standard fruit fly delimitation design that has been approved for all other exotic 
tephritids is recommended. Collection of adults can be accomplished with trap 
and lure combinations. An alternative method that can also be used is sweep 
netting (Jackson and Moylett, 2016). 
During ECFF outbreaks, the USDA and relevant State Departments of 
Agriculture will operate under Unified Command and each agency will designate 
an incident commander to be responsible for the overall project and 
administrative functions. 
If circumstances warrant, the Unified Command may request the assistance of 
APHIS–PPQ’s Incident Management Team. The project will use the Incident 
Command System in handling the project activities.

Delimitation Area 
The total delimitation area may depend on information from trace-back and trace-
forward investigations; pest identification; the nearby host distribution, including 
the extent of natural and artificial dispersal; agency resources and logistics. The 
delimiting survey boundaries can be as specific as production sites or as broad as 
political or geographical boundaries.  
Along with other factors, the delimited area depends on the flight capacity of the 
exotic pest. The delimitation area may also be influenced by other specifics that 
are only known at the time of introduction. For instance, the location of 
introduction, occurrence of high-risk pathways, density and distribution of hosts 
near the initial detection area, wind direction and available surveillance resources 
at the time of introduction all may influence the delimitation area.

exotic pest. The delimitation area may also be influenced by other specifics that 
are only known at the time of introduction. For instance, the location of 
introduction, occurrence of high-risk pathways, density and distribution of hosts 
near the initial detection area, wind direction and available surveillance resources 
at the time of introduction all may influence the delimitation area. 
The range of dispersal of R. cerasi is determined by the availability of host fruit; 
thus, the delimited area can be determined by host distribution.  
Traps and Placement 
The CAPS approved method is a protein-baited yellow sticky card with a lure of 
ammonium acetate in a polycon dispenser (Molet and Moylett, 2016). Place traps 
around the perimeter of the orchard and in the middle section of the tree canopy 
on the outside edge of the tree with the yellow surface of the trap facing outward 
(Molet and Moylett, 2016). Traps may also be placed in honeysuckle. If the main 
stem is large enough, hang the trap; if not, use a wooden or metal stake placed in 
close proximity to the host, making sure the trap is level with the crown of the 
plant (Molet and Moylett, 2016). 
Following the confirmation of a detected specimen as ECFF, increase trap 
densities in the core square-mile area within 24-48 hours. Optimally, place traps 
over an 81-square mile area in a 100-50-25-20-10 array (Fig. 5-1) (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2003). This includes a core mile area surrounded by four concentric 
buffer square miles for a total of approximately 81 square miles depending on the 
factors mentioned above. Increase trap densities in the

over an 81-square mile area in a 100-50-25-20-10 array (Fig. 5-1) (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ, 2003). This includes a core mile area surrounded by four concentric 
buffer square miles for a total of approximately 81 square miles depending on the 
factors mentioned above. Increase trap densities in the remainder of the trapping 
area from the core outward, if possible, within 72 hours of the find (Table 5-1) 
(USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2003). Reduce overall trap numbers if there are areas that 
do not support hosts. For example, if any square mile of the area contains only 25 
percent hosts, then the total numbers recommended in that square mile would be 
  Delimitation Survey 
2018-03 R. cerasi 5-3 
reduced by approximately 75 percent.

Trap Servicing 
During the first week, service traps in the core mile daily. If you find a second fly 
during this first week of intensive trapping, service traps in the core area twice 
weekly and place increased emphasis on servicing traps in the buffer areas in an 
effort to better delimit the infestation (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2003). Traps in the 
eight square miles around the core need to be serviced every two days. Check all 
other traps at least once within the first week. Service all traps weekly for three 
life cycles of the fly beyond the last fly detected. Relocate traps to available 
preferred hosts as practical (USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 2003). 
Once the ammonium acetate dispenser has been expelled, discard the polycon and 
replace it with a new pre-loaded polycon (Molet and Moylett, 2016). Polycon

Other Survey Techniques for Delimitation 
Overwintering pupae are found in soil proximal to the host, at a depth of 2–5 cm, 
varying with soil texture from clayey to sandy (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). A 
method for sampling soil and extracting pupae has been described for the Western 
cherry fruit fly (AliNiazee, 1974). 
Sampling of Soil for Pupae 
The soil depth at which the 2 × 4 mm pupae have been reported to pupate has 
ranged from 2 cm in clay soils to 5 cm in sandy soils (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
AliNiazee (1974) described a wet-sieving method for surveying cherry orchard 
soils in western Oregon (Albany) for pupae of the western cherry fruit fly. Most 
pupae were found within 10 cm of the soil surface; however, up to 12.5 percent of 
pupae in a sampled area were found at a depth of 15.24 cm.  
♦ Collect soil beneath host using a sample size of 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm 
diameter × 2.5 cm depth., down to 15.

Visual Inspection for Larvae during Delimiting Survey 
In addition to flight-interception trapping of adults, larval surveys are conducted 
in host fruit (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). Signs and symptoms of R. cerasi larval 
activity in cherries include presence of ovipositing adults on fruit, darkening of 
fruit, soft spots on fruit, exit holes on fruit made by mature (pre-pupal) larvae, 
shriveled or wilted fruit and rotten fruit (USDA-APHIS-PPQ-CPHST, 2016). 
Additionally, fruits may be sliced to actively look for larvae. A method of

Additionally, fruits may be sliced to actively look for larvae. A method of 
  Delimitation Survey 
2018-03 R. cerasi 5-5 
surveying cherry and honeysuckle fruit for larvae is described by Daniel and 
Grunder (2012): 
♦ Collect 100 ripe cherries or Lonicera spp. berries 
♦ Crush fruits to a degree sufficient to dislodge and separate the pits 
♦ Add the de-pitted fruits to a 1,000-ml aqueous solution containing 
350 g salt 
♦ After 10 minutes of immersion, count floating larvae 
 
Timing of Surveys 
Rhagoletis cerasi is univoltine and overwinters as pupae in soil proximal to the 
host. Pupal diapause concludes after 180 days below 5 °C; adult emergence 
occurs after 430 day-degrees above that temperature (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
The period of adult emergence, flight, mating and oviposition can range from 7–
11 weeks, coinciding with temperatures above 15 °C (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Adult emergence begins after 430 degree days above the pupal (soil) 
developmental threshold temperature of 5 °C (Daniel, 2014). Models exist for 
predicting adult emergence based on soil temperature at 5 cm depth (Daniel, 
2014). The emergence of adults from pupae in soil beneath Lonicera spp. lags a 
few days behind that of adults that emerge from pupae proximal to cherries 
(Daniel and Gru
Text Len: 1449
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
al threshold temperature of 5 °C (Daniel, 2014). Models exist for 
predicting adult emergence based on soil temperature at 5 cm depth (Daniel, 
2014). The emergence of adults from pupae in soil beneath Lonicera spp. lags a 
few days behind that of adults that emerge from pupae proximal to cherries 
(Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
After adult emergence and feeding on the host and in the vicinity of the host to 
promote sexual maturity, mating and oviposition occurs where the host fruit is 
exposed to sunlight. Adults prefer sweet cherries  over sour cherries; in sweet 
cherries, the preferred oviposition host is a fruit with pulp thickness of 5 mm or 
more, a hardened pit and a color stage transitioning from green to yellow (Daniel 
and Grunder, 2012). Larvae develop in cherries until they have matured and leave 
the fruit to pupate in adjacent soil or until fruit are harvested or destroyed by 
disease organisms or weather events (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Guidance for CAPS suggests surveying for R. cerasi adults in the U.S. from May 
through July, when weather conditions are hot and dry (USDA-APHIS-PPQ-
CPHST, 2016). Survey of cherry fruit for larvae can begin soon after oviposition 
begins in mid-June and when host fruit starts to become available (USDA-
APHIS-PPQ-CPHST, 2016).

6. Eradication and Control 
Procedures 
 
 
This chapter presents known control options available for this pest and 
summarizes how widely used they are in the United States. 
This information can be used by PPQ decision-makers after a detection to assess 
the suitability of potential actions to eradicate, contain or suppress R. cerasi. The 
efficacy and feasibility of each control option will depend on the pest situation at 
the time of detection. Factors such as where the pest is detected (i.e., natural or 
urban environment, agricultural crops, greenhouses), how widespread the pest is, 
the climatic region, the time of year, the phenology of the host and what current 
practices are already in place contribute to determining whether a particular 
control option is appropriate. With respect to detection of an introduction of 
Rhagoletis cerasi, in the absence of recurring introductions, the prospect of 
eradicating a small, geographically isolated population of this oligophagous, 
univoltine species is favored by its susceptibility to three classes of chemical 
insecticides (see below). 
 
Regulatory Procedures 
♦ Hold Notices: After an infestation is known to exist, operations personnel 
will issue hold orders on all properties known to be infested with ECFF

Environmental Assessment and Public Notifications Regarding 
Eradication Treatments 
At the time of an eradication treatment, a site specific Environmental Assessment 
will be completed and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) signed, and 
the public will be notified regarding the findings.  
The purpose of notification is to comply with state/federal law and present 
accurate information in an understandable and non-threatening format to 
concerned groups. Local and state elected representatives of the residents in the 
treatment area will be notified and apprised of major developments before and 
during treatment. During ground treatment activities, any resident whose property 
will be treated with foliar sprays following the discovery of infested fruit on or 
near their property will be notified in writing prior to treatment. Treatment notices 
include the name of the pest to be eradicated, the material to be used and a phone 
number to call in case of additional questions on project operations. Following 
treatment, a completion notice is left detailing any precautions the homeowner 
should take, including harvest intervals on treated fruit. Treatment without prior 
notification may be necessary on a

include the name of the pest to be eradicated, the material to be used and a phone 
number to call in case of additional questions on project operations. Following 
treatment, a completion notice is left detailing any precautions the homeowner 
should take, including harvest intervals on treated fruit. Treatment without prior 
notification may be necessary on a small number of properties if active larvae are 
detected. However, reasonable efforts will be made to contact the homeowner.  
In the event of aerial treatment operations, notification will be made either by 
hand delivery or first class mail at least 72 hours before the first pesticide 
application begins, or in a declared emergency situation, at least 24 hours before 
treatment (USDA-APHIS, 2015). The information contained in the notice will 
include that noted above plus the aerial treatment boundaries and the number of a 
toll-free hotline to answer health related questions. 
 
Eradication Methods and Procedures 
Control Tactics 
Ground control is comprised of three elements: foliar bait spray treatments of 
host and/or non-host plants with hand or mechanical ground spray equipment, soil 
drenching hosts around larval or mated female detections and removal of all fruit 
(fruit removal). Foliar bait spray treatments target the adult life stage of the fruit 
fly. Soil drenching under the drip-line of a host plant targets the larval or pupae 
stage in the soil. Fruit removal is conducted in order to break the life cycle by 
eliminating any potential hosts for egg oviposition and larval development.

  Control Options 
2018-03 R. cerasi 6-3 
The following outline has been developed to provide direction through the initial 
stages of a ground control program: 
♦ Control triggers are met, fly identification is confirmed and a treatment 
area is defined based on fly distribution and the current action plan 
♦ State Agricultural authorities and regulations are required and used for 
official plant pest eradication and pesticide treatments for intrastate 
quarantines. Federal and state program officials must work together on 
control and eradication of plant pests 
♦ Compliance with the Endangered Species Act and NEPA: A site specific 
Environmental Assessment will be required and prepared by the APHIS 
Environmental Risk Assessment Staff (ERAS). Also, sensitive 
environmental sites to be excluded from treatment are identified in 
cooperation with the Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and local government agencies 
 Environmental and Biological Assessments conducted prior to 
treatment 
♦ The Public Information Officer (PIO) must issue a public notification via 
the news media at least 24 hours in advance of treatment. This notification 
should include treatment area boundaries, common roadways and 
landmarks for reference, anticipated dates of treatment, information about 
the pesticide used and the program help-line telephone number 
♦ Equipment and personnel are mobilized. All control equipment is brought 
to a suitable location. Control personnel are contacted for immediate 
deployment: strike teams consisting of three to four 2-person units are 
assigned to sections of the treatment area, depending on equipment used.

Treatment Notification 
The following procedures pertain to foliar bait spays and soil drench applications 
by ground-based treatment crews: 
♦ Notify the property owner 24 hours before treatment 
 Leave a Pre-Treatment Notification Form at the residence on the 
front door or in another visible place (do not leave the form in the 
property’s USPS mailbox) 
 If contact is made and permission is granted, begin treatment 
♦ When beginning treatment, attempt to make contact with the 
resident/homeowner

Foliar Bait Spray Treatments 
Foliar bait spray treatment refers to the use of ground-control equipment, such as 
pump-up hand held sprayers, backpack sprayers, vehicle-mounted tank sprayers, 
etc., to apply bait spray directly to the underside of foliage on hosts and non-
hosts. Fruit flies are attracted to the protein hydrolysate and ingest the material, 
thereby receiving a lethal dose of the pesticide. 
♦ Personnel numbers are dependent on the size of the area to be treated and 
the density of hosts and properties in that area 
 A two-person team can treat approximately 40 to 50 properties per 
day, based on host and property density 
♦ Use the following formula to estimate the resources needed in urban or 
residential areas: 
 Assumptions: high density area = 2500 properties/mi2 
 Two-person team can treat 50 properties/day or 350 properties/7-
day week 
 No. of sq. mi. to treat × 2500 = X; X/350 = no. of control units 
needed for weekly application 
 Note: this calculation is for the number of two-person teams and 
does not include strike team leaders or other support personnel.

Chemicals 
There are only two approved bait-insecticides for fruit fly eradication 
programs: GF-120 Naturalyte® (Spinosad, Dow AgroSciences LLC, 
Indianapolis, IN), an organically certified mixture of spinosad and fruit fly 
bait, and malathion2 (various manufacturers) plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait 
(Miller Chemical and Fertilizer Corp., Hanover, PA).  
Instructions for applying foliar bait sprays 
GF-120 Naturalyte® (GF-120 NF) and malathion/Nu-Lure® bait-sprays must 
be applied as a low volume application, either as a hand-wand spot-spray or 
with ultra–low volume application equipment.  
Hand-wand spray equipment for the bait-spray applications includes 2 to 4-
gallon backpack sprayers and 1 to 5-gallon (pump-up) sprayers. Larger 
capacity spray equipment (ultra–low volume) may be used that can be 
adjusted or retooled to apply large droplet sizes (4-6 mm). 
Application Procedures: Proper application techniques ensure 1) coverage 
of the target plants and 2) that an accurate dosage is applied for optimal 
fly control

♦ A large spray droplet size of 4 to 6 mm is recommended to optimize the 
length of bait attractiveness 
♦ Begin applications as soon as monitoring indicates flies are present. 
Applications should be made every 7 to 14 days. Always refer to the 
label for timing and frequency of applications 
♦ All treatments on a property should be recorded 
♦ GF-120 NF will allow 1–3 oz of bait spray per host or non-host plant. 
If the average is four hosts or non-hosts per property, then a property 
would receive an average of 12 oz of bait spray (3 oz × 4 hosts/non-
hosts). If there are fewer than four hosts on a property, non-hosts 
should be used so at least four hosts or non-hosts are treated on each

Mixing instructions for GF-120 Naturalyte® fruit fly bait 
GF‐120 NF is a concentrate that must be diluted with water before use. The 
dilution rate is 1:1.5 (GF‐120 NF: water). For example, to make 10 liters of 
spray solution, mix 4 liters of GF‐120 NF with 6 liters of water. 
♦ Add water (one half of the total volume of water) to the mixing tank 
and start the agitation system 
♦ Add the full amount of GF-120 NF 
♦ Use the remaining water (the second half of the total volume of water) 
to rinse the GF-120 containers 
♦ Before disposal, empty GF-120 NF containers will need to be triple-
rinsed; the rinsate from this process should be used in the mixing of 
the spray solution 
♦ Dispose of rinsed GF-120 NF containers appropriately 
♦ Agitate the spray solution for at least 5 minutes to ensure uniformity 
before dispensing it into individual sprayers

Mixing instructions for Malathion/Nu-Lure® 
Malathion plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait Mixture: The only approved insecticide to 
mix with Nu-Lure® Insect Bait is malathion. There are numerous malathion 
brands with different amounts of a.i. Use a malathion product that is labeled 
for your crop. You must apply 0.18 pounds of a.i. per acre. The amount of 
product that is applied per acre will vary with the malathion formulation you 
purchase.

The effectiveness of Nu-Lure® may be decreased or slowed when applied over 
copper spray residues or when sprayed in tank mixes with copper.  
Calibration of Spray Equipment: Note the following when calibrating spray 
equipment. 
♦ Have all calibration equipment on hand: graduated cylinder, buckets, 
stopwatch and recording material 
♦ Test the spray pattern and adjust for a large spray droplet size of 4–6 mm 
♦ Place the spray nozzle into a graduated cylinder and note the time it takes 
to spray out the desired amount (i.e., 1–3 oz). This is the amount of time it 
will take to apply 1–3 oz when conducting the treatments

Soil drenches 
The use of soil drench under the drip line of host trees where invasive fruit fly 
species have been detected has historically been a key pest control component 
used in regulatory quarantine and eradication. In addition, soil drenches are 
also used as a regulatory treatment in the certification process to allow 
movement of known host nursery stock in containers outside of fruit fly 
quarantine areas as described in Title 7 of the CFR.  
Lambda-cyhalothrin (Warrior II with Zeon Technology®, Syngenta Crop 
Protection, LLC. Greensboro, NC) is used as a soil drench to kill larvae and 
pupae in the soil and may be applied around mated female and larval detection 
sites or in fruit fly host production nurseries under quarantine. No other 
insecticides are currently available for regulatory soil treatments in fruit fly 
eradication programs. Lambda-cyhalothrin is a synthetic pyrethroid 
insecticide and acaricide.  
Applications of lambda-cyhalothrin could occur within the drip line of fruit-

A Special Local Needs (SLN) label needs to be obtained/registered for this 
use. Work with your State Department of Agriculture Pesticide Registration 
Office.  
Application Rate: Apply 0.4 lbs a.i./acre, which equates to a single maximum 
rate of 0.0092 lbs a.i./1,000 sq. ft. of soil surface. This equals 0.56 fl oz of 
product in 15.5 gallons of water/1,000 ft2.  
Mixing Instructions: Mix 0.73 fl oz of product in 20 gallons of water to form a 
solution/suspension. Fifteen and one-half (15.5) gallons will treat 1,000 ft2 of 
surficial soil.  
Application within Drip Line of Fruit Bearing Host Plants: Applications will be 
made by or under the supervision of a licensed state or federal employee. Prior 
to application of the pesticide mixture, if necessary, remove all fruit from 
plant and pre-drench the areas to be treated with sufficient water to break the 
surface tension of soil and thereby allow adequate penetration by the 
insecticide. Based on risk assessment, drench the soil under the drip line of 
host plants located within a 200 m radius from a mated female or larval

host plants located within a 200 m radius from a mated female or larval 
detection. Make treatments such that no surface liquid remains in order to 
avoid non-target exposure of humans, animals and non-target species. In areas 
where absorption is slow, applicators will remain on-site until the application 
has been absorbed into the soil.  
Applications on Regulated Host Nursery Stock: Applications are to be made 
by a licensed applicator under the supervision of the appropriate state or 
federal official. Chemigation is not allowed. Apply to nursery stock using 
equipment that generates a coarse, low pressure spray. Make applications 
using sufficient volume to soak the entire contents of the nursery stock 
container.  
Do not drench to the point of runoff. Do not allow offsite movement of the 
treatment solution from treated area into sewers, drains, gutters or to any area 
where drainage to sewers, storm drains, water bodies or aquatic habitats can 
occur.

Larval Survey 
Fruit fly host material on a property where a fly has been detected must be 
inspected for possible larval infestation. Small circular oviposition scars are 
occasionally visible, indicating a potential infestation. In the absence of visible 
scars, 100 or more pieces of host material (preferred hosts if available) should be 
cut open at random and examined for larvae. First and second instar larvae are 
small and may be feeding immediately under the surface of the skin; therefore 
fruit cutting should be left to experienced personnel. Fruit fly host material on 
properties adjacent to a detection should also be inspected for larval infestation. 
If two or more flies are detected in close proximity, fruit cutting may be extended 
to all properties in a 200 m radius, concentrating on preferred hosts if available.

properties adjacent to a detection should also be inspected for larval infestation. 
If two or more flies are detected in close proximity, fruit cutting may be extended 
to all properties in a 200 m radius, concentrating on preferred hosts if available. 
Fruit can be inspected on the property or double-bagged and taken to another 
inspection site within the quarantine area. Do not move fruit fly host material out 
of the quarantine area.  
Fruit Removal 
If there is evidence of a breeding population (larval or gravid/mated female), all 
fruit fly host material will be removed from all hosts within 200 m of a known 
infestation, safeguarded by double-bagging, and taken to a project-approved 
incinerator or landfill site for burial under at least one foot of fill. These activities 
must be completed on a daily basis. 
Fruit removal is the physical removal of host fruit from plants or ground where 
fruit may have fallen, occurs at the detection sites and may extend outward to 200 
m, depending on the severity of the infestation.

Alternative Control Techniques 
This section outlines alternate control treatments. These techniques are not 
applicable for quarantine purposes. 
The economic objective of the control measures presented is to keep the 
maximum larval infestation of fresh market cherries to less than or equal to 2 
percent of the marketed crop, and of canning cherries to less than or equal to 6 
percent (Daniel and Baker, 2013). Sweet cherries with greater levels of larval 
infestation are sold to distillers at a greatly reduced price (Daniel and Baker, 
2013). 
Yellow sticky traps are used to mass trap as well as monitor the timing and 
density of moth emergence to guide timing of insecticide application (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012). However, sticky trap results cannot be used to monitor for 
economic threshold because other variables in levels of larval infestation of fruit 
include the weather conditions during oviposition and the crop load–relative 
numbers of mated females (Daniel, 2014). 
Mass Trapping 
Mass trapping with yellow sticky traps is used in organic cherry orchards as an 
alternative to chemical sprays (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). A field-tested 
prototype of an improved trap, with advantages over the widely used Rebell® 
amarillo cross-shaped sticky trap, was described by Daniel (2014). 
Adults are visibly distinct, as described in Chapter 4 and illustrated in Figs. 4-1 
and 4-2, and are trapped with yellow sticky traps placed in cherry trees or near 
honeysuckle (Daniel et al., 2014). A sticky trap of three-dimensional design 
(visible from all directions) with a primary reflectance peak at 500–550 nm and a 
secondary reflectance peak at 300–400 nm was found

and 4-2, and are trapped with yellow sticky traps placed in cherry trees or near 
honeysuckle (Daniel et al., 2014). A sticky trap of three-dimensional design 
(visible from all directions) with a primary reflectance peak at 500–550 nm and a 
secondary reflectance peak at 300–400 nm was found to capture the most flies 
and to be the most practical trap among tested designs (Daniel et al., 2014). 
Sanitation 
For varieties that allow it (i.e., early-maturing), cherry harvest should occur 
before mature pre-pupal larvae exit the host fruit to pupate in the soil. 
Unharvested infested cherries are a source of larvae and pupae for the next 
generation, and thus should be removed (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). To facilitate 
  Control Options 
2018-03 R. cerasi 6-12 
complete and early harvest, trees should be appropriately pruned and tree height 
limited to 10-m (Daniel, 2014). 
Cultural Controls 
Fly emergence can be delayed by leaving grass growing uncut beneath tree 
canopies until shortly before harvest. The longer grass maintains the soil in a 
cooler state and thus can delay completion of fly development (Daniel and 
Grunder, 2012).  
The emergence of adults from the soil can be reduced by covering the soil beneath 
tree canopies with white, fine-meshed (0.8 mm) netting. In two orchards over two 
years, soil netting reduced adult trap captures by 77 percent relative to un-netted 
controls; larval infestation of cherries was reduced 91 percent compared to 
controls (Daniel and Baker, 2013).

ies with white, fine-meshed (0.8 mm) netting. In two orchards over two 
years, soil netting reduced adult trap captures by 77 percent relative to un-netted 
controls; larval infestation of cherries was reduced 91 percent compared to 
controls (Daniel and Baker, 2013). 
Netting (1.3 mm) developing cherries in orchards of dwarf trees protected by hail 
net or from rain by plastic covers is reported to a be cost effective means of 
excluding reproductive adults from host fruit (Daniel, 2014). 
For new plantings, choose varieties that accommodate mechanical harvesting, 
which is more rapid than manual harvest (Daniel, 2014). 
Behavioral Control 
The efficacy of the sterile insect technique (the release of sterile males in numbers 
that result in an economically significant reduction in the number of fertilized 
eggs oviposited) has been demonstrated; however, the narrow host range of this 
species requires a mass rearing technique based on an alternative host or artificial 
host that has yet to be developed (Daniel and Grunder, 2012). 
Biological Control 
Foliar application of Beauvaria bassiana (entomopathogenic fungus, formulated 
as "Naturalis®-L" bioinsecticide) is effective in organic cherry orchards (Daniel, 
2014). 
The efficacy of prospective soil treatments based on entomopathogenic 
nematodes and fungi versus pupae has been demonstrated in laboratory 
experiments (Daniel and Baker, 2013). However, efficacy could not be proven 
under field conditions; among unpublished results, nematodes were not effective, 
and fungi were only effective in years with heavy rainfall and persistent very wet 
soil conditions (Daniel, 2017).

and fungi were only effective in years with heavy rainfall and persistent very wet 
soil conditions (Daniel, 2017). 
Rhagoletis cerasi populations in Europe have been found to be infected with 
  Control Options 
2018-03 R. cerasi 6-13 
distinct strains of Wolbachia, intracellular bacteria suspected of being agents of 
cytoplasmic incompatibility between infected populations. When males infected 
with one strain mated with uninfected females or with females infected with a 
different Wolbachia strain, the resulting embryos died; when males and females 
infected with the same Wolbachia strain mated, the resulting embryos developed 
(Riegler and Stauffer, 2002). Thus, through the mechanism of cytoplasmic 
incompatibility, infection with distinct strains of Wolbachia was found to have 
resulted in geographically distinct R. cerasi populations in Europe (Arthofer et al., 
2009a). The prospect of applying cytoplasmic incompatibility, based on 
Wolbachia infection, to prevent an introduced population from becoming 
established has been proposed, but has not developed and implemented (Riegler 
and Stauffer, 2002). The limiting factor for this approach is the mass rearing of R. 
cerasi (Daniel, 2017). The challenges to mass rearing of R. cerasi include the 
following: 
1. Rhagoletis cerasi only oviposits in round objects, which are more 
expensive to produce than simpler oviposition substrates.

 limiting factor for this approach is the mass rearing of R. 
cerasi (Daniel, 2017). The challenges to mass rearing of R. cerasi include the 
following: 
1. Rhagoletis cerasi only oviposits in round objects, which are more 
expensive to produce than simpler oviposition substrates. 
2. Rhagoletis cerasi marks the oviposition site after oviposition, which 
results in only one egg/oviposition substrate and makes frequent 
replacement of oviposition substrate necessary and very labor intensive. 
3. Usually, under field conditions, only one larva per cherry is found. If two 
larvae meet within a fruit, they attack each other, and the older larva 
typically kills the younger one. Therefore, during laboratory rearing, 
larvae need to be kept individually, which can be costly in labor and 
materials. 
4. There is only one generation per year with a long obligatory winter 
diapause, making the rearing of a single generation very slow with high 
facilities costs.

 of Action 
 
 
 
 
Once a fly has been detected, the chronology of action is as follows: 
♦ 24 hours: Trap density increased to protocol levels within core area around 
each fly find 
♦ 48 hours: First inspection of traps 
♦ 72 hours: Trap density increased to protocol levels in 81-mi2 area around 
each fly find 
♦ First week: Daily inspection of project traps in core area 
♦ Second week: Weekly inspection of project traps 
Ground treatments conducted within a minimum of 200 m around the wild fly 
find begin as follows: 
♦ 24–36 hours: Notification and larval survey begins 
♦ 24–48 hours after notification: Pesticide treatment (bait spray) begins 
♦ First week: Completion of first pesticide treatment 
Handle any new treatment areas established due to additional fly finds within the 
same time frame as the first area.

Plan Summary 
 
 
 
Rhagoletis cerasi Detected:  
1. 81-square mile area delimiting grid/survey initiated—less than this if 
within an existing sterile PRP (approximately 9 mi2 depending on the 
infestation level). 
2. Fruit cutting conducted within 200 m of fly finds (larval survey) for three 
life cycles while hosts are available. 
3. Ground applied bait sprays conducted within 200 m of fly finds for three 
life cycles (optional).  
4. If triggers are not reached after three life cycles: no quarantine action or 
further survey/treatments.

life cycles while hosts are available. 
3. Ground applied bait sprays conducted within 200 m of fly finds for three 
life cycles (optional).  
4. If triggers are not reached after three life cycles: no quarantine action or 
further survey/treatments. 
5. If triggers are reached:  
a. Initiate quarantine/regulatory action within 4.5 mile radius of fly 
finds.  
b. Conduct larval survey around fly finds for three life cycles out to 
200 m.  
c. Based on pest risk, terrain, topography and available hosts, conduct 
ground applied bait sprays within 200 m of fly finds for three life 
cycles or aerial applications of pesticides within a 0.56 mi radius of 
fly finds. 
d. After three negative life cycles of trapping, release area from 
quarantine and all corresponding regulations.

GF-120 NF or Malathion/Nu-Lure® Bait Treatments 
1. If your farm is within the fruit fly quarantine area, but not in the 0.5 mile arc 
core area, and your crop is on the host list, you must sign a compliance 
agreement with the Fruit Fly Eradication Program and follow a specific 30-
day pre-harvest bait-spray treatment before harvesting your produce. Please 
call the Program Regulatory Office to sign a compliance agreement.

agreement with the Fruit Fly Eradication Program and follow a specific 30-
day pre-harvest bait-spray treatment before harvesting your produce. Please 
call the Program Regulatory Office to sign a compliance agreement.  
2. Keep detailed records of your bait-sprays (i.e., GF-120 NF or malathion plus 
Nu-Lure®) purchases, use rates, use pattern and dates of application. 
3. Bait-spray applications must begin 30 days prior to harvest, with applications 
made every 6–10 days and continued throughout the harvest season. 
Note: If a quarantine fruit fly is trapped on or near your site (within a 0.5-mile 
arc) anytime during the 30-day pre-harvest period, you will be disqualified 
from the pre-harvest treatment option. Post-harvest treatments, if available, 
will apply in such cases. Examples of post-harvest treatments will include 
methyl bromide fumigations and cold treatments, among others. 
4. There are only two approved bait-insecticides for fruit fly eradication 
programs: GF-120 Naturalyte® (Spinosad, Dow AgroSciences LLC, 
Indianapolis, IN), an organically certified mixture of spinosad and fruit fly 
bait, and malathion3 (various manufacturers) plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait 
(Miller Chemical and Fertilizer Corp., Hanover, PA).

3 Not all crops or this defined application regime are listed on malathion labels. If your crop is not listed on the 
malathion label, it is illegal to use on your crop. Therefore, the GF-120 NF might be the only treatment option 
unless a Special Local Needs label can be obtained under the authority of §24(c) of FIFRA for the use of a 
federally registered malathion product to meet special local needs of the program.

Instructions for Applying the Bait-Sprays 
Malathion/Nu-Lure® and GF-120 NF bait-sprays  
This must be applied at a low volume application either as a hand-wand type 
spot-spray or with ultra-low volume application equipment. 
Spot-spray equipment for the bait-spray applications include a 2 to 4-gallon 
backpack sprayer and a 1 to 5-gallon (hand-wand type pump-up) sprayer. 
Larger capacity spray equipment (ultra-low volume) that can be adjusted or 
retooled to apply large droplet sizes (4–6 mm) may be used; however, contact 
the Program Regulatory office to be sure your

backpack sprayer and a 1 to 5-gallon (hand-wand type pump-up) sprayer. 
Larger capacity spray equipment (ultra-low volume) that can be adjusted or 
retooled to apply large droplet sizes (4–6 mm) may be used; however, contact 
the Program Regulatory office to be sure your application method meets the 
application requirements for the harvest certification program. 
GF-120 NF Naturalyte® fruit fly bait (EPA Reg. No. 62719-498)  
This is used as a very low volume hand-wand–type spot-spray application. 
This is NOT a high volume air-blast or high volume hand-gun type 
application. You must follow the label directions on the concentrations and 
mixing. 
The proper GF-120 NF rate is 20 oz of GF-120 NF mixed with 30 oz of water 
(this is a dilution rate of 1:1.5) per acre. The reasons for this rate and dilution 
are as follows:  
a. This is the most effective concentration (i.e., attracts and kills fruit 
flies better). 
b. The efficacy of GF-120 NF lasts longer at this rate. 
c. At this dilution rate (1:1.5), the material is least affected by rain. 
Application Directions: 
1. Use a large spray droplet size (4–6 mm). Set your nozzle tip or use nozzle 
tips that provide large droplets.  
2. Calibrate your spray equipment to deliver sufficient amounts with every 
burst of spray so that you can distribute 50 oz of material (20 oz GF-120 + 
30 oz water) throughout an acre of plants.  
3. Direct the bait spray to one

6 mm). Set your nozzle tip or use nozzle 
tips that provide large droplets.  
2. Calibrate your spray equipment to deliver sufficient amounts with every 
burst of spray so that you can distribute 50 oz of material (20 oz GF-120 + 
30 oz water) throughout an acre of plants.  
3. Direct the bait spray to one or two spots (areas) on the inner canopy of the 
plant, spraying the underside of leaves on the inside of the canopy. This 
reduces the direct sun exposure and the potential for washing off of the 
material by rainfall. The idea is to create an area where a fruit fly would 
feed on the bait/insecticide and perish. This is not a contact insecticide. 
4. The pattern of application throughout the treated acre may depend upon 
plant type, size and spacing. The perimeter and inside of the planting 
should be sprayed. The main goal is to be sure to equally distribute the 50 
oz of bait spray (20 oz GF-120 + 30 oz water) throughout the entire one

acre.  
♦ For example: In tree crops, spot treat every third or fourth tree around 
the perimeter, then inside the acre, spray every fourth to fifth tree in 
every fourth row. To be most effective, the pattern should change 
slightly with each successive application 
♦ For example: In vegetable crops, spot treat the perimeter and then spot 
treat at a reasonable distance down every fifth or sixth row. To be most 
effective, the pattern should change slightly with each successive 
application 
The REI (restricted entry interval) and pre-harvest interval for GF-120 NF 
is four hours.

Malathion plus Nu-Lure® Insect Bait mixture 
The only approved insecticide to mix with Nu-Lure® Insect Bait is malathion. 
There are numerous malathion brands with different amounts of active 
ingredients (a.i.). Use a malathion product that is labeled for your crop. 
However, you must apply 0.18 lbs of a.i. per acre. The amount of product that 
is applied per acre will vary with the malathion formulation you purchase. 
Following are some examples using the formula to calculate the amount of 
product you need to apply 0.18 lbs a.i. malathion per acre:  
♦ GOWAN® Malathion 8 Flowable— 8 lbs a.i./gallon (128 oz) 
8 lbs a. i. gallon⁄
128 oz/gallon = Need 0.18 lbs acre⁄

It is critical to follow the label directions on the rates allowed per application, 
number of applications allowed per year and the application interval. If the 
interval is long (i.e., every 30 days) or the number of applications allowed in a

year too low (i.e., no more than four), then the Malathion must be rotated with the 
GF-120 applications. 
This is also a low volume application and may be applied in the same way as the 
GF-120 NF spot treatment type application or with spray equipment that is 
capable of applying 10–40 gallons of material (Malathion/Nu-Lure® plus water) 
per acre with the proper droplet size (4–6 mm). Contact the Program Regulatory 
office to be sure it meets the application requirements for the harvest certification 
program.  
Malathion products must be applied at the rate of 0.18 lbs per acre as a foliar bait-
spray treatment at a 6 to 10-day interval for the 30-day pre-harvest treatment, and

office to be sure it meets the application requirements for the harvest certification 
program.  
Malathion products must be applied at the rate of 0.18 lbs per acre as a foliar bait-
spray treatment at a 6 to 10-day interval for the 30-day pre-harvest treatment, and 
continued at intervals of 6 to 10 days throughout the harvest season. 
♦ The water used for the solution should be buffered to pH 7.0 with an 
available buffer material 
♦ You must mix the Malathion with Nu-Lure® Insect Bait. Follow the label 
and calculations above for proper use and rates. The Nu-Lure® rate is 9.6 
fl oz/acre 
♦ Mix the Malathion plus the Nu-Lure® in 10 to 40 gallons of water. Apply 
the bait spray as a spot spray equally throughout the acre, treating the 
perimeter and inside of the planting in a similar pattern to the GF-120 NG 
application described above 
♦ Growers with crops not listed on a Malathion label should use the GF-120 
NF 
The effectiveness of Nu-Lure® may be decreased or slowed when applied over 
copper spray residues or when sprayed in tank mixes with copper.  
In addition to the bait-insecticide application procedures, all producers must 
follow the compliance agreement for moving produce from their farm in and out 
of the quarantine area.
