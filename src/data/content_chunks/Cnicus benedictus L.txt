The yellow flower heads which appear from about May to August are borne at the ends of the branches, almost hidden by the upper leaves, and are about 1 1/2 inches long. Surrounding the flower heads are leathery scales, tipped with long, branching, yellowish-red spines. The herb has a rather disagreeable odor which is lost in drying.
Part used.
—The leaves and leafy flowering tops, gathered preferably just before or during the flowering period.
