products for Mycoplasma contamination as described in CVB-PRO-0006. 
7. Instructions for Use: To expand as stock culture, thaw one vial of E. coli/pMyco culture 
on ice. Inoculate 50 mL of pre-warmed Luria Bertani broth (supplemented with 50 µg/mL 
kanamycin) with 1 mL thawed E. coli/pMyco culture. Incubate with shaking for 18-24 hours at 
35°- 37°C. Add 5.0 mL sterile glycerol to the culture, mix thoroughly, and dispense aliquots into 
sterile cyrovials. Store the dispensed stock culture at -70°C or colder. 
To use the E. coli/pMyco reagent as described in CVB-PRO-0006, the pMyco plasmid must be 
purified from the E. coli host. Thaw one vial of stock E. coli/pMyco culture on ice. Isolate the 
pMyco plasmid DNA using a standard plasmid purification protocol or a commercial plasmid 
purification kit. Elute the plasmid DNA with sterile Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 8.0). Measure 
the DNA concentration of the pMyco plasmid preparation using a micro-spectrophotometer. 
Record the DNA concentration in ng/µL. Concentrated pMyco plasmid preparations may be 
stored at 3°- 7°C for up to 1 year or at -70°C or colder for longer storage. 
The recommended use concentration of purified pMyco DNA is 0.5 ng/µL, however, the optimal 
concentration may be

stored at 3°- 7°C for up to 1 year or at -70°C or colder for longer storage. 
The recommended use concentration of purified pMyco DNA is 0.5 ng/µL, however, the optimal 
concentration may be determined by titration using the PCR assay described in CVB-PRO-0006. 
Make a working dilution of the pMyco plasmid preparation in sterile TE buffer. The working 
dilution of pMyco plasmid preparation may be stored at 3°- 7°C for up to 6 months.

method described in 9 CFR 113.27(d). Sequence confirmation of the plasmid was conducted by

12. Origin and Passage History: The E. coli host strain TOP10 and plasmid vector pCR®4-
TOPO® were obtained from Invitrogen™. 
13. Method of Preparation: E. coli/pMyco lot 091510B is a recombinant E. coli host strain 
harboring the plasmid pMyco. The pMyco plasmid was constructed by inserting a 464 base pair 
PCR amplicon generated from the 16S rDNA gene of Mycoplasma hyorhinis strain ATCC 17981 
into the cloning vector pCR®4-TOPO®. An internal 86 bp segment was deleted from the PCR 
insert; the linear DNA was then circularized with T4 ligase and transformed into the E. coli host 
strain TOP10. The recombinant E. coli was expanded overnight in LB broth supplemented with 
kanamycin. Glycerol was added to the culture as a cryoprotectant prior to being aliquoted and 
frozen.

generally associated with unfavorable storage conditions, introduction of endonucleases from

frozen. 
14. Other: The quality of a pMyco plasmid preparation can quickly deteriorate and is 
generally associated with unfavorable storage conditions, introduction of endonucleases from 
frequent handling, and/or low DNA concentration. If no amplicon is generated from the pMyco 
positive control, the following steps may be taken, 1) make a new pMyco plasmid prep; 2) 
perform a titration to determine the optimal DNA concentration of the pMyco positive control in 
the PCR reaction.
