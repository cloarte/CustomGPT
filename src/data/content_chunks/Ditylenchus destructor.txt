 Invasion: The morphology of D. destructor is described by Thorne (1945, 1961),Hooper (1973)andEsser and Smart (1977). Wu (1958, 1960) gives more detailed information on the morphology of the reproductive system and oesophageal glands of D. destructor.Measurements (afterThorne, 1945). Females: length=0.81-1.4 mm; a=30-35 µm; b=8-10 µm; c=15-20 µm; V=78-83%. Males: length=0.8-1.3 mm; a=34-40 µm; b=7-8 µm; c=12-16 µm; T=73-80%.There is considerable morphological variation shown by the adults of this species due to age or feeding on particular hosts. Body slender (a=30-35 µm). Cuticle smooth, marked by faint and fine transverse striae about 1 µm apart; lateral field with six incisures. Cephalic region smooth, low, anteriorly flattened, slightly set off or almost continuous with body contour. Cephalic framework hexa-radiate, moderately developed. Stylet slender, 10-14 µm long, with distinct basal knobs. Median oesophageal bulb fusiform; basal bulb clavate, usually its base overlaps the intestine on the dorsal side for half to one body width.

 Reproduccion: D. destructor is a migratory endoparasite of roots and underground modified plant parts such as potato tubers, bulbous iris and garlic. The nematodes attack the subterranean and only rarely the aerial parts of plants. They enter potato tubers through the lenticels, and then begin to multiply rapidly and invade the whole tuber. They can continue to live and develop within harvested tubers. D. destructor attacked carrots at the base of the lateral roots and tissue breakdown occurred in the cortex. The damaged tissue was discoloured. External lesions subsequently appeared which served as infection sites for other pathogens, including Mycocentrospora acerina ( Stoeen, 1977 ). It was found to attack stems, buds and leaves of Cimicifuga racemosa ( Planer, 1972 ) and roots of ginseng in Korea ( Young and Seung, 1995 ). Stem infestations are rare but have also been reported on potato haulm by Goodey (1951) and on Vicia sativa by Duggan and Moore (1962) .Means of movement/dispersal and survivalThe nematodes can move only short distances in the soil and have no natural means of long-range movement. The main means of dispersal is with infested potato tubers or other subterranean organs of host plants, for example bulbs and rhizomes (especially of iris). Transport in infested soil is another important means of spread. Irrigation water can also carry the nematodes. Unlike the closely related species D. dipsaci, D. destructor is unable to withstand excessive desiccation, and for this reason is usually important only in cool, moist soils.

especially of iris). Transport in infested soil is another important means of spread. Irrigation water can also carry the nematodes. Unlike the closely related species D. dipsaci, D. destructor is unable to withstand excessive desiccation, and for this reason is usually important only in cool, moist soils. Unlike D. dipsaci, it does not form 'eelworm wool'. Without a resistant resting stage, the species overwinters in soil as adults or larvae and may even multiply by feeding on alternative weed hosts (for example Mentha arvensis, Sonchus arvensis) and on fungal mycelia. It may also possibly overwinter as eggs. These hatch in the spring and larvae are immediately able to parasitize hosts. Thorne (1961) suggested that D. destructor overwintered in USA field soil as eggs and coiled adults. In Ireland, its survival in soil is helped by the presence of corn mint and unharvested potato tubers (Anon., 1972).Interactions with other organismsRhizoctonia solani infections of potato tubers (var. Janka and Leda) were highest in pots to which the largest number of D. destructor (136 nematodes per 100 g soil) was added. The results confirmed that mixed infections were more harmful to the potatoes than either infection alone ( Janowicz and Mazurkiewicz, 1982 ). The damage to potato tubers stored in the dark at 6-15°C was greater (49% compared to 27%) when both the dry rot fusaria (Fusarium solani var. coeruleum, F. culmorum and F. oxysporum) and D. destructor were present, than when only the dry rot fungi were present ( Janowicz, 1984 ).

CultureD. destructor can feed on fungi and hence can easily be cultured on many fungi and on plant callus ( Darling et al., 1957 ; Faulkner and Darling, 1961 ). It is readily established on laboratory cultures of Alternaria tenuis [A. alternata] and A. solani ( Foot and Wood, 1982 ). D. destructor reproduced well on cultures of A. tenuis on potato glucose agar at 26-27°C ( Pupavkina, 1971 ). It was cultured on ginseng root callus, fungal mycelium (F. solani), carrot discs and radish sprouts ( Young and Seung, 1995 ).
 Sintomas: On potatoesThere are, in general, no obvious symptoms in the aerial parts of the plant, although heavily infested tubers give rise to weak plants which usually die. Early infections can be detected by peeling the tuber, which can reveal small, off-white spots in the otherwise healthy flesh. These later enlarge, darken, are woolly in texture and may be slightly hollow at the centre. If stored in moist conditions a general rot may ensue and spread to other tubers. Infested dahlia tubers develop similar syptoms ( Myuge, 1957 ; Hooper, 1973 ).On badly affected tubers there are typically slightly sunken areas with cracked and wrinkled skin which is detached in places from the underlying flesh. The flesh has a dry and mealy appearance, varying in colour from greyish to dark brown or black. This discoloration is largely due to secondary invasion of fungi, bacteria and free-living nematodes (the latter are easily confused with D. destruct

 badly affected tubers there are typically slightly sunken areas with cracked and wrinkled skin which is detached in places from the underlying flesh. The flesh has a dry and mealy appearance, varying in colour from greyish to dark brown or black. This discoloration is largely due to secondary invasion of fungi, bacteria and free-living nematodes (the latter are easily confused with D. destructor). In contrast, the skin of potatoes infested with D. dipsaci is not usually cracked, and the rot darkens towards the inside of the tuber. The symptoms are more obvious in the foliage, which is shortened and malformed. Rotting due to D. destructor in storage increased with rising temperature, but there was no evidence of transfer of infestation from diseased to healthy tubers ( Andersson, 1971 ). It spread from infected to healthy potato plants when spaced at 70x20 cm or less in the sod-podzolic soil in the Ukraine ( Polozhenets', 1977 ). On Iris and tulipsInfestations usually begin at the base and extend up the fleshy scales, causing grey-to-black lesions; roots may be blackened, and leaves poorly developed with yellow tips. On groundnutThe following symptoms were originally recorded for D. destructor on groundnut; however, the Ditylenchus attacking groundnut has now been shown to be a different species, named D. africanus ( Wendt et al., 1995 ).D. destructor was reported to occur in large numbers in the hulls and seeds of groundnut. At 85 days after planting, the nematodes were found 3-5 cell layers deep in the exocarp at the base of groundnut pods, near the point of connection with the peg. The nematodes rapidly invaded the developing pods after fruiting pegs had penetrated the soil; very few were found in roots. The surface of the infection site showed brown, spongy cork

 At 85 days after planting, the nematodes were found 3-5 cell layers deep in the exocarp at the base of groundnut pods, near the point of connection with the peg. The nematodes rapidly invaded the developing pods after fruiting pegs had penetrated the soil; very few were found in roots. The surface of the infection site showed brown, spongy cork cells, and from this site the nematodes invaded the pegs. Hulls of groundnuts showed black discoloration which appeared first along the longitudinal veins. The kernels were shrunken. The infected testae were brown to black and the embryo showed a brown discoloration ( Jones and De Waele, 1988 ). Feeding in the parenchyma of the peg caused the cells to collapse. Empty and collapsed cells were pushed aside, creating channels through which the nematodes moved. From the peg, the nematodes further penetrated the exocarp to feed on the parenchymatous cells surrounding the vascular bundles. They also migrated to the base of the mesocarp through the natural opening at the point of peg attachment ( Jones and De Waele, 1990 ). In the testa, the nematode feeding on the tissues near or within the vascular bundles caused discoloration of vascular strands within the seed coat. It aggregated in large numbers near the vascular bundles in the exocarp; these tissues are thought to facilitate migration of the nematode. The nematode did not invade the cotyledons ( Jones and De Waele, 1990 ). Thorne (1961) , Hooper (1973) , MAFF (1974), Esser and Smart (1977) , Dement'eva, (1980) and Ambrogioni et al.

Empty and collapsed cells were pushed aside, creating channels through which the nematodes moved. From the peg, the nematodes further penetrated the exocarp to feed on the parenchymatous cells surrounding the vascular bundles. They also migrated to the base of the mesocarp through the natural opening at the point of peg attachment ( Jones and De Waele, 1990 ). In the testa, the nematode feeding on the tissues near or within the vascular bundles caused discoloration of vascular strands within the seed coat. It aggregated in large numbers near the vascular bundles in the exocarp; these tissues are thought to facilitate migration of the nematode. The nematode did not invade the cotyledons ( Jones and De Waele, 1990 ). Thorne (1961) , Hooper (1973) , MAFF (1974), Esser and Smart (1977) , Dement'eva, (1980) and Ambrogioni et al. (1995) give general accounts of D. destructor, including its morphology, geographical distribution, symptoms, pathogenicity, transmission and control.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology D. destructor is a migratory endoparasite of roots and underground modified plant parts such as potato tubers, bulbous iris and garlic. The nematodes attack the subterranean and only rarely the aerial parts of plants. They enter potato tubers through the lenticels, and then begin to multiply rapidly and invade the whole tuber. They can continue to live and develop within harvested tubers. D. destructor attacked carrots at the base of the lateral roots and tissue breakdown occurred in the cortex. The damaged tissue was discoloured. External lesions subsequently appeared which served as infection sites for other pathogens, including Mycocentrospora acerina ( Stoeen, 1977 ). It was found to attack stems, buds and leaves of Cimicifuga racemosa ( Planer, 1972 ) and roots of ginseng in Korea ( Young and Seung, 1995 ). Stem infestations are rare but have also been reported on potato haulm by Goodey (1951) and on Vicia sativa by Duggan and Moore (1962) .Means of movement/dispersal and survivalThe nematodes can move only short distances in the soil and have no natural means of long-range movement. The main means of dispersal is with infested potato tubers or other subterranean organs of host plants, for example bulbs and rhizomes (especially of iris).

 sativa by Duggan and Moore (1962) .Means of movement/dispersal and survivalThe nematodes can move only short distances in the soil and have no natural means of long-range movement. The main means of dispersal is with infested potato tubers or other subterranean organs of host plants, for example bulbs and rhizomes (especially of iris). Transport in infested soil is another important means of spread. Irrigation water can also carry the nematodes. Unlike the closely related species D. dipsaci, D. destructor is unable to withstand excessive desiccation, and for this reason is usually important only in cool, moist soils. Unlike D. dipsaci, it does not form 'eelworm wool'. Without a resistant resting stage, the species overwinters in soil as adults or larvae and may even multiply by feeding on alternative weed hosts (for example Mentha arvensis, Sonchus arvensis) and on fungal mycelia. It may also possibly overwinter as eggs. These hatch in the spring and larvae are immediately able to parasitize hosts. Thorne (1961) suggested that D. destructor overwintered in USA field soil as eggs and coiled adults. In Ireland, its survival in soil is helped by the presence of corn mint and unharvested potato tubers (Anon., 1972).Interactions with other organismsRhizoctonia solani infections of potato tubers (var. Janka and Leda) were highest in pots to which the largest number of D. destructor (136 nematodes per 100 g soil) was added. The results confirmed that mixed infections were more harmful to the potatoes than either infection alone ( Janowicz and Mazurkiewicz, 1982 ). The damage to potato tubers stored in the dark at 6-15°C was greater (49% compared to 27%) when both the dry rot fusaria

 largest number of D. destructor (136 nematodes per 100 g soil) was added. The results confirmed that mixed infections were more harmful to the potatoes than either infection alone ( Janowicz and Mazurkiewicz, 1982 ). The damage to potato tubers stored in the dark at 6-15°C was greater (49% compared to 27%) when both the dry rot fusaria (Fusarium solani var. coeruleum, F. culmorum and F. oxysporum) and D. destructor were present, than when only the dry rot fungi were present ( Janowicz, 1984 ). CultureD. destructor can feed on fungi and hence can easily be cultured on many fungi and on plant callus ( Darling et al., 1957 ; Faulkner and Darling, 1961 ). It is readily established on laboratory cultures of Alternaria tenuis [A. alternata] and A. solani ( Foot and Wood, 1982 ). D. destructor reproduced well on cultures of A. tenuis on potato glucose agar at 26-27°C ( Pupavkina, 1971 ). It was cultured on ginseng root callus, fungal mycelium (F. solani), carrot discs and radish sprouts ( Young and Seung, 1995 ).
