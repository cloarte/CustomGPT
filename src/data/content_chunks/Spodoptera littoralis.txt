 Invasion: EggsSpherical, somewhat flattened, 0.6 mm in diameter, laid in clusters arranged in more or less regular rows in one to three layers, with hair scales derived from the tip of the abdomen of the female moth. Usually whitish-yellow in colour, changing to black just prior to hatching, due to the big head of the larva showing through the transparent shell (Pinhey, 1975).LarvaeLarvae grow to 40-45 mm and are hairless, cylindrical, tapering towards the posterior and variable in colour (blackish-grey to dark green, becoming reddish-brown or whitish-yellow).

 prior to hatching, due to the big head of the larva showing through the transparent shell (Pinhey, 1975).LarvaeLarvae grow to 40-45 mm and are hairless, cylindrical, tapering towards the posterior and variable in colour (blackish-grey to dark green, becoming reddish-brown or whitish-yellow). The sides of the body have dark and light longitudinal bands; dorsal side with two dark semilunar spots laterally on each segment, except for the prothorax; spots on the first and eighth abdominal segments larger than the others, interrupting the lateral lines on the first segment. The larva of S. littoralis is figured by Bishari (1934) andBrown and Dewhurst (1975).PupaeWhen newly formed, pupae are green with a reddish colour on the abdomen, turining dark reddish-brown after a few hours. The general shape is cylindrical, 14-20 x 5 mm, tapering towards the posterior segments of the abdomen. The last segment ends in two strong straight hooks (Pinhey, 1975).AdultsMoth with grey-brown body, 15-20 mm long; wingspan 30-38 mm; forewings grey to reddish brown with paler lines along the veins (in males, bluish areas occur on the wing base and tip); the ocellus is marked by two or three oblique whitish stripes. Hindwings are greyish white, irridescent with grey margins and usually lack darker veins (EPPO, 1997).

 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: Female moths lay most of their egg masses (20-1000 eggs) on the lower surface of younger leaves or upper parts of the plant ( Khalifa et al., 1982 ). On cotton, the first three larval instars feed mainly on the lower surface of the leaves, whereas later instars feed on both surfaces. The larvae feed mainly in the dark, although this behaviour pattern may be less noticeable in early instars ( Hassan et al., 1960 ). Pinhey (1975) recorded that >50% of the nocturnal larval population consisted of early instar larvae. In summer the majority of fifth- and sixth-instar larvae leave the plants during mid-morning until sunset, returning to climb the plant at night ( Baker and Miller, 1974 ). Third- and fourth-instars rest on the plant and remain stationary unless overcrowded. On pupation the fully grown larva pushes the loose surface of the soil downwards until it reaches more solid ground 3-5 cm deep. It then creates a clay 'cell' or cocoon in which it usually pupates within 5-6 hours ( Pinhey, 1975 ).Emergence of adult moths occurs at night and they have a life span of 5-10 days (Shalama and Shoukry, 1972). The reproductive capacity, egg facility and life span of moths are affected by the difference in ages between males and females. The highest ratio of egg fertility was obtained by mating between 4-day-old males with fresh females ( Nasr and Nassif, 1978 ). There is also a correlation between the host plant and the longevity and fecundity of S. littoralis (Dimetry and Nadia, 1972). The majority of adults mate on the first night of emergence, copulation lasting for 20 minutes to 2 hours. Approximately 50% of mated females lay

 4-day-old males with fresh females ( Nasr and Nassif, 1978 ). There is also a correlation between the host plant and the longevity and fecundity of S. littoralis (Dimetry and Nadia, 1972). The majority of adults mate on the first night of emergence, copulation lasting for 20 minutes to 2 hours. Approximately 50% of mated females lay their eggs on the same night of mating, before sunrise ( Hassan et al., 1960 ). Adults fly at night, mostly between 20.00 and midnight ( Nasr et al., 1981 ). Flight activity is governed by atmospheric conditions, increases in relative humidity and decreases in air temperature inducing flight ( Hassan et al., 1960 ). The flight range during a 4-hour-period can be up to 1.5 km ( Salama and Shoukry, 1972 ). The moths have chemoreceptors on the ventral surface of the tarsi and the distal portion of the proboscis. These are highly sensitive and respond to a certain number of sugars mainly present in nectar. Pheromones (comprising of tetradecadien-1-ol acetates) have been isolated and successfully used in traps ( Kehat and Gordon, 1975 ; Campion, 1977).The minimum constant temperature for normal development in all stages is 13-14°C. Resistance to cold generally increases through the larval stages and is greatest in the pupal stage ( Miller, 1977 ). At 18°C, egg, larval and pupal stages last 9, 34 and 27 days, respectively. At 36°C, egg, larval and pupal stages last 2, 10 and 8 days, respectively. Data on survival and development at different temperatures are provided by Sidibe and Lauge (1977) , Baker and Miller (1974) and Ocete Rubio (1984) . Information on development on different host crops is given by Dimetry and Nadia (1972),

Studies in Egypt indicate that there are seven overlapping generations of S. littoralis when feeding on cotton, and that there are three peak infestation periods ( El-Shafei et al., 1981 ; Khalifa et al., 1982 ).
 Sintomas: On most crops, damage arises from extensive feeding by larvae, leading to complete stripping of the plants.On cotton, the larvae feed on the leaves creating large holes of irregular shape and usually all that remains are the bigger veins. The larvae may also bore into the bud or young boll and consume the whole contents, causing them to be shed or dry up (Bishari, 1934). Bolls have large holes in them from which yellowish- to dark-green larval excrement protrudes. On tobacco, leaves develop irregular, brownish-red patches and the stem base may be gnawed off. Maize stems are often mined by S. littoralis and young grains in the ear may also be damaged.

It has been recorded several times in the UK, and even though it has been intercepted at U.S. ports, it is not known to be established in North America. It is considered a pest of national concern and may result in quarantine and/or regulatory actions if detected. It is a pest on vegetables, fruits, flowers and other crops.

 pest of national concern and may result in quarantine and/or regulatory actions if detected. It is a pest on vegetables, fruits, flowers and other crops. The establishment of Egyptian cottonworm in the continental U.S. would have the potential to negatively impact trade.Hosts:This pest has a very wide host range; it feed on over 40 plant families. Among their host are: okra, onion, pigweed, peanut, cabbage, cauliflower, pepper, citrus, taro, tea, cucurbits, carrot, fig, geranium, soybean, cotton, sunflower, tomato, lettuce, apple, alfalfa, tobacco, avocado, pine, pea, poplar, plum, pear, oak, potato, eggplant, spinach, clover, wheat, and corn.Identification Characteristics and Life History Information:Egg MassesEggs are whitish-yellow and are laid in masses on the lower surfaces of young leaves. They are covered with hair scales from the female’s abdomen.LarvaeSix larval instars occur.  Feeding damage is similar toS. litura, with initial larval feeding resulting in leaf skeletonization. Larvae are hairless and blackish-grey to dark green when recently hatched, as they mature they become reddish-brown or whitish-yellow. Caterpillars have dark and light longitudinal bands and two dark, semi-circular spots on their back. 
When recently hatched, larvae begin feeding on the underside of leaves, but as they mature they move towards the upper surface of leaves. Larvae may also feed on fruits, pods, and stems of plants. They can grow up to 1½ to 1 ¾ inches (3.81 to 4.45 cm) in length.
They pupate ½ inches below the surface of the soil in a clay cocoon. When the pupae form, they are green with a reddish abdomen

 move towards the upper surface of leaves. Larvae may also feed on fruits, pods, and stems of plants. They can grow up to 1½ to 1 ¾ inches (3.81 to 4.45 cm) in length.
They pupate ½ inches below the surface of the soil in a clay cocoon. When the pupae form, they are green with a reddish abdomen but they turn dark reddish-brown pretty quickly.AdultsAdults are gray-brown and marked by grey to reddish-brown forewings with paler lines along the veins. The tip of the forewing (apex) is light brown, with a distinct white marking shaped like an “A” and a white, three-branched fork-like pattern. Hind wings are whitish, glossy with grayish-brown margins and veins as well as fringe hairs.Confirming and Identification?An entomologist will probably need to dissect the male genitalia of an adult moth to confirm identification.  Field specimens may be confused with another exotic species of concern,Spodoptera litura, or otherSpodopteraspecies currently occurring in the continental U.S., including southern armyworm (S. eridania), beet armyworm (S. exigua) fall armyworm (S. frugiperda),S. latifascia, yellow-striped armyworm (S. ornithogalli),S. albula,S. androgea,S. dolichos,S. pulchella, and western yellowstriped armyworm (S. praefica) .

lla, and western yellowstriped armyworm (S. praefica) . 
Initial screening questions can be directed to your local cooperative extension service county officehttp://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/or your state-based NPDN lab.  Go to the ‘Diagnostic Lab’ section of the NPDN websitehttp://www.npdn.org/and click on your home state.  As with most moths, adults are nocturnal and often commonly begin a couple of hours before midnight.  
Researchers and survey specialists with the USDA-ARS, USDA-APHIS-PPQ, your local state department of agriculture, or your state-based university system may be  currently surveying or researching survey methods for trapping Egyptian cottonworm with pheromone-based traps.  For questions regarding survey programs in your area, contact your local Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey Program.  You can link to more information about this program on the National Agriculture Pest Information System website at:http://pest.ceris.purdue.edu/index.php.Potential Economic Impact and Description of Damage:If this pest were to be introduced and established in the United States, both the climate and hosts would be suitable for it to establish in approximately 49% of the country, resulting in severe economic and environmental impact. It is considered one of the most destructive agricultural pests within the subtropical and tropical range. Subsequently, the establishment of Egyptian cottonworm in the continental U.S. would also have the potential to negatively impact international trade.  Due to its wide host range, it can attack several economically important crops all year round. It has shown to lower cotton yields by as much as 75%.Regulatory Status and Management Issues:Extension specialists or others that strongly suspect they have detected Egyptian cottonworm should contact their local state department of agriculturehttp://nationalplantboard.org/

 would also have the potential to negatively impact international trade.  Due to its wide host range, it can attack several economically important crops all year round. It has shown to lower cotton yields by as much as 75%.Regulatory Status and Management Issues:Extension specialists or others that strongly suspect they have detected Egyptian cottonworm should contact their local state department of agriculturehttp://nationalplantboard.org/member/index.html.  State and federal (USDA-APHIS-PPQ) regulatory officials may begin quarantine and eradication procedures if a confirmed population is detected.
As Egyptian cottonworm has not established in the continental U.S., local management programs are not available. Remember that any attempt to manage this pest will only occur after regulatory officials have determined that eradication is not possible.
The use ofBacillus thuringiensis(BT) has been suggested as a possible biological control option for this pest.

 prior to hatching, due to the big head of the larva showing through the transparent shell (Pinhey, 1975).LarvaeLarvae grow to 40-45 mm and are hairless, cylindrical, tapering towards the posterior and variable in colour (blackish-grey to dark green, becoming reddish-brown or whitish-yellow). The sides of the body have dark and light longitudinal bands; dorsal side with two dark semilunar spots laterally on each segment, except for the prothorax; spots on the first and eighth abdominal segments larger than the others, interrupting the lateral lines on the first segment. The larva of S. littoralis is figured by Bishari (1934) andBrown and Dewhurst (1975).PupaeWhen newly formed, pupae are green with a reddish colour on the abdomen, turining dark reddish-brown after a few hours. The general shape is cylindrical, 14-20 x 5 mm, tapering towards the posterior segments of the abdomen. The last segment ends in two strong straight hooks (Pinhey, 1975).AdultsMoth with grey-brown body, 15-20 mm long; wingspan 30-38 mm; forewings grey to reddish brown with paler lines along the veins (in males, bluish areas occur on the wing base and tip); the ocellus is marked by two or three oblique whitish stripes. Hindwings are greyish white, irridescent with grey margins and usually lack darker veins (EPPO, 1997).

 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: Female moths lay most of their egg masses (20-1000 eggs) on the lower surface of younger leaves or upper parts of the plant ( Khalifa et al., 1982 ). On cotton, the first three larval instars feed mainly on the lower surface of the leaves, whereas later instars feed on both surfaces. The larvae feed mainly in the dark, although this behaviour pattern may be less noticeable in early instars ( Hassan et al., 1960 ). Pinhey (1975) recorded that >50% of the nocturnal larval population consisted of early instar larvae. In summer the majority of fifth- and sixth-instar larvae leave the plants during mid-morning until sunset, returning to climb the plant at night ( Baker and Miller, 1974 ). Third- and fourth-instars rest on the plant and remain stationary unless overcrowded. On pupation the fully grown larva pushes the loose surface of the soil downwards until it reaches more solid ground 3-5 cm deep. It then creates a clay 'cell' or cocoon in which it usually pupates within 5-6 hours ( Pinhey, 1975 ).Emergence of adult moths occurs at night and they have a life span of 5-10 days (Shalama and Shoukry, 1972). The reproductive capacity, egg facility and life span of moths are affected by the difference in ages between males and females. The highest ratio of egg fertility was obtained by mating between 4-day-old males with fresh females ( Nasr and Nassif, 1978 ). There is also a correlation between the host plant and the longevity and fecundity of S. littoralis (Dimetry and Nadia, 1972). The majority of adults mate on the first night of emergence, copulation lasting for 20 minutes to 2 hours. Approximately 50% of mated females lay

 4-day-old males with fresh females ( Nasr and Nassif, 1978 ). There is also a correlation between the host plant and the longevity and fecundity of S. littoralis (Dimetry and Nadia, 1972). The majority of adults mate on the first night of emergence, copulation lasting for 20 minutes to 2 hours. Approximately 50% of mated females lay their eggs on the same night of mating, before sunrise ( Hassan et al., 1960 ). Adults fly at night, mostly between 20.00 and midnight ( Nasr et al., 1981 ). Flight activity is governed by atmospheric conditions, increases in relative humidity and decreases in air temperature inducing flight ( Hassan et al., 1960 ). The flight range during a 4-hour-period can be up to 1.5 km ( Salama and Shoukry, 1972 ). The moths have chemoreceptors on the ventral surface of the tarsi and the distal portion of the proboscis. These are highly sensitive and respond to a certain number of sugars mainly present in nectar. Pheromones (comprising of tetradecadien-1-ol acetates) have been isolated and successfully used in traps ( Kehat and Gordon, 1975 ; Campion, 1977).The minimum constant temperature for normal development in all stages is 13-14°C. Resistance to cold generally increases through the larval stages and is greatest in the pupal stage ( Miller, 1977 ). At 18°C, egg, larval and pupal stages last 9, 34 and 27 days, respectively. At 36°C, egg, larval and pupal stages last 2, 10 and 8 days, respectively. Data on survival and development at different temperatures are provided by Sidibe and Lauge (1977) , Baker and Miller (1974) and Ocete Rubio (1984) .

Studies in Egypt indicate that there are seven overlapping generations of S. littoralis when feeding on cotton, and that there are three peak infestation periods ( El-Shafei et al., 1981 ; Khalifa et al., 1982 ).
 Sintomas: On most crops, damage arises from extensive feeding by larvae, leading to complete stripping of the plants.On cotton, the larvae feed on the leaves creating large holes of irregular shape and usually all that remains are the bigger veins. The larvae may also bore into the bud or young boll and consume the whole contents, causing them to be shed or dry up (Bishari, 1934). Bolls have large holes in them from which yellowish- to dark-green larval excrement protrudes. On tobacco, leaves develop irregular, brownish-red patches and the stem base may be gnawed off. Maize stems are often mined by S. littoralis and young grains in the ear may also be damaged.

 pest of national concern and may result in quarantine and/or regulatory actions if detected. It is a pest on vegetables, fruits, flowers and other crops. The establishment of Egyptian cottonworm in the continental U.S. would have the potential to negatively impact trade.Hosts:This pest has a very wide host range; it feed on over 40 plant families. Among their host are: okra, onion, pigweed, peanut, cabbage, cauliflower, pepper, citrus, taro, tea, cucurbits, carrot, fig, geranium, soybean, cotton, sunflower, tomato, lettuce, apple, alfalfa, tobacco, avocado, pine, pea, poplar, plum, pear, oak, potato, eggplant, spinach, clover, wheat, and corn.Identification Characteristics and Life History Information:Egg MassesEggs are whitish-yellow and are laid in masses on the lower surfaces of young leaves. They are covered with hair scales from the female’s abdomen.LarvaeSix larval instars occur.  Feeding damage is similar toS. litura, with initial larval feeding resulting in leaf skeletonization. Larvae are hairless and blackish-grey to dark green when recently hatched, as they mature they become reddish-brown or whitish-yellow. Caterpillars have dark and light longitudinal bands and two dark, semi-circular spots on their back. 
When recently hatched, larvae begin feeding on the underside of leaves, but as they mature they move towards the upper surface of leaves. Larvae may also feed on fruits, pods, and stems of plants. They can grow up to 1½ to 1 ¾ inches (3.81 to 4.45 cm) in length.
They pupate ½ inches below the surface of the soil in a clay cocoon. When the pupae form, they are green with a reddish abdomen

 move towards the upper surface of leaves. Larvae may also feed on fruits, pods, and stems of plants. They can grow up to 1½ to 1 ¾ inches (3.81 to 4.45 cm) in length.
They pupate ½ inches below the surface of the soil in a clay cocoon. When the pupae form, they are green with a reddish abdomen but they turn dark reddish-brown pretty quickly.AdultsAdults are gray-brown and marked by grey to reddish-brown forewings with paler lines along the veins. The tip of the forewing (apex) is light brown, with a distinct white marking shaped like an “A” and a white, three-branched fork-like pattern. Hind wings are whitish, glossy with grayish-brown margins and veins as well as fringe hairs.Confirming and Identification?An entomologist will probably need to dissect the male genitalia of an adult moth to confirm identification.  Field specimens may be confused with another exotic species of concern,Spodoptera litura, or otherSpodopteraspecies currently occurring in the continental U.S., including southern armyworm (S. eridania), beet armyworm (S. exigua) fall armyworm (S. frugiperda),S. latifascia, yellow-striped armyworm (S. ornithogalli),S. albula,S. androgea,S. dolichos,S. pulchella, and western yellowstriped armyworm (S. praefica) .

lla, and western yellowstriped armyworm (S. praefica) . 
Initial screening questions can be directed to your local cooperative extension service county officehttp://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/or your state-based NPDN lab.  Go to the ‘Diagnostic Lab’ section of the NPDN websitehttp://www.npdn.org/and click on your home state.  As with most moths, adults are nocturnal and often commonly begin a couple of hours before midnight.  
Researchers and survey specialists with the USDA-ARS, USDA-APHIS-PPQ, your local state department of agriculture, or your state-based university system may be  currently surveying or researching survey methods for trapping Egyptian cottonworm with pheromone-based traps.  For questions regarding survey programs in your area, contact your local Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey Program.  You can link to more information about this program on the National Agriculture Pest Information System website at:http://pest.ceris.purdue.edu/index.php.Potential Economic Impact and Description of Damage:If this pest were to be introduced and established in the United States, both the climate and hosts would be suitable for it to establish in approximately 49% of the country, resulting in severe economic and environmental impact. It is considered one of the most destructive agricultural pests within the subtropical and tropical range. Subsequently, the establishment of Egyptian cottonworm in the continental U.S. would also have the potential to negatively impact international trade.  Due to its wide host range, it can attack several economically important crops all year round. It has shown to lower cotton yields by as much as 75%.Regulatory Status and Management Issues:Extension specialists or others that strongly suspect they have detected Egyptian cottonworm should contact their local state department of agriculturehttp://nationalplantboard.org/

 would also have the potential to negatively impact international trade.  Due to its wide host range, it can attack several economically important crops all year round. It has shown to lower cotton yields by as much as 75%.Regulatory Status and Management Issues:Extension specialists or others that strongly suspect they have detected Egyptian cottonworm should contact their local state department of agriculturehttp://nationalplantboard.org/member/index.html.  State and federal (USDA-APHIS-PPQ) regulatory officials may begin quarantine and eradication procedures if a confirmed population is detected.
As Egyptian cottonworm has not established in the continental U.S., local management programs are not available. Remember that any attempt to manage this pest will only occur after regulatory officials have determined that eradication is not possible.
The use ofBacillus thuringiensis(BT) has been suggested as a possible biological control option for this pest.
