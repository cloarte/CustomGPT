 Invasion: Dioecious, exceptionally monoecious, glabrous herb with annual twining stem arising from tuber; tuber usually solitary, cylindrical to irregularly shaped, up to 10(-25) kg in weight, flesh whitish or yellowish, with or without prickly superficial roots, giving rise to one or few annually renewed tubercules; stem up to 12 m long, twining to the right, glabrous, spiny or not. Leaves usually alternate in basal part of stem and opposite in upper part, basal leaves often strongly reduced, simple; stipules absent; petiole 5-12 cm long; blade broadly ovate to suborbicular, 5.5-12 cm x5-10 cm, broadly cordate at base, acuminate at apex, entire, 5-7-veined. Inflorescence an axillary unisexual spike, male 1-3 together and 4-6 cm long, female 1-2 together and 10-12 cm long. Flowers unisexual, regular, with 6-lobed perianth; male flowers small (1-2 mm in

Flowers unisexual, regular, with 6-lobed perianth; male flowers small (1-2 mm in diameter), sessile or shortly pedicelled, with six stamens; female flowers with inferior, 3-celled ovary, styles 3, short. Fruit a capsule wider than long, 2-2.5 cm x3-3.5 cm, opening by three valves, up to 6-seeded. Seeds 1-1.5 cm x1-1.5 cm, with large circular wing (PROTA, 2017).

 Reproduccion: The chromosome numbers reported for D. cayenensis are 2n = 36, 40, 54, 60, 66, 140 ( PROTA, 2017 ). Germplasm collections are stored at various institutions in Africa, France, Puerto Rico and USA, including cryopreservation in Guadeloupe ( Gallet et al., 2007 ; PROTA, 2017 ; USDA-ARS, 2017 ). The species is regarded as having high morphological polymorphism and plasticity ( Terauchi et al., 1992 ), with the ongoing domestication and crossing with wild species causing말ncreased genetic diversity ( Scarcelli et al., 2006 ). Propagation of D. cayenensis is normally by tubers. Flowering is infrequent, and fruit and seed production irregular, with only some cultivars producing seeds. Seeds have a dormancy period of 3-4 months prior to germination. The tuber yield of plants propagated by seed is very small. Tissue culture and seed propagation are used as

Seeds have a dormancy period of 3-4 months prior to germination. The tuber yield of plants propagated by seed is very small. Tissue culture and seed propagation are used as a research tool and to produce맋isease-free cultivars ( PROTA, 2017 ). D. cayenensis has a growing period of 10-12 months. Tubers are harvested from 280-350 days after planting and can be harvested for up to three years ( PROTA, 2017 ). The species forms associations with various arbuscular mycorrhizas ( Tchabi et al., 2009 ). D. cayenensis requires full sun and temperatures between 25-30춿C for normal growth, not growing well below 20춿C or above 35춿C. Evenly distributed rainfall of 1500 mm/year is optimal, but crops can be obtained with as little as 600 mm/year. The species needs well-drained, fertile soils that are free of coarse gravel or stones. Optimum pH is 5.5-6.5 ( PROTA, 2017 ).
