Blue grama is a long-lived native perennial grass that grows throughoutthe Great Plains. It is low growing, up to 18 inches, with small leaves, notover 6 inches long and 0.125 inch or less in width. It is found on all soiltypes, but thrives best on upland, rather beavy soils. It is drought resistant.Growth is late starting in spring. It is relished as pasture by all classes oflivestock. It is one of the more important range grass species, standing heavygrazing well. It is readily established by seeding.
