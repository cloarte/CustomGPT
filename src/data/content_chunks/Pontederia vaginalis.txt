 Reproduccion: Genetics The chromosome number has been generally reported as 2n=52, but there are also counts of 2n=28, 58, 72, 74, 80 ( Patwary et al., 1989 ; Wang and Kusanagi, 1996 ), some of which might actually correspond to other species of subgenus Monochoria . Patwary et al. (1989) identified two morphologically and cytologically distinct types in Bangladesh, “ Monochoria vaginalis type I” (2n=24), which seems to correspond to P. plantaginea (formerly Monochoria vaginalis var. plantaginea ) and “ M. vaginalis type II” (2n=56) or Pontederia vaginalis sensu stricto. They suggest that the latter is an allotetraploid derived from Monochoria ( Pontederia ) hastata (2n=28) and “ M. vaginalis type I” (2n = 24). A study conducted in Southern China using RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) and ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeats) reported low levels of genetic diversity within populations but high differentiation among populations ( Li et al., 2005 ). Reproductive Biology Pontederia vaginalis is a predominantly selfing species, although some outcrossing can occur. Both chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers are produced simultaneously on the same plant. Cleistogamy is prevalent, with pollination usually taking place while the flower is underwater. However, in open sites with abundant light, plants will produce more chasmogamous flowers and will have a higher outcrossing rate than in shaded conditions ( Imaizumi et al., 2008b ; Les, 2020 ).

However, in open sites with abundant light, plants will produce more chasmogamous flowers and will have a higher outcrossing rate than in shaded conditions ( Imaizumi et al., 2008b ; Les, 2020 ). Chasmogamous flowers open only for 1 day and are ocassionally visited by insects, including hoverflies ( Sphaerophoria spp.), honeybees ( Apis spp.) and halictid bees ( Halictus spp., Lasioglossum spp.) ( Tang and Huang, 2007 ; Imaizumi et al., 2008b ). Pollen grains from both the long and short stamens are viable, and since flowers lack nectaries, they are the only reward for pollinators ( Tang and Huang, 2007 ). Reproduction is from seed, with occasional new growth from tubers ( Pancho and Soerjani, 1978 ). Chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers produce similar number of seeds per fruit ( Imaizumi et al., 2008b ). The species is a prolific seed producer, producing an estimated average of 29,700 seeds per plant ( Kunii and Okibe, 1999 ). The seeds are ejected from the capsule as the valves detach explosively from the pedicels and are dispersed by water ( Les, 2020 ). The optimum temperatures for seed germination are between 25 to 35°C, with only 4% of seeds germinating at 20°C ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Germination appears to be favoured by acidic conditions. Tazawa et al. (2021) reported 63% to 72% of germination in buffer solutions ranging from pH 4.6 to 6.4 at 30°C under a 12-h light/dark cycle. At pH=7 germination percent decreased to 42%.

(2021) reported 63% to 72% of germination in buffer solutions ranging from pH 4.6 to 6.4 at 30°C under a 12-h light/dark cycle. At pH=7 germination percent decreased to 42%. Seed germination is higher in light than in darkness and decreases with burial depth ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Koarai and Shibayama (2001) reported over 90% of seedling emergence for seeds located within the top 2 mm of puddled soil. Kim and Mercado (1987) suggest that P. vaginalis seeds develop a light requirement for germination when buried for 1 month or longer at depths of greater than 1 cm. Noda and Eguchi (1965) found that seedling emergence is greater in early planted ricefields in Japan and, with early planting, seedling emergence was higher in saturated soils than in dry soils. They also found that the patterns of seed germination varied greatly according to moisture levels. In submerged conditions, the majority of seedlings emerged within a short space of time, the peak germination being between 15 and 25 days. In contrast, in saturated or dried soils, germination occurred gradually throughout the season. Miyahara et al. (1989) studied seedling emergence from buried seed over a 15-year period and found that emergence declined from 1 year to the next more rapidly in well-drained than in poorly drained soils. Physiology and Phenology Pontederia vaginalis behaves as an annual or pseudoannual in flooded ricefields, but can also grow as a perennial in constantly flooded conditions ( Holm et al., 1977 ). In the Northern hemisphere, flowering has been reported from July to October ( Gupta, 1968 ; Kunii and Okibe, 1999 ; Les, 2020 ), but it can also occur throughout the year in the Philippines ( Merrill,

In Australia, flowers have been recorded from February to May ( Aston, 1987 ). Seeds are produced within 4 to 5 weeks after flowering ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Submergence of fruits after seed initiation has been reported to be beneficial for seed development ( Gupta, 1968 ). The seeds remain in deep dormancy when kept under air-dried conditions, but dormancy is broken when they are dipped in cool water for over 2 months ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Associations In addition to rice, P. vaginalis can be found in association with other species of aquatic and wet habitats, including Blyxa aubertii , Cyperus spp., Fimbristylis spp., Fuirena umbellata , Isachne globosa , Ischaemum rugosum , Leersia hexandra , Lindernia spp., Limnocharis flava , Ludwigia spp. and Rotala spp. ( Baki, 1993 ; Tomita et al., 2003 ; Dorji et al., 2013 ). In California, this species has been reported to grow along with Alisma triviale , Bacopa repens , Heteranthera limosa , Rotala indica , Sagittaria montevidensis and Schoenoplectus mucronatus [ Schoenoplectiella mucronata ]( Les, 2020 ).

Environmental requirements Pontederia vaginalis is found mainly in tropical and humid subtropical climates, but can also tolerate cool-temperate climates. The plants root in mud, with their upper parts growing above water, so they require a shallow water environment to grow. They can be found in seasonal or permanent waters in open or shaded sites ( Aston, 1987 ; Les, 2020 ).

Reproduction is from seed, with occasional new growth from tubers ( Pancho and Soerjani, 1978 ). Chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers produce similar number of seeds per fruit ( Imaizumi et al., 2008b ). The species is a prolific seed producer, producing an estimated average of 29,700 seeds per plant ( Kunii and Okibe, 1999 ). The seeds

 from seed, with occasional new growth from tubers ( Pancho and Soerjani, 1978 ). Chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers produce similar number of seeds per fruit ( Imaizumi et al., 2008b ). The species is a prolific seed producer, producing an estimated average of 29,700 seeds per plant ( Kunii and Okibe, 1999 ). The seeds are ejected from the capsule as the valves detach explosively from the pedicels and are dispersed by water ( Les, 2020 ). The optimum temperatures for seed germination are between 25 to 35°C, with only 4% of seeds germinating at 20°C ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Germination appears to be favoured by acidic conditions. Tazawa et al. (2021) reported 63% to 72% of germination in buffer solutions ranging from pH 4.6 to 6.4 at 30°C under a 12-h light/dark cycle. At pH=7 germination percent decreased to 42%. Seed germination is higher in light than in darkness and decreases with burial depth ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Koarai and Shibayama (2001) reported over 90% of seedling emergence for seeds located within the top 2 mm of puddled soil. Kim and Mercado (1987) suggest that P. vaginalis seeds develop a light requirement for germination when buried for 1 month or longer at depths of greater than 1 cm. Noda and Eguchi (1965) found that seedling emergence is greater in early planted ricefields in Japan and, with early planting, seedling emergence was higher in saturated soils than in dry soils. They also found that the patterns of seed germination varied greatly according to moisture levels. In submerged conditions, the majority of seedlings emerged within a short space of time, the peak germination being between 15 and 25 days. In contrast, in saturated or dried soils, germination occurred gradually throughout the season.

In submerged conditions, the majority of seedlings emerged within a short space of time, the peak germination being between 15 and 25 days. In contrast, in saturated or dried soils, germination occurred gradually throughout the season. Miyahara et al. (1989) studied seedling emergence from buried seed over a 15-year period and found that emergence declined from 1 year to the next more rapidly in well-drained than in poorly drained soils. Physiology and Phenology Pontederia vaginalis behaves as an annual or pseudoannual in flooded ricefields, but can also grow as a perennial in constantly flooded conditions ( Holm et al., 1977 ). In the Northern hemisphere, flowering has been reported from July to October ( Gupta, 1968 ; Kunii and Okibe, 1999 ; Les, 2020 ), but it can also occur throughout the year in the Philippines ( Merrill, 1912 ). In Australia, flowers have been recorded from February to May ( Aston, 1987 ). Seeds are produced within 4 to 5 weeks after flowering ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Submergence of fruits after seed initiation has been reported to be beneficial for seed development ( Gupta, 1968 ). The seeds remain in deep dormancy when kept under air-dried conditions, but dormancy is broken when they are dipped in cool water for over 2 months ( Wang et al., 1996 ). Associations In addition to rice, P. vaginalis can be found in association with other species of aquatic and wet habitats, including Blyxa aubertii , Cyperus spp., Fimbristylis spp., Fuirena umbellata , Isachne globosa , Ischaemum rugosum , Leersia hexandra , Lindernia spp., Limnocharis flava , Ludwigia spp.

In California, this species has been reported to grow along with Alisma triviale , Bacopa repens , Heteranthera limosa , Rotala indica , Sagittaria montevidensis and Schoenoplectus mucronatus [ Schoenoplectiella mucronata ]( Les, 2020 ). Environmental requirements Pontederia vaginalis is found mainly in tropical and humid subtropical climates, but can also tolerate cool-temperate climates. The plants root in mud, with their upper parts growing above water, so they require a shallow water environment to grow. They can be found in seasonal or permanent waters in open or shaded sites ( Aston, 1987 ; Les, 2020 ).
