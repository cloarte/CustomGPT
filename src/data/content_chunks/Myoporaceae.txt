ChinnockProstrate or erect shrubs or small trees, glabrous, glandular papillate or covered with stellate, villous, or glandular simple or branched trichomes, often with embedded resin cavities protruding from vegetative and floral parts, viscid to resinous. Stipules absent. Leaves simple, alternate to densely spiral, more rarely opposite or whorled, sessile to petiolate; leaf blade margin entire, serrate, crenate, or rarely lobed. Inflorescences a reduced dichasial cyme of 1-12 axillary flowers; bracts absent. Flowers bisexual, rarely functionally male or female.

Corolla bilabiate, campanulate, rarely urceolate, actinomorphic, or zygomorphic, 5-lobed, lower lip 1-3-lobed, upper lip 2-4-lobed. Stamens 4(-8), inserted in corolla tube, alternate with corolla lobes, included or exserted; filaments filiform; anther cells confluent, reniform or sagittate.

 Gynoecium of 2 connate carpels; ovary superior, 2-carpelled, becoming 4(-12)-loculed by division of ovary; ovules 1-3(or 4) per locule, pendulous, anatropous; stigma capitate. Fruit usually indehiscent, rarely semi-dehiscent or subschizocarpic, dry or drupaceous with fleshy or watery mesocarp; endocarp woody. Seeds with a straight or slightly curved embryo; endosperm absent or sparse.Seven genera and ca. 250 species: tropical America, E and SE Asia, Australia, Indian Ocean islands (Mauritius and Rodrigues); one species in China.The family has recently been monographed (R. J. Chinnock,Eremophilaand allied genera: A monograph of the plant family Myoporaceae, 1-672. 2007), andPentacoeliumwas re-instated as a genus distinct fromMyoporumBanks & Solander ex G. Forster. AlthoughPentacoeliumis comparable vegetatively with species ofMyoporum, the flowers are much larger and the fruit are quite different. The fruit ofPentacoeliumare large and the most complex in the family. The fruit are similar in size and internal structures toBontiaLinnaeus, a genus endemic to the Caribbean and surrounding coastal areas of South America. Both genera show fruit features that suggest adaptation to dispersal by water, but the fruit ofPentacoeliumare more complicated with a star-shaped inner woody zone and up to 10 locules and subapical lacunae extending down into the fruit.Li Zhenyu. 2002.
