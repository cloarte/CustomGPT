Fiscal Year 2018 Quarterly Report   
 
Surveillance Summary for Second Quarter:  Jan. 1 – Mar. 31, 2018 
 
Report Summary1 
 This report covers the second quarter (Q2) of FY 2018, from Jan. 1 – Mar. 31, 2018.  
 Where relevant, the report also includes previous years’ data for historical perspective.  
 The report provides data from both national and regional levels. 
 In FY 2018 Q1-Q2, a total of 7,284 samples were submitted for influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) 
surveillance from 2,448 accessions.  
 H1N1 continues to be the predominant subtype reported in USDA data.  
 Over the past 8 quarters, H1N2 predominated in Regions 1, 3, 4 and 5. H1N1 predominated in 
Region 2. When regions are recorded as “unknown,” there was an even mix between H1N2 and 
H1N1. 
 Limited accessions from a region can skew data and lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, less 
inference can be applied to results from Regions 3, 4, and 5.  
 All IAV-S submissions are voluntary and based on clinical case submissions to veterinary 
diagnostic labs. These data are not a statistically representative sampling of the U.S. swine 
population. 
 Due to the voluntary nature of this surveillance, the information in this report cannot be used to 
determine regional and/or national incidence, prevalence, or other epidemiological measures, 
but it may help identify I

Introduction 
This report, based on data received as of July 2, 2018, provides a brief update on the status of national 
surveillance for IAV in swine for producers, swine practitioners, diagnosticians, and the public.  
Summaries in this report may differ from those in past reports due to the regular addition of data from 
participating laboratories. Reporting months are based on the month the sample was collected. The 
USDA-APHIS website provides general information about the IAV-S surveillance program 
(https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/swine-disease-
information/influenza-a-virus).  
                                                           
1 In November 2016, VS modernized the process that prepares and stages laboratory results data for reporting. Consequently, 
VS recognizes there is a small difference in previously reported summary numbers for IAV-S surveillance. The results in this 
report reflect updated and corrected numbers achieved with the modernized data process.

 Influenza A Virus in Swine Surveillance Quarterly Report for FY 2018, Quarter 2 
 
USDA-APHIS-VS     2 
The IAV-S surveillance program is voluntary and, as a result, the accessions and samples submitted 
represent a subset of the swine population. Submitted samples should only be collected from animals 
displaying influenza-like illness. Due to its voluntary nature, this surveillance system does not entirely 
represent the total U.S. domestic swine population. Therefore, the data cannot be used to determine 
IAV-S prevalence or other epidemiologic measures in the swine population. However, the data may help 
identify trends in influenza in swine.   
When the submitter does not report relevant information, data are recorded as “unknown.” Summaries 
in this report may differ from those in past reports due to the ongoing addition of data from 
participating labs. Reporting months are based on the month when the sample was collected.   
A laboratory accession is considered a set of samples collected at a single premises on a single day and 
received at the laboratory. While a nasal swab or lung tissue sample represents a single animal within 
the herd, a single oral fluid sample may represent one to two pens of animals in a herd. A positive 
sample status is based on the screening matrix real-

A laboratory accession is considered a set of samples collected at a single premises on a single day and 
received at the laboratory. While a nasal swab or lung tissue sample represents a single animal within 
the herd, a single oral fluid sample may represent one to two pens of animals in a herd. A positive 
sample status is based on the screening matrix real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR). The subtype is based on the rRT-PCR- subtyping assays and sequencing if the sample 
is sequenced. Virus isolation (VI) and sequencing are only attempted on rRT-PCR positives meeting 
criteria listed in the testing algorithm posted on the web.    
On a monthly basis, USDA performs whole genomic sequencing on a selected subset of isolates received 
through surveillance. On a quarterly basis, a phylogenetic analysis is performed; phylogenetic analyses 
are based on all successful USDA surveillance sequencing results, with sequences deposited into 
GenBank®, the public sequence database. 
 
IAV-S Surveillance Objectives 
USDA’s National Surveillance Plan for Swine Influenza Virus in Pigs (July 2010) describes the current 
surveillance system for IAV-S in detail. The surveillance objectives are to:  
1. Monitor genetic evolution of endemic IAV in swine to better understand endemic and 
emerging influenza virus ecology;  
2. Make influenza isolates from swine available for research and establish a data management 
system to facilitate genetic analysis of these isolates and related information; and  
3. Select proper isolates for the development of relevant diagnostic reagents, updated 
diagnostic assays, and vaccine seed stock products.

Objective 1.  Monitoring genetic evolution of endemic IAV in swine to better 
understand endemic and emerging influenza virus ecology 
Objective 1 is met through the submission of diagnostic laboratory samples to the surveillance system, 
collection of the viruses that are isolated from the samples, and analysis of the HA and NA sequences 
that are generated at the NAHLN laboratories and posted into GenBank®. Each month selected viruses 
undergo whole genomic sequencing by NVSL.  Phylogenic analysis of the genetic sequences is provided 
through an interagency agreement with the USDA-ARS National Animal Disease Center (NADC).  
National Surveillance Data Summary 
From FY 2011 through FY 2016, the total number of accessions and samples submitted rose over time. 
Changes initiated in FY 2016 have resulted in decreased laboratory accessions and samples, but a higher 
percentage of accessions that yield a virus that can be sequenced and analyzed. For FY 2018’s second 
quarter, 7,284 samples have been tested from 2,448 accessions (Figure 1).  Figure 2 shows the overall 
trends in total accessions, PCR-positive accessions, subtyped accessions, and VI positive accessions.

When accessions were evaluated by age-class for the second quarter, the following observations were noted. H1N2 was the most common 
subtype among suckling pigs.  H1N1 was the most common subtype among nursery and grower/ finisher pigs. Sow/boar had limited testing, with 
only four accessions of which one was H1N1, one was H1N2, and two were H3N2. Among accessions for which the age class was unknown or not 
recorded, H1N1 was the predominant subtype (Table 1). Nasal specimens (swab or wipes) were the most successful at providing positive virus 
isolation and submission to GenBank (Table 2).

Regional phylogenetic analysis 
Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the IAV-S surveillance system 
Phylogenetic analysis is conducted on gene sequences of the influenza A virus in swine to further 
examine the genetic changes that occur in HA, NA, and M genes, when available, of this rapidly changing 
virus. Through collaboration with ARS, a dataset2 of 473 isolates with published sequences in GenBank® 
was characterized by phylogenetic analysis for the Q2 FY 2018 report. This analysis provides information 
on the genetic diversity and evolution patterns of influenza in swine and allows for inferences about 
population and/or vaccine immunity. 
 
The following bar charts parse the data into an approximate 2-year window by quarters and subtypes 
for each region, followed by charts further parsing the H1 and H3 subtypes into phylogenetic clades. 
Regional charts depicting the various combinations of HA and NA are available in Appendix 1.

2 The ARS dataset is comprised of IAV-S surveillance isolate sequences that were posted in Genbank. This represents only a 
subset of the complete IAV-S surveillance dataset that includes PCR diagnostic test-based results as well as sequencing results. 
Therefore, ARS dataset results, such as subtype percentages, differ from the complete IAV-S dataset results provided in other 
sections of this report.

Figure 8 demonstrates the four subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and mixed subtypes across the five 
regions.  Regions 1 and 2 reported the most submissions, with a mixture of mostly H1N1, H1N2, and 
H3N2.  Limited accessions from a region can skew data and lead to misinterpretation and therefore, less 
inference can be applied to results from Regions 3, 4, and 5.

The USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, IA, receives virus isolates acquired 
through USDA’s IAV-S surveillance and deposits the isolates into the IAV-S virus repository. NAHLN 
testing labs post the genomic sequences from the isolates into GenBank®, a publically accessible 
database maintained by the National Institutes for Health. USDA swine surveillance influenza A virus 
isolates can be identified in GenBank® by their eight-digit barcode designations in the virus name, e.g. 
A/swine/NY/A01104005/2011(H3N2). The information in GenBank® will usually list “USDA Swine 
Surveillance” or similar in the Consortium field. The majority of available isolates will have H and N 
sequenced, but some will also have full genome sequencing completed, including the M gene. The 
repository contains over 3,000 viruses.  NVSL makes these viruses available to the public upon request.

Conclusion 
The IAV-S voluntary surveillance system continues to provide insight into the genetic makeup of 
circulating influenza virus in limited populations of commercial pigs. Genetic information and virus 
isolates are made publicly available for further research and possible vaccine strain selection and 
efficacy testing. Influenza A virus in swine remains a dynamic virus with high levels of genetic variability 
in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes.

Influenza A Virus in Swine Surveillance 
Fiscal Year 2018 Quarterly Report   
 
Surveillance Summary for Second Quarter:  Jan. 1 – Mar. 31, 2018 
 
Report Summary1 
 This report covers the second quarter (Q2) of FY 2018, from Jan. 1 – Mar. 31, 2018.  
 Where relevant, the report also includes previous years’ data for historical perspective.  
 The report provides data from both national and regional levels. 
 In FY 2018 Q1-Q2, a total of 7,284 samples were submitted for influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) 
surveillance from 2,448 accessions.  
 H1N1 continues to be the predominant subtype reported in USDA data.  
 Over the past 8 quarters, H1N2 predominated in Regions 1, 3, 4 and 5. H1N1 predominated in 
Region 2. When regions are recorded as “unknown,” there was an even mix between H1N2 and 
H1N1. 
 Limited accessions from a region can skew data and lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, less 
inference can be applied to results from Regions 3, 4, and 5.  
 All IAV-S submissions are voluntary and based on clinical case submissions to veterinary 
diagnostic labs. These data are not a statistically representative sampling of the U.S. swine 
population. 
 Due to the voluntary nature of this surveillance, the information in this report cannot be used to 
determine regional and/or national incidence, prevalence, or other epidemiological measures, 
but it may help identify I

Introduction 
This report, based on data received as of July 2, 2018, provides a brief update on the status of national 
surveillance for IAV in swine for producers, swine practitioners, diagnosticians, and the public.  
Summaries in this report may differ from those in past reports due to the regular addition of data from 
participating laboratories. Reporting months are based on the month the sample was collected. The 
USDA-APHIS website provides general information about the IAV-S surveillance program 
(https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/swine-disease-
information/influenza-a-virus).  
                                                           
1 In November 2016, VS modernized the process that prepares and stages laboratory results data for reporting. Consequently, 
VS recognizes there is a small difference in previously reported summary numbers for IAV-S surveillance. The results in this 
report reflect updated and corrected numbers achieved with the modernized data process.

USDA-APHIS-VS     2 
The IAV-S surveillance program is voluntary and, as a result, the accessions and samples submitted 
represent a subset of the swine population. Submitted samples should only be collected from animals 
displaying influenza-like illness. Due to its voluntary nature, this surveillance system does not entirely 
represent the total U.S. domestic swine population. Therefore, the data cannot be used to determine 
IAV-S prevalence or other epidemiologic measures in the swine population. However, the data may help 
identify trends in influenza in swine.   
When the submitter does not report relevant information, data are recorded as “unknown.” Summaries 
in this report may differ from those in past reports due to the ongoing addition of data from 
participating labs. Reporting months are based on the month when the sample was collected.   
A laboratory accession is considered a set of samples collected at a single premises on a single day and 
received at the laboratory. While a nasal swab or lung tissue sample represents a single animal within 
the herd, a single oral fluid sample may represent one to two pens of animals in a herd. A positive 
sample status is based on the screening matrix real-

A laboratory accession is considered a set of samples collected at a single premises on a single day and 
received at the laboratory. While a nasal swab or lung tissue sample represents a single animal within 
the herd, a single oral fluid sample may represent one to two pens of animals in a herd. A positive 
sample status is based on the screening matrix real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR). The subtype is based on the rRT-PCR- subtyping assays and sequencing if the sample 
is sequenced. Virus isolation (VI) and sequencing are only attempted on rRT-PCR positives meeting 
criteria listed in the testing algorithm posted on the web.    
On a monthly basis, USDA performs whole genomic sequencing on a selected subset of isolates received 
through surveillance. On a quarterly basis, a phylogenetic analysis is performed; phylogenetic analyses 
are based on all successful USDA surveillance sequencing results, with sequences deposited into 
GenBank®, the public sequence database. 
 
IAV-S Surveillance Objectives 
USDA’s National Surveillance Plan for Swine Influenza Virus in Pigs (July 2010) describes the current 
surveillance system for IAV-S in detail. The surveillance objectives are to:  
1. Monitor genetic evolution of endemic IAV in swine to better understand endemic and 
emerging influenza virus ecology;  
2. Make influenza isolates from swine available for research and establish a data management 
system to facilitate genetic analysis of these isolates and related information; and  
3. Select proper isolates for the development of relevant diagnostic reagents, updated 
diagnostic assays, and vaccine seed stock products.

Objective 1.  Monitoring genetic evolution of endemic IAV in swine to better 
understand endemic and emerging influenza virus ecology 
Objective 1 is met through the submission of diagnostic laboratory samples to the surveillance system, 
collection of the viruses that are isolated from the samples, and analysis of the HA and NA sequences 
that are generated at the NAHLN laboratories and posted into GenBank®. Each month selected viruses 
undergo whole genomic sequencing by NVSL.  Phylogenic analysis of the genetic sequences is provided 
through an interagency agreement with the USDA-ARS National Animal Disease Center (NADC).  
National Surveillance Data Summary 
From FY 2011 through FY 2016, the total number of accessions and samples submitted rose over time. 
Changes initiated in FY 2016 have resulted in decreased laboratory accessions and samples, but a higher 
percentage of accessions that yield a virus that can be sequenced and analyzed. For FY 2018’s second 
quarter, 7,284 samples have been tested from 2,448 accessions (Figure 1).  Figure 2 shows the overall 
trends in total accessions, PCR-positive accessions, subtyped accessions, and VI positive accessions.

When accessions were evaluated by age-class for the second quarter, the following observations were noted. H1N2 was the most common 
subtype among suckling pigs.  H1N1 was the most common subtype among nursery and grower/ finisher pigs. Sow/boar had limited testing, with 
only four accessions of which one was H1N1, one was H1N2, and two were H3N2. Among accessions for which the age class was unknown or not 
recorded, H1N1 was the predominant subtype (Table 1). Nasal specimens (swab or wipes) were the most successful at providing positive virus 
isolation and submission to GenBank (Table 2).

Regional phylogenetic analysis 
Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the IAV-S surveillance system 
Phylogenetic analysis is conducted on gene sequences of the influenza A virus in swine to further 
examine the genetic changes that occur in HA, NA, and M genes, when available, of this rapidly changing 
virus. Through collaboration with ARS, a dataset2 of 473 isolates with published sequences in GenBank® 
was characterized by phylogenetic analysis for the Q2 FY 2018 report. This analysis provides information 
on the genetic diversity and evolution patterns of influenza in swine and allows for inferences about 
population and/or vaccine immunity. 
 
The following bar charts parse the data into an approximate 2-year window by quarters and subtypes 
for each region, followed by charts further parsing the H1 and H3 subtypes into phylogenetic clades. 
Regional charts depicting the various combinations of HA and NA are available in Appendix 1.

2 The ARS dataset is comprised of IAV-S surveillance isolate sequences that were posted in Genbank. This represents only a 
subset of the complete IAV-S surveillance dataset that includes PCR diagnostic test-based results as well as sequencing results. 
Therefore, ARS dataset results, such as subtype percentages, differ from the complete IAV-S dataset results provided in other 
sections of this report.

Figure 8 demonstrates the four subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and mixed subtypes across the five 
regions.  Regions 1 and 2 reported the most submissions, with a mixture of mostly H1N1, H1N2, and 
H3N2.  Limited accessions from a region can skew data and lead to misinterpretation and therefore, less 
inference can be applied to results from Regions 3, 4, and 5.

The USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, IA, receives virus isolates acquired 
through USDA’s IAV-S surveillance and deposits the isolates into the IAV-S virus repository. NAHLN 
testing labs post the genomic sequences from the isolates into GenBank®, a publically accessible 
database maintained by the National Institutes for Health. USDA swine surveillance influenza A virus 
isolates can be identified in GenBank® by their eight-digit barcode designations in the virus name, e.g. 
A/swine/NY/A01104005/2011(H3N2). The information in GenBank® will usually list “USDA Swine 
Surveillance” or similar in the Consortium field. The majority of available isolates will have H and N 
sequenced, but some will also have full genome sequencing completed, including the M gene. The 
repository contains over 3,000 viruses.  NVSL makes these viruses available to the public upon request.

Conclusion 
The IAV-S voluntary surveillance system continues to provide insight into the genetic makeup of 
circulating influenza virus in limited populations of commercial pigs. Genetic information and virus 
isolates are made publicly available for further research and possible vaccine strain selection and 
efficacy testing. Influenza A virus in swine remains a dynamic virus with high levels of genetic variability 
in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes.

Appendix 1.  Regional Charts of HA and NA Combinations by Percentage 
The following charts present the percentages of combinations of HA and NA on the national and 
regional scales based on ARS-NADC phylogenetic analyses. The results are reported from April 2016 to 
March 2018. These “heat maps” represent the percentage of combinations by using a color gradient; a 
deeper gradient represents a greater percentage occurrence for a particular HA-NA combination.  HA 
clusters are listed on the left vertical axis of the chart and NA clusters are listed on the bottom 
horizontal axis.  Line up the HA cluster with the corresponding NA cluster to determine the percentage 
of occurrence of that particular combination.  
  
 
 
  
Total HA & NA combinations – 1,721
