 Reproduccion: The most detailed studies on the life history of T. holosericeus have been conducted in India, and therefore most of the data reported here is based on those studies. Timing of events in the life cycle of T. holosericeus vary widely given that the geographic range of this beetle extends from near the equator to about 30°N latitude, and from sea level to about 2500 m elevation. For example, Khan (1989) reported adult emergence during February and March in central India (Madhya Pradesh), whereas Stebbing (1914) reported emergence primarily in June and July in northern India (Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand). Also in northern India (Jammu Province), Gupta and Tara (2013) stated that adults are active during April to June. And finally, although no details on where the observations were made, adults were reported to emerge from March to May by Beeson (1941) and April to July by Rahman and Khan (1942).

Reports on the time required for T. holosericeus to complete a single generation vary widely, which is to be expected given its broad latitudinal range and ability to infest live trees and cut logs. The shortest generation times reported of only 8-15 months were for the Andaman Islands, which are located at 10° to 14°N latitude ( Khan and Maiti, 1983 ). Others, working in central and northern India, have reported generation times of 1 year ( Khan, 1989 ), 1-2 years (Beeson, 1941), 2 years ( Wang, 2017 ), and 2-3 years (Rahman and Khan, 1942). Mating takes place on the host tree (Stebbing, 1914). Tara et al. (2009) reported that mating starts within 2-3 days of emergence. By contrast, Sinha et al. (2011) stated that males start to mate within 2 days post-emergence, compared with 6-8 days for females. No pheromones have been reported for T. holosericeus ; however, known pheromones for all other Cerambycinae have all been male-produced aggregation pheromones ( Millar and Hanks, 2017 ). T. holosericeus females usually chew a small slit in the outer bark, often in bark cracks and crevices, and then deposit one or more eggs into the slit (Rahman and Khan, 1942; Sinha et al., 2011 ; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). The number of eggs laid at a single site was reported as 1-5 eggs by Gupta and Tara (2013) , 2-4 by Wang (2017) , and 4-8 by Rahman and Khan (1942). Sinha et al.

The number of eggs laid at a single site was reported as 1-5 eggs by Gupta and Tara (2013) , 2-4 by Wang (2017) , and 4-8 by Rahman and Khan (1942). Sinha et al. (2011) reported that females appeared to seal the bark slit afterwards by rubbing their ovipositor over the slit for 3-5 minutes. Under laboratory conditions, Gupta and Tara (2013) reported that T. holosericeus lifetime fecundity averaged 63 eggs per female with a range of 45-83. However, Rahman and Khan (1942) stated that one female laid 92 eggs in her lifetime, while others reported that some females can lay 200-300 eggs each (Beeson, 1941; Khan, 1989 ; Wang, 2017 ). Gupta and Tara (2013) stated that eggs hatched in 9-12 days, with an average incubation period of 11 days. By contrast, egg hatch was reported to occur in 2-3 days by Khan (1989) , 7-12 days by Rahman and Khan (1942), and 18-20 days by Sinha et al. (2011) . Based on head capsule widths, Gupta and Tara (2013) estimated that T. holosericeus has seven larval instars. After hatching, first instar larvae tunnel directly through the bark and feed in the cambial region at the interface of the bark and wood, with later instars entering the sapwood and heartwood ( Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). The larval galleries in the cambial region form a zig-zag pattern and at various locations broaden out into wide cavities that score deeply into both the bark and outer sapwood (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941). Stebbing (1914) stated that the portion of the larval gallery constructed on the sapwood surface is

 ( Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). The larval galleries in the cambial region form a zig-zag pattern and at various locations broaden out into wide cavities that score deeply into both the bark and outer sapwood (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941). Stebbing (1914) stated that the portion of the larval gallery constructed on the sapwood surface is about 30 cm long and that the cavities are about 7.5 cm wide. Larvae usually chew 2-4 holes through the bark at various locations during their tunneling and use these holes to eject some of their frass and wood shavings (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). At times various tree exudates also drip from these frass-ejection holes (Rahman and Khan, 1942; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). Gupta and Sharma (2015) noted active expulsion of frass from infested trees from April through November, peaking during August to October. When larvae are about two-thirds developed they tunnel somewhat horizontally (to the tree’s axis) into the sapwood and possibly heartwood for a distance of 6-7.5 cm and then tunnel downward, parallel to the tree’s axis, for about the same distance to form the eventual pupal chamber (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941). Prior to pupation, the larva returns to the near the bark surface and chews an area that will be used by the eventual adult as their exit hole. The larva then returns to the end of the gallery where it seals itself inside by capping the entrance to the pupal chamber with wood shavings and a calcium carbonate substance regurgitated by the larva to form an operculum (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941; Haack et al., 2017 ). Pupation typically occurs in autumn or spring, and lasts 1

va then returns to the end of the gallery where it seals itself inside by capping the entrance to the pupal chamber with wood shavings and a calcium carbonate substance regurgitated by the larva to form an operculum (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941; Haack et al., 2017 ). Pupation typically occurs in autumn or spring, and lasts 1-3 months depending on local conditions (Rahman and Khan, 1942; Duffy, 1968). For example, Beeson (1941) stated that pupation usually occurs in October and lasts only 3 weeks, whereas Gupta and Tara (2013) reported pupation usually starts in September or October and lasts about 8 weeks. Under ambient conditions indoors, Sinha et al. (2011) reported a 34-45 day pupation period. When pupation occurs in autumn the new adults remain in the pupal chambers until the following spring and then emerge from the tree. Under laboratory conditions, adult longevity averaged 16 days for females and 33 days for males ( Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). Adults are mostly nocturnal and usually remain still in bark crevices or on the shady side of logs during the day (Beeson, 1941; Rahman and Khan, 1942). Adults feed on the bark of young twigs ( Tara et al., 2009 ; Sinha et al., 2011 ; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ), but not on foliage (Rahman and Khan, 1942).
 Sintomas: Signs of T. holosericeus infestation include zig-zag irregular galleries, often with broadened areas, constructed on the sapwood surface by early larval instars and also galleries that enter deep into the sapwood and heartwood that are constructed by late larval instars. The pupal chamber is formed at the end of the larval gallery and is usually parallel to the axis of the tree trunk or branch. Frass is ejected from the galleries through small holes in the bark

 broadened areas, constructed on the sapwood surface by early larval instars and also galleries that enter deep into the sapwood and heartwood that are constructed by late larval instars. The pupal chamber is formed at the end of the larval gallery and is usually parallel to the axis of the tree trunk or branch. Frass is ejected from the galleries through small holes in the bark as the larvae tunnel. In heavily infested trees, frass can accumulate at the base of the tree. Upon emergence from the trees, adults chew oval exit holes through the bark, with those produced by males being 0.6-0.9 cm wide and those made by females being 0.8-1.1 cm wide ( Sinha et al., 2011 ). Given that borer infestation can occur over multiple years until the host tree dies, the typical symptoms include wilted foliage followed by crown dieback and eventual tree death.

Based on head capsule widths, Gupta and Tara (2013) estimated that T. holosericeus has seven larval instars. After hatching, first instar larvae tunnel directly through the bark and feed in the cambial region at the interface of the bark and wood, with later instars entering the sapwood and heartwood ( Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). The larval galleries in the cambial region form a zig-zag pattern and at various locations broaden out into wide cavities that score deeply into both the bark and outer sapwood (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941). Stebbing (1914) stated that the portion of the larval gallery constructed on the sapwood surface is

 ( Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). The larval galleries in the cambial region form a zig-zag pattern and at various locations broaden out into wide cavities that score deeply into both the bark and outer sapwood (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941). Stebbing (1914) stated that the portion of the larval gallery constructed on the sapwood surface is about 30 cm long and that the cavities are about 7.5 cm wide. Larvae usually chew 2-4 holes through the bark at various locations during their tunneling and use these holes to eject some of their frass and wood shavings (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). At times various tree exudates also drip from these frass-ejection holes (Rahman and Khan, 1942; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). Gupta and Sharma (2015) noted active expulsion of frass from infested trees from April through November, peaking during August to October. When larvae are about two-thirds developed they tunnel somewhat horizontally (to the tree’s axis) into the sapwood and possibly heartwood for a distance of 6-7.5 cm and then tunnel downward, parallel to the tree’s axis, for about the same distance to form the eventual pupal chamber (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941). Prior to pupation, the larva returns to the near the bark surface and chews an area that will be used by the eventual adult as their exit hole. The larva then returns to the end of the gallery where it seals itself inside by capping the entrance to the pupal chamber with wood shavings and a calcium carbonate substance regurgitated by the larva to form an operculum (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941; Haack et al., 2017 ). Pupation typically occurs in autumn or spring, and lasts 1

va then returns to the end of the gallery where it seals itself inside by capping the entrance to the pupal chamber with wood shavings and a calcium carbonate substance regurgitated by the larva to form an operculum (Stebbing, 1914; Beeson, 1941; Haack et al., 2017 ). Pupation typically occurs in autumn or spring, and lasts 1-3 months depending on local conditions (Rahman and Khan, 1942; Duffy, 1968). For example, Beeson (1941) stated that pupation usually occurs in October and lasts only 3 weeks, whereas Gupta and Tara (2013) reported pupation usually starts in September or October and lasts about 8 weeks. Under ambient conditions indoors, Sinha et al. (2011) reported a 34-45 day pupation period. When pupation occurs in autumn the new adults remain in the pupal chambers until the following spring and then emerge from the tree. Under laboratory conditions, adult longevity averaged 16 days for females and 33 days for males ( Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). Adults are mostly nocturnal and usually remain still in bark crevices or on the shady side of logs during the day (Beeson, 1941; Rahman and Khan, 1942). Adults feed on the bark of young twigs ( Tara et al., 2009 ; Sinha et al., 2011 ; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ), but not on foliage (Rahman and Khan, 1942).
 Sintomas: Signs of T. holosericeus infestation include zig-zag irregular galleries, often with broadened areas, constructed on the sapwood surface by early larval instars and also galleries that enter deep into the sapwood and heartwood that are constructed by late larval instars. The pupal chamber is formed at the end of the larval gallery and is usually parallel to the axis of the tree trunk or branch. Frass is ejected from the galleries through small holes in the bark

 broadened areas, constructed on the sapwood surface by early larval instars and also galleries that enter deep into the sapwood and heartwood that are constructed by late larval instars. The pupal chamber is formed at the end of the larval gallery and is usually parallel to the axis of the tree trunk or branch. Frass is ejected from the galleries through small holes in the bark as the larvae tunnel. In heavily infested trees, frass can accumulate at the base of the tree. Upon emergence from the trees, adults chew oval exit holes through the bark, with those produced by males being 0.6-0.9 cm wide and those made by females being 0.8-1.1 cm wide ( Sinha et al., 2011 ). Given that borer infestation can occur over multiple years until the host tree dies, the typical symptoms include wilted foliage followed by crown dieback and eventual tree death.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Physiology and Phenology​ The most detailed studies on the life history of T. holosericeus have been conducted in India, and therefore most of the data reported here is based on those studies. Timing of events in the life cycle of T. holosericeus vary widely given that the geographic range of this beetle extends from near the equator to about 30°N latitude, and from sea level to about 2500 m elevation. For example, Khan (1989) reported adult emergence during February and March in central India (Madhya Pradesh), whereas Stebbing (1914) reported emergence primarily in June and July in northern India (Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand). Also in northern India (Jammu Province), Gupta and Tara (2013) stated that adults are active during April to June. And finally, although no details on where the observations were made, adults were reported to

 and March in central India (Madhya Pradesh), whereas Stebbing (1914) reported emergence primarily in June and July in northern India (Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand). Also in northern India (Jammu Province), Gupta and Tara (2013) stated that adults are active during April to June. And finally, although no details on where the observations were made, adults were reported to emerge from March to May by Beeson (1941) and April to July by Rahman and Khan (1942). Reports on the time required for T. holosericeus to complete a single generation vary widely, which is to be expected given its broad latitudinal range and ability to infest live trees and cut logs. The shortest generation times reported of only 8-15 months were for the Andaman Islands, which are located at 10° to 14°N latitude ( Khan and Maiti, 1983 ). Others, working in central and northern India, have reported generation times of 1 year ( Khan, 1989 ), 1-2 years (Beeson, 1941), 2 years ( Wang, 2017 ), and 2-3 years (Rahman and Khan, 1942). Reproductive Biology Mating takes place on the host tree (Stebbing, 1914). Tara et al. (2009) reported that mating starts within 2-3 days of emergence. By contrast, Sinha et al. (2011) stated that males start to mate within 2 days post-emergence, compared with 6-8 days for females. No pheromones have been reported for T. holosericeus ; however, known pheromones for all other Cerambycinae have all been male-produced aggregation pheromones ( Millar and Hanks, 2017 ). T. holosericeus females usually chew a small slit in the outer bark, often in bark cracks and crevices, and then deposit one or more eggs into the slit (Rahman and

T. holosericeus females usually chew a small slit in the outer bark, often in bark cracks and crevices, and then deposit one or more eggs into the slit (Rahman and Khan, 1942; Sinha et al., 2011 ; Gupta and Tara, 2013 ). The number of eggs laid at a single site was reported as 1-5 eggs by Gupta and Tara (2013) , 2-4 by Wang (2017) , and 4-8 by Rahman and Khan (1942). Sinha et al. (2011) reported that females appeared to seal the bark slit afterwards by rubbing their ovipositor over the slit for 3-5 minutes. Under laboratory conditions, Gupta and Tara (2013) reported that T. holosericeus lifetime fecundity averaged 63 eggs per female with a range of 45-83. However, Rahman and Khan (1942) stated that one female laid 92 eggs in her lifetime, while others reported that some females can lay 200-300 eggs each (Beeson, 1941; Khan, 1989 ; Wang, 2017 ). Gupta and Tara (2013) stated that eggs hatched in 9-12 days, with an average incubation period of 11 days.
