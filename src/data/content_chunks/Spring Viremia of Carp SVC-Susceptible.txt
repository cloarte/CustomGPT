1. Spring Viremia of Carp (SVC): 
a. The facility of origin participates in an ongoing Spring Viremia of Carp 
(SVC) monitoring program for species susceptible to SVC, by testing twice 
annually for a minimum of two (2) consecutive years, with at least three 
(3) months between tests. AND 
b. Populations were tested at a ninety- five (95) percent confidence and two 
(2) percent assumed prevalence level, and found negative for SVC. AND 
c. Sample collection was done at times when water temperatures are conducive 
to detecting SVC virus.  AND

d. Samples were collected by an official veterinarian, or certifying 
official, representing the Competent Authority. AND 
e. Cell cultures were incubated on epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) or 
Fathead minnow (FHM) cell lines at fifteen (15) to twenty- five (25) 
degrees Celsius, with at least two (2) serial passages and evaluation of 
cytopathic effect (CPE) for a minimum of seven (7) days after each 
passage.  All testing results were negative for SVC. 
2. The consignment was inspected by a licensed veterinarian, or other approved 
representative, of the exporting country’s Competent Authority within seventy-
two (72) hours of shipment, and found to be free of any clinical evidence of 
SVC disease. 
3. Shipping Containers: 
a. All shipping containers are either new, OR 
b. Have been cleaned and disinfected according to protocols listed in the 
interim rule. (*NOTE: If containers are not new, then details of cleaning
