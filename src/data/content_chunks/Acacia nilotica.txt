 Invasion: Acacia niloticais generally a single-stemmed tree, usually 2.5-15 m high but can reach 25 m or more in riverine subspecies. The crown can be upright and flattened or rounded and spreading, as well as varying from hemispherical to narrow and erect. In India, stem circumference can reach 2-3 m, with a clear bole height of 6-7.5 m (Troup and Joshi, 1983). The bark is grey to brownish-black, rough and longitudinally fissured, never powdery or peeling. Young branchlets glabrous to subtomentose, glands inconspicuous or absent, bark not flaking off.

 Reproduccion: Acacia nilotica shows a great deal of morphological variation, nine subspecies being recognized ( Brenan, 1983 ), indicative of high levels of genetic variation. It is an outcrossing, insect-pollinated species and the taxa form a polyploid complex: most are tetraploids (2 n = 52); but higher numbers have been found in A. nilotica subsp. nilotica (2 n = 104) and A. nilotica subsp. tomentosa (2 n = 208) ( Nongonierma, 1976 ). The mating system of A. nilotica was investigated by scoring three enzyme systems in starch-gel electrophoresis, isozyme banding patterns within families suggesting that the species is autotetraploid, displaying tetrasomic inheritance. The best level of outcrossing was tm=0.384, highly significantly less than one. These suggested that the species is self-compatible and approximately 60% of seeds are set through self-pollination ( Mandal et al., 1994 ). Controlled pollinations are needed to estimate the degree of compatibility and assessing the factors controlling the extent of outcrossing in this species, otherwise heritability will be overestimated from open pollinated progeny trials. A number of early trials were based on relatively few collections. Plant material was collected and planted in a FAO/IBPGR project for arid zone species ( Armitage et al., 1980 ), but

A number of early trials were based on relatively few collections. Plant material was collected and planted in a FAO/IBPGR project for arid zone species ( Armitage et al., 1980 ), but again sampling was from relatively few sites. More recently, range wide collections in Africa were undertaken by the Oxford Forestry Institute (now the Department of Plant Sciences), UK and members of the African Acacia trials network (comprising OFI, UK, CIRAD-Forêt, France and the Danida Forest Seed Centre, DFSC, Denmark), co-ordinated by the FAO and seed is available for trials ( Fagg et al., 1997 ). There have been a number of international provenance trials planted but these have yet to be evaluated. In India, large provenance trials of A. nilotica subsp. indica have been planted and data on germination, seedling growth and nitrogen fixation are available ( Toky et al., 1995 ; Krishan and Toky, 1996 ). A mature tree can produce 2000-3000 pods in a good fruiting season, each with usually between eight and 16 seeds, yielding 5000 to 16,000 seed/kg depending on the subspecies. The species will produce pods in abundance after 5 to 7 years of age. There is considerable variation in the degree of seed production and germination in relation to water supply, with high reproductive success recorded in very wet years or in favourable locations, e.g. next to water channels ( Carter, 1998 ). Trees adjacent to water are able to reproduce in most years (Anon., 2001) but trees in dry areas produce few seeds in the absence of winter rain ( Carter, 1998 ). Seeds are dispersed by mammalian herbivores, particularly domestic livestock and a high proportion of the seeds that

Trees adjacent to water are able to reproduce in most years (Anon., 2001) but trees in dry areas produce few seeds in the absence of winter rain ( Carter, 1998 ). Seeds are dispersed by mammalian herbivores, particularly domestic livestock and a high proportion of the seeds that pass through stock are viable ( Carter, 1998 ) and seeds may remain viable for 7 years or more (Anon., 2001). Acacia nilotica flowers at a relatively young age, around 3 to 4 years of age, in ideal conditions, on current-season growth during the rainy season. Flowering is prolific and can occur several times a year depending on the availability of soil moisture. In southern Africa (all countries south of Tanzania), peak flowering appears to occur from October to December and peak fruiting around April/June. In eastern Africa, the trend is complicated by bimodal rainfall, with flowering occurring most months of the year for subsp. subalata with no marked fruiting period, although flowering of subsp. leiocarpa tends to peak in September ( Fagg and Barnes, 1995 ). In West Africa, in subsp. adstringens flowering occurs over most of the year with a peak in October; in subsp. nilotica flowering peaks in September/October; and in subsp. tomentosa a little later in November. Fruiting peaks in January for subsp. adstringens and subsp. tomentosa and in April for subsp. nilotica . In India, subsp. indica flowers from June to September and sometimes in December/January and the pods reach full size (for fodder) by February/March and ripen from April to June ( Gupta, 1993 ).

In India, subsp. indica flowers from June to September and sometimes in December/January and the pods reach full size (for fodder) by February/March and ripen from April to June ( Gupta, 1993 ). Acacia nilotica is a nitrogen-fixing tree that nodulates frequently over its natural range and forms mycorrhizal associations ( Njiti and Galiana, 1996 ; Ingleby et al., 1997 ). Acacia nilotica prefers dry conditions, with an annual rainfall of 200-1500 mm, although under irrigation some varieties will grow in areas with less than 100 mm. In India, the optimum lower limit is around 600 mm without irrigation ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ) and there are records of upper limits of 2300 mm in South East Asia (Lemmens and Wulijarni-Soetjipto, 1991). Some of these are plantings out of its natural range and caution is recommended before making introductions into humid areas. It is found principally in the drier lowland tropical and subtropical regions, in both unimodal and bimodal rainfall regions and in regular and irregular regimes ( Nicholson et al., 1988 ). Average annual temperatures commonly vary from 15° to 28°C, although it can withstand daily maximum temperatures of 50°C and is frost tender when young. Depending on the subspecies, it will tolerate both drought and flooded conditions for several months. A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ).

Acacia nilotica in Africa exhibits two very distinct ecological preferences: subspecies subalata , leiocarpa and adstringens occur in wooded grassland, savanna and dry scrub forests on deep sandy loamy soils and also on lateritic and calcareous sites; subsp. kraussiana also prefers dry grasslands and savannas, especially on compacted sandy loam, shallow granite or clay soils along drainage lines and rivers, but away from flooding. On the other hand, subsp. nilotica and tomentosa are restricted to riverine habitats and seasonally flooded areas on clay alluvial soils ( Fagg, 1992 ). In the Indian subcontinent, subsp. indica forms low altitude dry forests usually on alluvium soils subject to flooding or black cotton soils. It is now widely planted on farms throughout the plains and will grow on saline, alkaline soils and on those with calcareous pans, but requires sufficient moisture in the soil or subsoil ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ; Luna, 1996 ). It will grow but remain stunted on shallow soils with an underlying bedrock or beds of nodular kankar and also on poor argillaceous soils. A. nilotica subsp. hemispherica is restricted to sandy stream beds near Karachi, Pakistan and subsp. cupressiformis has similar preferences to subsp. indica , though it is less resilient to weed competition. In the Indian subcontinent, A. nilotica is usually found below altitudes of 450 m although some subspecies in Africa occur at altitudes as high as 2000 m.

Inner bark contains 18–23% tannin, used
for tanning and dyeing leather black.  Young pods produce a very pale tint in
leather, notably goat hides (Kano leather).  Pods were used by the ancient
Egyptians.  Young bark used as fiber, twigs esteemed for tooth brushes
(chewsticks).  Trees tapped for gum arabic.  The gum arabic is still used in
making candles, inks, matches, and paints (NAS, 1980).  Tender pods and shoots
used as vegetable, and used as forage for camels, sheep and goats, especially
in Sudan, where it is said to improve milk from these animals.  Seeds are a
valuable cattle food.  Roasted seed kernels, sometimes used for flavoring and
when crushed provide the dye for black strings worn by Nankani women.  Trees

(2n=52.)
Distribution
Native from Egypt south to Mozambique and Natal; apparently introduced to
Zanzibar, Pemba, and India; Arabia.  Considered a serious weed in South Africa.
Ecology
Woodlands of various sorts, wooded grasslands, scrub and thickets.  Thrives in
dry areas, but endures floods.  Grows 10–1,340 m altitude, in a wide range of
conditions.  Grows on a wide variety of soils, seemingly thriving on alluvial
soils, black cotton soils, heavy clay soils, as well as even poorer soils (NAS,
1980).  Ranging from Subtropical Desert to Subtropical Dry through Tropical
Desert to Tropical Dry Forest Life Zones, babul is reported to tolerate annual
precipitation of 3.8–22.8 dm (mean of 12 cases = 12.0 dm), annual mean
temperature of 18.7–27.8°C (mean of 12 cases = 24.1°C), and pH of 5.0–8.0
(mean of 10 cases = 6.9) (Duke, 1981a).

 dm), annual mean
temperature of 18.7–27.8°C (mean of 12 cases = 24.1°C), and pH of 5.0–8.0
(mean of 10 cases = 6.9) (Duke, 1981a).
Cultivation
Trees propagated in forest by seeds.  Direct seeding is the common practice.
Stored seed may require scarification.  Young seedlings are said to "require
full sun and frequent weeding" (NAS, 1980a).
Harvesting
Although there are other sources of gum arabic, trees are still tapped for the
gum by removing a bit of bark 5–7.5 cm wide and bruising the surrounding bark
with mallet or hammer.  The resulting reddish gum, almost completely soluble
and tasteless, is formed into balls.  Though used in commerce to some extent,
it is inferior to other forms of gum arabic, with which it is sometimes mixed.
Yields and Economics
Various products of the tree are used locally in tropical Africa, but none
enter international markets.  Trees usually add 2–3 cm in diameter each year
(NAS, 1980a).
Energy
Extensively used, e.g. in India, for firewood and charcoal, this species has
been used in locomotives and steamships as well as industry balers.  It is
cultivated for industrial fuel in the Sudan.  The calorific value of the
sapwood is 4,800 kcal/kg of the heartwood 4,950.  The species does nodulate and
fix nitrogen.
Biotic Factors
Wood borers may afflict the stems and bruchids may afflict the seeds.

 Invasion: Acacia niloticais generally a single-stemmed tree, usually 2.5-15 m high but can reach 25 m or more in riverine subspecies. The crown can be upright and flattened or rounded and spreading, as well as varying from hemispherical to narrow and erect. In India, stem circumference can reach 2-3 m, with a clear bole height of 6-7.5 m (Troup and Joshi, 1983). The bark is grey to brownish-black, rough and longitudinally fissured, never powdery or peeling. Young branchlets glabrous to subtomentose, glands inconspicuous or absent, bark not flaking off.

 Reproduccion: Acacia nilotica shows a great deal of morphological variation, nine subspecies being recognized ( Brenan, 1983 ), indicative of high levels of genetic variation. It is an outcrossing, insect-pollinated species and the taxa form a polyploid complex: most are tetraploids (2 n = 52); but higher numbers have been found in A. nilotica subsp. nilotica (2 n = 104) and A. nilotica subsp. tomentosa (2 n = 208) ( Nongonierma, 1976 ). The mating system of A. nilotica was investigated by scoring three enzyme systems in starch-gel electrophoresis, isozyme banding patterns within families suggesting that the species is autotetraploid, displaying tetrasomic inheritance. The best level of outcrossing was tm=0.384, highly significantly less than one. These suggested that the species is self-compatible and approximately 60% of seeds are set through self-pollination ( Mandal et al., 1994 ). Controlled pollinations are needed to estimate the degree of compatibility and assessing the factors controlling the extent of outcrossing in this species, otherwise heritability will be overestimated from open pollinated progeny trials. A number of early trials were based on relatively few collections. Plant material was collected and planted in a FAO/IBPGR project for arid zone species ( Armitage et al., 1980 ), but

A number of early trials were based on relatively few collections. Plant material was collected and planted in a FAO/IBPGR project for arid zone species ( Armitage et al., 1980 ), but again sampling was from relatively few sites. More recently, range wide collections in Africa were undertaken by the Oxford Forestry Institute (now the Department of Plant Sciences), UK and members of the African Acacia trials network (comprising OFI, UK, CIRAD-Forêt, France and the Danida Forest Seed Centre, DFSC, Denmark), co-ordinated by the FAO and seed is available for trials ( Fagg et al., 1997 ). There have been a number of international provenance trials planted but these have yet to be evaluated. In India, large provenance trials of A. nilotica subsp. indica have been planted and data on germination, seedling growth and nitrogen fixation are available ( Toky et al., 1995 ; Krishan and Toky, 1996 ). A mature tree can produce 2000-3000 pods in a good fruiting season, each with usually between eight and 16 seeds, yielding 5000 to 16,000 seed/kg depending on the subspecies. The species will produce pods in abundance after 5 to 7 years of age. There is considerable variation in the degree of seed production and germination in relation to water supply, with high reproductive success recorded in very wet years or in favourable locations, e.g. next to water channels ( Carter, 1998 ). Trees adjacent to water are able to reproduce in most years (Anon., 2001) but trees in dry areas produce few seeds in the absence of winter rain ( Carter, 1998 ). Seeds are dispersed by mammalian herbivores, particularly domestic livestock and a high proportion of the seeds that

Trees adjacent to water are able to reproduce in most years (Anon., 2001) but trees in dry areas produce few seeds in the absence of winter rain ( Carter, 1998 ). Seeds are dispersed by mammalian herbivores, particularly domestic livestock and a high proportion of the seeds that pass through stock are viable ( Carter, 1998 ) and seeds may remain viable for 7 years or more (Anon., 2001). Acacia nilotica flowers at a relatively young age, around 3 to 4 years of age, in ideal conditions, on current-season growth during the rainy season. Flowering is prolific and can occur several times a year depending on the availability of soil moisture. In southern Africa (all countries south of Tanzania), peak flowering appears to occur from October to December and peak fruiting around April/June. In eastern Africa, the trend is complicated by bimodal rainfall, with flowering occurring most months of the year for subsp. subalata with no marked fruiting period, although flowering of subsp. leiocarpa tends to peak in September ( Fagg and Barnes, 1995 ). In West Africa, in subsp. adstringens flowering occurs over most of the year with a peak in October; in subsp. nilotica flowering peaks in September/October; and in subsp. tomentosa a little later in November. Fruiting peaks in January for subsp. adstringens and subsp. tomentosa and in April for subsp. nilotica . In India, subsp. indica flowers from June to September and sometimes in December/January and the pods reach full size (for fodder) by February/March and ripen from April to June ( Gupta, 1993 ).

In India, subsp. indica flowers from June to September and sometimes in December/January and the pods reach full size (for fodder) by February/March and ripen from April to June ( Gupta, 1993 ). Acacia nilotica is a nitrogen-fixing tree that nodulates frequently over its natural range and forms mycorrhizal associations ( Njiti and Galiana, 1996 ; Ingleby et al., 1997 ). Acacia nilotica prefers dry conditions, with an annual rainfall of 200-1500 mm, although under irrigation some varieties will grow in areas with less than 100 mm. In India, the optimum lower limit is around 600 mm without irrigation ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ) and there are records of upper limits of 2300 mm in South East Asia (Lemmens and Wulijarni-Soetjipto, 1991). Some of these are plantings out of its natural range and caution is recommended before making introductions into humid areas. It is found principally in the drier lowland tropical and subtropical regions, in both unimodal and bimodal rainfall regions and in regular and irregular regimes ( Nicholson et al., 1988 ). Average annual temperatures commonly vary from 15° to 28°C, although it can withstand daily maximum temperatures of 50°C and is frost tender when young. Depending on the subspecies, it will tolerate both drought and flooded conditions for several months. A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Acacia nilotica in Africa exhibits two very distinct ecological preferences: subspecies subalata , leiocarpa and adstringens occur in wooded grassland, savanna and dry scrub forests on deep sandy loamy soils and also on lateritic and calcareous sites; subsp.

Acacia nilotica in Africa exhibits two very distinct ecological preferences: subspecies subalata , leiocarpa and adstringens occur in wooded grassland, savanna and dry scrub forests on deep sandy loamy soils and also on lateritic and calcareous sites; subsp. kraussiana also prefers dry grasslands and savannas, especially on compacted sandy loam, shallow granite or clay soils along drainage lines and rivers, but away from flooding. On the other hand, subsp. nilotica and tomentosa are restricted to riverine habitats and seasonally flooded areas on clay alluvial soils ( Fagg, 1992 ). In the Indian subcontinent, subsp. indica forms low altitude dry forests usually on alluvium soils subject to flooding or black cotton soils. It is now widely planted on farms throughout the plains and will grow on saline, alkaline soils and on those with calcareous pans, but requires sufficient moisture in the soil or subsoil ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ; Luna, 1996 ). It will grow but remain stunted on shallow soils with an underlying bedrock or beds of nodular kankar and also on poor argillaceous soils. A. nilotica subsp. hemispherica is restricted to sandy stream beds near Karachi, Pakistan and subsp. cupressiformis has similar preferences to subsp. indica , though it is less resilient to weed competition. In the Indian subcontinent, A. nilotica is usually found below altitudes of 450 m although some subspecies in Africa occur at altitudes as high as 2000 m.

In the Indian subcontinent, A. nilotica is usually found below altitudes of 450 m although some subspecies in Africa occur at altitudes as high as 2000 m.

Inner bark contains 18–23% tannin, used
for tanning and dyeing leather black.  Young pods produce a very pale tint in
leather, notably goat hides (Kano leather).  Pods were used by the ancient
Egyptians.  Young bark used as fiber, twigs esteemed for tooth brushes
(chewsticks).  Trees tapped for gum arabic.  The gum arabic is still used in
making candles, inks, matches, and paints (NAS, 1980).  Tender pods and shoots
used as vegetable, and used as forage for camels, sheep and goats, especially
in Sudan, where it is said to improve milk from these animals.  Seeds are a
valuable cattle food.  Roasted seed kernels, sometimes used for flavoring and
when crushed provide the dye for black strings worn by Nankani women.  Trees
used in Sudan for afforestation of inundated areas.  Sapwood is

used in Sudan for afforestation of inundated areas.  Sapwood is
yellowish-white, heartwood reddish-brown, hard, heavy, durable, difficult to
work, though taking a high polish.  Because of its resins, it resists insects
and water, and trees are harvested for the timber for boat-making, posts,
buildings, water-pipes, well-planking, plows, cabinet-work, wheels, mallets and
other implements.  Wood yields excellent firewood and charcoal (Duke, 1981a).

Folk Medicine
Zulu take bark for cough, Chipi use root for tuberculosis.  Masai are
intoxicated by the bark and root decoction, said to impart courage, even
aphrodisia, and the root is said to cure impotence.  Astringent bark used for
diarrhea, dysentery, and leprosy.  Bruised leaves poulticed onto ulcers.
According to Hartwell, the gum or bark is used for cancers and/or tumors (of
ear, eye, or testicles) and indurations of liver and spleen, condylomas, and

According to Hartwell, the gum or bark is used for cancers and/or tumors (of
ear, eye, or testicles) and indurations of liver and spleen, condylomas, and
excess flesh.  Said also to be used for cancer, colds, congestion, coughs,
diarrhea, dysentery, fever, gallbladder, hemorrhage, hemorrhoids, leucorrhea,
ophthalmia, sclerosis, smallpox, and tuberculosis.  Bark, gum, leaves, and pods
used medicinally in West Africa.  Sap or bark, leaves, and young pods are
strongly astringent due to tannin, and are chewed In Senegal as antiscorbutic;
in Ethiopia as lactogogue.  Bark decoction drunk for intestinal pains and
diarrhea.  Other preparations used for coughs, gargle, toothache, ophthalmia,
and syphilitic ulcers.  In Tonga, the root is used to treat tuberculosis.  In
Lebanon, the resin is mixed with orange-flower infusion for typhoid
convalescence.  Masai use the bark decoction as a nerve stimulant.  In Italian
Africa, the wood is used to treat smallpox.  Egyptian Nubians believe that
diabetics may eat unlimited carbohydrates as long as they also consume powdered
pods (Duke, 1983a).  Extracts are inhibitory to at least four species of
pathogenic fungi (Umalkar et al, 1976).

(Benth.) Brenan is the most
common form in east tropical Africa.  Young branches more or less densely
pubescent; pods not necklace-like, 1–1.8 cm wide, oblong, more or less
pubescent all over at first with raised parts over seeds becoming glabrescent,
shining and black when dry, margins shallowly crenate.  Exhibits wide range of
altitudinal and habitat requirements.  Found in Botswana, Zambia, Rhodesia,
Malawi, Tanzania, Angola, Mozambique, Transvaal, and Natal.

(2n=52.)
Distribution
Native from Egypt south to Mozambique and Natal; apparently introduced to
Zanzibar, Pemba, and India; Arabia.  Considered a serious weed in South Africa.
Ecology
Woodlands of various sorts, wooded grasslands, scrub and thickets.  Thrives in
dry areas, but endures floods.  Grows 10–1,340 m altitude, in a wide range of
conditions.  Grows on a wide variety of soils, seemingly thriving on alluvial
soils, black cotton soils, heavy clay soils, as well as even poorer soils (NAS,
1980).  Ranging from Subtropical Desert to Subtropical Dry through Tropical
Desert to Tropical Dry Forest Life Zones, babul is reported to tolerate annual
precipitation of 3.8–22.8 dm (mean of 12 cases = 12.0 dm), annual mean
temperature of 18.7–27.8°C (mean of 12 cases = 24.1°C), and pH of 5.0–8.0
(mean of 10 cases = 6.9) (Duke, 1981a).

 dm), annual mean
temperature of 18.7–27.8°C (mean of 12 cases = 24.1°C), and pH of 5.0–8.0
(mean of 10 cases = 6.9) (Duke, 1981a).
Cultivation
Trees propagated in forest by seeds.  Direct seeding is the common practice.
Stored seed may require scarification.  Young seedlings are said to "require
full sun and frequent weeding" (NAS, 1980a).
Harvesting
Although there are other sources of gum arabic, trees are still tapped for the
gum by removing a bit of bark 5–7.5 cm wide and bruising the surrounding bark
with mallet or hammer.  The resulting reddish gum, almost completely soluble
and tasteless, is formed into balls.  Though used in commerce to some extent,
it is inferior to other forms of gum arabic, with which it is sometimes mixed.
Yields and Economics
Various products of the tree are used locally in tropical Africa, but none
enter international markets.  Trees usually add 2–3 cm in diameter each year
(NAS, 1980a).
Energy
Extensively used, e.g. in India, for firewood and charcoal, this species has
been used in locomotives and steamships as well as industry balers.  It is
cultivated for industrial fuel in the Sudan.  The calorific value of the
sapwood is 4,800 kcal/kg of the heartwood 4,950.  The species does nodulate and
fix nitrogen.
Biotic Factors
Wood borers may afflict the stems and bruchids may afflict the seeds.
