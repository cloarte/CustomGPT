Asplenium trichomanes ssp trichomanes- spleenwort  -Aspleniaceae© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)Nearly all plants ofAsplenium trichomanesencountered in Ireland will be the tetraploid subspeciesquadrivalens, which is very abundant. The diploid subspeciestrichomanesis generally smaller (although stunted forms of subsp.quadrivalenscan be of similar size) and the spores are smaller when measured under the microscope. It is a much rarer plant, being currently known only from two sites within Northern Ireland, both are on shale rock outcrops in the Mourne Mountains. Two other sites occur in the Republic of Ireland.All names:Asplenium trichomanes ssp. trichomanesNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
