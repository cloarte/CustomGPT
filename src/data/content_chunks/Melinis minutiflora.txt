 Invasion: Plants are of diffuse growth habit, some reaching 2 m high. Culms 1-2 m long, cylindrical, 2-4 mm in diameter, intensely nodose with thick nodes and geniculate internodes, decumbent for almost all their length, terminally ascending. From lowest nodes there is some ramification with sterile tillers and a few adventitious roots. Root system fibrous with rhizomes present. Culms hairless, light green on the part covered by sheath. Sheets open, sometimes longer than the internode, particularly on the last leaf the sheet can be 3 times as long as the blade. Ligule a fringe of short hairs 1 mm long. Blades up to 15 cm long with a rounded base, narrowing to an acute apex. Leaves hairy on both sides, and at the base of hairs there are glands that secrete a sticky fluid with a sweet smell. On developed plants the lower leaves die, mostly because light cannot reach them. Compound panicles at the apex of culms, 15-25 cm long, erect, initially compact cylindrical, later loose pyramidal, very showy for their purple-reddish

Compound panicles at the apex of culms, 15-25 cm long, erect, initially compact cylindrical, later loose pyramidal, very showy for their purple-reddish colour in most varieties, light coloured in others. Spikelets oblong, narrow and compressed, 1.8-2.4 mm long, lower bract reduced to a scale 3 mm long, upper bract strongly grooved with 7 nerves, one sterile floret with the lemma generally presenting a long awn and a terminal, hermaphrodite floret with an awnless lemma. Spikelets fall off entire, being easily dispersed by wind. Seed a lanceolate caryopsis with acute base and apex, with a bristle 1 mm long, pericarp smooth, brown-greenish. Seedlings can be easily recognized by the first leaf being ovate-orbicular, lying flat on the ground (Kissmann and Groth, 1997).

 Reproduccion: Genetics The chromosome number reported for M. minutiflora is 2 n = 36. There is considerable genetic variation within the species, with many varieties or races represented in Brazil and other American countries. Reproductive Biology M. minutiflora flowers mostly in April and June in the southern hemisphere, the spikes producing a great quantity of spikelets with one caryopsis.

ccion: Genetics The chromosome number reported for M. minutiflora is 2 n = 36. There is considerable genetic variation within the species, with many varieties or races represented in Brazil and other American countries. Reproductive Biology M. minutiflora flowers mostly in April and June in the southern hemisphere, the spikes producing a great quantity of spikelets with one caryopsis. In Hawaii, it flowers in a synchronous burst in late November, while in Florida it flowers in autumn ( Hauser, 2008 ). In Brazil, seed production has been shown to be around 72,000 and 82,000 viable seeds per square metre for the cultivars Cabelo-de-Negro and Roxo, respectively (Martins et al., 2009). The reproduction is mostly by apomixes and seeds are dispersed by wind ( Williams and Baruch, 2000 ). For cultivation, the sowing rate depends on the purity and quality of the seeds. It also spreads vegetative through stolons and rhizomes. Physiology and Phenology M. minutiflora is a robust perennial plant, growing well even on poor soil, under full as well as diffuse illumination. It possesses a C 4 photosynthetic pathway. Seedlings establish best on well prepared soil, but in burned land preparation of soil is generally not necessary. It spreads quickly and grows vigorously on a wide range of soil types, but does not tolerate waterlogging or flooding. In areas of hot summers or cold winters the vegetation takes a temporary rest. Environmental Requirements Frost generally kills the plants. Optimal temperatures range from 14°C to 27°C. The plant is found in tropical and subtropical areas at elevations from 300 to 2400 m. It has naturalized in areas with annual rainfall ranging from 750mm to 2500mm but mostly from 1000mm to 2000mm.  The species is well adapted to drought and it can resist up to 5 months of dry season.

It is also adapted to moderate fire and after fire rapidly regenerates from remaining portions ( Cook et al., 2005 ). Once established, plants are resistant to animal trampling.
