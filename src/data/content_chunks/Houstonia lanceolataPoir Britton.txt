Plant Notes:  Calycose Bluet is a native herbaceous perennial in the Madder family (Rubiaceae). It can be found primarily in the northern and western counties of Alabama. Calycose Bluet occurs along streams, in prairies, in cedar glades, and on chalk outcrops. It is a perennial from a short rhizome or taproot. Leaves of the basal rosette are usually present at flowering. Stems are 3-12 inches in height, green or purplish in color, 4-angled, and pubescent. Stem leaves are opposite, sessile, oblong to lanceolate or elliptic in outline, entire but with marginal cilia. Flowers are produced in terminal cymes. The calyx has 4 lanceolate lobes that are longer than the corolla tube. The corolla is funnelform with 4 lobes that are shorter than the tube. The inside of the corolla is pubescent. Flower color ranges from white to deep lavender. The fruit is a bi-lobed capsule. Calycose Bluet is occasionally available from wildflower nurseries. It prefers partial to full sun and a moist loamy soil. Calycose Bluet is generally short-lived but will re-seed itself.---A. Diamond  ;
