Introduced Panicgrasses
Gramineae
Panicum
sp.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
Three species of
Panicum
, one introduced from India and two from Africa,are of some importance in parts of the United States.
Blue panicgrass
,
P. antidotale
Retz., native to India, wasintroduced via Australia in 1912. It has a coarse, vigorous root system and issodforming. Forage yields are high on fertile, well drained soils. It isimportant in parts of southwestern United States, both for dry-land andirrigated pastures. It is not winter hardy in northern locations.
Kleingrass,
P. coloratum
L., is a complex of grasses whichincludes both bunch and sod-forming types. It was introduced from Africa.Adapted to moist, heavy soil, it is used for pasture, hay and silage - mainlyin South Texas. Plants have slender stems up to 4 feet, with abundant darkgreen leaves.
Guineagrass
,
P. maximum
Jacq., is a warm-season, spreading grassfrom Africa used to a limited extent for pastures and silage in Florida andother southern areas. It is a tall, coarse grower with high nutritive valuewhen leafy and green. It is not cold hardy. Propagation is by sod pieces.
