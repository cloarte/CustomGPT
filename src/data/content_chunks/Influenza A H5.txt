APHIS National Milk Testing Strategy for Influenza A, H5 in Dairy Cattle 
I. Strategy Overview
The APHIS National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS) provides surveillance and response guidance for
influenza A H5 (hereafter, “H5”) in dairy cattle. The overall goal of the strategy is to eliminate H5 in
U.S. dairy cattle and focuses on testing bulk milk of dairy herds. The strategy currently applies to
States in the contiguous United States. Stages within may occur concurrently throughout the country
based on each State’s situation. Sampling schemes in each stage are ﬂexible based on each State’s
resources and industry.
S
tage 1: Standing Up Mandatory USDA National Plant Silo Monitoring 
• Provisional Unaﬀected State progresses to Unaﬀected (stage 4) status after at least 4 rounds of
monthly testing with negative results, if silo sampling is representative of dairy herds in the State
• Positive test results trigger additional State investigation
S
tage 2: Determining a State’s H5N1 Dairy Cattle Status 
• Option to implement a State-speciﬁc surveillance plan for State to quickly progress from
Provisional Unaﬀected to Unaﬀected status (“fast track” option to progress to stage 4)
• A conﬁrmed dairy HPAI case moves a State to stage 3, all-negative States move to stage 4
S
tage 3: Detecting and Responding to the Virus in Affected States 
• Quickly identify herds, implement rapid response measures (e.g., enhanced biosecurity, contact
tracing) and surveillance in States with detections to eliminate the virus from aﬀected herds

S
tage 3: Detecting and Responding to the Virus in Affected States 
• Quickly identify herds, implement rapid response measures (e.g., enhanced biosecurity, contact
tracing) and surveillance in States with detections to eliminate the virus from aﬀected herds
• Aﬀected States work toward Unaﬀected status as virus is eliminated and progress to stage 4

S
tage 4: Demonstrating Ongoing Absence of H5 in Dairy Cattle in Unaffected States 
• Utilize representative serial sampling and a phased approach for sampling frequency
• Aﬀected States/herds return to stage 3, Unaﬀected States contribute to stage 5
S
tage 5: Demonstrating Freedom From H5 in U.S. Dairy Cattle 
• After all States progress through stage 4, begin sampling to demonstrate absence of disease in the
United States using a risk-based surveillance strategy
