Black stem rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis —an organism that must alternate between two host plants (a cereal grain and barberry) to complete its lifecycle. A strong breeze can spread black stem rust from one area to another. Infected hosts display reddish-brown lesions on their stems. From the 1920s through the 1970s, USDA successfully eradicated wild barberry in the Northern United States to control black stem rust. Today, APHIS tests and regulates resistant barberry varieties to maintain the protected areas (54.07 KB) . The development of disease-resistant cereal crops and barberry has mitigated the damage of black stem rust. What To Look For Black stem rust can damage crops swiftly. Look for: Rust-colored or black fungal spore masses on the stems and leaves of wheat, barley, and other host plants. Late stages of stem rust on wheat have black spore clusters. Yellow spores on shoes and clothing. How To Prevent This Disease Only purchase and plant resistant and approved barberry varieties (142.73 KB) .
