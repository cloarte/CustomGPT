Plant Notes:  Ovate False Fiddleleaf is a native herbaceous perennial in the Hydolea family (Hydroleaceae). It is found in central and eastern Alabama. It occurs around ponds and lakes, in wet roadside ditches, and in low pastures. It is a colonial perennial with a rhizome. Stems are erect, pubescent, green in color, and unbranched until near the top. The stems are 1-3 feet tall and armed with a stout spine at each leaf. Leaves are alternate, petiolate, ovate to elliptic in outline, with entire margins. The leaves are pubescent on both surfaces. Flowers are produced in corymbs on short branches at the apex of the plant. The corolla is slightly bell-shaped to round with 5 corolla lobes. The flowers are an intense blue color. The fruit is a capsule with many small seed. Ovate False Fiddleleaf is occasionally available from nurseries that specialize in aquatic and bog plants. It can be used in a small, shallow pool or in a bog garden. The plant can be aggressive, rapidly expanding from its rhizomes. You can help to prevent its unwanted spread by planting it is a pot and leaving the lip of the pot exposed. Ovate False Fiddleleaf prefers an organic rich soil that is consistently wet and full sun. It will grow in shallow standing water.--A. Diamond  ;
