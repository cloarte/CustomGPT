Galium aparineL. - Cleavers  -Rubiaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)Cleavers and goosegrass are two of the other names for this extremely common species. It is perhaps most often noticed scrambling over plants in hedges, but grows in a variety of other places, including coastal shingle banks and rubbish dumps. It is a slender but vigorous climbing annual, covered by tiny hooked bristles. The flowers are tiny and four-petalled and they are succeeded by small, hard, green globular fruits which are also covered by hooked bristles. The plant is notorious for its ability to cling (or cleave - whence 'cleavers') to clothing or animal fur.This plant is one of a group called the bedstraws (Galiumspp.), all of which have slender stems and leaves arranged in whorls at the nodes. All have white flowers except lady's bedstraw (G. verum).All names:Galium aparineL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
