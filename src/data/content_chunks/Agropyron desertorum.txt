Magness et al. 1971
This is a hardy perennial bunch grass, originally introduced fromRussian Turkestan. Leaves are abundant, both at the base and along the stems.Leaves are 6 to 10 inches long, about 1/4 inch wide, flat, and slightly hairyon the upper surface. Stems are slender, 2 to 3 feet in height, growing indense clumps. It is deep-rooted and drought resistant, well adapted to theNorthern Plains and higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains. Growth startsearly in spring. If cut early, hay of excellent quality is produced. This is ahighly valuable grass in its area of adaptation. Stands once established willpersist for many years. Propagation is by seeding.
