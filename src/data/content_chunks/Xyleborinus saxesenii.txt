 Invasion: The description of the adult female is largely taken fromBright (1968). The males are much less common than the females and rarely found. They are smaller than the females, have reduced eyes, and lack wings.Length 2.0-2.4 mm, 2.6-3.0 times longer than wide. Frons minutely reticulate, punctures distinct but faint; longitudinal line very faint, extending beyond upper level of eyes. Antennal club as long as wide. Pronotum 1.2 times longer than wide; sides parallel on posterior two-thirds, broadly rounded anteriorly; anterior slope with numerous low asperities; posterior portion minutely reticulate, punctures very fine and shallow. Scutellum conical. Elytra 1.7 times longer than wide, basal margins emarginate in scutellar area, the emargination with dense setae; strial punctures impressed, larger and more widely spaced interstrial punctures; interstriae smooth on disc, becoming uniserrately granulate toward declivity. Declivital surface dull, reticulate; interstriae one and three slightly elevated, with a row of tubercles; tubercles absent on interstriae two; apical part of interstriae nine forming lower margin of declivity, and with several acute tubercles.

 Reproduccion: The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Xylosandrus, Xyleborinus and Euwallacea are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. Some species infest small twigs and shoots, others are found in larger branches and poles, and others are found in large timber; others may breed in material of almost any size. In general, most species bore through the bark and into the wood where an enlarged chamber and/or branching tunnels of varying size and shape are constructed. The tunnels into the wood are highly variable in depth and shape, depending on the species involved in the construction. All species are closely associated in a mutualistic relationship with ambrosia fungi, which grow on the walls of the gallery system and in the surrounding wood, and on which both adults and larvae feed ( Beaver, 1989 ). Fischer (1954) in Europe, and Hosking (1973) in New Zealand made detailed studies of the biology of X. saxesenii.

 the walls of the gallery system and in the surrounding wood, and on which both adults and larvae feed ( Beaver, 1989 ). Fischer (1954) in Europe, and Hosking (1973) in New Zealand made detailed studies of the biology of X. saxesenii. In Central Europe and in North America (Missouri), the flight period of X. saxesenii begins at the end of April and beginning of May ( Fischer, 1954 ; Roling and Kearby, 1975 ). The peak of flight activity is in the afternoon, and is related to temperature ( Hosking, 1973 ). The females have already mated with their brother(s) in the maternal gallery system, and disperse to find new breeding sites. The females are attracted to ethanol ( Roling and Kearby, 1975 ; Klimetzek et al., 1986 ; Lombardero, 1996 ; Markalas and Kalapanida, 1997 ; Oliver and Mannion, 2001 ), a volatile chemical which is released by decaying wood, and which serves as a good indicator of suitable breeding material. Other volatiles may also be involved ( Flechtmann et al., 1999 ). The initial positively phototropic response of the beetles is reversed following flight exercise ( Hosking, 1973 ). The female bores a radial entry tunnel directly into the wood. This may penetrate 4 cm or more, or may curve at some point to follow a growth ring ( Hosking, 1973 ). It may ( Fischer, 1954 ) or may not ( Hosking, 1973 ) branch. Oviposition begins once the ambrosia fungus has begun to grow on the walls of the gallery, and extends over two ( Fischer, 1954 ) to twelve ( Hosking, 1973 ) weeks. The eggs are laid in loose clumps of up to 8-12. The young larvae enlarge the maternal gallery to form an irregular brood chamber in the vertical plane, extending above and/or below the maternal gallery.

 begun to grow on the walls of the gallery, and extends over two ( Fischer, 1954 ) to twelve ( Hosking, 1973 ) weeks. The eggs are laid in loose clumps of up to 8-12. The young larvae enlarge the maternal gallery to form an irregular brood chamber in the vertical plane, extending above and/or below the maternal gallery. As gallery development continues, lateral chambers extending vertically along the growth rings may be excavated ( Hosking, 1973 ). The final form of the gallery system is variable, but the vertical chambers are quite distinct from the branching system of tunnels that have not been enlarged, found in many species of Xyleborus.Pupation occurs in the gallery chambers. Contrary to Fischer (1954) , the teneral adults do not take part in further extensions of the gallery ( Hosking, 1973 ). The development period from larva to adult is 7 to 15 weeks ( Fischer, 1954 ). The number of males per female is very variable. Fischer (1954) gives an average value of 1:20. In New Zealand, the ratio varied from 1:4 to 1:64 in different years, and there is similar variation between individual gallery systems, with some galleries having no male ( Hosking, 1973 ). The males mate with their sisters within the gallery system. The males are unable to fly, and usually die within the parental gallery, but some emerge from the gallery and can be found crawling over the bark ( Furniss and Johnson, 1987 ). It is not known whether these males can successfully enter other gallery systems and mate with the females there. Total brood size appears to be larger than in many xyleborines, with occasional galleries approaching or exceeding 100 individuals ( Milligan, 1969 ; Egger, 1973 ; Hosking, 1973 ). Unpublished studies by K Peer and M Taborsky (Institute of Zoology, University of Berne, Switzerland, personal communication, 2004) show that up to 50% of all

Unpublished studies by K Peer and M Taborsky (Institute of Zoology, University of Berne, Switzerland, personal communication, 2004) show that up to 50% of all females never disperse, but remain in the parental gallery. They do not reproduce there, but apparently help to raise their sisters, thus increasing colony productivity, and suggesting a primitively eusocial life.The number of generations per year is related to temperature. In Central Europe, there are one or two generations, but breeding is likely to be continuous in warmer climates, with all stages of development present at any time of year.In the majority of ambrosia beetles, the ambrosia fungus is transported by the dispersing female, in special cuticular pockets or mycangia. These are present in X. saxesenii in the base of the elytra ( Francke-Grosmann, 1956 ), but the ambrosia fungus, Ambrosiella sulphurea ( Batra, 1967 ), is apparently transmitted endozoically in the form of micromycelia in the gut ( Francke-Grosmann, 1975 ).In its attacks on fruit trees, X. saxesenii is often associated with another ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus dispar, with similar habits, but a tendency to more primary attacks ( Fischer, 1954 ).

The young larvae enlarge the maternal gallery to form an irregular brood chamber in the vertical plane, extending above and/or below the maternal gallery. As gallery development continues, lateral chambers extending vertically along the growth rings may be excavated ( Hosking, 1973 ). The final form of the gallery system is variable, but the vertical chambers are quite distinct from the branching system of tunnels that have not been enlarged, found in many species of Xyleborus.Pupation occurs in the gallery chambers. Contrary to Fischer (1954) , the teneral adults do not take part in further extensions of the gallery ( Hosking, 1973 ). The development period from larva to adult is 7 to 15 weeks ( Fischer, 1954 ). The number of males per female is very variable. Fischer (1954) gives an average value of 1:20. In New Zealand, the ratio varied from 1:4 to 1:64 in different years, and there is similar variation between individual gallery systems, with some galleries having no male ( Hosking, 1973 ). The males mate with their sisters within the gallery system. The males are unable to fly, and usually die within the parental gallery, but some emerge from the gallery and can be found crawling over the bark ( Furniss and Johnson, 1987 ). It is not known whether these males can successfully enter other gallery systems and mate with the females there. Total brood size appears to be larger than in many xyleborines, with occasional galleries approaching or exceeding 100 individuals ( Milligan, 1969 ; Egger, 1973 ; Hosking, 1973 ).

These are present in X. saxesenii in the base of the elytra ( Francke-Grosmann, 1956 ), but the ambrosia fungus, Ambrosiella sulphurea ( Batra, 1967 ), is apparently transmitted endozoically in the form of micromycelia in the gut ( Francke-Grosmann, 1975 ).In its attacks on fruit trees, X. saxesenii is often associated with another ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus dispar, with similar habits, but a tendency to more primary attacks ( Fischer, 1954 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Xylosandrus, Xyleborinus and Euwallacea are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. Some species infest small twigs and shoots, others are found in larger branches and poles, and others are found in large timber; others may breed in material of almost any size. In general, most species bore through the bark and into the wood where an enlarged chamber and/or branching tunnels of varying size and shape are constructed. The tunnels into the wood are highly variable in depth and shape, depending on the species involved in the construction. All species are closely associated in a mutualistic relationship with ambrosia fungi, which grow on the walls of the gallery system and in the surrounding wood, and on which both adults and larvae feed ( Beaver, 1989 ). Fischer (1954) in Europe, and Hosking (1973) in New Zealand made detailed studies of the biology of X. saxesenii. In Central Europe and in North America (Missouri), the flight period of X. saxesenii begins at the end of April and beginning of May ( Fischer, 1954 ; Roling and Kearby, 1975 ). The peak of flight activity is in the afternoon, and is related to temperature ( Hosking, 1973 ). The females have already mated with their brother(s) in the maternal gallery system, and disperse to find new breeding sites. The females are attracted to ethanol ( Roling and Kearby, 1975 ; Klimetzek et al., 1986 ;

 ; Roling and Kearby, 1975 ). The peak of flight activity is in the afternoon, and is related to temperature ( Hosking, 1973 ). The females have already mated with their brother(s) in the maternal gallery system, and disperse to find new breeding sites. The females are attracted to ethanol ( Roling and Kearby, 1975 ; Klimetzek et al., 1986 ; Lombardero, 1996 ; Markalas and Kalapanida, 1997 ; Oliver and Mannion, 2001 ), a volatile chemical which is released by decaying wood, and which serves as a good indicator of suitable breeding material. Other volatiles may also be involved ( Flechtmann et al., 1999 ). The initial positively phototropic response of the beetles is reversed following flight exercise ( Hosking, 1973 ). The female bores a radial entry tunnel directly into the wood. This may penetrate 4 cm or more, or may curve at some point to follow a growth ring ( Hosking, 1973 ). It may ( Fischer, 1954 ) or may not ( Hosking, 1973 ) branch. Oviposition begins once the ambrosia fungus has begun to grow on the walls of the gallery, and extends over two ( Fischer, 1954 ) to twelve ( Hosking, 1973 ) weeks. The eggs are laid in loose clumps of up to 8-12. The young larvae enlarge the maternal gallery to form an irregular brood chamber in the vertical plane, extending above and/or below the maternal gallery. As gallery development continues, lateral chambers extending vertically along the growth rings may be excavated ( Hosking, 1973 ). The final form of the gallery system is variable, but the vertical chambers are quite distinct from the branching system of tunnels that have not been enlarged, found in many species of Xyleborus.Pupation occurs in the gallery chambers. Contrary to Fischer (1954) , the teneral adults do not take part in further extensions of the gallery ( Hosking, 1973

The final form of the gallery system is variable, but the vertical chambers are quite distinct from the branching system of tunnels that have not been enlarged, found in many species of Xyleborus.Pupation occurs in the gallery chambers. Contrary to Fischer (1954) , the teneral adults do not take part in further extensions of the gallery ( Hosking, 1973 ). The development period from larva to adult is 7 to 15 weeks ( Fischer, 1954 ). The number of males per female is very variable. Fischer (1954) gives an average value of 1:20. In New Zealand, the ratio varied from 1:4 to 1:64 in different years, and there is similar variation between individual gallery systems, with some galleries having no male ( Hosking, 1973 ). The males mate with their sisters within the gallery system. The males are unable to fly, and usually die within the parental gallery, but some emerge from the gallery and can be found crawling over the bark ( Furniss and Johnson, 1987 ). It is not known whether these males can successfully enter other gallery systems and mate with the females there. Total brood size appears to be larger than in many xyleborines, with occasional galleries approaching or exceeding 100 individuals ( Milligan, 1969 ; Egger, 1973 ; Hosking, 1973 ). Unpublished studies by K Peer and M Taborsky (Institute of Zoology, University of Berne, Switzerland, personal communication, 2004) show that up to 50% of all females never disperse, but remain in the parental gallery. They do not reproduce there, but apparently help to raise their sisters, thus increasing colony productivity, and suggesting a primitively eusocial life.The number of generations per year is related to temperature.
