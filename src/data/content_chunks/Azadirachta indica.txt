 Reproduccion: Genetics Two chromosome numbers have been recorded for this species, 2n=30 in root tip mitosis and 2n=28 ( Tewari, 1992 ). The genetic potential of A. indica has not been fully assessed. A marked difference in the yield of azadirachtin has been observed from different seed sources ( Siddiqui, 1995 ), with seed from Ghana yielding 3.5 g/kg whereas Indian seed yielded only 0.2 g/kg. Therefore, genetic improvement studies should be undertaken to utilize the genetic variation in the species, including selection of A. indica plus trees for important traits, general growth, medicinal, insecticidal, anti-feedant and pesticidal characteristics, maturity and yield of fruits and properties and yield of oil. Provenance studies should also be carried out to determine suitable seed sources for various localities, though care should be exercised, because it is difficult to distinguish between natural stands and artificial plantations of this species. In many of the areas where A. indica has been introduced, unspecified Indian/Pakistani seed sources have been used. Therefore, provenance seed collection should be carried out in distinct populations of this species. An International Consultation on Establishment of Provenance Trials of this species was constituted by the FAO in 1993 to assist a number of countries to select suitable seed sources for planting. On the basis of results of progeny tests of plus trees and provenance studies, seed orchards could be established. Studies on mutation and breeding of polyploids, as well as vegetative propagation and tissue culture, also need to be carried out as they hold great potential for genetic improvement ( Tewari, 1992 ; Parveen et al., 1995 ). Physiology and Phenology Azadirachta indica starts fruiting at about 5 years of age, but economic yield of fruit begins at 10-12 years. There are 3300-4500 seeds per kg, and on average a

 culture, also need to be carried out as they hold great potential for genetic improvement ( Tewari, 1992 ; Parveen et al., 1995 ). Physiology and Phenology Azadirachta indica starts fruiting at about 5 years of age, but economic yield of fruit begins at 10-12 years. There are 3300-4500 seeds per kg, and on average a medium-sized tree produces 37-55 kg of fruit ( Streets, 1962 ; Luna, 1996 ). Fruit ripening coincides with the rainy season and under natural conditions, the fruit falls on the ground and germinates within 15 days. On very dry sites or during the periods of extreme drought, A. indica can become almost entirely leafless for a brief period and new leaves appear in March-April before the old leaves have fallen, but it always remains in full leaf during the summer when the shade is most needed ( Hocking, 1993 ; Luna, 1996 ). Depending on climatic conditions, flowering has been seen to occur at various times throughout the year. In the hot and dry subtropical areas of Pakistan, A. indica flowers in early summer and its fruit develops during the rains from June to August ( Tewari, 1992 ). In Thailand, A. indica trees flower from December to February and fruit in March to May ( Lemmens et al., 1995 ). The life span may be some 200 years ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). A. indica seedlings are unable to compete with other plants, and grasses present a particular problem in early establishment, however, they are able to withstand shade during the early years of development ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). Reproductive Biology Azadirachta indica produces bisexual flowers or male flowers on the same tree. Flowers are pollinated by insects including bees ( Apis spp.), and there are indications of self-incompatibility ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ).

, however, they are able to withstand shade during the early years of development ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). Reproductive Biology Azadirachta indica produces bisexual flowers or male flowers on the same tree. Flowers are pollinated by insects including bees ( Apis spp.), and there are indications of self-incompatibility ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). There are large quantities of seed and on average a medium-sized tree produces 37-55 kg of fruit per year ( Streets, 1962 ; Luna, 1996 ). In Puerto Rico, where the species is invasive, germination of fresh seeds is 98-100% ( Federal Highway Administration, 2001 ), but seeds have a short viability of about 3-4 weeks, and germination falls to about 55% after 11-14 days ( Parker, 1956 ; Pirani, 1994 ). Birds and bats play an important role in dispersal of the seed. Baboons can act as major dispersers in some areas, e.g. in the Shai Hills Game Production Reserve in Ghana ( Chamberlain, 2000 ), and germination is enhanced by passage through the baboon guts ( Mabberley, 1997 ). A. indica is frequently self-sown in gardens and the areas under mature trees are quickly colonized by a carpet of seedlings. It has the ability to establish itself under the protection of thorny bushes and to survive in dry poor soils, provided it is not subjected to frost ( Tewari, 1992 ). Although the main reproduction is by seed, root suckering does occur, for example when the roots are damaged. Associations In India and Pakistan, A. indica occurs naturally in dry deciduous and thorn forests ( Champion et al., 1965 ). In India, A. indica can be found growing with species of Acacia and Dalbergia sissoo ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). In Indonesia, it is naturalized in lowland mon

 example when the roots are damaged. Associations In India and Pakistan, A. indica occurs naturally in dry deciduous and thorn forests ( Champion et al., 1965 ). In India, A. indica can be found growing with species of Acacia and Dalbergia sissoo ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). In Indonesia, it is naturalized in lowland monsoon forest, whilst in Africa, it is found in evergreen forest and in dry deciduous forest ( PROTA, 2024 ). Climate Azadirachta indica has wide climatic adaptability and thrives under sub-humid to semi-arid and arid climatic conditions. It grows at temperatures as low as 1°C and as high as 49°C ( Siddiqui, 1995 ), though it is generally found in areas with mean maximum temperatures of 26-38°C, mean minimum temperatures of 24-28°C and mean annual temperatures of 24-32°C. The seedlings are liable to be killed by frost . A. indica requires large amounts of light but tolerates fairly heavy shade during the first few years ( PROTA, 2024 ). It is a species of arid and semi-arid tropical and subtropical ecological zones, with a mean annual rainfall of 450-1150 mm. However, in the Thar Desert of Pakistan, A. indica tolerates as little as 113 mm rainfall per year ( Siddiqui, 1995 ) and a dry season up to 8 months long. When found growing where annual rainfall is as little as 130 mm, it often receives supplementary water by virtue of its situation, i.e. in a wadi bed, or depression, or a shallow water table. 2500 mm is tolerated on well-drained soils, but fruiting is generally poor ( PROTA, 2024 ).

A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Soil and Physiography Azadirachta indica has an altitudinal range of 0-1500 m ( Webb et al., 1984 ; Tewari, 1992 ), however it grows better at low altitudes. The tree grows on a variety of soils, clayey or sandy, saline or alkaline. Experimental results confirm that neem plants can be grown in moderate saline soils ( Akram et al., 2024 ). It does particularly well, however, on black cotton soils and deep, well drained soils with good subsurface water. Unlike most other multi-purpose tree species, A. indica thrives on dry, stony, shallow soils and even on soils with hard calcareous or clay pans at a shallow depth ( Tewari, 1992 ). It will not grow on waterlogged soils or in deep dry sands where the dry season water table lies below 18 m ( PROTA, 2024 ). The tree improves soil fertility and water holding capacity because it has the unusual property of calcium mining, thereby neutralizing acidic soils. Its extensive root system also has a rare physiological capacity to extract nutrients from highly leached sandy soils. A. indica can grow on soils with a wide pH range. The optimum growth is at pH 6.2 to 7, but it can also grow well down to pH 5 and survives in soils between pH 3 and 9 ( Lemmens et al., 1995 ).

 Reproduccion: Genetics Two chromosome numbers have been recorded for this species, 2n=30 in root tip mitosis and 2n=28 ( Tewari, 1992 ). The genetic potential of A. indica has not been fully assessed. A marked difference in the yield of azadirachtin has been observed from different seed sources ( Siddiqui, 1995 ), with seed from Ghana yielding 3.5 g/kg whereas Indian seed yielded only 0.2 g/kg. Therefore, genetic improvement studies should be undertaken to utilize the genetic variation in the species, including selection of A. indica plus trees for important traits, general growth, medicinal, insecticidal, anti-feedant and pesticidal characteristics, maturity and yield of fruits and properties and yield of oil. Provenance studies should also be carried out to determine suitable seed sources for various localities, though care should be exercised, because it is difficult to distinguish between natural stands and artificial plantations of this species. In many of the areas where A. indica has been introduced, unspecified Indian/Pakistani seed sources have been used. Therefore, provenance seed collection should be carried out in distinct populations of this species. An International Consultation on Establishment of Provenance Trials of this species was constituted by the FAO in 1993 to assist a number of countries to select suitable seed sources for planting. On the basis of results of progeny tests of plus trees and provenance studies, seed orchards could be established. Studies on mutation and breeding of polyploids, as well as vegetative propagation and tissue culture, also need to be carried out as they hold great potential for genetic improvement ( Tewari, 1992 ; Parveen et al., 1995 ). Physiology and Phenology Azadirachta indica starts fruiting at about 5 years of age, but economic yield of fruit begins at 10-12 years. There are 3300-4500 seeds per kg, and on average a

 culture, also need to be carried out as they hold great potential for genetic improvement ( Tewari, 1992 ; Parveen et al., 1995 ). Physiology and Phenology Azadirachta indica starts fruiting at about 5 years of age, but economic yield of fruit begins at 10-12 years. There are 3300-4500 seeds per kg, and on average a medium-sized tree produces 37-55 kg of fruit ( Streets, 1962 ; Luna, 1996 ). Fruit ripening coincides with the rainy season and under natural conditions, the fruit falls on the ground and germinates within 15 days. On very dry sites or during the periods of extreme drought, A. indica can become almost entirely leafless for a brief period and new leaves appear in March-April before the old leaves have fallen, but it always remains in full leaf during the summer when the shade is most needed ( Hocking, 1993 ; Luna, 1996 ). Depending on climatic conditions, flowering has been seen to occur at various times throughout the year. In the hot and dry subtropical areas of Pakistan, A. indica flowers in early summer and its fruit develops during the rains from June to August ( Tewari, 1992 ). In Thailand, A. indica trees flower from December to February and fruit in March to May ( Lemmens et al., 1995 ). The life span may be some 200 years ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). A. indica seedlings are unable to compete with other plants, and grasses present a particular problem in early establishment, however, they are able to withstand shade during the early years of development ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). Reproductive Biology Azadirachta indica produces bisexual flowers or male flowers on the same tree. Flowers are pollinated by insects including bees ( Apis spp.), and there are indications of self-incompatibility ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ).

, however, they are able to withstand shade during the early years of development ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). Reproductive Biology Azadirachta indica produces bisexual flowers or male flowers on the same tree. Flowers are pollinated by insects including bees ( Apis spp.), and there are indications of self-incompatibility ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). There are large quantities of seed and on average a medium-sized tree produces 37-55 kg of fruit per year ( Streets, 1962 ; Luna, 1996 ). In Puerto Rico, where the species is invasive, germination of fresh seeds is 98-100% ( Federal Highway Administration, 2001 ), but seeds have a short viability of about 3-4 weeks, and germination falls to about 55% after 11-14 days ( Parker, 1956 ; Pirani, 1994 ). Birds and bats play an important role in dispersal of the seed. Baboons can act as major dispersers in some areas, e.g. in the Shai Hills Game Production Reserve in Ghana ( Chamberlain, 2000 ), and germination is enhanced by passage through the baboon guts ( Mabberley, 1997 ). A. indica is frequently self-sown in gardens and the areas under mature trees are quickly colonized by a carpet of seedlings. It has the ability to establish itself under the protection of thorny bushes and to survive in dry poor soils, provided it is not subjected to frost ( Tewari, 1992 ). Although the main reproduction is by seed, root suckering does occur, for example when the roots are damaged. Associations In India and Pakistan, A. indica occurs naturally in dry deciduous and thorn forests ( Champion et al., 1965 ). In India, A. indica can be found growing with species of Acacia and Dalbergia sissoo ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). In Indonesia, it is naturalized in lowland mon

 example when the roots are damaged. Associations In India and Pakistan, A. indica occurs naturally in dry deciduous and thorn forests ( Champion et al., 1965 ). In India, A. indica can be found growing with species of Acacia and Dalbergia sissoo ( World Agroforestry Centre, 2002 ). In Indonesia, it is naturalized in lowland monsoon forest, whilst in Africa, it is found in evergreen forest and in dry deciduous forest ( PROTA, 2024 ). Climate Azadirachta indica has wide climatic adaptability and thrives under sub-humid to semi-arid and arid climatic conditions. It grows at temperatures as low as 1°C and as high as 49°C ( Siddiqui, 1995 ), though it is generally found in areas with mean maximum temperatures of 26-38°C, mean minimum temperatures of 24-28°C and mean annual temperatures of 24-32°C. The seedlings are liable to be killed by frost . A. indica requires large amounts of light but tolerates fairly heavy shade during the first few years ( PROTA, 2024 ). It is a species of arid and semi-arid tropical and subtropical ecological zones, with a mean annual rainfall of 450-1150 mm. However, in the Thar Desert of Pakistan, A. indica tolerates as little as 113 mm rainfall per year ( Siddiqui, 1995 ) and a dry season up to 8 months long. When found growing where annual rainfall is as little as 130 mm, it often receives supplementary water by virtue of its situation, i.e. in a wadi bed, or depression, or a shallow water table. 2500 mm is tolerated on well-drained soils, but fruiting is generally poor ( PROTA, 2024 ).

A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Soil and Physiography Azadirachta indica has an altitudinal range of 0-1500 m ( Webb et al., 1984 ; Tewari, 1992 ), however it grows better at low altitudes. The tree grows on a variety of soils, clayey or sandy, saline or alkaline. Experimental results confirm that neem plants can be grown in moderate saline soils ( Akram et al., 2024 ). It does particularly well, however, on black cotton soils and deep, well drained soils with good subsurface water. Unlike most other multi-purpose tree species, A. indica thrives on dry, stony, shallow soils and even on soils with hard calcareous or clay pans at a shallow depth ( Tewari, 1992 ). It will not grow on waterlogged soils or in deep dry sands where the dry season water table lies below 18 m ( PROTA, 2024 ). The tree improves soil fertility and water holding capacity because it has the unusual property of calcium mining, thereby neutralizing acidic soils. Its extensive root system also has a rare physiological capacity to extract nutrients from highly leached sandy soils. A. indica can grow on soils with a wide pH range. The optimum growth is at pH 6.2 to 7, but it can also grow well down to pH 5 and survives in soils between pH 3 and 9 ( Lemmens et al., 1995 ).
