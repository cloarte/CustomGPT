About this toolAn identification guide for polyphagous and cosmopolitan aphidsAphids are one of the most important agricultural insect pests. Members of the family Aphididae (Sternorrhyncha, Hemiptera), aphids are sap-sucking insects that are most common in the temperate zones of the world.
                    They cause direct feeding damage to the plant and serve as vectors of plant viruses. In addition, aphid honeydew 
                    promotes the growth of sooty mold and attracts nuisance ants. Many economically important aphid species have a worldwide distribution but some remain outside the USA. The establishment 
                    of these aphid species would present dire consequences to US agriculture, as happened recently with the advent of the soybean aphid. In order to make informed decisions about the importation 
                    of agricultural products, it is critical that intercepted aphids be accurately identified.AphIDis the latest tool in the USDA's means to identify potential aphid pests.AphIDis intended to help US port identifiers, quarantine officers, and anyone seeking a preliminary but relatively simple way to identify aphids. A total of 66 aphid species are treated.AphIDincludes the 38 polyphagous aphid species in the three seminal works by Roger Blackman and Victor Eastop (1994, 2000, 2006). The remaining aphids represent the 28 species most frequently

                        intercepted at U.S. ports of entry that are not already represented on the Blackman & Eastop list.The key has 132 end points, one for each alata (winged female) and aptera (wingless female) of each of 66 species. The key will work for slide-mounted winged and wingless adult live-bearing females only. 
                    The key does not include males, oviparae (egg-laying females), or immatures. 
                    It may not work for all fundatrices (foundress from the first egg) or alatae and apterae from primary hosts (for those species with host alternation).The content of this tool has significant limitations! Please read the information below carefully in order to understand exactly how the key is constructed and to avoid misidentifications.
