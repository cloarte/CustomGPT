2022 OSTP Memorandum: Ensuring Free, Immediate,
and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research
1. Update their public access policies as soon as possible,
and no lat
er than December 31st, 2025, to make
publ
ications and their supporting data resulting from
federally funded research publicly accessible without an
em
bargo on their free and public release
2. Establish transparent procedures that ensure scientific and
r
esearc
h integrity is maintained in public access policies
3. Coordinate with OSTP to ensure equitable delivery of
federally funded research results and data

Implementation Plan Roadmap: FY 2024
• Continue customer and stakeholder engagement to validate information
and
 requirements for making USDA-funded research freely, immediately,
and equitably accessible by December 31, 2025.
• Make changes to existing USDA public access policy, following statutory
and
 regulatory requirements and processes, so that USDA can implement
new policies by December 31, 2025.
• Ensure ongoing operations and maintenance, and enhancements to
Pub
Ag, Ag Data Commons, and research management systems to ensure
public access to USDA-funded research outputs, with an emphasis on
d
igital persistent identifier issues to integrate research outputs consistently
and at scale.
• Prototype automated reporting frameworks and processes needed to
anal
yze policy effectiveness.
• Develop plans to carry out likely development needs as well as needs
re
vealed during the policy development and implementation process.
• Develop new outreach and training materials and validate them with
cu
stomers and community stakeholders.
Scope of DR 1020-006
People • All USDA mission areas, agencies, and staff offices
• All USDA employees who engage in scientific research during
of
ficial duties
• Awardees and contractors from non-US DA organizations who
ar
e engaged in USDA-supported scientific research
Research
All unclassified scientific research (intramural and extramural) 
supported wholly or in part by the USDA, regardless of the USDA 
funding level or funding mechanism. This includes scientific 
research

Outline of Policy Requirements
1. Scholarly Publications
2. Digital Scientific Research Data
a. Public Access
b. Data Management Plans
3. Persistent Identifiers
1. Requirements for Scholarly Publications
Scope: 
Peer-reviewed journal articles published by nongovernmental organizations
Accepted manuscripts must be made freely available to the public 
through PubAg within 12 months of upon publication.
In most cases these should be submitted to submit.nal.usda.gov.
Final published articles may be submitted to PubAg to satisfy this 
requirement, if the author has the right to share the published version (i.e., 
open access articles)
2. R equirements for Digital Scientifi c
R
esearch Data
Scope: 
Digital scientific research data that are appropriate for public access
Published in a machine-readable format in recognized repository that 
provides public access, persistent identifier, and preservation
Public access within 12 months of on publishing date of associated 
scholarly publication, or end of performance period, 
whichever comes first
Standardized metadata catalog entry in the Ag Data Commons

2. a. Requirements for Digital Scientific
R
esearch Data
Digital scientific research data assets should be made publicly accessible to 
fullest extent practicable.
However, nine categories of digital scientific research data assets should not 
be mad
e publicly accessible, including:
• Data that would not be necessary for validation of scientific research findings (i.e., trivial data)
• Data assets that include personally identifiable information (PII) or other information that could
enable re-identification of individuals or businesses
• Proprietary data assets
• Data assets related to protecting critical infrastructure
• Data assets related to the physical location of threatened or endangered species or sensitive
archaeological sites
• Data assets for which release would be inconsistent with U.S. national, homeland, or economic
security or would have significant negative impact on intellectual property rights, innovation,
and U.S. competitiveness
• Data assets for which public access is inconsistent with agency mission (e.g., documents
designated CUI)
• Other data assets whose release is limited by law, regulation, contract, agreement, national
security requirements, or policy (e.g., classified data or dual-use research data)
• Data covered by a FOIA exemption

Scope: 
All scientific research covered by this DR
All scientific research must be accompanied by a reviewed and agency- or 
office-approved data management plan (DMP)
DMP must describe how digital scientific research data assets will be made 
publicly accessible and indicate any categories of digital scientific research data 
assets that are exempt from public access requirements

Authors of scholarly publications and digital scientific research data assets should 
use individual persistent identifiers 
(e.g., ORCID iD)
USDA-funded authors who are not USDA staff can go to http://orcid.org or use their 
institution’s links.
Research products should receive persistent identifiers
