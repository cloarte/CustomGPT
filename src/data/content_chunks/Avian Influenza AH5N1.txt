2024 Highly Pathogenic Avian 
Influenza (H5N1) - Michigan 
Dairy Herd and Poultry Flock 
Summary  
Epidemiological Investigations of HPAI H5N1 Genotype B3.13 in 
Michigan Dairy Herds and Poultry Flocks: Observations on viral 
spread between premises and mitigation recommendations  
June 9, 2024 
1. Executive Summary
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viral infection in dairy cattle was first confirmed on a Texas dairy 
premises on March 25, 2024.  Dairy cattle from an HPAI affected dairy premises in Texas – non-clinical and 
undetected at the time of the cattle movement – were shipped to Michigan, arriving on March 8, 2024.  Clinical 
signs were first observed in the premises’ resident cattle on March 20, 2024.  On April 1, 2024, a commercial 
poultry premises reported clinical signs associated with HPAI. The flock was confirmed infected on April 2, 2024. 
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of viruses from the dairy and poultry premises identified Eurasian lineage 
goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 on both premises and suggests likely indirect transfer of virus 
from the dairy premises to the poultry premises.   
In early April 2024, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) invited a USDA 
Epidemiological Strike Team into Michigan to investigate the links between HPAI affected dairy premises and 
evidence of spillover into poultry premises.  This report summarizes the findings from field epidemiological 
investigations of disease spread between premises for 15 dairy herds and 8 poultry flocks confirmed with HPAI 
genotype

 Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) invited a USDA 
Epidemiological Strike Team into Michigan to investigate the links between HPAI affected dairy premises and 
evidence of spillover into poultry premises.  This report summarizes the findings from field epidemiological 
investigations of disease spread between premises for 15 dairy herds and 8 poultry flocks confirmed with HPAI 
genotype B3.13 in Michigan. 
After interstate animal movement initially introduced the HPAI genotype B3.13 virus into a Michigan dairy, 
continued disease transmission within the state is determined to be multifactorial. Transmission between farms is 
likely due to indirect epidemiological links related to normal business operations such as numerous people, 
vehicles, and other conveyances frequently moving on and off the affected dairy premises, with many of these 
indirect links shared between premises. Importantly, disease spread due to independent introduction of the virus 
onto dairy or poultry premises from migratory waterfowl is not supported based on both genomic and 
epidemiological data analysis. 
Key findings identified to date and potential risk factors for local transmission include: 
• Shared personnel b etween premises
o 20% of affected dairies’ employees and 7% of dairies’ employees family members work on other
dairy premises
o 7% of affected dairies’ employees also work on poultry premises; 13% of affected dairies’
employees have family members who work on poultry premises
o 31% of dairies have employees who own livestock or poultry at their personal residence
• Shared v ehicles between premises

o 40% of affected dairy premises have regular visits for deadstock removal, with 20% having direct
contact with cattle
 53% of affected dairies utilized the same deadstock removal company and 40% had
animals removed from the premises by that company within 30 days prior to clinical

o Milk haulers visit dairy premises, on average, 34 times within a 30-day time period
 93.3% of affected dairy premises are part of the same milk co-op with at least one other
affected dairy premises within the state (i.e., only one of the affected dairy herds is part
of a milk co-op that none of the other 14 affected dairy herds belong to)
Based on the epidemiological findings, the majority of links between affected dairy premises, and between dairy 
and poultry premises, are indirect from shared people, vehicles, and equipment.  As such, HPAI disease spread 
between dairy and poultry premises can be mitigated by identifying potential interconnections between 
operations (people, conveyances, etc.) and increasing biosecurity practices on all premises and associated animal 
businesses (e.g., milk haulers, deadstock/contract haulers and other shared vehicles/trailers between premises,

and allow decision-makers to better manage the response. 
2. Background
After more than a month of investigations into dramatically decreased milk production and changes in milk 
composition in dairy herds in Texas, on March 25, 2024, the cause was confirmed to be the highly pathogenic 
avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus of Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13.  The HPAI 
H5N1 virus is detected at high levels in milk of infected cows and at lower levels in nasal swabs and urine of 
infected cows; manure does not appear to be a meaningful viral source and is unlikely to transmit the virus.  
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis suggests an initial single spillover event of the virus from wild birds to 
dairy cattle, most likely occurring in the Texas panhandle in December 2023, with onward spread of the virus to 
eight other states (Nguen et al, 2024).   
On March 29, 2024, HPAI was confirmed on a Michigan dairy cattle premises with disease introduction traced 
back to movement of lactating dairy cattle from an affected dairy premises in Texas which was non-clinical at the 
time of animal movement.  The Texas dairy herd was detected shortly after cattle movement into Michigan 
occurred when

On March 29, 2024, HPAI was confirmed on a Michigan dairy cattle premises with disease introduction traced 
back to movement of lactating dairy cattle from an affected dairy premises in Texas which was non-clinical at the 
time of animal movement.  The Texas dairy herd was detected shortly after cattle movement into Michigan 
occurred when the Texas herd displayed clinical signs.  On April 2, 2024, HPAI was confirmed on a commercial 
poultry premises in Michigan; WGS supports this premises was infected with the same B3.13 genotype as the first 
Michigan affected dairy with directional movement of the virus from the dairy premises to the poultry premises.    
On April 10, 2024, a team of USDA epidemiologists (Epidemiological Strike Team) was invited by the Michigan 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) to deploy to Michigan to rapidly investigate 
detections of HPAI in Michigan dairies with evidence of spillover into poultry premises.  A USDA Incident 
Management Team (IMT) was also deployed to Michigan at the same time to support the state’s HPAI poultry 
response; epidemiologists from both groups communicated daily during deployment and regularly after 
demobilization to discuss details about affected premises.

3. Epidemiologic Investigation Methods
The focus of the epidemiological investigations was to identify potential transmission routes for disease spread 
between affected dairy premises and links to affected poultry premises in Michigan.  All affected dairy herds in 
Michigan were identified by reporting sick cattle on

3. Epidemiologic Investigation Methods
The focus of the epidemiological investigations was to identify potential transmission routes for disease spread 
between affected dairy premises and links to affected poultry premises in Michigan.  All affected dairy herds in 
Michigan were identified by reporting sick cattle on their operations to the MDARD.  Michigan’s first affected 
dairy submitted samples from affected cattle to Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for 
preliminary testing and subsequent affected herds submitted samples to the Michigan State University Veterinary 
Diagnostic Laboratory; both laboratories are members of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.  
Confirmatory testing was performed at USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL).  Initial 
epidemiological information was collected at the time of reporting of clinical signs, followed by administration of 
the USDA Dairy Cattle Emerging Health Event: Epidemiological Questionnaire.  The questionnaire took 1-2 hours 
to complete depending on the complexity of the operation and the willingness of the producer.  Both WGS 
analysis and follow-up field epidemiology investigations were then conducted with producers/herd veterinarians 
on affected dairy premises and associated animal businesses (e.g., deadstock haulers, milk haulers, feed 
deliveries) to further identify epidemiological links between affected dairy and poultry premises.  A subset of 
affected dairy and poultry premises also agreed to additional on-farm sampling of wild birds and peri-domestic 
species by USDA Wildlife Services personnel.  Data analyses were ongoing and performed as soon as possible after 
data collection.

4. Epidemiologic Summary
4.1 Summary of HPAI H5N1 Cases
A summary description of the 15 dairy herds and 8 poultry flocks that were confirmed in Michigan between March 
29, 2024 and May 16, 2024 is presented in Table 1.  On average, dairy premises had approximately 1,000 cattle 
onsite and poultry premises had approximately 84,000 birds onsite.  The range of Euclidean geographic distances 
between dairy premises is 1 to 93 miles; between dairy and poultry premises is 1 to 93 miles; and between 
poultry premises is 0.7 to 68 miles.     
Clinical signs were first observed in dairy cattle in Michigan on March 20, 2024.  The last date that clinical signs 
were initially reported on affected premises investigated in this report was May 6, 2024 in dairy and May 3, 2024 
in poultry. The date ranges of clinical onset are shown in Table 1. The order of clinical signs observed does not 
match the order the herds/flocks were detected due to variability in the timing of reporting, sample collection, 
and laboratory confirmation.  
Figure 1 provides the timeline of the HPAI H5N1 detections based on the date of clinical onset for each affected 
dairy herd and poultry flock.

4.2 Summary of Disease Spread between Premises   
A summary of the identified genomic and epidemiological links (Figures 3, 4) between affected dairy and poultry 
premises are conceptualized in the figures below.  Michigan’s first affected dairy was infected by the importation 
of cattle from an affected herd in Texas, which was undetected at the time of movement.  Based on movement 
information and WGS, the virus in this herd likely moved to other Michigan dairy herds and poultry flocks.  While 
the exact mechanism of disease spread onto each premises is unknown, the route of transmission is likely 
multifactorial based on epidemiological investigations.   
4.2.1 Disease Spread Between Dairy Premises 
All dairy premises had numerous risk factors for virus introduction, including many visitors within 30 days prior to 
clinical signs appearing in cattle.  Key risk factors shared between dairy premises are summarized below and 
additional characteristics of affected dairy farms is provided in Table 2.  Key findings include the following:

4.2.1 Disease Spread Between Dairy Premises 
All dairy premises had numerous risk factors for virus introduction, including many visitors within 30 days prior to 
clinical signs appearing in cattle.  Key risk factors shared between dairy premises are summarized below and 
additional characteristics of affected dairy farms is provided in Table 2.  Key findings include the following:  
• 6 dairy premises had cattle brought onto the premises in the previous 30 days, although only one of these 
premises’ movements is associated with disease transmission. 
• All dairy premises reported visitors having contact with cattle on their premises.  
o 100% of affected dairy premises have regular visits by veterinarians, nutritionist/feed consultant, 
and/or contract haulers (e.g., cattle or manure); the majority of these visitors have direct contact 
with cattle. 
o 40% of affected dairy premises have regular visits for deadstock removal, with 20% having direct 
contact with cattle.  
 53% of affected dairies (8/15) utilized the same deadstock removal company and 67% of 
those (6/8) had animals removed from the premises by that company within 30 days prior 
to clinical onset, 13% (1/8) reported that no animals were removed but that the 
deadstock hauler they have in common did stop on their property. 
o Milk haulers visit dairy premises on average 34 times within a 30-day time period. 
 93.3% of affected dairy premises are part of the same milk co-op with at least one other 
affected dairy premises (i.e., only one of the affected dairy herds is part of a milk co-op 
that none of the other 14 affected dairy herds belong to). 
• 7 dairy premises reported shared personnel between premises.

Despite no genomic evidence that migratory birds are spreading HPAI genotype B3.13 within Michigan, the 
potential for resident wild birds or peri-domestic species to move and transmit the virus between dairy herds 
cannot be ruled out, especially for dairy premises located in close proximity.  All dairy herds reported wild bird,

ential for resident wild birds or peri-domestic species to move and transmit the virus between dairy herds 
cannot be ruled out, especially for dairy premises located in close proximity.  All dairy herds reported wild bird, 
wild animal, or rodent presence on farms, with these species always having access to cattle feed.  HPAI H5N1 
genotype B3.13 detections in pigeons, a starling, cats, racoons, opossums, and foxes have occurred on 5 affected 
dairy premises and 1 affected poultry premises that participated in on-farm sampling.  Still, it was a small number 
of individual animals and species that were detected from the large number of samples collected.         
4.2.2 Disease Spread Between Dairy and Poultry Premises 
Apart from the potential for resident wild birds or peri-domestic species to move and transmit the virus, as 
discussed above, the only other potential transmission routes found from dairy herds to the poultry flocks were 
through shared employment, housing, or movement of employees.  Approximately 22 employees of 3 poultry 
flocks worked weekend shifts at 2 different dairy premises.  Shared housing between dairy and poultry workers 
was identified between 3 poultry premises and 2 dairy premises. It is also possible that dairy employees have 
social contact with poultry premises employees.   
5. Recommendations to Mitigate Disease Spread Between Premises 
The intensive, integrated, and specialized nature of the dairy industry results in biosecurity risks that are not 
completely avoidable, but these risks can be mitigated.  Given that disease spread between dairy and poultry 
premises is multifactorial, mitigation measures that are integrated and target multiple risk factors are needed.

 specialized nature of the dairy industry results in biosecurity risks that are not 
completely avoidable, but these risks can be mitigated.  Given that disease spread between dairy and poultry 
premises is multifactorial, mitigation measures that are integrated and target multiple risk factors are needed.  
The USDA Federal Order requires premovement testing for interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle (as of 
April 29, 2024) which greatly reduces the risk of premises-to-premises disease spread.  Since 9 of 15 of the 
affected dairy herds in Michigan were closed herds which did not bring any new cattle into the herd, restriction of 
live cattle movements would not have prevented disease in these herds.  Movement restrictions on cattle in 
some Michigan affected herds may result in serious animal welfare issues since these specialized operations do 
not have the facilities to manage all classes of dairy cattle and rely on an integrated network of operations to 
raise and manage the different classes of cattle.  However, testing before moving cattle would help limit 
premises-to-premises transmission from cattle movement within the state and may identify additionally affected 
herds.   
The biosecurity practices outlined in the Secure Milk Supply’s “Enhanced Biosecurity Plan” include not moving 
cattle if possible, restricting visitors’ access to the premises, cleaning and disinfecting vehicles and equipment 
moved on/off the premises – especially those having contact with cattle or cattle areas, requiring use of personal 
protective equipment and/or changing or cleaning and disinfecting footwear, and implementing a line of 
separation to mitigate virus movement; are all applicable in this event.  In addition, reducing wild bird/animal 
exposure to unpasteurized or waste milk, cattle feed, and other areas of the premises, as is possible, would also 
mitigate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 of personal 
protective equipment and/or changing or cleaning and disinfecting footwear, and implementing a line of 
separation to mitigate virus movement; are all applicable in this event.  In addition, reducing wild bird/animal 
exposure to unpasteurized or waste milk, cattle feed, and other areas of the premises, as is possible, would also 
mitigate this transmission route.  The MDARD Director signed a “Determination of Extraordinary Emergency -  
HPAI Risk Reduction Response Order” on May 1, 2024 to further protect Michigan’s poultry and livestock 
industries from the ongoing threat of the virus.  The order requires dairy and poultry premises to implement the 
above biosecurity practices; prohibits all cattle from affected dairy herds and lactating or late pregnancy cattle 
from unaffected dairy herds from being exhibited until at least 60 days have passed with no new dairy detections; 
and prohibits all poultry from being exhibited until at least 30 days have passed with no new poultry detections.  
Implementation of this order will also greatly mitigate disease exposure and spread within the state.    
Page 10 of 10  
Finally, testing dairy cattle as early as possible after onset of clinical signs or changes in production metrics within 
the herd (e.g., decreased milk production, decreased rumen motility) allows earlier detection of affected dairy 
herds and evaluation if the above mitigation measures can be implemented.

6. Conclusion 
The investigations discussed in this report, including the respective WGS information, indicate that HPAI H5N1 
genotype B3.13 was introduced into Michigan through animal movement and subsequently spread within the 
state between dairy premises with spillover into poultry premises through multiple possible routes. Factors that 
appear to be of greater risk for introduction into a dairy premises may be mitigated through enhanced 
biosecurity, increased animal testing, and potentially through within-state animal movement restrictions if they 
can be implemented without impacting animal welfare.  
The willingness of Michigan producers to participate in these investigations has greatly increased the body of 
knowledge of HPAI H5N1 B3.13 detections in Michigan and throughout the nation; this report could not have 
been completed without them.

Influenza (H5N1) - Michigan 
Dairy Herd and Poultry Flock 
Summary  
Epidemiological Investigations of HPAI H5N1 Genotype B3.13 in 
Michigan Dairy Herds and Poultry Flocks: Observations on viral 
spread between premises and mitigation recommendations  
June 9, 2024 
1. Executive Summary
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viral infection in dairy cattle was first confirmed on a Texas dairy 
premises on March 25, 2024.  Dairy cattle from an HPAI affected dairy premises in Texas – non-clinical and 
undetected at the time of the cattle movement – were shipped to Michigan, arriving on March 8, 2024.  Clinical 
signs were first observed in the premises’ resident cattle on March 20, 2024.  On April 1, 2024, a commercial 
poultry premises reported clinical signs associated with HPAI. The flock was confirmed infected on April 2, 2024. 
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of viruses from the dairy and poultry premises identified Eurasian lineage 
goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 on both premises and suggests likely indirect transfer of virus 
from the dairy premises to the poultry premises.   
In early April 2024, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) invited a USDA 
Epidemiological Strike Team into Michigan to investigate the links between HPAI affected dairy premises and 
evidence of spillover into poultry premises.  This report summarizes the findings from field epidemiological 
investigations of disease spread between premises for 15 dairy herds and 8 poultry flocks confirmed with HPAI 
genotype

 Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) invited a USDA 
Epidemiological Strike Team into Michigan to investigate the links between HPAI affected dairy premises and 
evidence of spillover into poultry premises.  This report summarizes the findings from field epidemiological 
investigations of disease spread between premises for 15 dairy herds and 8 poultry flocks confirmed with HPAI 
genotype B3.13 in Michigan. 
After interstate animal movement initially introduced the HPAI genotype B3.13 virus into a Michigan dairy, 
continued disease transmission within the state is determined to be multifactorial. Transmission between farms is 
likely due to indirect epidemiological links related to normal business operations such as numerous people, 
vehicles, and other conveyances frequently moving on and off the affected dairy premises, with many of these 
indirect links shared between premises. Importantly, disease spread due to independent introduction of the virus 
onto dairy or poultry premises from migratory waterfowl is not supported based on both genomic and 
epidemiological data analysis. 
Key findings identified to date and potential risk factors for local transmission include: 
• Shared personnel b etween premises
o 20% of affected dairies’ employees and 7% of dairies’ employees family members work on other
dairy premises
o 7% of affected dairies’ employees also work on poultry premises; 13% of affected dairies’
employees have family members who work on poultry premises
o 31% of dairies have employees who own livestock or poultry at their personal residence
• Shared v ehicles between premises

o 100% of affected dairy premises have regular visits by veterinarians, nutritionist/feed consultant,
and/or contract haulers (e.g., cattle or manure); the majority of these visitors have direct contact
w
ith cattle
o 40% of affected dairy premises have regular visits for deadstock removal, with 20% having direct
contact with cattle
 53% of affected dairies utilized the same deadstock removal company and 40% had
animals removed from the premises by that company within 30 days prior to clinical
o
nset
o Milk haulers visit dairy premises, on average, 34 times within a 30-day time period
 93.3% of affected dairy premises are part of the same milk co-op with at least one other
affected dairy premises within the state (i.e., only one of the affected dairy herds is part
of a milk co-op that none of the other 14 affected dairy herds belong to)
Based on the epidemiological findings, the majority of links between affected dairy premises, and between dairy 
and poultry premises, are indirect from shared people, vehicles, and equipment.  As such, HPAI disease spread 
between dairy and poultry premises can be mitigated by identifying potential interconnections between 
operations (people, conveyances, etc.) and increasing biosecurity practices on all premises and associated animal 
businesses (e.g., milk haulers, deadstock/contract haulers and other shared vehicles/trailers between premises, 
livestock markets

and allow decision-makers to better manage the response. 
2. Background
After more than a month of investigations into dramatically decreased milk production and changes in milk 
composition in dairy herds in Texas, on March 25, 2024, the cause was confirmed to be the highly pathogenic 
avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus of Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13.  The HPAI 
H5N1 virus is detected at high levels in milk of infected cows and at lower levels in nasal swabs and urine of 
infected cows; manure does not appear to be a meaningful viral source and is unlikely to transmit the virus.  
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis suggests an initial single spillover event of the virus from wild birds to 
dairy cattle, most likely occurring in the Texas panhandle in December 2023, with onward spread of the virus to 
eight other states (Nguen et al, 2024).   
On March 29, 2024, HPAI was confirmed on a Michigan dairy cattle premises with disease introduction traced 
back to movement of lactating dairy cattle from an affected dairy premises in Texas which was non-clinical at the 
time of animal movement.  The Texas dairy herd was detected shortly after cattle movement into Michigan 
occurred when

On March 29, 2024, HPAI was confirmed on a Michigan dairy cattle premises with disease introduction traced 
back to movement of lactating dairy cattle from an affected dairy premises in Texas which was non-clinical at the 
time of animal movement.  The Texas dairy herd was detected shortly after cattle movement into Michigan 
occurred when the Texas herd displayed clinical signs.  On April 2, 2024, HPAI was confirmed on a commercial 
poultry premises in Michigan; WGS supports this premises was infected with the same B3.13 genotype as the first 
Michigan affected dairy with directional movement of the virus from the dairy premises to the poultry premises.    
On April 10, 2024, a team of USDA epidemiologists (Epidemiological Strike Team) was invited by the Michigan 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) to deploy to Michigan to rapidly investigate 
detections of HPAI in Michigan dairies with evidence of spillover into poultry premises.  A USDA Incident 
Management Team (IMT) was also deployed to Michigan at the same time to support the state’s HPAI poultry 
response; epidemiologists from both groups communicated daily during deployment and regularly after 
demobilization to discuss details about affected premises.

3. Epidemiologic Investigation Methods
The focus of the epidemiological investigations was to identify potential transmission routes for disease spread 
between affected dairy premises and links to affected poultry premises in Michigan.  All affected dairy herds in 
Michigan were identified by reporting sick cattle on

3. Epidemiologic Investigation Methods
The focus of the epidemiological investigations was to identify potential transmission routes for disease spread 
between affected dairy premises and links to affected poultry premises in Michigan.  All affected dairy herds in 
Michigan were identified by reporting sick cattle on their operations to the MDARD.  Michigan’s first affected 
dairy submitted samples from affected cattle to Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for 
preliminary testing and subsequent affected herds submitted samples to the Michigan State University Veterinary 
Diagnostic Laboratory; both laboratories are members of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.  
Confirmatory testing was performed at USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL).  Initial 
epidemiological information was collected at the time of reporting of clinical signs, followed by administration of 
the USDA Dairy Cattle Emerging Health Event: Epidemiological Questionnaire.  The questionnaire took 1-2 hours 
to complete depending on the complexity of the operation and the willingness of the producer.  Both WGS 
analysis and follow-up field epidemiology investigations were then conducted with producers/herd veterinarians 
on affected dairy premises and associated animal businesses (e.g., deadstock haulers, milk haulers, feed 
deliveries) to further identify epidemiological links between affected dairy and poultry premises.  A subset of 
affected dairy and poultry premises also agreed to additional on-farm sampling of wild birds and peri-domestic 
species by USDA Wildlife Services personnel.  Data analyses were ongoing and performed as soon as possible after 
data collection.

4. Epidemiologic Summary
4.1 Summary of HPAI H5N1 Cases
A summary description of the 15 dairy herds and 8 poultry flocks that were confirmed in Michigan between March 
29, 2024 and May 16, 2024 is presented in Table 1.  On average, dairy premises had approximately 1,000 cattle 
onsite and poultry premises had approximately 84,000 birds onsite.  The range of Euclidean geographic distances 
between dairy premises is 1 to 93 miles; between dairy and poultry premises is 1 to 93 miles; and between 
poultry premises is 0.7 to 68 miles.     
Clinical signs were first observed in dairy cattle in Michigan on March 20, 2024.  The last date that clinical signs 
were initially reported on affected premises investigated in this report was May 6, 2024 in dairy and May 3, 2024 
in poultry. The date ranges of clinical onset are shown in Table 1. The order of clinical signs observed does not 
match the order the herds/flocks were detected due to variability in the timing of reporting, sample collection, 
and laboratory confirmation.  
Figure 1 provides the timeline of the HPAI H5N1 detections based on the date of clinical onset for each affected 
dairy herd and poultry flock.  
Figure 2 provides the epidemiological timeline curve of HPAI H5N1 detections based on the date of confirmation 
for affected dairy herds and poultry flocks.

4.2 Summary of Disease Spread between Premises   
A summary of the identified genomic and epidemiological links (Figures 3, 4) between affected dairy and poultry 
premises are conceptualized in the figures below.  Michigan’s first affected dairy was infected by the importation 
of cattle from an affected herd in Texas, which was undetected at the time of movement.  Based on movement 
information and WGS, the virus in this herd likely moved to other Michigan dairy herds and poultry flocks.  While 
the exact mechanism of disease spread onto each premises is unknown, the route of transmission is likely 
multifactorial based on epidemiological investigations.   
4.2.1 Disease Spread Between Dairy Premises 
All dairy premises had numerous risk factors for virus introduction, including many visitors within 30 days prior to 
clinical signs appearing in cattle.  Key risk factors shared between dairy premises are summarized below and 
additional characteristics of affected dairy farms is provided in Table 2.  Key findings include the following:

4.2.1 Disease Spread Between Dairy Premises 
All dairy premises had numerous risk factors for virus introduction, including many visitors within 30 days prior to 
clinical signs appearing in cattle.  Key risk factors shared between dairy premises are summarized below and 
additional characteristics of affected dairy farms is provided in Table 2.  Key findings include the following:  
• 6 dairy premises had cattle brought onto the premises in the previous 30 days, although only one of these 
premises’ movements is associated with disease transmission. 
• All dairy premises reported visitors having contact with cattle on their premises.  
o 100% of affected dairy premises have regular visits by veterinarians, nutritionist/feed consultant, 
and/or contract haulers (e.g., cattle or manure); the majority of these visitors have direct contact 
with cattle. 
o 40% of affected dairy premises have regular visits for deadstock removal, with 20% having direct 
contact with cattle.  
 53% of affected dairies (8/15) utilized the same deadstock removal company and 67% of 
those (6/8) had animals removed from the premises by that company within 30 days prior 
to clinical onset, 13% (1/8) reported that no animals were removed but that the 
deadstock hauler they have in common did stop on their property. 
o Milk haulers visit dairy premises on average 34 times within a 30-day time period. 
 93.3% of affected dairy premises are part of the same milk co-op with at least one other 
affected dairy premises (i.e., only one of the affected dairy herds is part of a milk co-op 
that none of the other 14 affected dairy herds belong to). 
• 7 dairy premises reported shared personnel between premises.

of individual animals and species that were detected from the large number of samples collected.         
4.2.2 Disease Spread Between Dairy and Poultry Premises 
Apart from the potential for resident wild birds or peri-domestic species to move and transmit the virus, as 
discussed above, the only other potential transmission routes found from dairy herds to the poultry flocks were 
through shared employment, housing, or movement of employees.  Approximately 22 employees of 3 poultry 
flocks worked weekend shifts at 2 different dairy premises.  Shared housing between dairy and poultry workers 
was identified between 3 poultry premises and 2 dairy premises. It is also possible that dairy employees have 
social contact with poultry premises employees.   
5. Recommendations to Mitigate Disease Spread Between Premises 
The intensive, integrated, and specialized nature of the dairy industry results in biosecurity risks that are not 
completely avoidable, but these risks can be mitigated.  Given that disease spread between dairy and poultry 
premises is multifactorial, mitigation measures that are integrated and target multiple risk factors are needed.

 specialized nature of the dairy industry results in biosecurity risks that are not 
completely avoidable, but these risks can be mitigated.  Given that disease spread between dairy and poultry 
premises is multifactorial, mitigation measures that are integrated and target multiple risk factors are needed.  
The USDA Federal Order requires premovement testing for interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle (as of 
April 29, 2024) which greatly reduces the risk of premises-to-premises disease spread.  Since 9 of 15 of the 
affected dairy herds in Michigan were closed herds which did not bring any new cattle into the herd, restriction of 
live cattle movements would not have prevented disease in these herds.  Movement restrictions on cattle in 
some Michigan affected herds may result in serious animal welfare issues since these specialized operations do 
not have the facilities to manage all classes of dairy cattle and rely on an integrated network of operations to 
raise and manage the different classes of cattle.  However, testing before moving cattle would help limit 
premises-to-premises transmission from cattle movement within the state and may identify additionally affected 
herds.   
The biosecurity practices outlined in the Secure Milk Supply’s “Enhanced Biosecurity Plan” include not moving 
cattle if possible, restricting visitors’ access to the premises, cleaning and disinfecting vehicles and equipment 
moved on/off the premises – especially those having contact with cattle or cattle areas, requiring use of personal 
protective equipment and/or changing or cleaning and disinfecting footwear, and implementing a line of 
separation to mitigate virus movement; are all applicable in this event.  In addition, reducing wild bird/animal 
exposure to unpasteurized or waste milk, cattle feed, and other areas of the premises, as is possible, would also 
mitigate

 of personal 
protective equipment and/or changing or cleaning and disinfecting footwear, and implementing a line of 
separation to mitigate virus movement; are all applicable in this event.  In addition, reducing wild bird/animal 
exposure to unpasteurized or waste milk, cattle feed, and other areas of the premises, as is possible, would also 
mitigate this transmission route.  The MDARD Director signed a “Determination of Extraordinary Emergency -  
HPAI Risk Reduction Response Order” on May 1, 2024 to further protect Michigan’s poultry and livestock 
industries from the ongoing threat of the virus.  The order requires dairy and poultry premises to implement the 
above biosecurity practices; prohibits all cattle from affected dairy herds and lactating or late pregnancy cattle 
from unaffected dairy herds from being exhibited until at least 60 days have passed with no new dairy detections; 
and prohibits all poultry from being exhibited until at least 30 days have passed with no new poultry detections.  
Implementation of this order will also greatly mitigate disease exposure and spread within the state.

Finally, testing dairy cattle as early as possible after onset of clinical signs or changes in production metrics within 
the herd (e.g., decreased milk production, decreased rumen motility) allows earlier detection of affected dairy 
herds and evaluation if the above mitigation measures can be implemented.          
6. Conclusion 
The investigations discussed in this report, including the respective WGS information, indicate that HPAI H5N1 
genotype B3.13 was introduced into Michigan through animal movement and subsequently spread within the 
state between dairy premises with spillover into poultry premises through multiple possible routes. Factors that 
appear to be of greater risk for introduction

6. Conclusion 
The investigations discussed in this report, including the respective WGS information, indicate that HPAI H5N1 
genotype B3.13 was introduced into Michigan through animal movement and subsequently spread within the 
state between dairy premises with spillover into poultry premises through multiple possible routes. Factors that 
appear to be of greater risk for introduction into a dairy premises may be mitigated through enhanced 
biosecurity, increased animal testing, and potentially through within-state animal movement restrictions if they 
can be implemented without impacting animal welfare.  
The willingness of Michigan producers to participate in these investigations has greatly increased the body of 
knowledge of HPAI H5N1 B3.13 detections in Michigan and throughout the nation; this report could not have 
been completed without them.
