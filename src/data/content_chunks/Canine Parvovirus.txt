3.4   Preparation of the Test Vaccine 
 
3.4.1   Conduct the initial test of a Test Vaccine with a single vial (a single 
sample from 1 vial). On the day of inoculation, using a sterile 1.0-mL syringe and 
an 18-gauge x 1 1/2-inch needle, rehydrate a vial of the Test Vaccine with the 
provided diluent by transferring 1.0 mL for 1-mL-dose vaccines, 0.5 mL for  
0.5-mL-dose vaccines, etc., into the vial containing the lyophilized Test Vaccine; 
mix by vortexing. Incubate for 15 ± 5 minutes at room temperature. 
 
3.4.2   For multifraction CPI vaccines, neutralize the non-CPI viral fractions with 
antiserum specific to each non-CPI virus fraction. It is not necessary to neutralize 
canine parvovirus (CPV) since CPV is not expected to replicate in confluent Vero 
cells.  
 
1.  Prepare dilutions of each neutralizing non-CPI antiserum according to 
the CVB Reagent Data Sheet or manufacturer’s instructions.  
 
2.  Dispense 200 µL of each of the required neutralizing antiserum into a 
12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube labeled 10-1, and q.s. with MEM to 1.8 mL.

For example, to neutralize 2 non-CPI viral fractions in a 3-fraction 
CDV/CPI/CAV vaccine, dispense 200 µL of each of the diluted CDV and 
CAV antiserums into the tube labeled 10-1; add 1.4 mL of MEM to obtain 
a final volume of 1.8 mL. 
   
3.  Pipette 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to the 10-1 labeled 
tube containing the neutralizing antisera; mix by vortexing.  
 
4.  Incubate at room temperature for 60 ± 10 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For Test Vaccines containing only the CPI viral fraction, prepare the 10-1 
dilution by mixing 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine with 1.8 mL of MEM 
in a labeled 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube.

labeled 10-2 through 10-6 (or more if the expected CPI endpoint of the Test 
Vaccine is higher than 10-6).  
 
2.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the tube labeled 10-1 to 
the next dilution tube; mix by vortexing. 
 
3.  Repeat Step 2 to the remaining tubes, transferring 200 µL from the 
previous dilution to the next dilution tube until the tenfold dilution series 
is completed. 
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   On the day of test inoculation, label the Test Plates and inoculate each of 5 
wells/dilution with 200 µL of dilutions 10-6 through 10-3 of each Test Vaccine. In a 
similar manner, identify and inoculate 5 wells/dilution of the CPI Positive Control Virus 
(with dilutions 10-9 through 10-6 for the example in Section 3.3.2). Change tips between 
each unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine and the CPI Positive Control Virus); tip 
changes are not necessary between dilutions in a series if pipetting from the most dilute 
to the most concentrated within that series (e.g., 10-9 through 10-6).

to the most concentrated within that series (e.g., 10-9 through 10-6). 
 
4.2   Five uninoculated wells serve as Negative Cell Controls. 
 
4.3   Incubate the Test Plates in a 36°± 2°C CO 2 incubator for 8 days ± 1 day. 
 
4.4   After incubation, perform the HAd assay on the cell monolayers with a 0.5% 
GPRBC suspension. 
 
4.4.1   Decant the media from the plates into an autoclavable container. 
 
4.4.2   Submerge each Test Plate in a reservoir of Ca++, Mg++-Free DPBS and 
decant. 
 
4.4.3   Mix the 0.5% GPRBC suspension by gentle inversion, and add  
1.0 mL/well. 
 
4.4.4   Incubate at 2°- 7°C for 25 ± 5 minutes. 
 
4.4.5   Wash Test Plates by repeating Section 4.4.2 twice.

4.4.6   Read the wet Test Plate at 100X magnification on an inverted light 
microscope, and examine CPI-infected vero cells for HAd. 
 
1.  Wells displaying GPRBC adsorbed onto the cell monolayer are 
considered to be positive for CPI.  
 
2.  Record the results as the number of HAd- positive wells versus total 
number of wells examined for each dilution of the Test Vaccine and the 
CPI Positive Control Virus. 
 
4.5   Calculate the CPI Virus endpoints of the Test Vaccine and the CPI Positive 
Control Virus using the Spearman-Kärber method as modified by Finney. The titers are 
expressed as log10 50% HAd infective doses (HAdID50). 
 
Example: 
 
10-3 dilution of Test Vaccine = 5/5 wells HAd positive 
10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 4/5 wells HAd positive 
10-5 dilution of Test Vaccine = 1/5 wells HAd positive 
10-6 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/5 wells HAd positive 
 
Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (X - d/2 + [d • S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells HAd positive (3)  
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) 
S =

Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (X - d/2 + [d • S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells HAd positive (3)  
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) 
S = sum of proportions of wells HAd positive for all dilutions tested: 
 
5     4    1     0    10  
5 +  5  + 5  + 5 =  5 = 2.0 
 
CPI Test Vaccine titer = (3 -  1/2) + (1 • 2.0) = 4.5 
 
Adjust the titer to the recommended Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A.  divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose where: 
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for 
this CPI vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL)

                       0.2 mL inoculum = 5 
 
B.  calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine titer as illustrated 
below: 
 
                       Log of 5 = 0.7 
 
CPI Test Vaccine titer = 4.5 + 0.7 = 5.2 
                         
Therefore, the titer of the CPI Test Vaccine is 105.2 HAdID50/mL. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Validity requirements 
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the CPI Positive Control Virus must fall within plus 
or minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers. 
 
5.1.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CPI Positive Control Virus must 
exhibit a 100% positive HAd reaction (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or 
more wells are HAd positive wells at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as 
“greater than

5.1.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CPI Positive Control Virus must 
exhibit a 100% positive HAd reaction (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or 
more wells are HAd positive wells at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as 
“greater than or equal to” the calculated titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, 
the highest (most dilute) must exhibit no positive HAd reaction (0/5). 
 
5.1.3   The Negative Cell Controls shall not exhibit degradation, HAd, or cloudy 
media indicative of contamination. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, the assay is considered a NO TEST and 
can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater than or equal to the titer 
contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) filed Outline of 
Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is considered SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.4   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is less than the titer contained in the 
APHIS filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine may be 
retested in accordance with 9 CFR 113.8.

3.4   Preparation of the Test Vaccine 
 
3.4.1   Conduct the initial test of a Test Vaccine with a single vial (a single 
sample from 1 vial). On the day of inoculation, using a sterile 1.0-mL syringe and 
an 18-gauge x 1 1/2-inch needle, rehydrate a vial of the Test Vaccine with the 
provided diluent by transferring 1.0 mL for 1-mL-dose vaccines, 0.5 mL for  
0.5-mL-dose vaccines, etc., into the vial containing the lyophilized Test Vaccine; 
mix by vortexing. Incubate for 15 ± 5 minutes at room temperature. 
 
3.4.2   For multifraction CPI vaccines, neutralize the non-CPI viral fractions with 
antiserum specific to each non-CPI virus fraction. It is not necessary to neutralize 
canine parvovirus (CPV) since CPV is not expected to replicate in confluent Vero 
cells.  
 
1.  Prepare dilutions of each neutralizing non-CPI antiserum according to 
the CVB Reagent Data Sheet or manufacturer’s instructions.  
 
2.  Dispense 200 µL of each of the required neutralizing antiserum into a 
12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube labeled 10-1, and q.s. with MEM to 1.8 mL. 
For example, to neutralize 2 non-CPI viral fractions in a 3-fraction

For example, to neutralize 2 non-CPI viral fractions in a 3-fraction 
CDV/CPI/CAV vaccine, dispense 200 µL of each of the diluted CDV and 
CAV antiserums into the tube labeled 10-1; add 1.4 mL of MEM to obtain 
a final volume of 1.8 mL. 
   
3.  Pipette 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to the 10-1 labeled 
tube containing the neutralizing antisera; mix by vortexing.  
 
4.  Incubate at room temperature for 60 ± 10 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For Test Vaccines containing only the CPI viral fraction, prepare the 10-1 
dilution by mixing 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine with 1.8 mL of MEM 
in a labeled 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube.

3.  Repeat Step 2 to the remaining tubes, transferring 200 µL from the 
previous dilution to the next dilution tube until the tenfold dilution series 
is completed. 
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   On the day of test inoculation, label the Test Plates and inoculate each of 5 
wells/dilution with 200 µL of dilutions 10-6 through 10-3 of each Test Vaccine. In a 
similar manner, identify and inoculate 5 wells/dilution of the CPI Positive Control Virus 
(with dilutions 10-9 through 10-6 for the example in Section 3.3.2). Change tips between 
each unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine and the CPI Positive Control Virus); tip 
changes are not necessary between dilutions in a series if pipetting from the most dilute 
to the most concentrated within that series (e.g., 10-9 through 10-6).

4.4.6   Read the wet Test Plate at 100X magnification on an inverted light 
microscope, and examine CPI-infected vero cells for HAd. 
 
1.  Wells displaying GPRBC adsorbed onto the cell monolayer are 
considered to be positive for CPI.  
 
2.  Record the results as the number of HAd- positive wells versus total 
number of wells examined for each dilution of the Test Vaccine and the 
CPI Positive Control Virus. 
 
4.5   Calculate the CPI Virus endpoints of the Test Vaccine and the CPI Positive 
Control Virus using the Spearman-Kärber method as modified by Finney. The titers are 
expressed as log10 50% HAd infective doses (HAdID50). 
 
Example: 
 
10-3 dilution of Test Vaccine = 5/5 wells HAd positive 
10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 4/5 wells HAd positive 
10-5 dilution of Test Vaccine = 1/5 wells HAd positive 
10-6 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/5 wells HAd positive 
 
Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (X - d/2 + [d • S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells HAd positive (3)  
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) 
S =

 positive 
 
Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (X - d/2 + [d • S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells HAd positive (3)  
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1) 
S = sum of proportions of wells HAd positive for all dilutions tested: 
 
5     4    1     0    10  
5 +  5  + 5  + 5 =  5 = 2.0 
 
CPI Test Vaccine titer = (3 -  1/2) + (1 • 2.0) = 4.5 
 
Adjust the titer to the recommended Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A.  divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose where: 
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for 
this CPI vaccine, the recommended dose is 1 mL)

Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test vaccine added to each well of 
the Test Plate (for this test CPI vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.2 mL)

ulation Dose = amount of diluted Test vaccine added to each well of 
the Test Plate (for this test CPI vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.2 mL) 
 
                      ___1 mL dose       
                       0.2 mL inoculum = 5 
 
B.  calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine titer as illustrated 
below: 
 
                       Log of 5 = 0.7 
 
CPI Test Vaccine titer = 4.5 + 0.7 = 5.2 
                         
Therefore, the titer of the CPI Test Vaccine is 105.2 HAdID50/mL. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Validity requirements 
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the CPI Positive Control Virus must fall within plus 
or minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers. 
 
5.1.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CPI Positive Control Virus must 
exhibit a 100% positive HAd reaction (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or 
more wells are HAd positive wells at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as 
“greater than

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 titers. 
 
5.1.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the CPI Positive Control Virus must 
exhibit a 100% positive HAd reaction (5/5). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or 
more wells are HAd positive wells at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as 
“greater than or equal to” the calculated titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, 
the highest (most dilute) must exhibit no positive HAd reaction (0/5). 
 
5.1.3   The Negative Cell Controls shall not exhibit degradation, HAd, or cloudy 
media indicative of contamination. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, the assay is considered a NO TEST and 
can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater than or equal to the titer 
contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) filed Outline of 
Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is considered SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.4   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is less than the titer contained in the 
APHIS filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine may be 
retested in accordance with 9 CFR 113.8.
