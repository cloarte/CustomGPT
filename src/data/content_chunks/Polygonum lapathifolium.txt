 Invasion: P. lapathifoliumis a branched, erect, herbaceous, annual plant growing to 100 cm but rarely exceeding 50 cm. The species is very plastic phenotypically especially in flower colour and pubescence (Tutin et al., 1964;Stace, 1991). The cotyledons are slender, length three times the width, usually with a reddish hypocotyl. The stems are swollen above the nodes and usually green, distinguishing the species from the closely relatedP. persicariawhose stems are purple. The leaf stipules or ochreae are fused into a tube, truncate with only the uppermost very shortly fringed. The leaves are alternate, 5-20 cm long, with a short petiole and sunken pellucid resinous glands on the underside. Leaf shape is elliptical-lanceolate with regularly arranged hairs projecting from the margin

ariawhose stems are purple. The leaf stipules or ochreae are fused into a tube, truncate with only the uppermost very shortly fringed. The leaves are alternate, 5-20 cm long, with a short petiole and sunken pellucid resinous glands on the underside. Leaf shape is elliptical-lanceolate with regularly arranged hairs projecting from the margin, and sometimes woolly beneath, but coarsely hairy on the midrib, which often has black blotches. The flowers are greenish-white, rarely pink, with sparsely glandular perianth segments and peduncles. The inflorescences are erect cylindrical, terminal or axillary. Seeds are 2.5-3 mm, shiny, flattened, biconcave and triangular in section.

 Habitat: No encontrado
 Reproduccion: P. lapathifolium has a pronounced weedy habit and spreads entirely by seed. It produces 800-850 seeds per plant which, in common with other species of Polygonum , germinate mainly in the spring. A study in Japan ( Watanabe, 1978 ) has shown that seeds of P. lapathifolium have a chilling requirement to break dormancy, with an optimum temperature of 1-5°C. Seed longevity is variable. Klemm (1988) has shown that P. lapathifolium seeds germinated at a rate of 10% after 10-11 years storage, while those stored for 6 years were 90% viable. However, in a controlled experiment Japan in which 200 seeds were mixed with sterilized soil, buried in plastic cylinders and recovered periodically for 4 years to determine viability, seeds of P. lapathifolium showed over 10% emergence after 2 years but mostly lost viability after 4 years ( Takabayashi and Nakayama, 1978 ).

In common with P. persicaria, P. lapathifolium can maintain a high photosynthetic performance in a variety of moisture and nutrient environments ( Sultan et al., 1998a ), but it is less tolerant of shade, particularly early in the growth season ( Sultan et al., 1998b ). It is, therefore, more limited in scope than P. persicaria , but potentially a problem weed in any spring sown temperate crop especially when it emerges with or before the crop. A move away from traditional seedbed preparation to zero cultivation (no tillage) to achieve earlier sowing will encourage P. lapathifolium . Elmore and Heatherly (1983) compared sowing soyabeans in stale and conventional seedbeds for 2 years at two locations in the Mississippi River alluvial plain and demonstrated that the absence of pre-plant tillage led to the presence of early summer germinating annuals, including P. lapathifolium .
