 Invasion: Hemp is an annual herb and can grow to 1–5 m tall.The seeds (achenes) are round to nearly lens-shaped, with a round base, surface green-brown to grey, marbled or unmarbled, with or without an abscission layer at the base, ranging in size from 1.5 to 4 mm long.Young seedlings produce a pair of cotyledons, which are fleshy, somewhat oval (narrowed at the sessile base), with an entire margin. Cotyledons are followed by the first pair of true leaves, which are coarsely serrate, long, lanceolate, with a dark green upper surface and whitish-green lower surface.During the early vegetative stage, seedlings form up to five true leaf pairs, oppositely arranged, with short internodes. The first true leaves are single leaflets, thereafter, leaves become palmately compound. The second leaf pair consist of three leaflets per leaf, the third leaf pair has five leaflets per leaf, and so on, up to eleven leaflets per leaf.Later in the vegetative stage, stem elongation accelerates and internode distance increases. The stem normally does not branch, it is often hollow at maturity, its surface is generally ridged or fluted, and covered with a fine scabrous layer of cystolith trichomes. The root system is vigorous and centred by a taproot, with laterals.Flowering stage begins with a change in phyllotaxis, from opposite to alternate, and stalk elongation is reduced. Plants are quite aromatic by this stage. Most plants are dioecious, although monoecious hemp cultivars have been bred in Europe. In a

stolith trichomes. The root system is vigorous and centred by a taproot, with laterals.Flowering stage begins with a change in phyllotaxis, from opposite to alternate, and stalk elongation is reduced. Plants are quite aromatic by this stage. Most plants are dioecious, although monoecious hemp cultivars have been bred in Europe. In a dioecious crop, male and female plants are usually present in more or less similar numbers. Male plants die 3-5 weeks earlier than female plants.Early flower primordia appear at the base of petioles. Male primordia appear first. They have a curved claw shape, which grows into a pointed cone consisting of five fused tepals. Male (staminate) inflorescences are loosely branched cymose panicles. Tepals open and five anthers hang from flaccid filaments. Pollen grains are nearly spherical, smooth, 25-30 µm diameter, and light yellow. The female (pistillate) flowers are both axillary and terminal, the inflorescence tend to branch less and grow more compact and leafy. Leaves and bracts are often densely covered with resinous glandular hairs. Female flowers are inconspicuous - a pair of small, white styles emerging from each perigonal bract, they have one single-ovulate ovary. The fruit is a greyish-brown, shining achene, variously marked or plain, tightly embracing the seed. The fruit is ellipsoid 2-6 mm long and 2-4 mm in diameterAfter pollination, the styles of pistillate flowers atrophy and necrose, while the bract swells. The perianth is papery, continuous, and closely appressed to the ovary. The perianth persists on the surface of the single seed (achene).Hemp fib

The perianth is papery, continuous, and closely appressed to the ovary. The perianth persists on the surface of the single seed (achene).Hemp fibres are bast or phloem cells, only 10 µm wide, but up to 7.5 cm long. The fibres overlap in bundles containing from 10-40 cells per bundle. Fibre bundles often run the entire length of plants. Approximately 25 bundles lie around stems, embedded in a ring of phloem parenchyma.The morphological descriptions of the 'biotypes' presented below are adapted from work bySchultes et al.

 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: C. sativa is an annual herb, and the seed germinates 3-7 days after absorbing water. Early vegetative growth is often slow, but later growth may be quite rapid. Generally, canopy closure (when leaves of adjacent plants mesh together and shade the soil) occurs when fibre crops are approximately 50 cm in height. Duke (1985) determined that optimal growth of C. sativa occurs at 14.3°C. It has a growth period of 2-10 months, which is dependent on the latitude. C. sativa has an extensive root system, and is able to tolerate dry conditions, although it does not thrive. C. sativa also grows poorly in wetlands or saturated soil. Duke (1985) found that C. sativa has optimum growth in areas receiving an annual rainfall of 970 mm. C. sativa grows well in bright sunlight. McPartland et al. (2000) describes good plant growth at 14,000-18,000 lx, or 215 W/m. It flowers in the autumn, when the photoperiod drops below 12-13 hours per day, depending on the variety and location. C. sativa tolerates UV radiation, and under high UV-B conditions the production of THC is enhanced ( Lydon et al., 1987 ).

C. sativa tolerates UV radiation, and under high UV-B conditions the production of THC is enhanced ( Lydon et al., 1987 ). C. sativa grows from sea level to 3700 m in altitude, and from the equator to approximately 63° latitude (such as in Finland). Fibre hemp cultivars grow well at 40-55° latitude, and they perform poorly in semi-tropical and tropical latitudes. However, drug varieties were bred in semitropical and tropical locations, and have poor growth at high latitudes (above 45°), because frost often kills the plants before flowering. C. sativa grows well in nutrient rich, well drained, well structured, silty loam soil with high organic matter. The plant is a nitrophile and requires much nutrients. Fibre crops require high levels of nitrogen and potassium, and in descending order of importance calcium, phosphorous and magnesium. However, seed crops extract less potassium and more phosphorous from the soil, and drug crops have a high demand for phosphorus ( Frank and Rosenthal, 1978 ). Duke (1985) suggests that a soil pH of 6.5 is optimal.
