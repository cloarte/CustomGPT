 Courtney and Howell, 1952 ). At maturity these galls contain anhydrobiotic second-stage juveniles, also known as ‘dauer’ juveniles (DJ2), which are the survival and dispersal stage of this nematode. In dry galls, these DJ2s can remain viable for up to 10 years ( Southey, 1973 ). They are up to six-fold more resistant to the detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate than freshly hatched juveniles or adult males and two-fold more resistant to the anaesthetic phenoxypropanol. The resistance of the DJ2 in the laboratory suggests that it may also be more resistant than other stages to other types of environmental stress in its natural habitat ( Riddle and Bird, 1985b ). DJ2 of A. agrostis , from rye grass galls, moved further and faster than freshly hatched juveniles ( Bird and Riddle, 1984 ). DJ2 of A. agrostis are able to withstand repeated dehydration and rehydration ( Preston and Bird, 1987 ). Anguina agrostis -infested inflorescences land on the ground and, with rains, the nematodes rehydrate and regain activity as moisture is absorbed through the gall wall. After a sufficient period of soil surface moisture, the mucoprotein in which the juveniles are embedded swells causing the walls of the gall to rupture and expulsion of the juvenile mass ( Collis-George and Blake, 1959 ). The conditions for optimum germination of host grass seedlings coincides with those favouring expulsion of juveniles from galls and their movement. On a moist soil surface, the J2 will actively seek a host plant to invade ( Riley and McKay, 1991a ), possibly assisted by rain. The J2 congregate at the meristem of infested tillers and wait for ovary initiation before forming a gall by invading the ovary and modifying its development.

. On a moist soil surface, the J2 will actively seek a host plant to invade ( Riley and McKay, 1991a ), possibly assisted by rain. The J2 congregate at the meristem of infested tillers and wait for ovary initiation before forming a gall by invading the ovary and modifying its development. Within the gall, the J2 feeds and moults through two more juvenile stages (third stage juvenile or J3 and fourth-stage juvenile or J4) to adults (females and males). From the third (second parasitic juvenile or PJ2) moult onwards, there was greater variability in the size of the female nematodes than in the males and sexual dimorphism became very pronounced. The transition from the DJ2 to the second-stage parasitic juvenile (PJ2) is marked by the disappearance of the numerous lipid storage granules which are characteristic of the DJ2, and the development in the PJ2 of an intestine which becomes more pronounced in each succeeding stage, particularly in the adult female. In A. agrostis the DJ2 has the thickest cuticle of all stages, including adults. Fourth-stage juveniles and adult males have thicker cuticles than the females at the same stages of development. Moulting appears to involve resorption of the innermost basal zone of the shed cuticle as well as morphological and chemical changes to the epicuticle ( Bird and Stynes, 1981c ). A gall of A. agrostis may be occupied by a few to 20 adults where sexual reproduction results in several hundred eggs per gall ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ). The nematodes develop to J2 in the eggs, which hatch in the gall. These freshly hatched J2 cannot survive desiccation, but mature physiologically to become the survival stage (DJ2), as the host dies and desiccates in the spring or early autumn ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ).

 hundred eggs per gall ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ). The nematodes develop to J2 in the eggs, which hatch in the gall. These freshly hatched J2 cannot survive desiccation, but mature physiologically to become the survival stage (DJ2), as the host dies and desiccates in the spring or early autumn ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ). Egg development, from laying to hatching, of two widely separated populations of A. agrostis (from Western and South Australia), was followed over a range of temperatures. Development rates for these two populations were identical, with a thermal optimum between 18 and 20°C. The minimum time recorded for embryogenesis to hatching was 9-10 days. Embryogenesis was inhibited by temperatures of 27°C and above and hatching by temperatures greater than 23°C. No significant differences were detected in the dimensions of eggs from either population. These eggs have an average length of 95 µm and an average width of 38 µm ( Bird and Stynes, 1981a ). In the Pacific Northwest USA, the life cycle of A. agrostis was completed in 3-4 weeks. There is one generation per year ( Courtney and Howell, 1952 ; Apt et al., 1960 ). In Australia, the number of second-stage dauer juveniles of A. agrostis from 15 one-year-old nematode galls from Lolium rigidum was between 550 and 2746, of these the percentage of dead nematodes per gall was only 5.1 to 8.3% ( Bird, 1985 ). Physiological changes involved in the transition from freshly hatched to ‘dauer’ juveniles included a marked increase in swimming activity and the ability to enter into an anhydrobiotic state. Growth from the freshly hatched to the 'dauer' juvenile took 9 days at 20°C in Lolium multiflorum callus tissue culture in which no moulting occurred and

Growth from the freshly hatched to the 'dauer' juvenile took 9 days at 20°C in Lolium multiflorum callus tissue culture in which no moulting occurred and there was no further growth beyond the 'dauer' juvenile stage ( Bird and Stynes, 1981b ). Anguina funesta in L. rigidum , together with the toxigenic actinomycete, Rathayibacter toxicus , causes annual ryegrass toxicity (ARGT), an ongoing concern for livestock production and oaten hay exports in South and Western Australia ( Riley and Barbetti, 2008 ). Corynetoxins, toxic glycolipids produced by R. toxicus colonizing galls induced by A. agrostis in L. rigidum , did not affect embryogenesis or juvenile development of A. agrostis although they did inhibit the rate of egg hatching. In former Czechoslovakia during 1981-1982, the development of A. agrostis on Trisetum flavescens from J2 to sexual maturity to the subsequent J2 generation took 21 days, from mid-May to late June ( Vargova and Sabova, 1985 ). The development of galls induced in the inflorescences of L. rigidum by A. agrostis was observed using light and electron microscopy. The galls, which grew rapidly as the nematodes developed, consisted of a wall several cell layers deep, surrounding a central cavity. Cells adjacent to the cavity were modified, whereas those at the surface were unchanged ( Stynes and Bird, 1982 ). Host test experiments showed that the T. flavescens population of the nematode attacked only T. flavescens , forming galls. It caused changes in the

Cells adjacent to the cavity were modified, whereas those at the surface were unchanged ( Stynes and Bird, 1982 ). Host test experiments showed that the T. flavescens population of the nematode attacked only T. flavescens , forming galls. It caused changes in the morphology of the vegetative organs and a cecidogenic transformation of the ovary within the florets. The Phleum boehmeri population attacked P. boehmeri and Phleum pratense , causing flower galls, cyst-like coalescences of the glumes around the ovary, which were less well developed in P. pratense . The number of juveniles in P. boehmeri ranged from 1757 to 3022 and in P. pratense from 0 to 986 ( Klumpar, 1986 ). Anguina agrostis , Rotylenchulus reniformis and Meloidogyne javanica responded differently to gradients of chemical attractants. In chemotaxis assays performed on agarose plates, R. reniformis J2 oriented their movement to several common inorganic salts, cyclic AMP and AMP, as well as to germinated host plant seeds. M. javanica J2 were attracted to germinated seeds, but not to the salts tested; and A. agrostis dauer juveniles were not strongly attracted to any of the 12 different tested agents, including host root or shoot tips ( Riddle and Bird, 1985a ). Dauer juveniles of A. agrostis were not attracted to R. toxicus (from bacterial galls), but on contact, the bacteria attached to the nematode cuticle surface, penetrated it and had a pathological effect on the epicuticle and cortical zone ( Bird and Riddle, 1984 ).

Dauer juveniles of A. agrostis were not attracted to R. toxicus (from bacterial galls), but on contact, the bacteria attached to the nematode cuticle surface, penetrated it and had a pathological effect on the epicuticle and cortical zone ( Bird and Riddle, 1984 ). The bacteria ( R. toxicus ) are carried on the cuticle surface of the nematodes. The cuticle surfaces of taxonomically widely divergent species of nematodes have been shown to be covered by a surface coat (glycocalyx) that contains carbohydrate. This surface coat is not considered to be part of the nematode cuticle but to be secreted by the nematode onto its surface. The relationship of A. agrostis and Anguina pacificae [ Anguina agropyri ] with bacteria is opportunistic in that if the appropriate bacteria share the nematode community, the characteristic disease appears. In the absence of that particular bacterial species other bacterial species in the nematode niche can be substituted; however, the relationship is benign. Wen and Viglierchio (1992) suggested that although specificity in partners was required for a specific disease to emerge, the nematode might develop intimate relationships with a range of non-threatening bacteria and this might also explain why the 'sheep staggers' disease so serious to livestock in Australia was not so in the Pacific Northwest States of the USA, which harboured the same nematode. A study of the ecology of ryegrass pasture ants showed that ants were unselective harvesters of seeds, nematode galls and bacterial galls. Most seeds were stored around nest entrances, although some were retained beneath the soil. Certain species were more prone to store seeds than others ( Twigg et al., 1982 ).

 Sintomas: Anguina agrostis causes no obvious symptoms on grass shoots except that of the inflorescence which is so distorted that the parasitized plants were once described as a new species, Agrostis sylvatica [ Agrostis capillaris ]. Symptoms of the inflorescence include pronounced lengthening of glumes and paleae, reaching two to three times normal length, and elongated flower galls which are modified ovaries that look greenish or purple and may be 4-5 mm long. Lodicules, stamens and sometimes other flower parts are suppressed in such parasitized flowers ( Goodey, 1930 ). Adult nematodes (1-3 females, 1-3 males) are found within these galls. Later, the females lay eggs and die, the eggs hatch and the second-stage juveniles fill the gall which then turns into a seed gall. Seed galls containing the nematodes are dark brown. They may look similar to normal seeds but are lighter and hence can be separated mechanically from them.

 Courtney and Howell, 1952 ). At maturity these galls contain anhydrobiotic second-stage juveniles, also known as ‘dauer’ juveniles (DJ2), which are the survival and dispersal stage of this nematode. In dry galls, these DJ2s can remain viable for up to 10 years ( Southey, 1973 ). They are up to six-fold more resistant to the detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate than freshly hatched juveniles or adult males and two-fold more resistant to the anaesthetic phenoxypropanol. The resistance of the DJ2 in the laboratory suggests that it may also be more resistant than other stages to other types of environmental stress in its natural habitat ( Riddle and Bird, 1985b ). DJ2 of A. agrostis , from rye grass galls, moved further and faster than freshly hatched juveniles ( Bird and Riddle, 1984 ). DJ2 of A. agrostis are able to withstand repeated dehydration and rehydration ( Preston and Bird, 1987 ). Anguina agrostis -infested inflorescences land on the ground and, with rains, the nematodes rehydrate and regain activity as moisture is absorbed through the gall wall. After a sufficient period of soil surface moisture, the mucoprotein in which the juveniles are embedded swells causing the walls of the gall to rupture and expulsion of the juvenile mass ( Collis-George and Blake, 1959 ). The conditions for optimum germination of host grass seedlings coincides with those favouring expulsion of juveniles from galls and their movement. On a moist soil surface, the J2 will actively seek a host plant to invade ( Riley and McKay, 1991a ), possibly assisted by rain. The J2 congregate at the meristem of infested tillers and wait for ovary initiation before forming a gall by invading the ovary and modifying its development.

. On a moist soil surface, the J2 will actively seek a host plant to invade ( Riley and McKay, 1991a ), possibly assisted by rain. The J2 congregate at the meristem of infested tillers and wait for ovary initiation before forming a gall by invading the ovary and modifying its development. Within the gall, the J2 feeds and moults through two more juvenile stages (third stage juvenile or J3 and fourth-stage juvenile or J4) to adults (females and males). From the third (second parasitic juvenile or PJ2) moult onwards, there was greater variability in the size of the female nematodes than in the males and sexual dimorphism became very pronounced. The transition from the DJ2 to the second-stage parasitic juvenile (PJ2) is marked by the disappearance of the numerous lipid storage granules which are characteristic of the DJ2, and the development in the PJ2 of an intestine which becomes more pronounced in each succeeding stage, particularly in the adult female. In A. agrostis the DJ2 has the thickest cuticle of all stages, including adults. Fourth-stage juveniles and adult males have thicker cuticles than the females at the same stages of development. Moulting appears to involve resorption of the innermost basal zone of the shed cuticle as well as morphological and chemical changes to the epicuticle ( Bird and Stynes, 1981c ). A gall of A. agrostis may be occupied by a few to 20 adults where sexual reproduction results in several hundred eggs per gall ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ). The nematodes develop to J2 in the eggs, which hatch in the gall. These freshly hatched J2 cannot survive desiccation, but mature physiologically to become the survival stage (DJ2), as the host dies and desiccates in the spring or early autumn ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ). Egg development

 hundred eggs per gall ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ). The nematodes develop to J2 in the eggs, which hatch in the gall. These freshly hatched J2 cannot survive desiccation, but mature physiologically to become the survival stage (DJ2), as the host dies and desiccates in the spring or early autumn ( Riley and Bertozzi, 2004 ). Egg development, from laying to hatching, of two widely separated populations of A. agrostis (from Western and South Australia), was followed over a range of temperatures. Development rates for these two populations were identical, with a thermal optimum between 18 and 20°C. The minimum time recorded for embryogenesis to hatching was 9-10 days. Embryogenesis was inhibited by temperatures of 27°C and above and hatching by temperatures greater than 23°C. No significant differences were detected in the dimensions of eggs from either population. These eggs have an average length of 95 µm and an average width of 38 µm ( Bird and Stynes, 1981a ). In the Pacific Northwest USA, the life cycle of A. agrostis was completed in 3-4 weeks. There is one generation per year ( Courtney and Howell, 1952 ; Apt et al., 1960 ). In Australia, the number of second-stage dauer juveniles of A. agrostis from 15 one-year-old nematode galls from Lolium rigidum was between 550 and 2746, of these the percentage of dead nematodes per gall was only 5.1 to 8.3% ( Bird, 1985 ). Physiological changes involved in the transition from freshly hatched to ‘dauer’ juveniles included a marked increase in swimming activity and the ability to enter into an anhydrobiotic state. Growth from the freshly hatched to the 'dauer' juvenile took 9 days at 20°C in Lolium multiflorum callus tissue culture in which no moulting occurred and

Growth from the freshly hatched to the 'dauer' juvenile took 9 days at 20°C in Lolium multiflorum callus tissue culture in which no moulting occurred and there was no further growth beyond the 'dauer' juvenile stage ( Bird and Stynes, 1981b ). Anguina funesta in L. rigidum , together with the toxigenic actinomycete, Rathayibacter toxicus , causes annual ryegrass toxicity (ARGT), an ongoing concern for livestock production and oaten hay exports in South and Western Australia ( Riley and Barbetti, 2008 ). Corynetoxins, toxic glycolipids produced by R. toxicus colonizing galls induced by A. agrostis in L. rigidum , did not affect embryogenesis or juvenile development of A. agrostis although they did inhibit the rate of egg hatching. In former Czechoslovakia during 1981-1982, the development of A. agrostis on Trisetum flavescens from J2 to sexual maturity to the subsequent J2 generation took 21 days, from mid-May to late June ( Vargova and Sabova, 1985 ). The development of galls induced in the inflorescences of L. rigidum by A. agrostis was observed using light and electron microscopy. The galls, which grew rapidly as the nematodes developed, consisted of a wall several cell layers deep, surrounding a central cavity. Cells adjacent to the cavity were modified, whereas those at the surface were unchanged ( Stynes and Bird, 1982 ).

Host test experiments showed that the T. flavescens population of the nematode attacked only T. flavescens , forming galls. It caused changes in the morphology of the vegetative organs and a cecidogenic transformation of the ovary within the florets. The Phleum boehmeri population attacked P. boehmeri and Phleum pratense , causing flower galls, cyst-like coalescences of the glumes around the ovary, which were less well developed in P. pratense . The number of juveniles in P. boehmeri ranged from 1757 to 3022 and in P. pratense from 0 to 986 ( Klumpar, 1986 ). Anguina agrostis , Rotylenchulus reniformis and Meloidogyne javanica responded differently to gradients of chemical attractants. In chemotaxis assays performed on agarose plates, R. reniformis J2 oriented their movement to several common inorganic salts, cyclic AMP and AMP, as well as to germinated host plant seeds. M. javanica J2 were attracted to germinated seeds, but not to the salts tested; and A. agrostis dauer juveniles were not strongly attracted to any of the 12 different tested agents, including host root or shoot tips ( Riddle and Bird, 1985a ). Dauer juveniles of A. agrostis were not attracted to R. toxicus (from bacterial galls), but on contact, the bacteria attached to the nematode cuticle surface, penetrated it and had a pathological effect on the epicuticle and cortical zone ( Bird and Riddle, 1984 ).

Dauer juveniles of A. agrostis were not attracted to R. toxicus (from bacterial galls), but on contact, the bacteria attached to the nematode cuticle surface, penetrated it and had a pathological effect on the epicuticle and cortical zone ( Bird and Riddle, 1984 ). The bacteria ( R. toxicus ) are carried on the cuticle surface of the nematodes. The cuticle surfaces of taxonomically widely divergent species of nematodes have been shown to be covered by a surface coat (glycocalyx) that contains carbohydrate. This surface coat is not considered to be part of the nematode cuticle but to be secreted by the nematode onto its surface. The relationship of A. agrostis and Anguina pacificae [ Anguina agropyri ] with bacteria is opportunistic in that if the appropriate bacteria share the nematode community, the characteristic disease appears. In the absence of that particular bacterial species other bacterial species in the nematode niche can be substituted; however, the relationship is benign. Wen and Viglierchio (1992) suggested that although specificity in partners was required for a specific disease to emerge, the nematode might develop intimate relationships with a range of non-threatening bacteria and this might also explain why the 'sheep staggers' disease so serious to livestock in Australia was not so in the Pacific Northwest States of the USA, which harboured the same nematode. A study of the ecology of ryegrass pasture ants showed that ants were unselective harvesters of seeds, nematode galls and bacterial galls. Most seeds were stored around nest entrances, although some were retained beneath the soil. Certain species were more prone to store seeds than others ( Twigg et al., 1982 ).

 Sintomas: Anguina agrostis causes no obvious symptoms on grass shoots except that of the inflorescence which is so distorted that the parasitized plants were once described as a new species, Agrostis sylvatica [ Agrostis capillaris ]. Symptoms of the inflorescence include pronounced lengthening of glumes and paleae, reaching two to three times normal length, and elongated flower galls which are modified ovaries that look greenish or purple and may be 4-5 mm long. Lodicules, stamens and sometimes other flower parts are suppressed in such parasitized flowers ( Goodey, 1930 ). Adult nematodes (1-3 females, 1-3 males) are found within these galls. Later, the females lay eggs and die, the eggs hatch and the second-stage juveniles fill the gall which then turns into a seed gall. Seed galls containing the nematodes are dark brown. They may look similar to normal seeds but are lighter and hence can be separated mechanically from them.
