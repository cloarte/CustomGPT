3.3.1   Preparation of DKp cell culture plates (Test Plates)  
 
Cells are prepared from healthy, confluent DKp cell cultures at second or third 
passage. On the day of test initiation, using the 12-channel micropipettor, add  
200 µL/well of approximately 104.7 to 105.2 cells/mL suspended in Growth 
Medium into all wells of a 96-well cell culture plate. Prepare 1 Test Plate for the 
controls and 1 Test Vaccine. Each additional Test Plate allows testing of 3 
additional Test Vaccines. Incubate at 36°± 2°C in a CO2 incubator and use within 
4 hours. 
 
3.3.2   Preparation of ICH Virus Positive Control 
 
1.  On the day of test initiation, rapidly thaw a vial of ICH Virus Positive 
Control in a water bath.  
 
2.  Dispense 1.8 mL MEM into enough 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tubes to 
bracket the expected endpoint according to the CVB Reagent Data Sheet, 
and label (e.g., 8 tubes labeled 10-1 through 10-8, respectively). 
 
3.  With a 200-µL pipettor, transfer 200 µL  of the ICH Virus Positive 
Control to the first tube  labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing. 
 
4.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the 10-1-

3.4.2   For multifraction ICH vaccines, neutralize the non-ICH fractions with 
antiserum specific to each virus fraction.  
 
1.  Dispense 200 µL of each of the required neutralizing antiserum into a 
12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube labeled 10-1 and q.s. with MEM to 1.8 mL. 
For example, to neutralize the 3 viral non-ICH Virus components of a 
CDV/ICH/CPI/CPV vaccine, dispense 200 µL of each of the diluted CDV, 
CPI, and CPV antisera into the tube labeled 10-1; add 1.2 mL of MEM to 
obtain a final volume of 1.8 mL. 
 
2.  Pipette 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to the labeled tube to 
yield a 10-1 dilution; mix by vortexing.  
 
3.  Incubate at room temperature for 30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For vaccines containing only the ICH fraction, the 10-1 dilution is prepared 
by adding 200

yield a 10-1 dilution; mix by vortexing.  
 
3.  Incubate at room temperature for 30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For vaccines containing only the ICH fraction, the 10-1 dilution is prepared 
by adding 200 µL of the Test Vaccine to 1.8 mL of MEM in a 12 x 75-mm 
polystyrene tube, labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing.  
 
3.4.4   Serial tenfold dilutions 
 
1.  Dispense 1.8 mL MEM into sufficient 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tubes 
to bracket the expected endpoint according to the CVB Reagent Data 
Sheet; appropriately label (e.g., 8 tubes, labeled 10-1 through 10-8, 
respectively).  
 
2.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the tube labeled 10-1 to 
the next dilution tube labeled 10-2; mix by vortexing. 
 
3.  Repeat Step 2 to the remaining tubes, transferring 200 µL from the 
previous dilution to the next dilution tube until the tenfold dilution series 
is completed. 
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   On the day of test initiation, label the Test Plates and inoculate each of 8 
wells/dilution with 25 µL of the Test Vaccine, starting with the highest dilution (most 
dilute). In a similar manner, inoculate 8 wells of the ICH Virus Positive Control

(dilutions 10-8 through 10-5 for the example in Section 3.3.2[2]). Change tips between 
each unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine and the ICH Virus Positive Control), but tip 
changes are not necessary between each dilution in a series if pipetting from the most 
dilute to the most concentrated within that series (e.g., 10-8 through 10-5).

4.2   Eight uninoculated wells serve as negative cell controls. 
 
4.3   Incubate the inoculated Test Plates in the CO 2 incubator for 11 days ± 1 day. 
 
4.4   After incubation, read at 100X or 200X magnification on an inverted light 
microscope and examine cells for CPE characterized by cell rounding and lysis.

4.4.1   Wells displaying one or more CPE foci are considered to be positive for 
ICH Virus. 
 
4.4.2   Record results as the number of CPE-positive wells versus total number of 
wells examined for each dilution of the Test Vaccine and the ICH Virus Positive 
Control. 
 
4.5   Calculate the ICH endpoints of the Test Vaccine and the ICH Virus Positive 
Control using the Spearman-Kärber method as commonly modified by Finney. The titers 
are expressed as log10, 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50). 
 
Example: 
 
10-2 dilution of Test Vaccine = 8/8 wells CPE positive 
10-3 dilution of Test Vaccine = 5/8 wells CPE positive 
10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 1/8 wells CPE positive 
10-5 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/8 wells CPE positive 
 
Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine Titer = (X - d/2 + [d • S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells CPE positive (2) 
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1)       
S = sum of proportion of wells CPE positive for all dilutions tested: 
 
8     5     1     0     14 
8 +  8 +  8 + 8 =    8 = 1.75

8 +  8 +  8 + 8 =    8 = 1.75 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (2 – 1/2) + (1 • 1.75) = 3.25 
 
Adjust the titer to the Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A. divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose  
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for this 
ICH test vaccine, the recommended dose is 2 mL)

Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine added to each well of the

Test Vaccine titer = 3.25 + 1.9 = 5.15 
 
Therefore the titer of the ICH Test Vaccine is 105.15 TCID50/2mL. 
 
 
5. Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Valid assay  
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the ICH Virus Positive Control must fall within plus 
or minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers. 
 
5.1.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the ICH Virus Positive  Control must 
exhibit a 100% positive CPE reaction (8/8). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or 
more wells are CPE positive wells at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as 
“greater than or equal to” the calculated titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, 
the highest (most dilute) must exhibit no positive CPE reaction (0/8). 
 
5.1.3   The uninoculated cell controls must not exhibit any CPE, degradation, or 
cloudy media that would indicate contamination. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater than or equal to the titer 
contained in the
Text Len: 1304
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cloudy media that would indicate contamination. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater than or equal to the titer 
contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) filed Outline of 
Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is considered SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.4   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is lower than the titer contained in 
the APHIS filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine may 
be retested in accordance with 9 CFR, Part 113.8.b.

3.3   Preparation of reagents/control procedures  
 
3.3.1   Preparation of DKp cell culture plates (Test Plates)  
 
Cells are prepared from healthy, confluent DKp cell cultures at second or third 
passage. On the day of test initiation, using the 12-channel micropipettor, add  
200 µL/well of approximately 104.7 to 105.2 cells/mL suspended in Growth 
Medium into all wells of a 96-well cell culture plate. Prepare 1 Test Plate for the 
controls and 1 Test Vaccine. Each additional Test Plate allows testing of 3 
additional Test Vaccines. Incubate at 36°± 2°C in a CO2 incubator and use within 
4 hours. 
 
3.3.2   Preparation of ICH Virus Positive Control 
 
1.  On the day of test initiation, rapidly thaw a vial of ICH Virus Positive 
Control in a water bath.  
 
2.  Dispense 1.8 mL MEM into enough 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tubes to 
bracket the expected endpoint according to the CVB Reagent Data Sheet, 
and label (e.g., 8 tubes labeled 10-1 through 10-8, respectively). 
 
3.  With a 200-µL pipettor, transfer 200 µL  of the ICH Virus Positive 
Control to the first tube  labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing. 
 
4.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the 10-1-

3.4.2   For multifraction ICH vaccines, neutralize the non-ICH fractions with 
antiserum specific to each virus fraction.  
 
1.  Dispense 200 µL of each of the required neutralizing antiserum into a 
12 x 75-mm polystyrene tube labeled 10-1 and q.s. with MEM to 1.8 mL. 
For example, to neutralize the 3 viral non-ICH Virus components of a 
CDV/ICH/CPI/CPV vaccine, dispense 200 µL of each of the diluted CDV, 
CPI, and CPV antisera into the tube labeled 10-1; add 1.2 mL of MEM to 
obtain a final volume of 1.8 mL. 
 
2.  Pipette 200 µL of the reconstituted Test Vaccine to the labeled tube to 
yield a 10-1 dilution; mix by vortexing.  
 
3.  Incubate at room temperature for 30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For vaccines containing only the ICH fraction, the 10-1 dilution is prepared 
by adding 200

stituted Test Vaccine to the labeled tube to 
yield a 10-1 dilution; mix by vortexing.  
 
3.  Incubate at room temperature for 30 ± 5 minutes. 
 
3.4.3   For vaccines containing only the ICH fraction, the 10-1 dilution is prepared 
by adding 200 µL of the Test Vaccine to 1.8 mL of MEM in a 12 x 75-mm 
polystyrene tube, labeled 10-1; mix by vortexing.  
 
3.4.4   Serial tenfold dilutions 
 
1.  Dispense 1.8 mL MEM into sufficient 12 x 75-mm polystyrene tubes 
to bracket the expected endpoint according to the CVB Reagent Data 
Sheet; appropriately label (e.g., 8 tubes, labeled 10-1 through 10-8, 
respectively).  
 
2.  Using a new pipette tip, transfer 200 µL from the tube labeled 10-1 to 
the next dilution tube labeled 10-2; mix by vortexing. 
 
3.  Repeat Step 2 to the remaining tubes, transferring 200 µL from the 
previous dilution to the next dilution tube until the tenfold dilution series 
is completed. 
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   On the day of test initiation, label the Test Plates and inoculate each of 8 
wells/dilution with 25 µL of the Test Vaccine, starting with the highest dilution (most 
dilute). In a similar manner, inoculate 8 wells of the ICH Virus Positive Control

(dilutions 10-8 through 10-5 for the example in Section 3.3.2[2]). Change tips between 
each unique sample (i.e., each Test Vaccine and the ICH Virus Positive Control), but tip 
changes are not necessary between each dilution in a series if pipetting from the most 
dilute to the most concentrated within that series (e.g., 10-8 through 10-5).

4.2   Eight uninoculated wells serve as negative cell controls. 
 
4.3   Incubate the inoculated Test Plates in the CO 2 incubator for 11 days ± 1 day. 
 
4.4   After incubation, read at 100X or 200X magnification on an inverted light 
microscope and examine cells for CPE characterized by cell rounding and lysis. 
 
4.4.1   Wells displaying one or more CPE foci are considered to be positive for 
ICH Virus.

4.4.1   Wells displaying one or more CPE foci are considered to be positive for 
ICH Virus. 
 
4.4.2   Record results as the number of CPE-positive wells versus total number of 
wells examined for each dilution of the Test Vaccine and the ICH Virus Positive 
Control. 
 
4.5   Calculate the ICH endpoints of the Test Vaccine and the ICH Virus Positive 
Control using the Spearman-Kärber method as commonly modified by Finney. The titers 
are expressed as log10, 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50). 
 
Example: 
 
10-2 dilution of Test Vaccine = 8/8 wells CPE positive 
10-3 dilution of Test Vaccine = 5/8 wells CPE positive 
10-4 dilution of Test Vaccine = 1/8 wells CPE positive 
10-5 dilution of Test Vaccine = 0/8 wells CPE positive 
 
Spearman-Kärber formula: 
 
Test Vaccine Titer = (X - d/2 + [d • S]) where: 
 
X = log10 of highest dilution with all wells CPE positive (2) 
d = log10 of tenfold dilution factor (1)       
S = sum of proportion of wells CPE positive for all dilutions tested: 
 
8     5     1     0     14 
8 +  8 +  8 + 8 =    8 = 1.75

8 +  8 +  8 + 8 =    8 = 1.75 
 
Test Vaccine titer = (2 – 1/2) + (1 • 1.75) = 3.25 
 
Adjust the titer to the Test Vaccine dose as follows: 
 
A. divide the Test Vaccine Dose by the Inoculation Dose  
 
Test Vaccine Dose = manufacturer’s recommended vaccination dose (for this 
ICH test vaccine, the recommended dose is 2 mL)

Inoculation Dose = amount of diluted Test Vaccine added to each well of the 
Test Plate (for this ICH test vaccine, the inoculation dose is 0.025 mL)

B. calculate log10 of value in A and add it to the Test Vaccine titer as illustrated

below: 
 
Log of 80 = 1.9 
 
Test Vaccine titer = 3.25 + 1.9 = 5.15 
 
Therefore the titer of the ICH Test Vaccine is 105.15 TCID50/2mL. 
 
 
5. Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1   Valid assay  
 
5.1.1   The calculated titer of the ICH Virus Positive Control must fall within plus 
or minus 2 standard deviations (± 2 SD) of its mean titer, as established from a 
minimum of 10 previously determined titers. 
 
5.1.2   The lowest inoculated dilution of the ICH Virus Positive  Control must 
exhibit a 100% positive CPE reaction (8/8). If an endpoint is not reached (1 or 
more wells are CPE positive wells at the highest dilution), the titer is expressed as 
“greater than or equal to” the calculated titer. If an endpoint is critical to testing, 
the highest (most dilute) must exhibit no positive CPE reaction (0/8). 
 
5.1.3   The uninoculated cell controls must not exhibit any CPE, degradation, or 
cloudy media that would indicate contamination. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater than or equal to the titer 
contained in the
Text Len: 1304
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cloudy media that would indicate contamination. 
 
5.2   If the validity requirements are not met, then the assay is considered a NO TEST 
and can be retested without prejudice. 
 
5.3   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is greater than or equal to the titer 
contained in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) filed Outline of 
Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine is considered SATISFACTORY. 
 
5.4   In a valid test, if the titer of the Test Vaccine is lower than the titer contained in 
the APHIS filed Outline of Production for the product under test, the Test Vaccine may 
be retested in accordance with 9 CFR, Part 113.8.b.
