 Reproduccion: C. falcatum has a chromosome number of 2n=82 ( Lu et al., 2006 ), although naturalizing populations are reported to be apogamous triploids with a chromosome number of 2n=123 ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2015 ; Weakley, 2015 ). Three cytotypes have been identified in the species, including sexual diploid, apogamous triploid and sexual tetraploid ( Matsumoto, 2003a ; Lu et al., 2006 ; Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2015 ). C. falcatum is a homosporous fern ( Chung and Chung, 2013 ). Populations that have naturalized are apogamous triploids. Being apogamous means that these plants can avoid the sexual process in the gametophyte stage so sporophytes arise more efficiently, allowing for easier colonization of new sites ( Robinson, 2009 ). C. falcatum produces spores from spring to autumn ( Diggs and George, 2006 ). It is moderately tolerant of arsenic ( Sridokchan et al., 2005 ). In Korea, the roots of C. falcatum were reported to be colonized by a mycorrhizal fungus with constricted hyphae, similar to those of Rhizoctonia s pp. that colonize orchid roots ( Lee et al., 2001 ). C. falcatum generally requires moist or shaded conditions for establishment, such as stream banks, shaded walls, waterfalls and ravines, and is sensitive to colder temperatures. In studies of phenology and wintering capacity, Toshiyuki (1982) found gametophytes resistant to temperatures of -30°C, and sporophytes to -15°C. Gametophytes survived well in a region where temperatures of -30°C can occur. They also found that gametophytes could

Gametophytes survived well in a region where temperatures of -30°C can occur. They also found that gametophytes could survive independently of sporophytes under some conditions.
