1. Reagent Name: Leptospira canicola Master Reference Bacterin 
2. Strain or Source: Lot 0367A00701 (Hond Utrecht Strain) 
3. Lot Number: IRP 699 
4. Fill Date: March 5, 2024 
5. Expiration Date: April 30,2029 
Precautions: Caution – contains Thimerosal at 0.00042% 
6. Intended Use: To be used as a reference bacterin in accordance with SAM 625 
(Supplemental Assay Method for in vitro Potency Testing of Leptospira interrogans Serogroup 
canicola Bacterins). CAUTION: This reference is to be used for canine, swine, and bovine 
vaccines as approved in Outlines of Production. 
7. Instructions for Use: Make an initial dilution of 1:10 (1.0 mL bacterin + 9.0 mL 0.85% 
NaCl solution of 0.01M phosphate buffered saline). Adjust final dilution (using 0.85% NaCl 
solution or phosphate buffered saline) based on host animal dosage per the following table. This 
dilution is used as the Working Reference bacterin for ELISA testing. The final dilution is 
considered as UNDILUTED when entering data into the software to estimate relative potency.
