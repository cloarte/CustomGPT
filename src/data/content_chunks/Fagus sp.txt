Beech nuts
Fagaceae:
Fagus
sp.
American beech:
F. grandifolia
Ehrh
European beech:
F. sylvatica
L.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
The seeds of these beech species are sometimes gathered from nativetrees, or from trees planted for other purposes, and used as food. The seedsare formed in prickly burrs, about 0.75 to 1 inch in diameter, which remainclosed until ripe, then partially open. The angular seeds or nuts are up to0.75 inch long. The seed coat must be removed from the kernel before eating. In general, beech nuts are similar to small chestnuts. The trees are notcultivated for the purpose of nut production.
