Home Share Close AIDmonitor AIDmonitor gathers information from diverse databases to help users analyze Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows with a focus on Food Security, Nutrition, Agriculture and Rural Development, determine priorities for assistance and formulate resource mobilization strategies. With AIDmonitor you can: elaborate raw ODA dataset into a variety of graphs, charts and diagrams; identify common priorities amongst various players; create unique reports for resource mobilization and market intelligence purposes. Dataset enables analysis on: where aid goes; what purposes it serves; what policies it aims to implement, on a comparable basis for all DAC members. Data are collected on individual projects and programmes.

Climate-related development finance dataset This dataset uses the climate-related development finance database of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC). AidMonitor allows the quantitative analysis of this climate-related data to track climate finance allocations across developed and developing countries, as well as across and within economic sectors and to identify climate finance trends in the agriculture and land use sector at global and regional scale.

Publications Climate-related development finance to agrifood systems - global and regional trends between 2000 and 2021 2023 This publication addresses the persistent knowledge gap related to climate finance to agrifood systems, providing data and information to support countries making informed decisions towards agrifood systems transformation. The analysis brings to light the evolution of climate finance in agrifood systems over the past two decades, showcasing unique sectorial analysis of climate finance allocations for adaptation and mitigation. Additional resources Annual Funding Overview The Annual Report for 2020, 2021 and 2022 raises the visibility of the Organization's Resource Partners, including FAO Members, international financial institutions (IFIs), United Nations entities, vertical funds and private sector partners. Monthly Funding Overview A new Monthly Funding Overview provides regular and more detailed updates on FAO’s Resource Partners, presenting a wide spectrum of analytical information through an engaging and interactive interface. AIDmonitor takes into account only commitments, without including negative (aggregate) re-allocations to the donor country. This might generate a discrepancy with the ODA CRS on the total value for donor, without influencing any other result.
