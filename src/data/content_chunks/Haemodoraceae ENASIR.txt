Haemodoraceae E.NASIR National Herbarium, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, Islamabad. Plants perennial, herbaceous. Root-stock short or elongated with adventitious roots; tubiferous or without tubers. Leaves linear to narrowly lanceolate, usually radical. Sap often orange coloured. Scape leafless or leafy with bisexual flowers in terminal racemes or spikes. Perianth segments 6; stamens 6; ovary semi-inferior or superior, 3-locular with 1 or more ovules in each locule; fruit dehiscent or in-dehiscent. A small family represented in Pakistan by 3 genera and 4 species. Many modern authors include these in Liliaceae, but because of their general habit and the resemblance they show with the others members of the group, they have been described under Haemodoraceae.

Hedge for his helpful suggestions. 1 Ovary half inferior; locules many ovuled. Perianth lobes short, recurved. Filaments short at the bases of the perianth lobes 1 Aletris + Ovary superior or half inferior; locules 2-ovuled. Perianth segments long, spreading. Filaments arising at the bases of the perianth segments (2) 2 (1) Ovary superior. Anthers shorter than the filaments. Flowers erect. Perianth spreading from the base of the ovary 2 Liriope + Ovary half inferior. Anthers longer than the filaments. Flowers drooping or erect.
