 Invasion: Tridax procumbensis a semi-prostrate or procumbent herb 30-60 cm tall with a firm taproot. The branches are ascending, brittle, 20-75 cm long, green or purplish, and with long white hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to ovate-lanceolate, 2-6 x 1.5-4.5 cm, coarsely toothed, herbaceous or somewhat succulent, with the midrib strongly prominent below. The flower heads are terminal, about 1.5-2 cm diam., and situated on long peduncles 20-40 cm long. The outer involucral bracts are foliaceous and green, whereas the inner ones are membraneous and purplish. The ray flowers are few (5-6), female, with a 3-4 lobed, pale yellow or white corolla. The disc flowers are numerous, bisexual, with a 5-lobed yellow corolla. The achenes are angular, dark brown to black, densely white long-hairy, 1.

 Reproduccion: Genetics The basic chromosome number in Tridax is n=9, 10, and the chromosome count for T. procumbens is 2n=36. It has been suggested that this species is an ancient allotetraploid of hybrid origin between T. mexicana and T. purpusii ( Powell, 1965 ). Reproductive Biology Tridax procumbens can be either cross- or self-pollinated ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Pollinators include butterflies, bees, flies and thrips ( Ananthakakrishnan et al., 1981 ; Balasubramanian, 1989 ; Varalakshmi et al., 2012 ).

A single disc floret produces about 0.2 μL of sucrose-rich nectar with a 20% sugar concentration and high aminoacid content, which is common for Lepidoptera-pollinated plants ( Varalakshmi et al., 2012 ). Single plants can produce 500 to 2500 seeds (achenes), which are wind-dispersed ( Pancho, 1964 ). Germination occurs over a prolonged period and in a variable pattern. Light stimulates germination, but seeds can also germinate in the dark ( Chauhan and Johnson, 2008 ). In Nigeria, Marks and Nwachuku (1986) found that freshly harvested seeds required light for 100% germination but, after 2 months of burial in soil, half germinated in darkness. Ogbonnaya (1988) found the highest germination rate (82%) of T. procumbens for seeds on the soil surface under diffuse light. While seeds can germinate when buried at depths of up to 4 cm in the soil, only 6% of those at 1 cm actually emerged and became established ( Pemadasa and Kangatharalingam, 1977 ). Seeds stored in soil for 2 years gave 7% germination in south Benin ( Lutzeyer and Koch, 1992 ). The pappus on the achene aids water uptake from soil, promoting germination ( Pemadasa and Kangatharalingam, 1977 ). The percentage germination of fresh seed in India was greatest at 30°C and at pH 6 to 8 ( Ramakrishnan and Jain, 1965 ). In Brazil, highest germination percent was reported at 25°C (94%), 30°C (93%) and 35°C (92%).

In Brazil, highest germination percent was reported at 25°C (94%), 30°C (93%) and 35°C (92%). At these temperatures, seeds begin to germinate within 2-4 days. At 15, 20 and 40°C, less than 6% of seeds germinated ( Guimarães et al., 2000 ). Synchronous germination of high densities of seedlings results in intra-specific competition and a reduction in subsequent seedling establishment ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Physiology and Phenology In humid tropical regions, flowering and fruiting occur year-round ( Powell, 1965 ; Pemadasa, 1976 ; Orchard, 2015 ). In the drier Sudano-Sahelian zone, this weed is an annual, flowering from June to October and dying at the end of the rainy season ( Bourgeois and Merlier, 1995 ). In East Africa, flowering occurs 35 to 55 days after emergence, and seeds ripen within 3 weeks of flowering ( Popay and Ivens, 1982 ). In Texas, U.S., and other areas, plants have been reported to grow from a seedling to a mature flowering plant within 3 weeks ( Bourgeois and Merlier, 1995 ; Graves, 2000 ). Dry weight, plant height and leaf area index of T. procumbens are reduced by shade ( Shetty et al., 1982 ). In Nigeria, seedlings attain maximum increments in height and biomass after 12 weeks, after which the growth rate declines ( Ogbonnaya, 1988 ).

Lateral roots angle sharply downward and are important in water and nutrient uptake. T. procumbens is a C3 plant and is a very inefficient user of water; Datta (1959) reports a transpiration coefficient of 1402 compared with 430 for sorghum. Associations The flowers are attractive to insects and are an important food source, especially for butterflies ( Raju et al., 2004 ; Varalakshmi et al., 2012 ; Hasan et al., 2018 ). Environmental Requirements Tridax procumbens occurs in areas of tropical and humid subtropical climates, as well as dry climates. It is usually found in open land, on exposed, dry, sandy, or rocky soils ( Orchard, 2015 ). It has great resistance to drought ( Burkill, 1985 ) and is moderately tolerant to salt stress ( Chauhan and Johnson, 2008 ).

Seeds stored in soil for 2 years gave 7% germination in south Benin ( Lutzeyer and Koch, 1992 ). The pappus on the achene aids water uptake from soil, promoting germination ( Pemadasa and Kangatharalingam, 1977 ). The percentage germination of fresh seed in India was greatest at 30°C and at pH 6 to 8 ( Ramakrishnan and Jain, 1965 ). In Brazil, highest germination percent was reported at 25°C (94%), 30°C (93%) and 35°C (92%). At these temperatures, seeds begin to germinate within 2-4 days. At 15, 20 and 40°C, less than 6% of seeds germinated ( Guimarães et al., 2000 ). Synchronous germination of high densities of seedlings results in intra-specific competition and a reduction in subsequent seedling establishment ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Physiology and Phenology In humid tropical regions, flowering and fruiting occur year-round ( Powell, 1965 ; Pemadasa, 1976 ; Orchard, 2015 ). In the drier Sudano-Sahelian zone, this weed is an annual, flowering from June to October and dying at the end of the rainy season ( Bourgeois and Merlier, 1995 ). In East Africa, flowering occurs 35 to 55 days after emergence, and seeds ripen within 3 weeks of flowering ( Popay and Ivens, 1982 ). In Texas, U.S., and other areas, plants have been reported to grow from a seedling to a mature flowering plant within 3 weeks ( Bourgeois and Merlier, 1995 ; Graves, 2000 ). Dry weight, plant height and leaf area index of T. procumbens are reduced by shade ( Shetty

en within 3 weeks of flowering ( Popay and Ivens, 1982 ). In Texas, U.S., and other areas, plants have been reported to grow from a seedling to a mature flowering plant within 3 weeks ( Bourgeois and Merlier, 1995 ; Graves, 2000 ). Dry weight, plant height and leaf area index of T. procumbens are reduced by shade ( Shetty et al., 1982 ). In Nigeria, seedlings attain maximum increments in height and biomass after 12 weeks, after which the growth rate declines ( Ogbonnaya, 1988 ). T. procumbens forms slender, wavy taproots with many lateral branches ( Shetty and Maiti, 1978 ). The branches are more abundant near the soil surface. Lateral roots angle sharply downward and are important in water and nutrient uptake. T. procumbens is a C3 plant and is a very inefficient user of water; Datta (1959) reports a transpiration coefficient of 1402 compared with 430 for sorghum. Associations The flowers are attractive to insects and are an important food source, especially for butterflies ( Raju et al., 2004 ; Varalakshmi et al., 2012 ; Hasan et al., 2018 ). Environmental Requirements Tridax procumbens occurs in areas of tropical and humid subtropical climates, as well as dry climates. It is usually found in open land, on exposed, dry, sandy, or rocky soils ( Orchard, 2015 ). It has great resistance to drought ( Burkill, 1985 ) and is moderately tolerant to salt stress ( Chauhan and Johnson, 2008 ).

Overview
Appearance
Tridax procumbens
is a perennial herb that has a creeping stem which can reach from to 8-30 inches (20-75 cm) long.
Foliage
The leaves of
Tridax procumbens
are opposite, pinnate, oblong to ovate, and  1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long with cuneate bases, coarsely serrate margins, and acute apexes.
Flowers
Tridax procumbens
flowers have white rays and yellow disk flowers. They are about 0.4-0.6 inches (1-1.5 cm) wide, and held on a 4-12 inches (10-30 cm) long stalk. Flowering occurs in spring.
Fruit
Fruits are achenes that are dark brown to black in color, oblong, and 0.08 inches (2 mm) long, each with a head of pappus bristles that vary from 0.12-0.24 inches (3-6 mm) long.
Ecological Threat
Tridax procumbens
is listed as a Federal Noxious Weed. It prefers coarse-textured soils in more tropical locations. It invades roadsides, crops, waste land, and fallow land. It is native to Mexico and South America, but has become an invasive problem around the world.
