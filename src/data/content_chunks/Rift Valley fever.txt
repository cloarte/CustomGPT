Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease spread to 
livestock (cattle, sheep, goats and camels) and humans 
via mosquitoes that transmit the virus through biting.  
This disease is a major human, agricultural and economic 
threat in Africa and the Middle East.   It has not reached 
the United States, but having a way to predict potential 
outbreaks allows the United States to implement 
preventive measures. The rapid spread of West Nile 
virus—once only prevalent in Africa—demonstrates the 
nature of disease threats, and the importance of being able 
to track and prevent insect-transmitted diseases.  
USDA-ARS researchers partnered with the United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and Federal partners from 
NASA, CDC and the DoD to form the Rift Valley Fever 
Outbreak Early-Warning Team in a global effort to develop 
and transfer an early-warning system to detect and predict 
RVF. 
The model is based on analyzing satellite images to detect 
when temperatures in the Pacific and Indian oceans elevate 
concurrently to produce widespread and heavy rainfall in 
Africa, which causes vegetation to grow at rapid rates in 
specific areas that experience extremely moist weather 
conditions, including heavy rainfall, elevated humidity 
and heavy cloud cover. These conditions flood mosquito 
breeding habitats and give rise to major increases in 
the number and longevity of infected mosquitoes that 
spread the disease.  Similar models can also help predict 
outbreaks of other diseases of livestock and people such as 
malaria, cholera, and dengue. 
A Rift Valley Fever outbreak was successfully predicted 
several months in advance for the first time with a model

A Rift Valley Fever outbreak was successfully predicted

In October 2006, when the model predicted that RVF 
would flare up within 3 months in sub-Saharan Africa, a 
warning was sent to FAO and WHO, which then passed 
on the warning to countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, 
Tanzania, Uganda and Somalia. The early warning allowed 
the countries most likely to be in harm’s way to step up 
surveillance and controls for disease-carrying insects.  
Subsequently, from 2007–2010, additional specific 
warnings were issued to Sudan, Southern Africa and 
Madagascar months prior to the detection of RVF disease 
in animals and people.
An outbreak of Rift Valley Fever was blamed for the 
deaths of hundreds of people in Kenya in 1997–1998. 
Twenty years earlier, in 1977–1978, an RVF epidemic in 
Egypt involved 200,000 human cases and 600 fatalities.
