1. Reagent Name: Veterinary Rabies Reference Vaccine, killed virus 
2. Strain or Source: Pasteur Virus 
3. Lot Number: 08-14 
4. Fill Date: November 24, 2008 
5. Expiration Date: January 31, 2020 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: For use as a reference vaccine in the title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, 
(9 CFR), part 113.209 testing. 
7. Instructions for Use: Reference the current edition of the World Health Organization’s 
Laboratory Techniques in Rabies; The National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Test for Potency; or

Laboratory Techniques in Rabies; The National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Test for Potency; or 
the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) Supplemental Assay Method 308 for use and 
formulations. 
Reconstitute 1 vial with 13 mL sterile distilled water. This reference vaccine is for use in the 
NIH test. Starting with undilute, 5-fold dilutions (1:1 through 1:625) are made in phosphate 
buffered saline and these dilutions of the reference are used to vaccinate mice. Discard the 
remaining reconstituted reference. 
For the second vaccination, reconstitute a new vial of reference with 13 mL sterile distilled 
water. Prepare 5-fold dilutions as described previously and immunize mice. Discard the 
remaining reconstituted reference. 
8. Test of Reagent: Lot 08-14 was negative for viable rabies virus by intracerebral 
inoculation of mice and rabbits by 9 CFR 113.209(d)(2)(i). The vaccine was found to be free of 
mycoplasma and bacteria by 9 CFR 113.26 and 113.28 testing. The residual moisture content of 
the vaccine was equal to 3.9% by 9 CFR 113.29. The initial dilution value was determined by 
calibrating against the 6th International Rabies Reference vaccine in the NIH test.

12. Origin and Passage History: The virus is the Pasteur Virus strain. 
13. Method of Preparation: Lot 08-14 was grown in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. 
Following 5 days of incubation, the virus was inactivated with beta-propiolactone. The vaccine 
was tested for purity and inactivation. The reference was bottled, lyophilized, sealed, and 
stored at -20°C.
