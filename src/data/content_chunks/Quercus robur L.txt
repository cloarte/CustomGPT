Quercus roburL. - Pedunculate Oak  -Fagaceae© Alan Hill© Alan Hill© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This is one of the two native oaks of Northern Ireland. It is similar to the sessile oakQuercus petraeawith which it hybridizes. The factors which determine the distributions of these two species in Northern Ireland are unclear.The pedunculate oak has a shorter leaf stalk (petiole) than the sessile oak, and there are obvious auricles at the leaf base (absent in sessile oak). The acorns are produced in groups on a long peduncle, whereas the acorns of sessile oak have no peduncle or a very short one.The Irish word for oak isdair, and an oak grove isdaire, which has become anglicised as 'derry', a frequent component of Irish placenames.All names:Quercus roburL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
