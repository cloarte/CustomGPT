Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease 
 
Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a fatal disease in rabbits and is classified as a foreign 
animal disease in the United States. In February 2020, animal health officials detected 
rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 2 (RHDV2) for the third time in the United 
States, since 2018. Since that detection, RHDV2 has spread to multiple states across the 
Southwest. RHDV2 does not impact human health.  
Cases of RHDV2 in North America 
RHDV2 is highly contagious and, unlike other rabbit hemorrhagic disease viruses, it 
affects both domestic and wild rabbits. Many times, the only signs of the disease are 
sudden death and blood stained noses caused by internal bleeding. Infected rabbits may 
also develop a fever, be hesitant to eat, or show respiratory or nervous signs.   
In February 2020, RHDV2 was detected in a domestic rabbit 
in New York City. The virus was quickly identified, isolated 
and eradicated. There does not appear to be an epidemiological 
link, but the disease was later confirmed in a rabbit in New 
Mexico in March 2020. Since then, RHDV2 has continued to 
spread in New Mexico and across multiple states, including 
Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas.   
How RHDV2 Spreads 
The RHDV2 virus is very resistant to extreme temperatures. It 
can be spread through direct contact or exposure to an infected rabbit’s excretions or 
blood. The virus can also survive and spread from carcasses, food, water, and any 
contaminated materials. People can spread the virus indirectly by carrying it on their

contaminated materials. People can spread the virus indirectly by carrying it on their 
clothing and shoes.  
Protect Your Rabbits with Biosecurity 
A vaccine for RHDV2 is not currently licensed in the U.S. Instead, it is up to you as the 
owner to protect your rabbits by practicing good biosecurity. Biosecurity means taking 
simple steps every day to keep germs away from your animals. These actions will 
significantly reduce the chance of RHDV2 or other contagious diseases affecting your 
rabbits.  
Follow these recommended biosecurity practices: 
• Do not allow pet or wild rabbits to have contact with your rabbits or gain entry to 
the facility or home. 
• Do not allow visitors in rabbitries or let them handle pet rabbits without protective 
clothing (including coveralls, shoe covers, hair covering, and gloves). 
• Always wash hands with warm soapy water before entering your rabbit area, after 
removing protective clothing and before leaving the rabbit area.

• Do not introduce new rabbits from unknown or untrusted sources. Do not add

rabbits to your rabbitry from animal shelters or other types of rescue operations. 
• If you bring outside rabbits into your facility or home, keep them separated from 
your existing rabbits for at least 30 days. Use separate equipment for newly 
acquired or sick rabbits to avoid spreading disease.  
• Sanitize all equipment and cages moved on or off premises before they are returned 
to the rabbitry. We recommend disinfecting with 10% bleach or 10% sodium 
hydroxide mixed with water. 
• Establish a working relationship with a veterinarian to review biosecurity practices 
for identification and closure of possible gaps.   
If you are a breeder or grower who purchases live rabbits, even if you have existing 
biosecurity measures in place, you should review your practices and take steps to address 
potential gaps.   
Other Steps to Prevent Disease Spread 
The goal is to prevent this disease from impacting domestic and wild rabbit populations.  
To minimize the risk, here are some actions you can take to help: 
• If you live near or visit an area where this disease was confirmed, do not touch any 
dead wild rabbits you may see. You may contact your local veterinarian, state and 
federal animal health officials to learn if RHDV2 has been detected in your area.  
• If you see multiple dead wild rabbits, report it to state wildlife officials. 
• If you own domestic rabbits, do not release them into the wild. If your rabbits 
appear ill or die suddenly, contact your veterinarian. 
• If you volunteer at animal shelters or wildlife rescue facilities, be aware that this 
disease has been found in wild

• If you volunteer at animal shelters or wildlife rescue facilities, be aware that this 
disease has been found in wild rabbits. If rabbits appear ill or die suddenly, contact 
the facility’s veterinarian. 
• Anyone working with rabbits should always practice good biosecurity. This 
includes basic steps like washing your hands before and after working with rabbits 
and not sharing equipment with other owners.  
• The virus is hardy and you need to be careful about how you dispose of a rabbit that 
has died. A carcass could be a means of spread of the virus. Contact your 
veterinarian or state or federal animal health officials for guidance.   
Report Suspicious Cases 
Rabbit owners who have questions about this disease should contact their veterinarians. 
When found, this disease must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health. 
Veterinarians should immediately contact the USDA APHIS Area Veterinarian in Charge 
of your state and/or the state veterinarian if a case is suspected.
