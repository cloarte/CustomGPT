They are a particularly good source of Vitamin C. Several species are also grown as ornamental garden shrubs. The roots are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen making it possible for plants to grow well on very poor soils. For this reason, some species, most notablyElaeagnus angustifolia, have been used for land reclamation.Chang Che-yung. 1983. Elaeagnaceae.In:Fang Wen-pei & Chang Che-yung, eds., Fl. Reipubl.
