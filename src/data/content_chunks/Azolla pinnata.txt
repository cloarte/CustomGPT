 Invasion: Feathered mosquitofern is a small (to 2.5 cm), free-floating, aquatic fern. Individual plants are roughly triangular in shape with roots that dangle freely in the water column, but large populations comprising many plants often aggregate to form dense floating mats. Each plant has a horizontal “stem” or central axis from which lateral side “branches” arise in a pinnate (feather-like) arrangement. Branches are longest at the base of the fern and become progressively shorter from the base to the tip of the fern, resulting in the triangular appearance. Lateral branches have small (to 1 mm), scale-like, lobed fronds arranged in two overlapping rows along their length. The oblong or ovate upper (dorsal) lobes range in colour from bright green to deep burgundy or purple based on light exposure and other conditions. They are also densely covered with papillae (fleshy structures), rendering the plants water-repellent and creating a velvety appearance.

 Azolla reproduce using both sexual and asexual means, but sexual reproduction is rare and vegetative reproduction is much more common. Sexual reproduction is triggered by poorly understood environmental conditions and utilizes microsporocarps and megasporocarps, which split open to release “male” microspores and “female” megaspores, respectively. Microspores are released in massulae (spongy clumps) that attach to the megaspore; after an initial dormant period, each microspore germinates and becomes a prothallus, which produces antheroziods (male gametes). Germination of the megaspore also results in a prothallus, but this structure produces oospheres (female gametes). Fertilization of an oosphere by an antherozoid yields an embryo; the embryo germinates and becomes a sporophyte (plantlet), which floats to the water’s surface ( Wagner, 1997 , and references within). Fragmentation of feathered mosquitofern drives asexual (vegetative) reproduction and occurs when individual fronds form abscission layers and break away from the main body of the floating fern. The species can expand very quickly and can double its population size every two to five days. Physiology and Phenology Although feathered mosquitofern is an obligate wetland fern, the species tolerates drawdown (dewatered) conditions provided soil moisture is present, which allows the species to survive occasional stranding or short-term droughts. Like other members of the genus Azolla , feathered mosquitofern captures and fixes atmospheric nitrogen in association with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae , so it can thrive in nitrogen-poor waters.

Like other members of the genus Azolla , feathered mosquitofern captures and fixes atmospheric nitrogen in association with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae , so it can thrive in nitrogen-poor waters. Mosquitoferns in general have rapid growth rates, with population size doubling in as little as 2 days, but feathered mosquitofern has a higher growth rate and is more photosynthetically efficient than other species of Azolla ( Ocampo-Ariza et al., 2018 ; Kösesakal and Yıldız, 2019 ). Plant phenolics often reduce oxidative damage due to ultraviolet radiation exposure and may also suppress attacks by pathogens, parasites and predators. Tran et al. (2020) reported that more phenols were produced by feathered mosquitofern than by waterfern ( A. filiculoides ) under both unstressed and stressed conditions, which may give feathered mosquitofern a competitive advantage over other mosquitoferns. Red colouration is driven by anthocyanin content, and Tran et al. (2020) showed that anthocyanin concentrations were 15 times higher in stressed feathered mosquitofern than in green (unstressed) plants. Feathered mosquitofern also has high levels of deoxyanthocyanins, which serve as feedings deterrent and reduce grazing by aquatic fauna such as snails (e.g. Lymnaea swinhoei [ Radix plicatula ] and Biomphalaria alexandrina ), tree frog ( Polypedates leucomystax ) tadpoles and fish (e.g. Cichlasoma fenestratum and Oreochromis niloticus ) ( Antoine et al., 1986 ; Cohen et al., 2002 ).

The cyanobacteria are contained in leaf cavities, which often also have small populations of the bacteria Pseudomonas and Azotobacter ( Shi and Hall, 1998 , and references within). Environmental Requirements Rai and Rai (2006) reported that feathered mosquitofern is salt-sensitive and unable to tolerate abrupt exposure to waters with >30 mM (around 0.18% salinity or 1.8 ppt, equal to 5% the salinity of seawater). However, they also found that increasing salt concentration by 10 mM per day allowed plants to survive at 60 mM. This suggests that feathered mosquitofern is unlikely to exhibit aggressive growth in brackish or saline waters. Beyond salinity, feathered mosquitofern can survive under a variety of conditions, but growth rate of the species is affected by environment.

Overview
Appearance
Azolla pinnata
is a small fern with a triangular frond that measures up to 1 in. (2.5 cm) in length and floats on the water.
Foliage
The frond is made up of many rounded or angular overlapping leaves each 0.08 in. (0.2 cm.) long. They are green, blue-green, or dark red in color and coated in tiny hairs, giving them a velvety appearance. The hairs make the top surface of the leaf water-repellent, allowing the plant to float.
Flowers
Ferns do not produce a flower.
Fruit
The small fruit is a capsule that can contain up to 64 small spores.
Ecological Threat
Azolla pinnata
can quickly spread to cover open areas of water. It forms dense surface mats that impede water flow and navigation, and clog irrigation pumps. Mats of
Azolla pinnata
also reduce oxygen levels and the amount of light available to other aquatic organisms. It can be found in lakes, slow moving rivers and streams, ponds and wetlands.

Feathered mosquitofern is more photosynthetically efficient than other mosquitoferns and thus may be more tolerant of short days and low-light conditions, but growth is greatest under long days and high light intensities. As with other members of the genus Azolla , feathered mosquitofern utilizes atmospheric nitrogen and may be unaffected by nitrogen-deficient waters, but insufficient levels of phosphorus, potassium, and other essential elements are likely to limit growth ( Sadeghi et al., 2013 ; Kumar and Chander, 2017 ; Ocampo-Ariza et al., 2018 ; Kösesakal and Yıldız, 2019 ; Bhujel and Rizal, 2022 ).

Overview
Appearance
Azolla pinnata
is a small fern with a triangular frond that measures up to 1 in. (2.5 cm) in length and floats on the water.
Foliage
The frond is made up of many rounded or angular overlapping leaves each 0.08 in. (0.2 cm.) long. They are green, blue-green, or dark red in color and coated in tiny hairs, giving them a velvety appearance. The hairs make the top surface of the leaf water-repellent, allowing the plant to float.
Flowers
Ferns do not produce a flower.
Fruit
The small fruit is a capsule that can contain up to 64 small spores.
Ecological Threat
Azolla pinnata
can quickly spread to cover open areas of water. It forms dense surface mats that impede water flow and navigation, and clog irrigation pumps. Mats of
Azolla pinnata
also reduce oxygen levels and the amount of light available to other aquatic organisms. It can be found in lakes, slow moving rivers and streams, ponds and wetlands.
