1.Clusiaceae(GUTTIFERAE)藤黄科 teng huang keAuthors:Xi-wen Li,Jie Li,Norman K. B. Robson&Peter StevensHypericum monanthemumCredit: Harvard University HerbariaTrees, shrubs, or sometimes herbs containing resin or oil in schizogenous spaces or canals and sometimes black or red glands containing hypericin or pseudohypericin. Leaves simple, entire or rarely gland-fringed, opposite or sometimes whorled, nearly always estipulate. Flowers bisexual or unisexual, regular, hypogynous, solitary or in cymes or thyrses; bracteoles often inserted just beneath calyx and then not always easily distinguishable from sepals. Sepals (2-)4 or 5(or 6), imbricate or decussate or rarely wholly united in bud, inner ones sometimes petaloid. Petals [3 or]4 or 5[or 6], free, imbricate or contorted in bud. Stamens many to rarely few (9), in [3 or]4 or 5 bundles (fascicles) that are free and antipetalous or variously connate, with filaments variously united or apparently free and then sometimes sterile (staminodes); anther dehiscence longitudinal. Staminode bundles (fasciclodes) 3-5, free and antisepalous or variously connate or absent. Ovary superior, with 2-5(-12) connate carpels, 1-12-loculed, with axile to parietal or basal placentation; ovules 1 to many on each placenta, erect to pendulous; styles 1-5[-12], free or ± united or absent; stigmas 1-12, punctiform to peltate

Some authors treat Hypericaceae (genera nos. 1-4 in this treatment:Hypericum,Lianthus,Triadenum, andCratoxylum) separately from Clusiaceae sensu stricto (genera nos. 5-8:Mesua,Calophyllum,Mammea, andGarcinia).The Clusiaceae are a rather economically important family. Many species, such asMesua ferreaandGarcinia paucinervis, have hard wood. Numerous species inCalophyllum,ClusiaLinnaeus, andGarciniaproduce valuable commercial resin or gum.
