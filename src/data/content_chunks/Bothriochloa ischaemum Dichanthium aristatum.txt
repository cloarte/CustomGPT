Yellow bluestem
Gramineae
Bothriochloa ischaemum
(L.) Keng.
Dichanthium aristatum
(Poir) C.E. Hubb.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
These bluestems are both native to Central or Southern Asia. Yellowbluestem is used for pasture through the Southern Great Plains.
D.aristatum
appears not to have a common name, but varieties are known asAngleton and Gordo. They are used as pasture and hay in the humid Gulf CoastalPlain in Texas. Both of these species are warm season, semiprostratebunchgrasses, leafy or medium leafy. In palatability
D. aristatum
appears superior to yellow bluestem but both furnish good pasturage and goodhay if cut early.
