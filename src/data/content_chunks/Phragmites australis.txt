(2007) grew clones alongside each other in Denmark, octoploids were more vigorous than tetraploids and hexaploids, with dodecaploids intermediate. A study of native and introduced forms of P. phragmites in USA, Saltonstall (2002 ; 2003) identifies a range of haplotypes, also observing that hybridization occurs between the introduced and the two native subspecies: P. australis subsp. americanus and P. australis spp. berlandieri , although rare. Germplasm collections ( PROTA, 2023 ; USDA-ARS, 2023 ), and DNA barcode information are available for the species ( BOLDS, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Reproduction in P. australis is mainly vegetative by rhizomes, but also by stolons ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Rhizomes with 2- to 3-nodes are often viable. Some studies suggest that seed banks are small and/or short lived ( Gucker, 2008 ). Although a considerable number of seeds can be produced, most of them are not viable ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Pollen fertility and seed set are poor as abnormalities often occur during meiosis. Also, self-incompatibility or at least partial self-incompatibility is common. This has been seen in two Japanese populations where self-pollination yielded 2.8 and 8.9% seed set, while cross-pollination produced 52.4 and 64.4% seed set ( PROTA, 2023 ). Climatic conditions also appear to act as important

 during meiosis. Also, self-incompatibility or at least partial self-incompatibility is common. This has been seen in two Japanese populations where self-pollination yielded 2.8 and 8.9% seed set, while cross-pollination produced 52.4 and 64.4% seed set ( PROTA, 2023 ). Climatic conditions also appear to act as important regulators of seed production and germination ( McKee and Richards, 1996 ). Germination optimum conditions differ from the typical environment of the adult plants ( PROTA, 2023 ). Germination requirements include full light, warm temperatures, and moist but not flooded conditions ( Tilley and St. John, 2012 ). Germination occurs at 10-30°C, optimal at 20°C, but favoured by alternating temperatures with an amplitude of at least 10°C ( Ekstam and Forseby, 1999 ). The range of suitable habitats for seed germination is often narrow, germinating poorly if at all, in water >5 cm deep, and appear to have a pre-germination drying period requirement to break dormancy ( Vasconcelos, 1980 ). Germination is slower under saline conditions but still occurs at 400 mM salinity ( Gorai et al., 2006 ). Seedling establishment is low, with high mortality rates when exposed to flooding, drought, salt and freezing temperatures. Warm temperatures, full light and high phosphate levels provide good conditions for seedling growth ( Gucker, 2008 ). Physiology and Phenology Phragmites australis is reported as flowering and fruiting from July to November in China ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ) and throughout the year in frost-free areas ( PROTA, 2023 ). After germination, plants take 2-4 years to produce flowers ( Sturtevant et al., 2023 ). Growing season can last from 80 days in colder areas to about 320 days in frost-free areas ( Gucker, 2008

After germination, plants take 2-4 years to produce flowers ( Sturtevant et al., 2023 ). Growing season can last from 80 days in colder areas to about 320 days in frost-free areas ( Gucker, 2008 ). Phragmites australis is a C3 plant but has anatomical characteristics that are intermediate between C3 and C4 plants ( PROTA, 2023 ). Haslam (1969a , b ; 1970 ; 1972 ) and Mal and Narine (2004) provide much useful ecological data for P. australis . Emergent bud width which determines the basal stem diameter is a good predictor of growth rate and ultimate shoot height of the plant in developing reed populations. In good conditions, strong, tall stems with large, horizontally held leaves are produced which permit the plant to compete efficiently for available light. The root system is large and well-adapted to anaerobic conditions common in submerged soils, as they possess aerenchymatous tissues to provide gas ventilation from the leaves. P. australis exhibits a combination of long, thick, unbranched roots that penetrate the substrate, plus smaller, much-branched roots infiltrating the water and surface layers of the sediment. Together, the two root types maximize the chances of roots successfully tapping available nutrients, even in the crowded conditions typical of the reed swamp habitat. In a dense stand of P. australis , underground parts (rhizome, root and bases of stems) may comprise up to 80% of total biomass. Reeds may show substantial productivity under favourable conditions, with a growth rate reported in USA being up to 4cm/day ( Gucker, 2008 ). Nevertheless, the plant litter it produces can reduce its growth rate ( PROTA, 2023 ). Alongside this strong

Reeds may show substantial productivity under favourable conditions, with a growth rate reported in USA being up to 4cm/day ( Gucker, 2008 ). Nevertheless, the plant litter it produces can reduce its growth rate ( PROTA, 2023 ). Alongside this strong competitive element in the life strategy of Phragmites reeds, there is evidence for the presence of at least some traits for tolerance of disturbance. They are aggressive, fast-growing colonizers of empty habitats suited to its growth, such as observed in newly created Dutch polders, in land exposed by the receding of the Caspian Sea. These reeds were one of the first colonizers of Krakatau (Indonesia) following the 1883 volcanic eruption ( Ridley, 1930 ). In artificial drainage channels such as those in arable lands in eastern England, reed colonization after dredging operations is rapid, usually requiring clearance measures (herbicide or mechanical) within 2-3 years if channel functioning is to be maintained. In the absence of appropriate control, channels may become completely blocked by reed vegetation. Young plants of P. australis can be produced through in-vitro culture of immature inflorescences. A micropropagation system has been developed using 2,4-D to initiate callus growth and myoinositol to induce somatic embryogenesis ( PROTA, 2023 ). Associations Phragmites australis is often found associated with other wetland plants, including species of Spartina , Carex , Nymphaea , Typha , Glyceria , Juncus , Myrica , Triglochin , Calamagrostis , Galium and Phalaris ( PROTA, 2023 ) .

 is often found associated with other wetland plants, including species of Spartina , Carex , Nymphaea , Typha , Glyceria , Juncus , Myrica , Triglochin , Calamagrostis , Galium and Phalaris ( PROTA, 2023 ) . Environmental Requirements Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan (boreal to tropical) and highly adaptable emergent grass of freshwater to brackish water normally up to 10 ppt total dissolved salts ( Sainty and Jacobs, 1988 ). It is found in systems of widely varying nutrient status from oligotrophic to eutrophic ( Haslam, 1972 ; Hocking et al., 1983 ). It is rare in very nutrient-poor waters, and although it may occur in hypertrophic conditions, plant could suffer die-back ( Klotzli, 1971 ; Nijburg and Laanbroek, 1997 ). Its growth is reported as limited by low nitrogen or phosphorus levels, and by tidal flooding ( PROTA, 2023 ). It is especially common in alkaline environments although it can also thrive in highly acidic wetlands ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). The preferred pH range is 7.0 to 9.3 ( PROTA, 2023 ). Maximum salinity tolerances have been reported from 12 ppt in the United Kingdom, to 29 ppt in New York, USA, to 40 ppt on the Red Sea coast ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Al-Garni (2006) found P. australis to make greater growth at moderate salinity of 2.9 ppt NaCl but sharply reduced its growth at 14.6-17.5 ppt, though the tolerance of salinity varies among different subspecies. The introduced Eurasian form apparently has a somewhat higher tolerance of salinity than the native American subspecies ( Vasquez et al., 2005 ). Phrag

The introduced Eurasian form apparently has a somewhat higher tolerance of salinity than the native American subspecies ( Vasquez et al., 2005 ). Phragmites australis usually (but not exclusively) prefers stationary or slow-moving waters, and areas of land with a high-water table, or that are seasonally inundated. It occurs as a marginal or bankside species along many watercourses, growing best where the water level fluctuates from 15 cm below soil surface to 15 cm above, but can grow to depths of 1 m in water ( PROTA, 2023 ). It has been found in alpine waters, especially where nutrient pollution has occurred ( Blake et al., 1986 ). Phragmites australis is reported from many rainfall regimes but can occur in areas with rainfall as low as 50-100 mm per year ( PROTA, 2023 ). It grows on most soil textures from fine clays to sandy loams ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Areas with some water movement promote the creation of floating mats or islands, growing without soil contact ( PROTA, 2023 ). Phragmites australis tolerates fires, if growing with water above the soil surface. It also tolerates late season droughts and will remain green until the start of frosts in autumn. It does not tolerate heavy grazing ( PROTA, 2023 ). The species has a wide climatic tolerance, growing in areas from -39°C to 34°C. It is also reported to grow in temperatures up to 44°C, when water is abundant ( Gucker, 2008 ).

(1-6 cm) wide, flat and glabrous.FlowersThe flower heads are dense, fluffy, gray or purple in color and 5.9-15.7 in. (15-40 cm) long.  Flowering occurs from July to October.FruitThe seeds are brown, light weight, and about 0.3 in. (8 mm) long. In the fall the plant turns brown, and the inflorescences persist throughout the winter.Ecological ThreatPhragmites australisis usually found in dense thickets growing in or near shallow water. These thickets displace native wetlands plants, alter hydrology and block sunlight to the aquatic community. It is native to Eurasia and Africa. Native Phragmites do occur in the United States and they are sometimes very difficult to distinguish from the exotics.IntroductionMembers of the genusPhragmitesare superficially similar toArundo donax. Sterile specimens ofP. australisare sometimes misidentified asArundo donax, a grass introduced to North
America from Asia and now troublesome in natural areas, especially in California. The
genera can be distinguished when in flower because the glumes ofPhragmitesare glabrous
while those ofArundoare covered with soft, whitish hairs 6-8 mm long. In addition, the
glumes are much shorter than the lemmas inPhragmites.Stewardship summaryCommunities that have stablePhragmitespopulations present but have been exposed to

disturbance should be closely monitored. Management is necessary when evidence
indicates thatPhragmiteshas spread, or is spreading and threatening the integrity of rare
communities, invading the habitat of rare plants or animals or interfering with the wildlife
support function of refuges. Cutting, burning, application of herbicides (in particular
Rodeo), or water management schemes are possible control measures. The measure(s)
used will depend on a number of factors including the size and locationNatural historyRangePhragmites australisis found on every continent except Antarctica and may have the
widest distribution of any flowering plant.[1]It is common in and near
freshwater, brackish and alkaline wetlands in the temperate zones world-wide. It may also
be found in some tropical wetlands but is absent from the Amazon Basin and central
Africa. It is widespread in the United states, typically growing in marshes, swamps, fens,
and prairie potholes, usually inhabiting the marsh-upland interface where it may form
continuous belts.[2]BecausePhragmiteshas invaded and formed near-monotypic stands in some North
American wetlands only in recent decades there has been some debate as to whether it is
indigenous to this continent or not. Convincing evidence that it was here long before

European contact is now available from at least two sources. Niering and Warren (1977)[3]found remains ofPhragmitesin cores of 3000 year old peat from tidal marshes in
Connecticut. IdentifiablePhragmitesremains dating from 600 to 900 A.D. and
constituting parts of a twined mat and other woven objects were found during
archaeological investigations of Anasazi sites in southwestern Colorado (Kane & Gross
1986;).[4]There is some suspicion that although the species itself is indigenous to North America,
new, more invasive genotype(s) were introduced from the Old World.[5]Hauber et al. (1991)[6]found that invasivePhragmitespopulations in the Mississippi
River Delta differed genetically from a more stable population near New Orleans. They
also examined populations elsewhere on the Gulf coast, from extreme southern Texas to
the Florida panhandle, and found no genetic differences between those populations and the
one near New Orleans.[7]This increased their suspicion that the
invasive biotypes were introduced to the Delta from somewhere outside the Gulf relatively
recently.Phragmitesis frequently regarded as an aggressive, unwanted invader in the East and
Upper Midwest. It has also earned this reputation in the Mississippi River Delta of
southern Louisiana, where over the last 50 years, it has displaced species that provided
valuable forage for wildlife, particularly migratory waterfowl.[6]In other
parts of coastal Louisiana, however, it is feared thatPhragmitesis declining as a result of

parts of coastal Louisiana, however, it is feared thatPhragmitesis declining as a result of
increasing saltwater intrusion in the brackish marshes it occupies.Phragmitesis apparently
decreasing in Texas as well due to invasion of its habitat by the alien grassArundo donax.[8]Similarly,Phragmitesis present in the Pacific states
but is not regarded as a problem there. In fact, throughout the western U.S. there is some
concern over decreases in the species habitat and losses of populations.Habitat:Phragmitesis especially common in alkaline and brackish (slightly saline) environments[9][10], and can also thrive in highly acidic wetlands.[11]However,Phragmitesdoes not require, nor even prefer these habitats to
freshwater areas. Its growth is greater in fresh water but it may be outcompeted in these
areas by other species that cannot tolerate brackish, alkaline or acidic waters. It is often
found in association with other wetland plants including species from the following
genera: Spartina, Carex, Nymphaea, Typha, Glyceria, Juncus, Myrica,
Triglochin, Calamagrostis, Galium, and Phalaris.[12]Phragmitesoccurs in disturbed areas as well as pristine sites. It is especially common
along railroad tracks, roadside ditches, and piles of dredge spoil, wherever even slight
depressions hold water.[13]Penko (pers. comm. 1993)[14]has observed stuntedPhragmitesgrowing on acidic tailings (Ph 2.9) from an abandoned copper mine in

depressions hold water.[13]Penko (pers. comm. 1993)[14]has observed stuntedPhragmitesgrowing on acidic tailings (Ph 2.9) from an abandoned copper mine in
Vermont. Various types of human manipulation and/or disturbance are thought to
promotePhragmites.[2]For example, restriction of the tidal inundation
of a marsh may result in a lowering of the water table, which may in turn favorPhragmites. Likewise, sedimentation may promote the spread ofPhragmitesby elevating a
marsh's substrate surface and effectively reducing the frequency of tidal inundation.[15]A number of explanations have been proposed to account for the recent dramatic increases
inPhragmitespopulations in the northeastern and Great Lakes States. As noted above,
habitat manipulations and disturbances caused by humans are thought to have a role. In
some areasPhragmitesmay also have been promoted by the increases in soil salinity which
result when de-icing salt washes off roads and into nearby ditches and wetlands.[16]On the other hand, bare patches of road sand washed into ditches
and wetlands may be of greater importance.Phragmitesseeds are shed from November
through January and so may be among the first propagules to reach these sites. If the
seeds germinate and become established the young plants will usually persist for at least
two years in a small, rather inconspicuous stage, resembling many other grasses. Later,
perhaps after the input of nutrients, they may take off and assume the tall growth form that
makes the species easily identifiable. Increases in soil nutrient concentrations, may come

two years in a small, rather inconspicuous stage, resembling many other grasses. Later,
perhaps after the input of nutrients, they may take off and assume the tall growth form that
makes the species easily identifiable. Increases in soil nutrient concentrations, may come
from runoff from farms and urban areas. It has also been suggested increases in nutrient
concentrations, especially nitrates, are primarily responsible for increases inPhragmitespopulations. Ironically, eutrophication and increases in nitrate levels are sometimes blamed
for the decline ofPhragmitespopulations in Europe (Den Hartog et al. 1989).Ecology:Salinity and depth to the water table are among the factors which control the distribution
and performance ofPhragmites. Maximum salinity tolerances vary from population to
population; reported maxima range from 12 ppt (1.2%) in Britain to 29 ppt in New York
state to 40 ppt on the Red Sea coast.[17]Dense stands normally lose
more water through evapotranspiration than is supplied by rain.[18]However,
rhizomes can reach down almost 2 meters below ground, their roots penetrating even
deeper, allowing the plant to reach low lying ground water.[18]Killing frosts
may knock the plants back temporarily but can ultimately increase stand densities by
stimulating bud development.[19]Phragmiteshas a low tolerance for wave and current action which can break its culms
(vertical stems) and impede bud formation in the rhizomes.[18]It can survive,
and in fact thrive, in stagnant waters where the sediments are poorly aerated at best.[18]Air spaces in the above-ground stems and in the rhizomes themselves
assure the underground parts of the plant with a relatively fresh supply of air. This

 impede bud formation in the rhizomes.[18]It can survive,
and in fact thrive, in stagnant waters where the sediments are poorly aerated at best.[18]Air spaces in the above-ground stems and in the rhizomes themselves
assure the underground parts of the plant with a relatively fresh supply of air. This
characteristic and the species' salinity tolerance allow it to grow where few others can
survive.[18]In addition the build up of litter from the aerial shoots within
stands prevents or discourages other species from germinating and becoming established.[20]The rhizomes and adventitious roots themselves form dense mats that
further discourage competitors. These characteristics are what enablePhragmitesto
spread, push other species out and form monotypic stands.Such stands may alter the wetlands they colonize, eliminating habitat for valued animal
species. On the other hand, the abundant cover of litter inPhragmitesstands may provide
habitat for some small mammals, insects and reptiles. The aerial stems provide nesting
sites for several species of birds, and Song Sparrows have been seen eatingPhragmites'seeds.[15]Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) usePhragmitesfor emergency cover when low lying marshes are swept by storm tides and for
food when better habitats are overpopulated.[21]Studies conducted in Europe indicate that gall-forming and stem- boring insects may
significantly reduce growth ofPhragmites.[22][23]Skuhravy (1978)[24]estimated that roughly one-third of the stems in a stand may be damaged reducing stand
productivity by 10-20%. Mook and van der Toorn[25][26]found yields were reduced by
25 to 60% in stands heavily infested with lepidopteran stem- or rhizome-borers. Hayden

25 to 60% in stands heavily infested with lepidopteran stem- or rhizome-borers. Hayden
(1947)[27]suggested that aphids (Hyalopterus pruni) heavily damaged aPhragmitesstand in Iowa. On the other hand work in Europe by Pintera (1971)[28]indicated that
although high densities of aphids may bring about reductions inPhragmitesshoot height
and leaf area they had little effect on shoot weight. Like other emergent macrophytes,Phragmiteshas tough leaves and appears to suffer little grazing by leaf-chewing insects.[29]As mentioned above, there is great concern about recent declines inPhragmitesin Europe
where the species is still used for thatch. In fact, the journal Aquatic Botany devoted an
entire issue (volume 35 no.1, September 1989) to this subject. Factors believed
responsible for the declines include habitat destruction and manipulation of hydrologic
regimes by humans, grazing, sedimentation and decreased water quality (eutrophication).[30]Detailed reviews of the ecology and physiological ecology ofPhragmitesare provided by
Haslam ( 1972;1973)[9]and Hocking et al. (1983)[17]and an extensive bibliography is provided

by van der Merff et al..[31]Reproduction:Phragmitesis typically the dominant species on areas that it occupies. It is capable of
vigorous vegetative reproduction and often forms dense, virtually monospecific stands.
Hara et al. (1993)[32]classify sparse stands as those with densities of less than 100 culms m-2
and dense stands as those with densities of up to about 200 culms m-2 in wet areas or up
to 300 culms m-2 in dry areas. Mammalian and avian numbers and diversity in the dense
stands are typically low.[33]Newly opened sites may be colonized
by seed or by rhizome fragments carried to the area by humans in soils and on machinery
during construction or naturally in floodwaters.The plants generally flower and set seed between July and September and may produce
great quantities of seed. In the northeast, seeds are dispersed between November and
January. However, in some cases, most or all of the seed produced is not viable.[1]The seeds are normally dispersed by wind but may be transported by birds such as
red-winged blackbirds that nest among the reeds.[9]Following seed set,
nutrients are translocated down into the rhizomes and the above- ground portions of the
plant die back for the season.[19]Temperature, salinity and water levels affect seed germination. Water depths of more than
5 cm and salinities above 20 ppt (2%) prevent germination.[1][34]Germination is not affected by salinities below 10 ppt (1%) but declines at higher
salinities. Percentage germination increases with increasing temperature from 16 to 25 oC
while the time required to germinate decreases from 25 to 10 days over the same

5 cm and salinities above 20 ppt (2%) prevent germination.[1][34]Germination is not affected by salinities below 10 ppt (1%) but declines at higher
salinities. Percentage germination increases with increasing temperature from 16 to 25 oC
while the time required to germinate decreases from 25 to 10 days over the same
temperature range. Barry Truitt[35]has observed that areas covered by
thick mats of wrack washed up during storms and high water events are frequently
colonized byPhragmiteson the Virginia Coast Reserve. It is not clear whether it
establishes from rhizome pieces washed in with the wrack or from seed that blows in later.Once a new stand ofPhragmitestakes hold it spreads, predominantly through vegetative
reproduction. Individual rhizomes live for 3 to 6 years and buds develop at the base of the
vertical type late in the summer each year. These buds mature and typically grow about 1
meter (up to 10 m in newly colonized, nutrient-rich areas) horizontally before terminating
in an upward apex and going dormant until spring. The apex then grows upward into a
vertical rhizome which in turn produces buds that will form more vertical rhizomes.
Vertical rhizomes also produce horizontal rhizome buds, completing the vegetative cycle.
These rhizomes provide the plant with a large absorbent surface that brings the plant
nutrients from the aquatic medium.[36]The aerial shoots
arise from the rhizomes. They are most vigorous at the periphery of a stand where they
arise from horizontal rhizomes, as opposed to old verticals.[9]ConditionPhragmitescan be regarded as a stable, natural component of a wetland community if the

arise from horizontal rhizomes, as opposed to old verticals.[9]ConditionPhragmitescan be regarded as a stable, natural component of a wetland community if the
habitat is pristine and the population does not appear to be expanding. Many native
populations ofPhragmitesare "benign" and pose little or no threat to other species and
should be left intact. Examples of areas with stable, native populations include sea-level
fens in Delaware and Virginia and along Mattagota Stream in Maine.[37][38]In Europe, a healthy reed belt is defined as a "homogeneous, dense or
sparse stand with no gaps in its inner parts, with an evenly formed lakeside borderline
without aisles, shaping a uniform fringe or large lobes, stalk length decreasing gradually at
the lakeside border, but all stalks of one stand of similar height; at the landside edge the
reeds are replaced by sedge or woodland communities or by unfertilized grasslands".[30]Stable populations may be difficult to distinguish from invasive populations, but one
should examine such factors as site disturbance and the earliest collection dates of the
species to arrive at a determination. If available, old and recent aerial photos can be
compared to determine whether stands in a given area are expanding or not.[15]Phragmitesis a problem when and where stands appear to be spreading while other
species typical the of the community are diminishing. Disturbances or stresses such as
pollution, alteration of the natural hydrologic regime, dredging, and increased

 and where stands appear to be spreading while other
species typical the of the community are diminishing. Disturbances or stresses such as
pollution, alteration of the natural hydrologic regime, dredging, and increased
sedimentation favor invasion and continued spread ofPhragmites.[2]Other factors that may have favored recent invasion and spread ofPhragmitesinclude
increases in soil salinity (from fresh to brackish) and/or nutrient concentrations, especially
nitrate, and the introduction of a more invasive genotype(s) from the Old World(see GLOBAL RANGE section for further
discussion).[16][5]Michael Lefor asserts that one reason for the general spread ofPhragmiteshas been the
destabilization of the landscape (pers. comm. 1993). In urban landscapes water is apt to
collect in larger volumes and pass through more quickly (flashily) than formerly. This
tends to destabilize substrates leaving bare soil open for colonization. Watersheds
throughout eastern North America are flashier due to the proliferation of paved surfaces,
lawns and roofs and the fact that upstream wetlands are largely filled with postsettlement/
post agricultural sediments from initial land-clearing operations.Many Atlantic coast wetland systems have been invaded byPhragmitesas a result of tidal
restrictions imposed by roads, water impoundments, dikes and tide gates. Tide gates have
been installed in order to drain marshes to harvest salt hay, to control mosquito breeding
and, most recently, to protect coastal development from flooding during storms. This
alteration of marsh systems may favorPhragmitesinvasion by reducing tidal action and
soil water salinity and lowering water tables.Phragmitesinvasions may threaten wildlife because they alter the structure and function

airplane accidents nearby. The monitoring and control of mosquito breeding is nearly
impossible in densePhragmitesstands.[42]In addition,Phragmitesinvasions can also have adverse aesthetic impacts. In Boston's Back Bay Fens,
dense stands have obscured vistas intended by the park's designer, Frederick Law
Olmstead.[14]As noted abovePhragmitesis not considered a threat in the West or most areas in the Gulf
states.Areas that have been invaded byPhragmiteshave excellent potential for recovery.
Management programs have proven thatPhragmitescan be controlled, and natural
vegetation will return. However, monitoring is imperative becausePhragmitestends to
reinvade and control techniques may need to be applied several times or, perhaps, in
perpetuity. It is also important to note that some areas have been so heavily manipulated
and degraded that it may be impossible to eliminatePhragmitesfrom them. For example, it
may be especially difficult to controlPhragmitesin freshwater impoundments that were
previously salt marshes.Management/MonitoringInvasive populations ofPhragmitesmust be managed in order to protect rare plants that it
might outcompete, valued animals whose habitat it might dominate and degrade, and
healthy ecosystems that it might greatly alter.Cultural, mechanical and/or chemical methods can be used to controlPhragmites. The
factors that are believed responsible for the alarming decreases ofPhragmitesbeds in
Europe and Texas include habitat destruction, increased soil nitrate levels, and

eutrophication[43][44][30]are not appropriate as management tools in natural areas.Biological controlBiological control does not appear to be an option at this
time. No organisms which significantly damagePhragmites australisbut do not feed on
other plant species have been identified. Naturally occurring parasites have not proven to
be successful controls.[25][45][26]In addition, some of the arthropods that feed onPhragmitesare killed
by winter fires and thus would likely be eliminated from the systems where prescribed fires
are used. Coots, nutria, and muskrats may feed onPhragmitesbut appear to have limited
impacts on its populations.[46]BurningPrescribed burning does not reduce the growing ability ofPhragmitesunless
root burn occurs. Root burn seldom occurs, however, because the rhizomes are usually
covered by a layer of soil, mud and/or water. Fires inPhragmitesstands are dangerous
because this species can cause spot-fires over 100 feet away.[47]Burning does
remove accumulatedPhragmitesleaf litter, giving the seeds of other species area to
germinate. Prescribed burning has been used with success after chemical treatment for this
purpose at The Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, NJ (Beall 1984)[47]and in Delaware.[48]Occasional burning has been used in Delaware in
conjunction with intensive spraying and water level management. This helps remove old

conjunction with intensive spraying and water level management. This helps remove old
canes and allows other vegetation to grow.[49]At Wallops Island, Virginia, a small (100' x 400') brackish to saline to dry wetland was
burned November 1990 to controlPhragmites.[50]A variety of
other species appeared in the year following the burn but they appeared leggy while thePhragmitesremained vigorous. A second winter burn is planned and monitoring of
transects will continue (there are no pre-treatment data).At Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge in New York, a 20-30 acre freshwater
impoundment was drained in the fall of 1989, burned the following winter and then
reflooded.[51]Phragmiteswas eliminated from the half of the
marsh that was treated and the area remained free of the grass through 1992.According to Cross and Fleming (1989)[46], late summer burns may be effective, but winter
and spring burning may in fact increase the densities of spring crops. Thompson and Shay
(1985)[52]performed experimental burn treatments on Delta Marsh, Manitoba. They found
that spring, summer and fall burns resulted in higher total shoot densities and lower mean
shoot weights than on controls primarily as a result of greater densities of shorter, thinner
vegetative shoots. Shoot biomass was greater in spring-burned and fall-burned plots than
in control areas but less on summer- burned plots. They also found that below-ground
production increased following spring and fall burns but not following summer burns. The
increase in light availability following burns generally appears to benefitPhragmites. A
variety of understory responses to these burns was noted.

production increased following spring and fall burns but not following summer burns. The
increase in light availability following burns generally appears to benefitPhragmites. A
variety of understory responses to these burns was noted. For example, summer burns
increased species diversity, richness, and evenness, although certain species declined.[52]In Connecticut late spring burns followed by manual flooding with salt water was
successful in reducingPhragmitesheight and density.[53]After
three years, the fuel load was exhausted; the process was very expensive and selfregulating
tide gates were installed instead (see MANIPULATION OF WATER LEVEL
AND SALINITY).In Europe, experimental removal of litter in winter resulted in doubling the above-ground
biomass.[54]Increased light availability at the soil surface and aeration of the
soil around the rhizomes may have been responsible for this increase. Burning in the
winter in an experimental field caused little damage, while burning during the emergence
period led to the death of the majority ofPhragmitesshoots.[25]ChemicalRodeo®, a water solution of the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate is
commonly used forPhragmitescontrol. This herbicide is not, however, selective and will
kill grasses and broadleaved plants alike. Toxicity tests indicate that it is virtually nontoxic
to all aquatic animals tested. It should be noted that many of these tests were
performed by or for Monsanto, the company which manufactures Rodeo.

Bioconcentration values for glyphosate in fish tissues were insignificant. Glyphosate
biodegrades quickly and completely in the environment into natural products including
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphate and water. Finally, since glyphosate does not
volatilize, it will not vaporize from a treated site and move to a non-target area.[55][56][57][58]Rodeo must be mixed with water and a surfactant which allows it to stick to and
subsequently be absorbed by the plant.[47]Instructions for application, amounts
needed per acre, the approved surfactants and ratios for mixing, are on the Rodeo label.
Glyphosate must be mixed with clean or, if possible, distilled water because it binds tightly
to sediments and is thus rendered non-toxic to plants.[59]This
limits its effectiveness but also may help prevent it from acting on plants that were not
originally targeted. Rodeo should not by applied in windy conditions, as the spray will drift.[60]It also should not be applied if rain is forecast within 12
hours because it will wash away before it has a chance to act.[61]Application
rates may vary but, as one example, effective control ofPhragmitesin a Delaware marsh
was achieved with 4 pints/acre of concentrate.[48]Application of Rodeo must take place after the tasseling stage when the plant is supplying
nutrients to the rhizome. At this time, when Rodeo is sprayed onto the foliage of aquatic

nutrients to the rhizome. At this time, when Rodeo is sprayed onto the foliage of aquatic
weeds, it translocates into the roots. Rodeo interferes with essential plant growth
processes, causing gradual wilting, yellowing, browning and deterioration of the plant.
Studies on tasseling at the Augustine Tidal area, in Port Penn Delaware, indicated that
tasseling in a stand is never 100% but that it is possible to spray when 94% of the plants
are tasseling. In dense stands, subdominant plants are protected by the thick canopy and
thus may not receive adequate herbicide. For these reasons, touch up work will be
necessary.[62]At Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, Rodeo was applied aerially after the plants
tasseled in late August. The application resulted in a 90% success. The following
February, a fast moving prescribed burn was carried out to remove litter, exposing the
seed bed for re-establishment of marsh vegetation. However funding was not available for
several years andPhragmiteshas returned to 90% of the previously treated areas.[63]Treatment was resumed in fall 1991.In September, 1983, at the Prime Hook Wildlife Refuge in Delaware, 500 acres of
freshwater impoundments were sprayed with Rodeo from a helicopter forPhragmitescontrol. The plants yellowed within 10 days. The following May aerial and ground
evaluations of the sprayed area revealed a 98% kill ofPhragmites.[61]In addition

to applying herbicide, Prime Hook manipulates water levels with a stop log to stressPhragmites; winter water levels are held at an elevation of 2.8' msl until June, when water
would otherwise be held at 2.2 msl. The combined spraying and water management
approach was successful and many aquatic plants returned. A regime of spraying in
August-September for two years followed by flooding has been used through 1991.[49]Annual costs ofPhragmitescontrol are $20K annual at Prime Hook
(1,000 acres) and $3K at Bombay Hook (20-60 acres); monitoring costs, which include
reading vegetation transects for species presence and density each September are not
included in the cost.Aerial spraying has been used since 1983 in many Delaware state wildlife refuges.[48]Using Rodeo, the state sprays freshwater and brackish
impoundments, brackish marshes, and salt marshes from early September to early October;
this is combined with winter burns between the first and second year of spraying. Areas
will be spot-treated whenever needed after that. The herbicide treatments consist of 4
pints/acre the first year and 2 pints/acre the second, with an average cost of $65/acre. The
state is involved with cost-sharing programs with private landowners where the state pays
half the spraying cost with a willing owner. Desirable native vegetation usually returns

after spraying; no revegetation is done. Occasionally become open mud flats that are
eventually repopulated byPhragmites.At Chincoteague National Wildlife refuge, an aerial spraying program initiated in 1986 in
an 18-mile long freshwater impoundment was terminated due to budget cuts.Phragmitesquickly reclaimed the area, estimated to be 100-150 acres total in small scattered stands.[64]In September 1991, spraying with Rodeo began again; it is
expected that the entire area will be sprayed again in 1992, and that small areas of regrowth
will be sprayed in 1993. Because the area is impounded, the water level usually is
lower in the spring, which helps preventPhragmitesregrowth.Herbicides are used at Tinicum Environmental Center, because other control options are
limited. Unplanned burns do occur, but prescribed burns are not allowed due to the
proximity to the highway and airport. Tinicum was recently granted $2M to restore a 18-
acre site. Here they will be altering the elevation of the marsh, seeding with native plants,
and monitoring the results.[65]At Parker National Wildlife Refuge, an aerial spraying program (annual budget $5K) for
50 acres of a 100-acre freshwater impoundment began in mid-August 1991. A winter burn
is anticipated and a second year of spraying planned. Results will be monitored by using
aerial photos to delineate the boundaries of thePhragmitesclones. A nearby tower also
provides a suitable viewing point to observe progress.[66]In more fragile situations wherePhragmitesis threatening a rare plant or community,

community that the entire operation was designed to protect. Glyphosate can be applied to
specific plants and areas by hand with a backpack sprayer. Wayne Klockner of The Nature
Conservancy's Maryland Field Office has been successful in eliminating mostPhragmitesat
the Nassawango preserve by applying glyphosate by hand with a backpack sprayer.[15]The control program there began in 1983; actual spraying
is conducted along the power line ROW by Delmarva Power.[67]Delmarva Power generally sprays with trucks, backpacks or helicopter, depending on the
accessibility of the area and presence of rare plants nearby.[68]They use Rodeo in tidal areas, and Accord®(another glyphosate product) in non-tidal
areas from mid-August to mid-October, when the plants are going to seed. They spray
intensively the first year, and conduct touch-up spraying the second year which eliminates
90-95% of the plants. They then return every three years to eliminate any new plants.
They do not spray if the plants are not tasselling and are short.Rodeo was used at Cape May Meadows in 1989, 1990, and 1991. It was applied with a 30
gallon gas-powered tank with spray nozzle mounted on a truck, Indian pump sprayers, 2.5

appeared to kill most, if not all, of the treatedPhragmitesin this 20-acre area; plants found
in the area following treatment were shorter and the stand was less dense (determined
visually). However the dead stalks remained and blocked views from the trail.In Connecticut a 5m x 23 m patch ofPhragmiteshas been treated with a hand-held spray
of Rodeo (1988 and 1989) and Roundup (1990 and 1991) for four years in late Augustearly
September. ThePhragmitesis shorter and less dense at the site but it is still present
(Lapin pers. obs.). Actions to supplement and enhance herbicide applications including the
removal of tassels (1991) and removal of dead stalks (planned 1992), have been and will
be taken.Other chemicals have been used onPhragmitesand are described in Cross and Fleming
(1989)[46].
Also see CUTTING at Constitution Marsh for another method of application.CuttingCutting has been used successfully to controlPhragmites. Since it is a grass,
cutting several times during a season, at the wrong times, may increase stand density.[70]However, if cut just before the end of July, most of the food reserves
produced that season are removed with the aerial portion of the plant, reducing the plant's
vigor. This regime may eliminate a colony if carried out annually for several years. Care

must be taken to remove cut shoots to prevent their sprouting and forming stolons.[70]In the Arcola Creek Preserve in Ohio, cutting reduced the vigor of thePhragmitescolony. Also in Ohio, at Morgan Swamp, cutting began in mid to end of July
(before tassel set) in 1989 around a gas well in a freshwater wetland.[71]The preferred tool was an old-fashioned hedge trimmer with an 8" flat blade with
serrations manufactured by Union Fork and Hoe. The trimmers worked better than
loppers and were safer than sickles; a circular blade on a weed whacker was also used and
proved to be faster and good for staff but it was more dangerous for volunteers and
detracted from the atmosphere of the work-day.[72]Small patches (10' x 50') in a New York freshwater system were cut at the end of July or
the beginning of August for two successive years with positive results.[73]The hand-cut material was removed from the site and thrown on a brush
pile (unfortunately it was located too close to the water and returned to the system).Massachusetts Audubon staff have cut the perimeter around a 0.25 acrePhragmitespatch

Marshfield, Massachussetts.[74]They have monitored their

buckets with a flexible cable to cut an area with 75% cover ofPhragmitesand 20-25' of
muck.[76][77]Cutting this 10-
acre plot three times during the summer (April, June, August) cost $150K. The cut
material was stockpiled nearby where it was to be burned in the winter when it was
washed away in a severe storm. In winter 1992, the town plans to open the tide gate and
allow flushing to prevent further return ofPhragmites. Results are not yet known.Cutting culms to 6" followed by addition of rock salt on a 10' x 10' patch appeared to have
reduced the height and density ofPhragmitesin a salt marsh in Greenwich, CT.[78]Continued observations indicated that this trend appeared to continue.[79]Cutting an area 25' x 25' to waist height with a hedge clippers and the applying one drop

and 1992 in a freshwater tidal wetland around the perimeter of a one-acre patch has
prevented subsequent expansion of the patch. Monitoring using aerial photos taken at fiveyear
intervals indicated the control success. Cutting was done with hand-held cutters and
gas-powered hedge trimmers, which were very efficient. Cut material was removed from
the site and allowed to decompose on upland areas. In a second area, similar efforts in a
calcareous wetland 1990-1992 were monitored by placing red survey wires around the
perimeter of the patch. Preliminary observations indicate a cessation ofPhragmitesexpansion.In Europe, Weisner and Graneli[81]found that oxygen transport was reduced by
cutting the culms above and below the water surface;cutting below the water in June
almost totally inhibited regrowth of shoots the following summer, while cutting above
water reduced regrowth of shoots. Cutting in August did not reduce growth the following
summer. Cutting in sandy substrates was minimally effective, while cutting on calcareous
muds caused decreases in oxygen levels.Also see MANIPULATION OF WATER LEVEL AND SALINITY.Grazing, dredging, and drainingGrazing, dredging, and draining are other

methods that have often been used to reduce stand vigor.[12]However, draining and dredging are not appropriate for use on most preserves.[70]Grazing may trample the rhizomes and reduce vigor but the results are limited.[46]Van Deursen and Drost[82]found that cattle consumed 67-98% of
above-ground biomass; in a four year study, they found that reed populations may reach
new equilibria under grazing regimes.Manipulation of water level and salinityA self-regulating tide gate
which reintroduced saltwater tidal action was used to help restore a diked marsh in
Fairfield, Connecticut.[53][83]A 1-3
foot reduction in stem height resulted over each of three years . In addition to reduced
height, plant density declined dramatically from 11.3 plants m-2 in 1980 to 3.3 plants/ m-2
the following year. In following years,Phragmitescontinued to decline, although less
dramatically. In addition to the decreased height and density of thePhragmitesstands,
typical marsh flora includingSalicornia, Distichilis, Spartina alternifloraLoisel. andS. patens(Aiton) Muhl. returned. Depending on
topography and elevation,Phragmiteswas eliminated in large areas and continues to
remain short and sparse in other areas through 1992. Hence, reintroduced tidal action and
salinity can reducePhragmitesvigor and restore the community's integrity. This has been

salinity can reducePhragmitesvigor and restore the community's integrity. This has been
implemented successfully in other degraded former salt marshes in Connecticut.[84]Flooding can be used to controlPhragmiteswhen 3 feet of water covers the rhizome for
an extended period during the growing season, usually four months.[47]However, many areas can not be flooded to such depths. Furthermore, flooding could
destroy the communities or plants targeted for protection.Open Marsh Water Management (OMWM) has been used as a method to controlPhragmites. Plugging of ditches and addition of culverts to raise the soil salinities appears
to have causedPhragmitesdie-back over the last four growing seasons at Fireplace Neck,
New York.[84][85]Hellings and Gallagher (1992)[42]found thatPhragmiteswas negatively impacted by
increasing salinity and increased flooding. They also found that cutting and subsequent
flooding also reduced growth and survival in outdoor experiments. They suggest thatPhragmitesmay be controlled by increasing flooding and salinity levels. Matoh, Matsushita
and Takahashi (1988)[86]also found reduction in vigor with increased salinity. However death
apparently occurred only when cutting was combined with brackish flooding.[42]In Europe, episodic freshwater flooding occurring early in the growing season has been
suggested as one of the reasons for reed population declines.[87]McKee et

Mowing only affects the above ground portion of the plant, so mowing would have to
occur annually. To remove the rhizome, disking could be employed. However, discing
could potentially result in an increase ofPhragmitessince pieces of the rhizome can
produce new plants. Cross and Fleming (1989)[46]describe successful mowing regimes of
several year duration during the summer (August and September) and disking in summer
or fall.In Cape May Meadows, New Jersey, a brackish to freshwater non- tidal sandy area, an
attempt was made to remove rhizomes by pulling to a depth of three feet.[69]This resulted in a very sparsePhragmitesstand the following year. However
it was very labor-intensive (using 130 people- hours to cover a 50 ft<sup2 patch) and could be
applied best to sandy soils.In a private yard,Phragmiteswas mowed and a thin layer of soil and grass seed were

North Carolina marsh by air and held in place by sandbags.[89][90]Plants were initially cut to 6-8" with a hand-pushed bush hog[91]or a weedeater with blade, with an area of 20 x 20 m taking several days to cut. The cut
material was left and the plastic put over the area. The high temperatures under the plastic
caused die-off ofPhragmitesin 3-4 days. After 8-10 weeks, the plastic deteriorated. The
rhizomes appeared to have died back, but the project was of short duration and the results
were not monitored the following year.[91]Turner[92]noted that follow-ups in subsequent years indicatedPhragmitesreturned but not as
densely. Plastic management in each 12 x 12 m plot took an average of 53 hours,
compared with 17 hours to cut and three hours to burn.[90]Clear plastic in two narrow swaths (70 m x 20 m) was placed along the edge of a tidal
brackish pond after hand-cutting thePhragmitesat the end of July 1991.[74]comm. 1992). One plot, in total sun, had a complete kill ofPhragmitesin 10 days, while

in 1990 and 1991.[80]Although there was difficulty due to tidal
influence, the plastic was weighted down with rocks and appeared to kill what is under it.
Runners along the edge were treated with a syringe application of Roundup in August. In
November 1991, a hole cut in the middle of the black plastic provided the opportunity for
cattail shoots to germinate. After the first year there was viablePhragmitesin the areas
covered. It appeared that the black plastic was more effective, due to the higher heat levels
attained.[93]Monitoring RequirementsPhragmitespopulations require close monitoring in order to determine whether they are
increasing in area or not. Populations that are growing may quickly threaten or even
eliminate rare elements. Monitoring provides the data needed in order to decide if control
measures are necessary. If and when a control program is begun it is important to monitor
targeted populations so that the program's effectiveness can be determined. If it is possible
to leave untreated control areas without jeopardizing the success of the control program
these should be monitored as well for comparison. It is imperative to continue monitoring
even if a control program succeeds initially becausePhragmitesmay reinvade and the
sooner this is detected the easier it will be to combat.To assess if aPhragmitescolony is spreading, quantitative measurements should be made

carried out in order to determine whether declines in species diversity are occurring.
In Europe, reed declines have been documented by comparing areas covered byPhragmitescolonies on up-to-date maps or aerial photographs with older sources,
monitoring permanent quadrats within or at the border of the reed belt and mapping the
stubble fields left after die-back.[30]In lakes[94],
wooden poles 5 m apart were connected with string and the numbers of reed stalks
directly below the strings were counted each year in the spring.Monitoring ProgramsThe programs listed below used various methods to controlPhragmitespopulations and
are monitoring the success of these actions including the degree of recovery of native
species and the longevity of the control.CONNECTICUTMonitoringPhragmitesreduction and replacement vegetation after

(2007) grew clones alongside each other in Denmark, octoploids were more vigorous than tetraploids and hexaploids, with dodecaploids intermediate. A study of native and introduced forms of P. phragmites in USA, Saltonstall (2002 ; 2003) identifies a range of haplotypes, also observing that hybridization occurs between the introduced and the two native subspecies: P. australis subsp. americanus and P. australis spp. berlandieri , although rare. Germplasm collections ( PROTA, 2023 ; USDA-ARS, 2023 ), and DNA barcode information are available for the species ( BOLDS, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Reproduction in P. australis is mainly vegetative by rhizomes, but also by stolons ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Rhizomes with 2- to 3-nodes are often viable. Some studies suggest that seed banks are small and/or short lived ( Gucker, 2008 ). Although a considerable number of seeds can be produced, most of them are not viable ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Pollen fertility and seed set are poor as abnormalities often occur during meiosis. Also, self-incompatibility or at least partial self-incompatibility is common. This has been seen in two Japanese populations where self-pollination yielded 2.8 and 8.9% seed set, while cross-pollination produced 52.4 and 64.4% seed set ( PROTA, 2023 ).

 during meiosis. Also, self-incompatibility or at least partial self-incompatibility is common. This has been seen in two Japanese populations where self-pollination yielded 2.8 and 8.9% seed set, while cross-pollination produced 52.4 and 64.4% seed set ( PROTA, 2023 ). Climatic conditions also appear to act as important regulators of seed production and germination ( McKee and Richards, 1996 ). Germination optimum conditions differ from the typical environment of the adult plants ( PROTA, 2023 ). Germination requirements include full light, warm temperatures, and moist but not flooded conditions ( Tilley and St. John, 2012 ). Germination occurs at 10-30°C, optimal at 20°C, but favoured by alternating temperatures with an amplitude of at least 10°C ( Ekstam and Forseby, 1999 ). The range of suitable habitats for seed germination is often narrow, germinating poorly if at all, in water >5 cm deep, and appear to have a pre-germination drying period requirement to break dormancy ( Vasconcelos, 1980 ). Germination is slower under saline conditions but still occurs at 400 mM salinity ( Gorai et al., 2006 ). Seedling establishment is low, with high mortality rates when exposed to flooding, drought, salt and freezing temperatures. Warm temperatures, full light and high phosphate levels provide good conditions for seedling growth ( Gucker, 2008 ). Physiology and Phenology Phragmites australis is reported as flowering and fruiting from July to November in China ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ) and throughout the year in frost-free areas ( PROTA, 2023 ). After germination, plants take 2-4 years to produce flowers ( Sturtevant et al., 2023 ). Growing season can last from 80 days in colder areas to about 320 days in frost-free areas ( Gucker, 2008

 from July to November in China ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ) and throughout the year in frost-free areas ( PROTA, 2023 ). After germination, plants take 2-4 years to produce flowers ( Sturtevant et al., 2023 ). Growing season can last from 80 days in colder areas to about 320 days in frost-free areas ( Gucker, 2008 ). Phragmites australis is a C3 plant but has anatomical characteristics that are intermediate between C3 and C4 plants ( PROTA, 2023 ). Haslam (1969a , b ; 1970 ; 1972 ) and Mal and Narine (2004) provide much useful ecological data for P. australis . Emergent bud width which determines the basal stem diameter is a good predictor of growth rate and ultimate shoot height of the plant in developing reed populations. In good conditions, strong, tall stems with large, horizontally held leaves are produced which permit the plant to compete efficiently for available light. The root system is large and well-adapted to anaerobic conditions common in submerged soils, as they possess aerenchymatous tissues to provide gas ventilation from the leaves. P. australis exhibits a combination of long, thick, unbranched roots that penetrate the substrate, plus smaller, much-branched roots infiltrating the water and surface layers of the sediment. Together, the two root types maximize the chances of roots successfully tapping available nutrients, even in the crowded conditions typical of the reed swamp habitat. In a dense stand of P. australis , underground parts (rhizome, root and bases of stems) may comprise up to 80% of total biomass. Reeds may show substantial productivity under favourable conditions, with a growth rate reported in USA being up to 4cm/day ( Gucker, 2008 ). Nevertheless, the plant litter it produces can reduce its growth rate ( PROTA, 2023 ). Alongside this strong

 australis , underground parts (rhizome, root and bases of stems) may comprise up to 80% of total biomass. Reeds may show substantial productivity under favourable conditions, with a growth rate reported in USA being up to 4cm/day ( Gucker, 2008 ). Nevertheless, the plant litter it produces can reduce its growth rate ( PROTA, 2023 ). Alongside this strong competitive element in the life strategy of Phragmites reeds, there is evidence for the presence of at least some traits for tolerance of disturbance. They are aggressive, fast-growing colonizers of empty habitats suited to its growth, such as observed in newly created Dutch polders, in land exposed by the receding of the Caspian Sea. These reeds were one of the first colonizers of Krakatau (Indonesia) following the 1883 volcanic eruption ( Ridley, 1930 ). In artificial drainage channels such as those in arable lands in eastern England, reed colonization after dredging operations is rapid, usually requiring clearance measures (herbicide or mechanical) within 2-3 years if channel functioning is to be maintained. In the absence of appropriate control, channels may become completely blocked by reed vegetation. Young plants of P. australis can be produced through in-vitro culture of immature inflorescences. A micropropagation system has been developed using 2,4-D to initiate callus growth and myoinositol to induce somatic embryogenesis ( PROTA, 2023 ). Associations Phragmites australis is often found associated with other wetland plants, including species of Spartina , Carex , Nymphaea , Typha , Glyceria , Juncus , Myrica , Triglochin , Calamagrostis , Galium and Phalaris ( PROTA, 2023 ) .

 is often found associated with other wetland plants, including species of Spartina , Carex , Nymphaea , Typha , Glyceria , Juncus , Myrica , Triglochin , Calamagrostis , Galium and Phalaris ( PROTA, 2023 ) . Environmental Requirements Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan (boreal to tropical) and highly adaptable emergent grass of freshwater to brackish water normally up to 10 ppt total dissolved salts ( Sainty and Jacobs, 1988 ). It is found in systems of widely varying nutrient status from oligotrophic to eutrophic ( Haslam, 1972 ; Hocking et al., 1983 ). It is rare in very nutrient-poor waters, and although it may occur in hypertrophic conditions, plant could suffer die-back ( Klotzli, 1971 ; Nijburg and Laanbroek, 1997 ). Its growth is reported as limited by low nitrogen or phosphorus levels, and by tidal flooding ( PROTA, 2023 ). It is especially common in alkaline environments although it can also thrive in highly acidic wetlands ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). The preferred pH range is 7.0 to 9.3 ( PROTA, 2023 ). Maximum salinity tolerances have been reported from 12 ppt in the United Kingdom, to 29 ppt in New York, USA, to 40 ppt on the Red Sea coast ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Al-Garni (2006) found P. australis to make greater growth at moderate salinity of 2.9 ppt NaCl but sharply reduced its growth at 14.6-17.5 ppt, though the tolerance of salinity varies among different subspecies. The introduced Eurasian form apparently has a somewhat higher tolerance of salinity than the native American subspecies ( Vasquez et al., 2005 ). Phrag

 found P. australis to make greater growth at moderate salinity of 2.9 ppt NaCl but sharply reduced its growth at 14.6-17.5 ppt, though the tolerance of salinity varies among different subspecies. The introduced Eurasian form apparently has a somewhat higher tolerance of salinity than the native American subspecies ( Vasquez et al., 2005 ). Phragmites australis usually (but not exclusively) prefers stationary or slow-moving waters, and areas of land with a high-water table, or that are seasonally inundated. It occurs as a marginal or bankside species along many watercourses, growing best where the water level fluctuates from 15 cm below soil surface to 15 cm above, but can grow to depths of 1 m in water ( PROTA, 2023 ). It has been found in alpine waters, especially where nutrient pollution has occurred ( Blake et al., 1986 ). Phragmites australis is reported from many rainfall regimes but can occur in areas with rainfall as low as 50-100 mm per year ( PROTA, 2023 ). It grows on most soil textures from fine clays to sandy loams ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Areas with some water movement promote the creation of floating mats or islands, growing without soil contact ( PROTA, 2023 ). Phragmites australis tolerates fires, if growing with water above the soil surface. It also tolerates late season droughts and will remain green until the start of frosts in autumn. It does not tolerate heavy grazing ( PROTA, 2023 ). The species has a wide climatic tolerance, growing in areas from -39°C to 34°C. It is also reported to grow in temperatures up to 44°C, when water is abundant ( Gucker, 2008 ).

Physiology and Phenology Phragmites australis is reported as flowering and fruiting from July to November in China ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ) and throughout the year in frost-free areas ( PROTA, 2023 ). After germination, plants take 2-4 years to produce flowers ( Sturtevant et al., 2023 ). Growing season can last from 80 days in colder areas to about 320 days in frost-free areas ( Gucker, 2008 ). Phragmites australis is a C3 plant but has anatomical characteristics that are intermediate between C3 and C4 plants ( PROTA, 2023 ). Haslam (1969a , b ; 1970 ; 1972 ) and Mal and Narine (2004) provide much useful ecological data for P. australis . Emergent bud width which determines the basal stem diameter is a good predictor of growth rate and ultimate shoot height of the plant in developing reed populations. In good conditions, strong, tall stems with large, horizontally held leaves are produced which permit the plant to compete efficiently for available light. The root system is large and well-adapted to anaerobic conditions common in submerged soils, as they possess aerenchymatous tissues to provide gas ventilation from the leaves.

 conditions, strong, tall stems with large, horizontally held leaves are produced which permit the plant to compete efficiently for available light. The root system is large and well-adapted to anaerobic conditions common in submerged soils, as they possess aerenchymatous tissues to provide gas ventilation from the leaves. P. australis exhibits a combination of long, thick, unbranched roots that penetrate the substrate, plus smaller, much-branched roots infiltrating the water and surface layers of the sediment. Together, the two root types maximize the chances of roots successfully tapping available nutrients, even in the crowded conditions typical of the reed swamp habitat. In a dense stand of P. australis , underground parts (rhizome, root and bases of stems) may comprise up to 80% of total biomass. Reeds may show substantial productivity under favourable conditions, with a growth rate reported in USA being up to 4cm/day ( Gucker, 2008 ). Nevertheless, the plant litter it produces can reduce its growth rate ( PROTA, 2023 ). Alongside this strong competitive element in the life strategy of Phragmites reeds, there is evidence for the presence of at least some traits for tolerance of disturbance. They are aggressive, fast-growing colonizers of empty habitats suited to its growth, such as observed in newly created Dutch polders, in land exposed by the receding of the Caspian Sea. These reeds were one of the first colonizers of Krakatau (Indonesia) following the 1883 volcanic eruption ( Ridley, 1930 ). In artificial drainage channels such as those in arable lands in eastern England, reed colonization after dredging operations is rapid, usually requiring clearance measures (herbicide or mechanical) within 2-3 years if channel functioning is to be maintained. In the absence of appropriate control, channels may become completely blocked by reed vegetation. Young plants of P. australis can

 ( Ridley, 1930 ). In artificial drainage channels such as those in arable lands in eastern England, reed colonization after dredging operations is rapid, usually requiring clearance measures (herbicide or mechanical) within 2-3 years if channel functioning is to be maintained. In the absence of appropriate control, channels may become completely blocked by reed vegetation. Young plants of P. australis can be produced through in-vitro culture of immature inflorescences. A micropropagation system has been developed using 2,4-D to initiate callus growth and myoinositol to induce somatic embryogenesis ( PROTA, 2023 ). Associations Phragmites australis is often found associated with other wetland plants, including species of Spartina , Carex , Nymphaea , Typha , Glyceria , Juncus , Myrica , Triglochin , Calamagrostis , Galium and Phalaris ( PROTA, 2023 ) . Environmental Requirements Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan (boreal to tropical) and highly adaptable emergent grass of freshwater to brackish water normally up to 10 ppt total dissolved salts ( Sainty and Jacobs, 1988 ). It is found in systems of widely varying nutrient status from oligotrophic to eutrophic ( Haslam, 1972 ; Hocking et al., 1983 ). It is rare in very nutrient-poor waters, and although it may occur in hypertrophic conditions, plant could suffer die-back ( Klotzli, 1971 ; Nijburg and Laanbroek, 1997 ). Its growth is reported as limited by low nitrogen or phosphorus levels, and by tidal flooding ( PROTA, 2023 ). It is especially common in alkaline environments although it can also thrive in highly acidic wetlands ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). The preferred pH range is 7.0 to 9.3 ( PROTA

It is especially common in alkaline environments although it can also thrive in highly acidic wetlands ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). The preferred pH range is 7.0 to 9.3 ( PROTA, 2023 ). Maximum salinity tolerances have been reported from 12 ppt in the United Kingdom, to 29 ppt in New York, USA, to 40 ppt on the Red Sea coast ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Al-Garni (2006) found P. australis to make greater growth at moderate salinity of 2.9 ppt NaCl but sharply reduced its growth at 14.6-17.5 ppt, though the tolerance of salinity varies among different subspecies. The introduced Eurasian form apparently has a somewhat higher tolerance of salinity than the native American subspecies ( Vasquez et al., 2005 ). Phragmites australis usually (but not exclusively) prefers stationary or slow-moving waters, and areas of land with a high-water table, or that are seasonally inundated. It occurs as a marginal or bankside species along many watercourses, growing best where the water level fluctuates from 15 cm below soil surface to 15 cm above, but can grow to depths of 1 m in water ( PROTA, 2023 ). It has been found in alpine waters, especially where nutrient pollution has occurred ( Blake et al., 1986 ). Phragmites australis is reported from many rainfall regimes but can occur in areas with rainfall as low as 50-100 mm per year ( PROTA, 2023 ). It grows on most soil textures from fine clays to sandy loams ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Areas with some

It grows on most soil textures from fine clays to sandy loams ( Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), 2023 ). Areas with some water movement promote the creation of floating mats or islands, growing without soil contact ( PROTA, 2023 ). Phragmites australis tolerates fires, if growing with water above the soil surface. It also tolerates late season droughts and will remain green until the start of frosts in autumn. It does not tolerate heavy grazing ( PROTA, 2023 ). The species has a wide climatic tolerance, growing in areas from -39°C to 34°C. It is also reported to grow in temperatures up to 44°C, when water is abundant ( Gucker, 2008 ).

Flowering occurs from July to October.FruitThe seeds are brown, light weight, and about 0.3 in. (8 mm) long. In the fall the plant turns brown, and the inflorescences persist throughout the winter.Ecological ThreatPhragmites australisis usually found in dense thickets growing in or near shallow water. These thickets displace native wetlands plants, alter hydrology and block sunlight to the aquatic community. It is native to Eurasia and Africa. Native Phragmites do occur in the United States and they are sometimes very difficult to distinguish from the exotics.IntroductionMembers of the genusPhragmitesare superficially similar toArundo donax. Sterile specimens ofP. australisare sometimes misidentified asArundo donax, a grass introduced to North
America from Asia and now troublesome in natural areas, especially in California. The
genera can be distinguished when in flower because the glumes ofPhragmitesare glabrous
while those ofArundoare covered with soft, whitish hairs 6-8 mm long. In addition, the
glumes are much shorter than the lemmas inPhragmites.Stewardship summaryCommunities that have stablePhragmitespopulations present but have been exposed to

indicates thatPhragmiteshas spread, or is spreading and threatening the integrity of rare
communities, invading the habitat of rare plants or animals or interfering with the wildlife
support function of refuges. Cutting, burning, application of herbicides (in particular
Rodeo), or water management schemes are possible control measures. The measure(s)
used will depend on a number of factors including the size and locationNatural historyRangePhragmites australisis found on every continent except Antarctica and may have the
widest distribution of any flowering plant.[1]It is common in and near
freshwater, brackish and alkaline wetlands in the temperate zones world-wide. It may also
be found in some tropical wetlands but is absent from the Amazon Basin and central
Africa. It is widespread in the United states, typically growing in marshes, swamps, fens,
and prairie potholes, usually inhabiting the marsh-upland interface where it may form
continuous belts.[2]BecausePhragmiteshas invaded and formed near-monotypic stands in some North
American wetlands only in recent decades there has been some debate as to whether it is
indigenous to this continent or not. Convincing evidence that it was here long before

European contact is now available from at least two sources. Niering and Warren (1977)[3]found remains ofPhragmitesin cores of 3000 year old peat from tidal marshes in
Connecticut. IdentifiablePhragmitesremains dating from 600 to 900 A.D. and
constituting parts of a twined mat and other woven objects were found during
archaeological investigations of Anasazi sites in southwestern Colorado (Kane & Gross
1986;).[4]There is some suspicion that although the species itself is indigenous to North America,
new, more invasive genotype(s) were introduced from the Old World.[5]Hauber et al. (1991)[6]found that invasivePhragmitespopulations in the Mississippi
River Delta differed genetically from a more stable population near New Orleans. They
also examined populations elsewhere on the Gulf coast, from extreme southern Texas to
the Florida panhandle, and found no genetic differences between those populations and the
one near New Orleans.[7]This increased their suspicion that the
invasive biotypes were introduced to the Delta from somewhere outside the Gulf relatively
recently.Phragmitesis frequently regarded as an aggressive, unwanted invader in the East and
Upper Midwest. It has also earned this reputation in the Mississippi River Delta of
southern Louisiana, where over the last 50 years, it has displaced species that provided
valuable forage for wildlife, particularly migratory waterfowl.[6]In other
parts of coastal Louisiana, however, it is feared thatPhragmitesis declining as a result of

increasing saltwater intrusion in the brackish marshes it occupies.Phragmitesis apparently
decreasing in Texas as well due to invasion of its habitat by the alien grassArundo donax.[8]Similarly,Phragmitesis present in the Pacific states
but is not regarded as a problem there. In fact, throughout the western U.S. there is some
concern over decreases in the species habitat and losses of populations.Habitat:Phragmitesis especially common in alkaline and brackish (slightly saline) environments[9][10], and can also thrive in highly acidic wetlands.[11]However,Phragmitesdoes not require, nor even prefer these habitats to
freshwater areas. Its growth is greater in fresh water but it may be outcompeted in these
areas by other species that cannot tolerate brackish, alkaline or acidic waters. It is often
found in association with other wetland plants including species from the following
genera: Spartina, Carex, Nymphaea, Typha, Glyceria, Juncus, Myrica,
Triglochin, Calamagrostis, Galium, and Phalaris.[12]Phragmitesoccurs in disturbed areas as well as pristine sites. It is especially common
along railroad tracks, roadside ditches, and piles of dredge spoil, wherever even slight
depressions hold water.[13]Penko (pers. comm. 1993)[14]has observed stuntedPhragmitesgrowing on acidic tailings (Ph 2.9) from an abandoned copper mine in

along railroad tracks, roadside ditches, and piles of dredge spoil, wherever even slight
depressions hold water.[13]Penko (pers. comm. 1993)[14]has observed stuntedPhragmitesgrowing on acidic tailings (Ph 2.9) from an abandoned copper mine in
Vermont. Various types of human manipulation and/or disturbance are thought to
promotePhragmites.[2]For example, restriction of the tidal inundation
of a marsh may result in a lowering of the water table, which may in turn favorPhragmites. Likewise, sedimentation may promote the spread ofPhragmitesby elevating a
marsh's substrate surface and effectively reducing the frequency of tidal inundation.[15]A number of explanations have been proposed to account for the recent dramatic increases
inPhragmitespopulations in the northeastern and Great Lakes States. As noted above,
habitat manipulations and disturbances caused by humans are thought to have a role. In
some areasPhragmitesmay also have been promoted by the increases in soil salinity which
result when de-icing salt washes off roads and into nearby ditches and wetlands.[16]On the other hand, bare patches of road sand washed into ditches
and wetlands may be of greater importance.Phragmitesseeds are shed from November
through January and so may be among the first propagules to reach these sites. If the
seeds germinate and become established the young plants will usually persist for at least
two years in a small, rather inconspicuous stage, resembling many other grasses. Later,
perhaps after the input of nutrients, they may take off and assume the tall growth form that
makes the species easily identifiable. Increases in soil nutrient concentrations, may come

 for at least
two years in a small, rather inconspicuous stage, resembling many other grasses. Later,
perhaps after the input of nutrients, they may take off and assume the tall growth form that
makes the species easily identifiable. Increases in soil nutrient concentrations, may come
from runoff from farms and urban areas. It has also been suggested increases in nutrient
concentrations, especially nitrates, are primarily responsible for increases inPhragmitespopulations. Ironically, eutrophication and increases in nitrate levels are sometimes blamed
for the decline ofPhragmitespopulations in Europe (Den Hartog et al. 1989).Ecology:Salinity and depth to the water table are among the factors which control the distribution
and performance ofPhragmites. Maximum salinity tolerances vary from population to
population; reported maxima range from 12 ppt (1.2%) in Britain to 29 ppt in New York
state to 40 ppt on the Red Sea coast.[17]Dense stands normally lose
more water through evapotranspiration than is supplied by rain.[18]However,
rhizomes can reach down almost 2 meters below ground, their roots penetrating even
deeper, allowing the plant to reach low lying ground water.[18]Killing frosts
may knock the plants back temporarily but can ultimately increase stand densities by
stimulating bud development.[19]Phragmiteshas a low tolerance for wave and current action which can break its culms
(vertical stems) and impede bud formation in the rhizomes.[18]It can survive,
and in fact thrive, in stagnant waters where the sediments are poorly aerated at best.[18]Air spaces in the above-ground stems and in the rhizomes themselves
assure the underground parts of the plant with a relatively fresh supply of air. This
characteristic and the species' salinity tolerance

 impede bud formation in the rhizomes.[18]It can survive,
and in fact thrive, in stagnant waters where the sediments are poorly aerated at best.[18]Air spaces in the above-ground stems and in the rhizomes themselves
assure the underground parts of the plant with a relatively fresh supply of air. This
characteristic and the species' salinity tolerance allow it to grow where few others can
survive.[18]In addition the build up of litter from the aerial shoots within
stands prevents or discourages other species from germinating and becoming established.[20]The rhizomes and adventitious roots themselves form dense mats that
further discourage competitors. These characteristics are what enablePhragmitesto
spread, push other species out and form monotypic stands.Such stands may alter the wetlands they colonize, eliminating habitat for valued animal
species. On the other hand, the abundant cover of litter inPhragmitesstands may provide
habitat for some small mammals, insects and reptiles. The aerial stems provide nesting
sites for several species of birds, and Song Sparrows have been seen eatingPhragmites'seeds.[15]Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) usePhragmitesfor emergency cover when low lying marshes are swept by storm tides and for
food when better habitats are overpopulated.[21]Studies conducted in Europe indicate that gall-forming and stem- boring insects may

25 to 60% in stands heavily infested with lepidopteran stem- or rhizome-borers. Hayden
(1947)[27]suggested that aphids (Hyalopterus pruni) heavily damaged aPhragmitesstand in Iowa. On the other hand work in Europe by Pintera (1971)[28]indicated that
although high densities of aphids may bring about reductions inPhragmitesshoot height
and leaf area they had little effect on shoot weight. Like other emergent macrophytes,Phragmiteshas tough leaves and appears to suffer little grazing by leaf-chewing insects.[29]As mentioned above, there is great concern about recent declines inPhragmitesin Europe
where the species is still used for thatch. In fact, the journal Aquatic Botany devoted an
entire issue (volume 35 no.1, September 1989) to this subject. Factors believed
responsible for the declines include habitat destruction and manipulation of hydrologic
regimes by humans, grazing, sedimentation and decreased water quality (eutrophication).[30]Detailed reviews of the ecology and physiological ecology ofPhragmitesare provided by

by van der Merff et al..[31]Reproduction:Phragmitesis typically the dominant species on areas that it occupies. It is capable of
vigorous vegetative reproduction and often forms dense, virtually monospecific stands.
Hara et al. (1993)[32]classify sparse stands as those with densities of less than 100 culms m-2
and dense stands as those with densities of up to about 200 culms m-2 in wet areas or up
to 300 culms m-2 in dry areas. Mammalian and avian numbers and diversity in the dense
stands are typically low.[33]Newly opened sites may be colonized
by seed or by rhizome fragments carried to the area by humans in soils and on machinery
during construction or naturally in floodwaters.The plants generally flower and set seed between July and September and may produce
great quantities of seed. In the northeast, seeds are dispersed between November and
January. However, in some cases, most or all of the seed produced is not viable.[1]The seeds are normally dispersed by wind but may be transported by birds such as
red-winged blackbirds that nest among the reeds.[9]Following seed set,
nutrients are translocated down into the rhizomes and the above- ground portions of the
plant die back for the season.[19]Temperature, salinity and water levels affect seed germination. Water depths of more than
5 cm and salinities above 20 ppt (2%) prevent germination.[1][34]Germination is not affected by salinities below 10 ppt (1%) but declines at higher
salinities. Percentage germination increases with increasing temperature from 16 to 25 oC

5 cm and salinities above 20 ppt (2%) prevent germination.[1][34]Germination is not affected by salinities below 10 ppt (1%) but declines at higher
salinities. Percentage germination increases with increasing temperature from 16 to 25 oC
while the time required to germinate decreases from 25 to 10 days over the same
temperature range. Barry Truitt[35]has observed that areas covered by
thick mats of wrack washed up during storms and high water events are frequently
colonized byPhragmiteson the Virginia Coast Reserve. It is not clear whether it
establishes from rhizome pieces washed in with the wrack or from seed that blows in later.Once a new stand ofPhragmitestakes hold it spreads, predominantly through vegetative
reproduction. Individual rhizomes live for 3 to 6 years and buds develop at the base of the
vertical type late in the summer each year. These buds mature and typically grow about 1
meter (up to 10 m in newly colonized, nutrient-rich areas) horizontally before terminating
in an upward apex and going dormant until spring. The apex then grows upward into a
vertical rhizome which in turn produces buds that will form more vertical rhizomes.
Vertical rhizomes also produce horizontal rhizome buds, completing the vegetative cycle.
These rhizomes provide the plant with a large absorbent surface that brings the plant
nutrients from the aquatic medium.[36]The aerial shoots
arise from the rhizomes. They are most vigorous at the periphery of a stand where they
arise from horizontal rhizomes, as opposed to old verticals.[9]ConditionPhragmitescan be regarded as a stable, natural component of a wetland community if the

arise from horizontal rhizomes, as opposed to old verticals.[9]ConditionPhragmitescan be regarded as a stable, natural component of a wetland community if the
habitat is pristine and the population does not appear to be expanding. Many native
populations ofPhragmitesare "benign" and pose little or no threat to other species and
should be left intact. Examples of areas with stable, native populations include sea-level
fens in Delaware and Virginia and along Mattagota Stream in Maine.[37][38]In Europe, a healthy reed belt is defined as a "homogeneous, dense or
sparse stand with no gaps in its inner parts, with an evenly formed lakeside borderline
without aisles, shaping a uniform fringe or large lobes, stalk length decreasing gradually at
the lakeside border, but all stalks of one stand of similar height; at the landside edge the
reeds are replaced by sedge or woodland communities or by unfertilized grasslands".[30]Stable populations may be difficult to distinguish from invasive populations, but one
should examine such factors as site disturbance and the earliest collection dates of the
species to arrive at a determination. If available, old and recent aerial photos can be
compared to determine whether stands in a given area are expanding or not.[15]Phragmitesis a problem when and where stands appear to be spreading while other

species typical the of the community are diminishing. Disturbances or stresses such as
pollution, alteration of the natural hydrologic regime, dredging, and increased
sedimentation favor invasion and continued spread ofPhragmites.[2]Other factors that may have favored recent invasion and spread ofPhragmitesinclude
increases in soil salinity (from fresh to brackish) and/or nutrient concentrations, especially
nitrate, and the introduction of a more invasive genotype(s) from the Old World(see GLOBAL RANGE section for further
discussion).[16][5]Michael Lefor asserts that one reason for the general spread ofPhragmiteshas been the
destabilization of the landscape (pers. comm. 1993). In urban landscapes water is apt to
collect in larger volumes and pass through more quickly (flashily) than formerly. This
tends to destabilize substrates leaving bare soil open for colonization. Watersheds
throughout eastern North America are flashier due to the proliferation of paved surfaces,
lawns and roofs and the fact that upstream wetlands are largely filled with postsettlement/
post agricultural sediments from initial land-clearing operations.Many Atlantic coast wetland systems have been invaded byPhragmitesas a result of tidal
restrictions imposed by roads, water impoundments, dikes and tide gates. Tide gates have
been installed in order to drain marshes to harvest salt hay, to control mosquito breeding
and, most recently, to protect coastal development from flooding during storms. This
alteration of marsh systems may favorPhragmitesinvasion by reducing tidal action and
soil water salinity and lowering water tables.Phragmitesinvasions may threaten wildlife because they alter the structure and function

above ground portions of the plant die and dry out.[41]Dense congregations of

dense stands have obscured vistas intended by the park's designer, Frederick Law
Olmstead.[14]As noted abovePhragmitesis not considered a threat in the West or most areas in the Gulf
states.Areas that have been invaded byPhragmiteshave excellent potential for recovery.
Management programs have proven thatPhragmitescan be controlled, and natural
vegetation will return. However, monitoring is imperative becausePhragmitestends to
reinvade and control techniques may need to be applied several times or, perhaps, in
perpetuity. It is also important to note that some areas have been so heavily manipulated
and degraded that it may be impossible to eliminatePhragmitesfrom them. For example, it
may be especially difficult to controlPhragmitesin freshwater impoundments that were
previously salt marshes.Management/MonitoringInvasive populations ofPhragmitesmust be managed in order to protect rare plants that it
might outcompete, valued animals whose habitat it might dominate and degrade, and
healthy ecosystems that it might greatly alter.Cultural, mechanical and/or chemical methods can be used to controlPhragmites. The

time. No organisms which significantly damagePhragmites australisbut do not feed on
other plant species have been identified. Naturally occurring parasites have not proven to
be successful controls.[25][45][26]In addition, some of the arthropods that feed onPhragmitesare killed
by winter fires and thus would likely be eliminated from the systems where prescribed fires
are used. Coots, nutria, and muskrats may feed onPhragmitesbut appear to have limited
impacts on its populations.[46]BurningPrescribed burning does not reduce the growing ability ofPhragmitesunless
root burn occurs. Root burn seldom occurs, however, because the rhizomes are usually
covered by a layer of soil, mud and/or water. Fires inPhragmitesstands are dangerous
because this species can cause spot-fires over 100 feet away.[47]Burning does
remove accumulatedPhragmitesleaf litter, giving the seeds of other species area to
germinate. Prescribed burning has been used with success after chemical treatment for this
purpose at The Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, NJ (Beall 1984)[47]and in Delaware.[48]Occasional burning has been used in Delaware in

conjunction with intensive spraying and water level management. This helps remove old
canes and allows other vegetation to grow.[49]At Wallops Island, Virginia, a small (100' x 400') brackish to saline to dry wetland was
burned November 1990 to controlPhragmites.[50]A variety of
other species appeared in the year following the burn but they appeared leggy while thePhragmitesremained vigorous. A second winter burn is planned and monitoring of
transects will continue (there are no pre-treatment data).At Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge in New York, a 20-30 acre freshwater
impoundment was drained in the fall of 1989, burned the following winter and then
reflooded.[51]Phragmiteswas eliminated from the half of the
marsh that was treated and the area remained free of the grass through 1992.According to Cross and Fleming (1989)[46], late summer burns may be effective, but winter
and spring burning may in fact increase the densities of spring crops. Thompson and Shay
(1985)[52]performed experimental burn treatments on Delta Marsh, Manitoba. They found
that spring, summer and fall burns resulted in higher total shoot densities and lower mean
shoot weights than on controls primarily as a result of greater densities of shorter, thinner
vegetative shoots. Shoot biomass was greater in spring-burned and fall-burned plots than
in control areas but less on summer- burned plots. They also found that below-ground
production increased following spring and fall burns but not following summer burns. The
increase in light availability following burns generally appears to benefitPhragmites. A
variety of understory responses to these burns was noted.

production increased following spring and fall burns but not following summer burns. The
increase in light availability following burns generally appears to benefitPhragmites. A
variety of understory responses to these burns was noted. For example, summer burns
increased species diversity, richness, and evenness, although certain species declined.[52]In Connecticut late spring burns followed by manual flooding with salt water was
successful in reducingPhragmitesheight and density.[53]After
three years, the fuel load was exhausted; the process was very expensive and selfregulating
tide gates were installed instead (see MANIPULATION OF WATER LEVEL
AND SALINITY).In Europe, experimental removal of litter in winter resulted in doubling the above-ground
biomass.[54]Increased light availability at the soil surface and aeration of the
soil around the rhizomes may have been responsible for this increase. Burning in the
winter in an experimental field caused little damage, while burning during the emergence
period led to the death of the majority ofPhragmitesshoots.[25]ChemicalRodeo®, a water solution of the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate is
commonly used forPhragmitescontrol. This herbicide is not, however, selective and will
kill grasses and broadleaved plants alike. Toxicity tests indicate that it is virtually nontoxic
to all aquatic animals tested. It should be noted that many of these tests were
performed by or for Monsanto, the company which manufactures Rodeo.

Bioconcentration values for glyphosate in fish tissues were insignificant. Glyphosate
biodegrades quickly and completely in the environment into natural products including
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphate and water. Finally, since glyphosate does not
volatilize, it will not vaporize from a treated site and move to a non-target area.[55][56][57][58]Rodeo must be mixed with water and a surfactant which allows it to stick to and
subsequently be absorbed by the plant.[47]Instructions for application, amounts
needed per acre, the approved surfactants and ratios for mixing, are on the Rodeo label.
Glyphosate must be mixed with clean or, if possible, distilled water because it binds tightly
to sediments and is thus rendered non-toxic to plants.[59]This
limits its effectiveness but also may help prevent it from acting on plants that were not
originally targeted. Rodeo should not by applied in windy conditions, as the spray will drift.[60]It also should not be applied if rain is forecast within 12
hours because it will wash away before it has a chance to act.[61]Application
rates may vary but, as one example, effective control ofPhragmitesin a Delaware marsh
was achieved with 4 pints/acre of concentrate.[48]Application of Rodeo must take place after the tasseling stage when the plant is supplying
nutrients to the rhizome. At this time, when Rodeo is sprayed onto the foliage of aquatic

nutrients to the rhizome. At this time, when Rodeo is sprayed onto the foliage of aquatic
weeds, it translocates into the roots. Rodeo interferes with essential plant growth
processes, causing gradual wilting, yellowing, browning and deterioration of the plant.
Studies on tasseling at the Augustine Tidal area, in Port Penn Delaware, indicated that
tasseling in a stand is never 100% but that it is possible to spray when 94% of the plants
are tasseling. In dense stands, subdominant plants are protected by the thick canopy and
thus may not receive adequate herbicide. For these reasons, touch up work will be
necessary.[62]At Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, Rodeo was applied aerially after the plants
tasseled in late August. The application resulted in a 90% success. The following
February, a fast moving prescribed burn was carried out to remove litter, exposing the
seed bed for re-establishment of marsh vegetation. However funding was not available for
several years andPhragmiteshas returned to 90% of the previously treated areas.[63]Treatment was resumed in fall 1991.In September, 1983, at the Prime Hook Wildlife Refuge in Delaware, 500 acres of
freshwater impoundments were sprayed with Rodeo from a helicopter forPhragmitescontrol. The plants yellowed within 10 days. The following May aerial and ground
evaluations of the sprayed area revealed a 98% kill ofPhragmites.[61]In addition

to applying herbicide, Prime Hook manipulates water levels with a stop log to stressPhragmites; winter water levels are held at an elevation of 2.8' msl until June, when water
would otherwise be held at 2.2 msl. The combined spraying and water management
approach was successful and many aquatic plants returned. A regime of spraying in
August-September for two years followed by flooding has been used through 1991.[49]Annual costs ofPhragmitescontrol are $20K annual at Prime Hook
(1,000 acres) and $3K at Bombay Hook (20-60 acres); monitoring costs, which include
reading vegetation transects for species presence and density each September are not
included in the cost.Aerial spraying has been used since 1983 in many Delaware state wildlife refuges.[48]Using Rodeo, the state sprays freshwater and brackish
impoundments, brackish marshes, and salt marshes from early September to early October;
this is combined with winter burns between the first and second year of spraying. Areas
will be spot-treated whenever needed after that. The herbicide treatments consist of 4
pints/acre the first year and 2 pints/acre the second, with an average cost of $65/acre. The
state is involved with cost-sharing programs with private landowners where the state pays
half the spraying cost with a willing owner. Desirable native vegetation usually returns

an 18-mile long freshwater impoundment was terminated due to budget cuts.Phragmitesquickly reclaimed the area, estimated to be 100-150 acres total in small scattered stands.[64]In September 1991, spraying with Rodeo began again; it is
expected that the entire area will be sprayed again in 1992, and that small areas of regrowth
will be sprayed in 1993. Because the area is impounded, the water level usually is
lower in the spring, which helps preventPhragmitesregrowth.Herbicides are used at Tinicum Environmental Center, because other control options are
limited. Unplanned burns do occur, but prescribed burns are not allowed due to the
proximity to the highway and airport. Tinicum was recently granted $2M to restore a 18-
acre site. Here they will be altering the elevation of the marsh, seeding with native plants,
and monitoring the results.[65]At Parker National Wildlife Refuge, an aerial spraying program (annual budget $5K) for
50 acres of a 100-acre freshwater impoundment began in mid-August 1991. A winter burn
is anticipated and a second year of spraying planned. Results will be monitored by using
aerial photos to delineate the boundaries of thePhragmitesclones. A nearby tower also
provides a suitable viewing point to observe progress.[66]In more fragile situations wherePhragmitesis threatening a rare plant or community,

community that the entire operation was designed to protect. Glyphosate can be applied to
specific plants and areas by hand with a backpack sprayer. Wayne Klockner of The Nature
Conservancy's Maryland Field Office has been successful in eliminating mostPhragmitesat
the Nassawango preserve by applying glyphosate by hand with a backpack sprayer.[15]The control program there began in 1983; actual spraying
is conducted along the power line ROW by Delmarva Power.[67]Delmarva Power generally sprays with trucks, backpacks or helicopter, depending on the
accessibility of the area and presence of rare plants nearby.[68]They use Rodeo in tidal areas, and Accord®(another glyphosate product) in non-tidal
areas from mid-August to mid-October, when the plants are going to seed. They spray
intensively the first year, and conduct touch-up spraying the second year which eliminates
90-95% of the plants. They then return every three years to eliminate any new plants.
They do not spray if the plants are not tasselling and are short.Rodeo was used at Cape May Meadows in 1989, 1990, and 1991. It was applied with a 30

in the area following treatment were shorter and the stand was less dense (determined
visually). However the dead stalks remained and blocked views from the trail.In Connecticut a 5m x 23 m patch ofPhragmiteshas been treated with a hand-held spray
of Rodeo (1988 and 1989) and Roundup (1990 and 1991) for four years in late Augustearly
September. ThePhragmitesis shorter and less dense at the site but it is still present
(Lapin pers. obs.). Actions to supplement and enhance herbicide applications including the
removal of tassels (1991) and removal of dead stalks (planned 1992), have been and will
be taken.Other chemicals have been used onPhragmitesand are described in Cross and Fleming
(1989)[46].
Also see CUTTING at Constitution Marsh for another method of application.CuttingCutting has been used successfully to controlPhragmites. Since it is a grass,
cutting several times during a season, at the wrong times, may increase stand density.[70]However, if cut just before the end of July, most of the food reserves
produced that season are removed with the aerial portion of the plant, reducing the plant's
vigor. This regime may eliminate a colony if carried out annually for several years. Care

(before tassel set) in 1989 around a gas well in a freshwater wetland.[71]The preferred tool was an old-fashioned hedge trimmer with an 8" flat blade with
serrations manufactured by Union Fork and Hoe. The trimmers worked better than
loppers and were safer than sickles; a circular blade on a weed whacker was also used and
proved to be faster and good for staff but it was more dangerous for volunteers and
detracted from the atmosphere of the work-day.[72]Small patches (10' x 50') in a New York freshwater system were cut at the end of July or
the beginning of August for two successive years with positive results.[73]The hand-cut material was removed from the site and thrown on a brush
pile (unfortunately it was located too close to the water and returned to the system).Massachusetts Audubon staff have cut the perimeter around a 0.25 acrePhragmitespatch
at the end of July since 1986 in a freshwater wetland at Daniel Webster Preserve in

buckets with a flexible cable to cut an area with 75% cover ofPhragmitesand 20-25' of
muck.[76][77]Cutting this 10-
acre plot three times during the summer (April, June, August) cost $150K. The cut
material was stockpiled nearby where it was to be burned in the winter when it was
washed away in a severe storm. In winter 1992, the town plans to open the tide gate and
allow flushing to prevent further return ofPhragmites. Results are not yet known.Cutting culms to 6" followed by addition of rock salt on a 10' x 10' patch appeared to have
reduced the height and density ofPhragmitesin a salt marsh in Greenwich, CT.[78]Continued observations indicated that this trend appeared to continue.[79]Cutting an area 25' x 25' to waist height with a hedge clippers and the applying one drop

and 1992 in a freshwater tidal wetland around the perimeter of a one-acre patch has
prevented subsequent expansion of the patch. Monitoring using aerial photos taken at fiveyear
intervals indicated the control success. Cutting was done with hand-held cutters and
gas-powered hedge trimmers, which were very efficient. Cut material was removed from
the site and allowed to decompose on upland areas. In a second area, similar efforts in a
calcareous wetland 1990-1992 were monitored by placing red survey wires around the
perimeter of the patch. Preliminary observations indicate a cessation ofPhragmitesexpansion.In Europe, Weisner and Graneli[81]found that oxygen transport was reduced by
cutting the culms above and below the water surface;cutting below the water in June
almost totally inhibited regrowth of shoots the following summer, while cutting above
water reduced regrowth of shoots. Cutting in August did not reduce growth the following
summer. Cutting in sandy substrates was minimally effective, while cutting on calcareous

 OF WATER LEVEL AND SALINITY.Grazing, dredging, and drainingGrazing, dredging, and draining are other
methods that have often been used to reduce stand vigor.[12]However, draining and dredging are not appropriate for use on most preserves.[70]Grazing may trample the rhizomes and reduce vigor but the results are limited.[46]Van Deursen and Drost[82]found that cattle consumed 67-98% of
above-ground biomass; in a four year study, they found that reed populations may reach
new equilibria under grazing regimes.Manipulation of water level and salinityA self-regulating tide gate
which reintroduced saltwater tidal action was used to help restore a diked marsh in
Fairfield, Connecticut.[53][83]A 1-3
foot reduction in stem height resulted over each of three years . In addition to reduced
height, plant density declined dramatically from 11.3 plants m-2 in 1980 to 3.3 plants/ m-2
the following year. In following years,Phragmitescontinued to decline, although less
dramatically. In addition to the decreased height and density of thePhragmitesstands,
typical marsh flora includingSalicornia, Distichilis, Spartina alternifloraLoisel. andS. patens(Aiton) Muhl. returned. Depending on
topography and elevation,Phragmiteswas eliminated in large areas and continues to
remain short and sparse in other areas through 1992. Hence, reintroduced tidal action and
salinity can reducePhragmitesvigor and restore the community's integrity. This has been
implemented successfully in other degraded former salt marshes in Connecticut.[84]Flooding can be used to controlPhragmiteswhen 3 feet of water covers

 large areas and continues to
remain short and sparse in other areas through 1992. Hence, reintroduced tidal action and
salinity can reducePhragmitesvigor and restore the community's integrity. This has been
implemented successfully in other degraded former salt marshes in Connecticut.[84]Flooding can be used to controlPhragmiteswhen 3 feet of water covers the rhizome for
an extended period during the growing season, usually four months.[47]However, many areas can not be flooded to such depths. Furthermore, flooding could
destroy the communities or plants targeted for protection.Open Marsh Water Management (OMWM) has been used as a method to controlPhragmites. Plugging of ditches and addition of culverts to raise the soil salinities appears
to have causedPhragmitesdie-back over the last four growing seasons at Fireplace Neck,
New York.[84][85]Hellings and Gallagher (1992)[42]found thatPhragmiteswas negatively impacted by
increasing salinity and increased flooding. They also found that cutting and subsequent
flooding also reduced growth and survival in outdoor experiments. They suggest thatPhragmitesmay be controlled by increasing flooding and salinity levels. Matoh, Matsushita
and Takahashi (1988)[86]also found reduction in vigor with increased salinity. However death
apparently occurred only when cutting was combined with brackish flooding.[42]In Europe, episodic freshwater flooding occurring early in the growing season has been
suggested as one of the reasons for reed population declines.[87]McKee et
al. (1989)[88]investigated root metabolic changes due to freshwater flooding and labelledPhragmitesas a flood-tolerant species.Also see Chincoteague NWR under CHEMICALS, Wertheim NWR under BURNING,

and Town of Quincy under CUTTING for additional references.Mowing, disking, and pullingBeall (1984)[47]discourages mowing and disking.
Mowing only affects the above ground portion of the plant, so mowing would have to
occur annually. To remove the rhizome, disking could be employed. However, discing
could potentially result in an increase ofPhragmitessince pieces of the rhizome can
produce new plants. Cross and Fleming (1989)[46]describe successful mowing regimes of
several year duration during the summer (August and September) and disking in summer
or fall.In Cape May Meadows, New Jersey, a brackish to freshwater non- tidal sandy area, an
attempt was made to remove rhizomes by pulling to a depth of three feet.[69]This resulted in a very sparsePhragmitesstand the following year. However
it was very labor-intensive (using 130 people- hours to cover a 50 ft<sup2 patch) and could be
applied best to sandy soils.In a private yard,Phragmiteswas mowed and a thin layer of soil and grass seed were
added. This was mowed weekly over the course of the summer. In the second summer
shoots ofPhragmitesoccurred around the edges. The rhizomes were decomposing after
this treatment.[50]PlasticClear plastic six-mil thick, 12 x 17 m, weighing 51.8 kg, was carried

shoots ofPhragmitesoccurred around the edges. The rhizomes were decomposing after
this treatment.[50]PlasticClear plastic six-mil thick, 12 x 17 m, weighing 51.8 kg, was carried into a
North Carolina marsh by air and held in place by sandbags.[89][90]Plants were initially cut to 6-8" with a hand-pushed bush hog[91]or a weedeater with blade, with an area of 20 x 20 m taking several days to cut. The cut
material was left and the plastic put over the area. The high temperatures under the plastic
caused die-off ofPhragmitesin 3-4 days. After 8-10 weeks, the plastic deteriorated. The
rhizomes appeared to have died back, but the project was of short duration and the results
were not monitored the following year.[91]Turner[92]noted that follow-ups in subsequent years indicatedPhragmitesreturned but not as
densely. Plastic management in each 12 x 12 m plot took an average of 53 hours,
compared with 17 hours to cut and three hours to burn.[90]Clear plastic in two narrow swaths (70 m x 20 m) was placed along the edge of a tidal
brackish pond after hand-cutting thePhragmitesat the end of July 1991.[74]comm. 1992). One plot, in total sun, had a complete kill ofPhragmitesin 10 days, while
the plot in partial shade had a partial kill. It is unknown how the plastic was kept in place
or what was done with the cut material.Clear and black plastic were used on 50' circular areas at Constitution Marsh in New York

the plot in partial shade had a partial kill. It is unknown how the plastic was kept in place
or what was done with the cut material.Clear and black plastic were used on 50' circular areas at Constitution Marsh in New York
in 1990 and 1991.[80]Although there was difficulty due to tidal
influence, the plastic was weighted down with rocks and appeared to kill what is under it.
Runners along the edge were treated with a syringe application of Roundup in August. In
November 1991, a hole cut in the middle of the black plastic provided the opportunity for
cattail shoots to germinate. After the first year there was viablePhragmitesin the areas
covered. It appeared that the black plastic was more effective, due to the higher heat levels
attained.[93]Monitoring RequirementsPhragmitespopulations require close monitoring in order to determine whether they are
increasing in area or not. Populations that are growing may quickly threaten or even
eliminate rare elements. Monitoring provides the data needed in order to decide if control
measures are necessary. If and when a control program is begun it is important to monitor
targeted populations so that the program's effectiveness can be determined. If it is possible
to leave untreated control areas without jeopardizing the success of the control program
these should be monitored as well for comparison. It is imperative to continue monitoring
even if a control program succeeds initially becausePhragmitesmay reinvade and the
sooner this is detected the easier it will be to combat.To assess if aPhragmitescolony is spreading, quantitative measurements should be made
of percentage of aerial cover, stem density and culm height, especially at the periphery of

even if a control program succeeds initially becausePhragmitesmay reinvade and the
sooner this is detected the easier it will be to combat.To assess if aPhragmitescolony is spreading, quantitative measurements should be made
of percentage of aerial cover, stem density and culm height, especially at the periphery of
the stand. Annual data should be compared to detect if the colony is expanding and the
stand gaining vigor. Inventories of the vegetation in and near the colony should also be
carried out in order to determine whether declines in species diversity are occurring.
In Europe, reed declines have been documented by comparing areas covered byPhragmitescolonies on up-to-date maps or aerial photographs with older sources,
monitoring permanent quadrats within or at the border of the reed belt and mapping the
stubble fields left after die-back.[30]In lakes[94],
wooden poles 5 m apart were connected with string and the numbers of reed stalks
directly below the strings were counted each year in the spring.Monitoring ProgramsThe programs listed below used various methods to controlPhragmitespopulations and
are monitoring the success of these actions including the degree of recovery of native
species and the longevity of the control.CONNECTICUTMonitoringPhragmitesreduction and replacement vegetation after
