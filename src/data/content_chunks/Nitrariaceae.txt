7.Nitrariaceae白刺科 bai ci keAuthors:Yingxin Liu&Lihua ZhouShrubs, 0.5-2 m tall, prostrate or ascending, succulent, sometimes spiny. Branches often spiny at end. Stipules intrapetiolar, distinct, caducous or persistent. Leaves alternate, spiral, or fasciculate, simple, fleshy or succulent, petiolate or subsessile, deciduous; leaf blade 1-veined or palmately veined, margin entire or 2- or 3-dentate at apex. Flowers solitary or aggregated in cymes, small, bracteate. Sepals 5, fleshy, imbricate, persistent. Petals 5, white or yellowish green. Stamens (10-)15, both alternate and opposite petals; anthers dorsifixed. Ovary inferior, sessile, 2-6-locular; styles 1; stigma ovoid. Fruit a drupe, purple, red, or yellow, fleshy, 1-seeded; mesocarp fleshy to succulent; endocarp forming a bony stone.One genus and ca. 11 species: arid and semiarid regions of N Africa, C, N, and W Asia, Australia, and SE Europe; five species (one endemic) in China.This family was included in Zygophyllaceae in FRPS. However, it differs from the Zygophyllaceae in many morphological characters. Molecular evidence also supports its recognition as a separate family.Liou Yingxin. 1998.Nitraria.In:Xu Langran & Huang Chengchiu, eds., Fl. Reipubl.
