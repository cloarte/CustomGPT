Rosa caesia x canina (R. x dumalis)Bechst. - rose  -Rosaceae(Map updated: March 2008)Rosa x dumalisis probably much commoner thanR. caesiaand perhaps even commoner than pureR. canina.  Unfortunately, the individual members of the dog roses group, to which these species and their hybrids belong, are difficult to separate, and consequentlyR. x dumalisis probably under-recorded, so that the accompanying distribution map is misleading. It is common and widespread; perhaps the dominant rose species in certain areas e.g. about Carnlough in Co Antrim.All names:Rosa caesia x canina (R. x dumalis)Bechst.;Rosa x dumalisBechst.;Rosa caesia x canina;Rosa x subcanina(Christ) Dalla Torre & Sarnth.;Rosa x subcollina(Christ) Dalla Torre & Sarnth.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
