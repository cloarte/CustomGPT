 Livestock Statistics for Latin America and the Caribbean. During the working group´s thirty-first session held in 2023, members recognized, inter alia, that “the name of this current body does not reflect its character” because “the term ‘working group’ does not correspond to the nature of a technical commission of FAO and implies a less formal and less important mechanism. In addition, it implies a defined operational timeline and specific technical products”. Accordingly, the group proposed to change the name to Latin American and the Caribbean Commission for Agricultural Statistics (LACCAS) and proposed legal statutes given the absence of any formal legal basis for terms of reference, membership, and other operational aspects. The legal statutes proposed were designed to correspond to the legal statutes of the African Commission for Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS), and Asian and Pacific Commission for Agricultural Statistics (APCAS). In this regard, in its 175th Council session of FAO , the Council endorsed this name change as well as additional specific legal statutes.
