🌍 Distribución: 
🦠 Hospedantes: Rhododendron maximum (Rosebay rhododendron)
 Nombres comunes: No encontrado
 Sinonimos: No encontrado
 Invasion: For asexual reproduction,P. strictaproduces non-papillate sporangia that are sometimes caducous with short or long pedicels in various shapes, including ovoid (most frequent), limoniform, obpyriform, ellipsoid, pyriform and obovoid.Yang et al. (2014)indicated that sporangia of isolates which originated from Mississippi and Virginia in the USA averaged 61.8 µm in length and 35.3 µm in width.Widmer et al. (2018)indicated that sporangia produced by isolates from Pennsylvania, USA averaged 60.0 ± 10.2 μm in length and 33.9 ± 9.3 μm in width. Sporangia ofP. strictaare characterized by frequent constrictions of sporangiophores. If present, each sporangiophore can have one to three constrictions (Yang et al., 2014). Pedicels of sporangia average 129.8 µm in length, while both short and long pedicels have been observed. Both internal and external proliferation are produced. Chlamydospores, mostly terminal and spherical, average 34.7 µm in diameter.

 Reproduccion: Phytophthora stricta represents a unique clade in a phylogeny based on sequences of the internal transcribe spacer (ITS) region ( Yang et al., 2014 ), while it was placed basal to other clade-8 species in a multi-locus phylogeny ( Yang et al., 2017 ). Phytophthora stricta reproduces asexually by producing sporangia. This species also produces resting structures known as chlamydospores. It is unknown whether this species can reproduce sexually in its natural habitats, as all isolates recovered so far belong to a single mating type, A 1 . Phytophthora stricta cannot survive at temperatures higher than 35°C or lower than 5°C. Its optimum growth temperature is between 25-30°C.
 Sintomas: Widmer et al. (2018) noted that P. stricta caused nondescript necrotic lesions at the leaf tips of wild Rhododendron maximum plants growing alongside a forest stream. Bily et al. (2022) noted that P. stricta can also cause lesions on stem tissues of R. maximum .
