 Reproduccion: P. aviculare regenerates exclusively by seed ( Grime et al., 1988 ) and is often one of the most abundant species in seed banks of cultivated soils in temperate Europe ( Macchia et al., 1996 ). Densities as high as 200 to 5000 seeds/m² are common ( Holm et al., 1997 ), with most seeds being buried in the upper 5 cm of soil. Optimum germination depth is 0-2 cm. Seed viability in soil decreases exponentially with time, with less than 10% remaining viable after 2 years ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Deep, undisturbed seeds are the most likely to remain dormant. Viable seeds have been recovered after up to 60 years of burial ( Campagna and Rapparini, 1997 ; Holm et al., 1997 ).P. aviculare has a cyclic dormancy pattern in soil; fresh seeds show innate dormancy and low temperatures stimulate release from dormancy of imbibed seeds (chilling requirement is typically <5-10 °C for 10 weeks) while high temperatures induce secondary dormancy. Therefore, P. aviculare usually germinates in a single flush during a short period early in the spring (between late February and early May in England, between August and November in Argentina). Seeds that fail to germinate in the spring enter secondary dormancy and no subsequent germination usually occurs in the summer ( Courtney, 1968 ). In Argentina, the temperature range in which germination could occur was estimated to fall between 8°C and 25°C and the estimated required thermal time for germination of 50% of the non-dormant fraction was 80 degree-days above a base temperature of 0°C ( Kruk and Benech-Arnold, 1998

A single plant can produce up to 6000 seeds, but this number is highly variable, depending on competition and resource availability ( Meerts, 1995 ; Holm et al., 1997 ).The removal of shoot apices resulted in reduced apical dominance and increased branching intensity and this was accompanied by reduced fitness estimates ( McPhee et al., 1997 ).P. aviculare, even defined in the narrow sense as specified in the Notes on Taxonomy and Nomenclature, is a highly polymorphic species. There exists considerable genetic variation in growth habit and life history traits, including growth rate, flowering date, number of seeds and life span ( Meerts, 1992 , 1995; Meerts and Garnier, 1996 ). Chilling requirement also varies among populations ( Holm et al., 1997 ). In addition, the species shows extensive phenotypic plasticity in response to soil fertility, soil moisture, and disturbance regime (trampling) ( Meerts, 1995 ). Genotypes with contrasting life-histories might be adapted to different cultivation practices and disturbance regimes. For instance, short-lived, early flowering genotypes could be favoured in crops subjected to weeding activities in early summer; by contrast, longer-lived genotypes can resume growth and reproduction after harvest of the crop and are therefore well adapted

For instance, short-lived, early flowering genotypes could be favoured in crops subjected to weeding activities in early summer; by contrast, longer-lived genotypes can resume growth and reproduction after harvest of the crop and are therefore well adapted to cereals.The flowers seem to be mostly (if not always) self-pollinated ( Grime et al., 1988 ; Meerts et al., 1998 ), although they can be visited by insects ( Bugg et al., 1987 ). The high colonizing success of P. aviculare in various kinds of man-disturbed habitats has been ascribed to a suite of complementary attributes ( Grime et al., 1988 ; Meerts, 1995 ): long lasting seed bank; extensive phenotypic plasticity; selfing mating system; and high genetic diversity compared to other, self-pollinating weeds. It has been shown that populations from arable fields, either tetra- or hexaploid, consist of fixed heterozygotes at several enzymatic loci ( Meerts et al., 1998 ).P. aviculare contains water-soluble allelochemicals, including long-chain fatty acids and phenolic glycosides, that inhibit germination and seedling growth of crops (lettuce, alfalfa, medic, rice) and several species of weeds, most notably Cynodon dactylon and Chenopodium album ( Alsaadawi and Rice, 1982a , 1982b; Kloot and Boyce, 1982 ; Alsaadawi et al., 1983 ; Lovett et al., 1986; Chung et al., 1994 )The species has effective mechanisms of seed dispersal by human or other agencies.

Seeds occur both as an impurity in the harvested crop and as a contaminant of sown seed. They may be dispersed in mud on footwear or tyre treads and can survive ingestion by stock or by birds ( Grime et al., 1988 ). They can also be transported by irrigation water ( Holm et al., 1997 ).

A single plant can produce up to 6000 seeds, but this number is highly variable, depending on competition and resource availability ( Meerts, 1995 ; Holm et al., 1997 ).The removal of shoot apices resulted in reduced apical dominance and increased branching intensity and this was accompanied by reduced fitness estimates ( McPhee et al., 1997 ).P. aviculare, even defined in the narrow sense as specified in the Notes on Taxonomy and Nomenclature, is a highly polymorphic species. There exists considerable genetic variation in growth habit and life history traits, including growth rate, flowering date, number of seeds and life span ( Meerts, 1992 , 1995; Meerts and Garnier, 1996 ). Chilling requirement also varies among populations ( Holm et al., 1997 ). In addition, the species shows extensive phenotypic plasticity in response to soil fertility, soil moisture, and disturbance regime (trampling) ( Meerts, 1995 ). Genotypes with contrasting life-histories might be adapted to different cultivation practices and disturbance regimes. For instance, short-lived, early flowering genotypes could be favoured in crops subjected to weeding activities in early summer; by contrast, longer-lived genotypes can resume growth and reproduction after harvest of the crop and are therefore well adapted

For instance, short-lived, early flowering genotypes could be favoured in crops subjected to weeding activities in early summer; by contrast, longer-lived genotypes can resume growth and reproduction after harvest of the crop and are therefore well adapted to cereals.The flowers seem to be mostly (if not always) self-pollinated ( Grime et al., 1988 ; Meerts et al., 1998 ), although they can be visited by insects ( Bugg et al., 1987 ). The high colonizing success of P. aviculare in various kinds of man-disturbed habitats has been ascribed to a suite of complementary attributes ( Grime et al., 1988 ; Meerts, 1995 ): long lasting seed bank; extensive phenotypic plasticity; selfing mating system; and high genetic diversity compared to other, self-pollinating weeds. It has been shown that populations from arable fields, either tetra- or hexaploid, consist of fixed heterozygotes at several enzymatic loci ( Meerts et al., 1998 ).P. aviculare contains water-soluble allelochemicals, including long-chain fatty acids and phenolic glycosides, that inhibit germination and seedling growth of crops (lettuce, alfalfa, medic, rice) and several species of weeds, most notably Cynodon dactylon and Chenopodium album ( Alsaadawi and Rice, 1982a , 1982b; Kloot and Boyce, 1982 ; Alsaadawi et al., 1983 ; Lovett et al., 1986; Chung et al., 1994 )The species has effective mechanisms of seed dispersal by human or other agencies.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology P. aviculare regenerates exclusively by seed ( Grime et al., 1988 ) and is often one of the most abundant species in seed banks of cultivated soils in temperate Europe ( Macchia et al., 1996 ). Densities as high as 200 to 5000 seeds/m² are common ( Holm et al., 1997 ), with most seeds being buried in the upper 5 cm of soil. Optimum germination depth is 0-2 cm. Seed viability in soil decreases exponentially with time, with less than 10% remaining viable after 2 years ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Deep, undisturbed seeds are the most likely to remain dormant. Viable seeds have been recovered after up to 60 years of burial ( Campagna and Rapparini, 1997 ; Holm et al., 1997 ).P. aviculare has a cyclic dormancy pattern in soil; fresh seeds show innate dormancy and low temperatures stimulate release from dormancy of imbibed seeds (chilling requirement is typically <5-10 °C for 10 weeks) while high temperatures induce secondary dormancy. Therefore, P. avicul

Therefore, P. aviculare usually germinates in a single flush during a short period early in the spring (between late February and early May in England, between August and November in Argentina). Seeds that fail to germinate in the spring enter secondary dormancy and no subsequent germination usually occurs in the summer ( Courtney, 1968 ). In Argentina, the temperature range in which germination could occur was estimated to fall between 8°C and 25°C and the estimated required thermal time for germination of 50% of the non-dormant fraction was 80 degree-days above a base temperature of 0°C ( Kruk and Benech-Arnold, 1998 ).The first seeds are usually shed two months after emergence, and can be produced over an extended period of time (up to 6 months or more unless the plant is killed by frost, for instance from June to November in England ( Grime et al. 1988 )).
