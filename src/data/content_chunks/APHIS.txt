APHIS 
• "Sometimes the first duty of 
intelligent men is the restatement of 
the obvious." - George Orwell 
 
 
  
APHIS 
Goal 
• To ensure that Safe and Effective 
products are available to the end-
users 
  
APHIS 
Implication of Potency Specifications 
• What impact does potency specifications 
have on efficacy and safety of veterinary 
biologics? 
 
• At the core of our goal. 
  
APHIS 
Expectations: Safety and Efficacy  
• Veterinary biologics are not 100% safe 
and effective. 
 
 
  
APHIS 
User Expectations  
• Users expect products to be safe and 
effective. 
  
APHIS 
Industry Expectations  
• The expectation of the veterinary 
biologics industry is to market products 
with predictable performance profiles. 
 
  
APHIS 
User Feedback  
• How well are our current potency 
standards performing? 
• Reports of potential lack of efficacy are 
infrequent. 
• Majority of cases received by CVB are 
AERs associated with safety issues. 
  
APHIS 
Difference in User Expectations 
• User 
• Products used 
• Application; expectations may vary 
depending on product application.  e.g., 
inoculation vs course spray. 
• Species (e.g., Companion vs livestock vs 
poultry & aquaculture

• User 
• Products used 
• Application; expectations may vary 
depending on product application.  e.g., 
inoculation vs course spray. 
• Species (e.g., Companion vs livestock vs 
poultry & aquaculture) 
• Multiple products administered 
• Off-label use (expectations?) 
  
APHIS 
Challenges to Expectations  

  
APHIS 
Expectations in High Risk Animals 

  
APHIS 
Potency Considerations  
• We are currently considering how data 
could be used to replace potency 
standards while ensuring product 
efficacy and safety. 
 
  
APHIS 
Implication of Potency Specifications 
• Potency is a balance between efficacy 
and safety 
 
• Minimal potency requirements to ensure 
efficacy 
 
• Should there be maximum potency 
requirements regarding safety? 
  
APHIS 
Potency  
• Does changing potency specifications 
impact efficacy and safety of veterinary 
biologics? 
 
• What users expect? 
 
• Is there an opportunity to improve safety 
of products by implementing new 
potency specifications?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
APHIS 
Role of Pharmacovigilance   
• "However beautiful the strategy, you 
should occasionally look at the results." 
- Winston Churchill 
 
• No potency assay correlates perfectly 
with efficacy in the field.  Thus, 
pharmacovigilance plays a significant 
part of understanding how potency

• No potency assay correlates perfectly 
with efficacy in the field.  Thus, 
pharmacovigilance plays a significant

specifications impact observed product 
performance.  
  
APHIS 
Goals regarding PV & User Expectations
  • Narrow the gap between product 
performance and user’s expectations. 
• Aligning user’s expectations with 
product performance profile. 
  
APHIS 
What Pharmacovigilance cannot do 
• Make end users report all events 
– Lack of reporting = lack of detection 
• Eliminate reporting bias: 
– Selection based on seriouness, animal, media 
• Determine causality 
– Accuracy of information reported 
– No control group 
– Other factors 
• Handling, storage, administration, health status, 
concomitant product 
  
APHIS 
Summary  
• The impact of product safety and 
efficacy must be considered when 
proposing changes to potency specs. 
• The expectations of users. 
• PV as a tool to assess impact 
• An opportunity to improve product 
safety?
