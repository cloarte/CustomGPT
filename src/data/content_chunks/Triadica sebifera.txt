 for T. sebifera is 2n = 44, 88 ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ; Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2023 ). The SE-EPPC (2003) reports a high level of genetic diversity and more than 100 cultivars of T. sebifera being developed. Two important cultivars are ‘eagle-claw’ and ‘grape’, which differ in fruit form and maturation period. In India, T. sebifera easily hybridizes with the native species Triadica cochinchinensis . The hybrid is more vigorous, possibly endangering the future of T. cochinchinensis in some areas ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Within the USA, populations in Georgia and South Carolina are different in their genetic composition and are more diverse than populations in other parts of the country. The Australian populations are genetically different to the populations of Georgia and South Carolina ( DeWalt et al., 2011 ). DNA barcode information is available for the species ( BOLDS, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Triadica sebifera is a monoecious species. The flowers are arranged in terminal spike-like inflorescences. The staminate (male) flowers occur in clusters at the upper nodes of the inflorescence, and the pistillate (female) flowers are solitary, located on short branches at the base of the spike ( Bruce et al., 1997 ; Meyer, 2011 ). The flowers on a tree are highly synchronous, very fragrant, and are only available for about 10 days after which they fall to the ground ( Vogt et al., 2021 ; PROSEA, 2023 ). The fruits take 3 to 4 months to ripen ( PROSEA, 2023 ). A production of ~100,000 seeds per tree has been reported ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023; USDA-NRCS, 2023 ).

 are only available for about 10 days after which they fall to the ground ( Vogt et al., 2021 ; PROSEA, 2023 ). The fruits take 3 to 4 months to ripen ( PROSEA, 2023 ). A production of ~100,000 seeds per tree has been reported ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023; USDA-NRCS, 2023 ). More than 95% of seeds are viable, with viability dropping 10-50% after 1 year ( EPPO, 2018 ). The seeds are capable of remaining viable for at least 2 years, and a high proportion of the seeds produce seedlings ( Meyer, 2011 ; Vogt et al., 2021 ; ISSG, 2023; USDA-NRCS, 2023 ). Although it has been suggested that T. sebifera may be wind-pollinated, the species is strongly outcrossing, the flowers are very fragrant, and primarily pollinated by bees ( Clark, 2016 ; Vogt et al., 2021 ). T. sebifera is also recognized as an important species for honey production ( EPPO, 2018 ). In USA, Clark and Howard (2019) found little evidence of autogamy, and although the plants are self-compatible, protandry within inflorescences and synchrony of flowering are effective at preventing self-fertilization. They also report that the pollen is poorly dispersed by wind, with no pollen being found on traps set up 8 m from source trees. Although numerous insects were seen visiting inflorescences, only species in the families Apidae and Halictidae carried more than traces of pollen. Both the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera , and five native generalists’ bees, including Melissodes maculata and Augochlora pura , were found carrying large amounts of pollen.

 the families Apidae and Halictidae carried more than traces of pollen. Both the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera , and five native generalists’ bees, including Melissodes maculata and Augochlora pura , were found carrying large amounts of pollen. Triadica sebifera can be propagated from cuttings, root suckers, layering and top grafting ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Root suckers are formed abundantly and contribute to its regeneration and persistence ( Meyer, 2011 ). In vitro techniques based on axillary bud proliferation have been developed ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Physiology and Phenology In China, T. sebifera has been recorded flowering from April to August and fruiting from August to December ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ). In USA, flowers are produced from April to June and fruits from August to November ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2023 ). It produces pollen and nectar abundantly during the spring and early summer in USA ( Vogt et al., 2021 ). In a germination experiment performed in northern Florida, seeds started germinating at the end of February, and germination peaked in mid-March to April. May was the latest month in which seeds germinated ( Meyer, 2011 ). Seedlings are shade-tolerant, although they perform better in open habitats. They also withstand occasional flooding and salt intrusion ( Vogt et al., 2021 ). Seedling survival is better in soils with moisture content being ≥31% ( EPPO, 2020 ). Those plants in the USA differ from those of China by allocating more resources to growth and reproduction than to herbivore defence. The species is also able to increase abundance and dominance by capitalizing on stochastic disturbances such as hurricanes through rapid recruitment ( Vogt et al., 2021 ).

The species is also able to increase abundance and dominance by capitalizing on stochastic disturbances such as hurricanes through rapid recruitment ( Vogt et al., 2021 ). Longevity Triadica sebifera generally live 15-50 years with a potential maximum age of 100 years. This species often begins flowering and fruiting when plants are one metre tall or approximately 3 years old. In greenhouse experiments, seedlings flowered in their first year of growth ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023). Activity Patterns Under favourable conditions, T. sebifera is a fast grower and can grow up to 1 metre per year until it is 8 to 10 years old. By the time it is 20 years, it may be up to 13 m tall with a stem diameter of up to 40 cm. In the wild, flowering starts when plants are 3 to 4 years old ( PROSEA, 2023 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Population Size and Density Triadica sebifera can form closed-canopy monocultures ( EPPO, 2018 ; Vogt, 2021). Associations In USA, Paudel et al. (2014) studies suggest that T. sebifera benefits from the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM), although without specifying the fungi associated with the invasive species. Yang et al. (2015) also reported higher AM colonizations in non-native T. sebifera than for native species, possibly accounting for its invasion success. Various generalist fungi associated with T. sebifera , include Armillaria mellea , A. tabescens , Alternaria spp., Lasiodiplodia theobromae ; Pythium spp.; Phymatotrichopsis omnivora , Pseudoc

Various generalist fungi associated with T. sebifera , include Armillaria mellea , A. tabescens , Alternaria spp., Lasiodiplodia theobromae ; Pythium spp.; Phymatotrichopsis omnivora , Pseudocercospora stillingiae , Phoma spp . and Phyllosticta stillingiae ( McCormick, 2005 ; Vogt et al., 2021 ) . According to McCormick (2005) , there are many gaps in the understanding of these fungal associations with T. sebifera. Some of these fungi are associated with dead, compromised trees or decaying plant tissue, and do not attack healthy plants ( Alfieri, 1982 ; Rishbeth, 1991 ). Environmental Requirements Triadica sebifera can be found growing in areas with mean annual temperatures in the range of 15-30°C, though it may tolerate cold winters with a mean minimum temperature of the coolest month of 0°C, and an absolute minimum temperature being above -12°C to -15°C ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Climate modelling studies suggest temperatures of 12 and 14°C being the lower temperature threshold for growth and lower limit of optimal growth, respectively. The upper temperature limit for optimal growth and upper threshold are 35 and 40°C respectively ( EPPO, 2020 ). T. sebifera also prefers areas with a mean annual rainfall ranging from 1500 mm to 2800 mm (but tolerates 700 mm to >3000 mm). It tolerates extended drought with dry seasons of up to 5 months duration. This species is adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and tolerates degraded, saline, waterlogged and moist soils with a pH range of 5-8. It thrives in sunny areas but can also grow in shaded conditions and thus

This species is adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and tolerates degraded, saline, waterlogged and moist soils with a pH range of 5-8. It thrives in sunny areas but can also grow in shaded conditions and thus it may be found growing under closed canopies ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023; PROSEA, 2023 ; PROTA, 2023 ).

A management guide for invasive plants in southern forests. Gen. Tech. Rep. SRS–131. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 120 p.Tallowtree or popcorntree [Triadica sebifera(L.) Small], formerly [Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb.] is a deciduous tree
growing to 60 feet (18 m) tall that can form pure stands, especially in wet prairies. Leaves are broadly ovate to diamondshaped
and turn bright yellow and scarlet in the fall. Abundant bundles of white waxy popcorn-like seeds appear on
branchlets in the fall also. Seeds, high in fat and protein, are consumed and spread by birds and mammals. Saplings
as young as 3 years can produce viable seed and remain reproductive for 100 years to produce 100,000 seeds per
year. Infestations intensify by prolific surface root sprouts. Seed viability in the soil is 2 to 7 years.Management strategiesDo not plant. Remove prior plantings, and control sprouts and seedlings.

 for T. sebifera is 2n = 44, 88 ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ; Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2023 ). The SE-EPPC (2003) reports a high level of genetic diversity and more than 100 cultivars of T. sebifera being developed. Two important cultivars are ‘eagle-claw’ and ‘grape’, which differ in fruit form and maturation period. In India, T. sebifera easily hybridizes with the native species Triadica cochinchinensis . The hybrid is more vigorous, possibly endangering the future of T. cochinchinensis in some areas ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Within the USA, populations in Georgia and South Carolina are different in their genetic composition and are more diverse than populations in other parts of the country. The Australian populations are genetically different to the populations of Georgia and South Carolina ( DeWalt et al., 2011 ). DNA barcode information is available for the species ( BOLDS, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Triadica sebifera is a monoecious species. The flowers are arranged in terminal spike-like inflorescences. The staminate (male) flowers occur in clusters at the upper nodes of the inflorescence, and the pistillate (female) flowers are solitary, located on short branches at the base of the spike ( Bruce et al., 1997 ; Meyer, 2011 ). The flowers on a tree are highly synchronous, very fragrant, and are only available for about 10 days after which they fall to the ground ( Vogt et al., 2021 ; PROSEA, 2023 ). The fruits take 3 to 4 months to ripen ( PROSEA, 2023 ). A production of ~100,000 seeds per tree has been reported ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023; USDA-NRCS, 2023 ).

 are only available for about 10 days after which they fall to the ground ( Vogt et al., 2021 ; PROSEA, 2023 ). The fruits take 3 to 4 months to ripen ( PROSEA, 2023 ). A production of ~100,000 seeds per tree has been reported ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023; USDA-NRCS, 2023 ). More than 95% of seeds are viable, with viability dropping 10-50% after 1 year ( EPPO, 2018 ). The seeds are capable of remaining viable for at least 2 years, and a high proportion of the seeds produce seedlings ( Meyer, 2011 ; Vogt et al., 2021 ; ISSG, 2023; USDA-NRCS, 2023 ). Although it has been suggested that T. sebifera may be wind-pollinated, the species is strongly outcrossing, the flowers are very fragrant, and primarily pollinated by bees ( Clark, 2016 ; Vogt et al., 2021 ). T. sebifera is also recognized as an important species for honey production ( EPPO, 2018 ). In USA, Clark and Howard (2019) found little evidence of autogamy, and although the plants are self-compatible, protandry within inflorescences and synchrony of flowering are effective at preventing self-fertilization. They also report that the pollen is poorly dispersed by wind, with no pollen being found on traps set up 8 m from source trees. Although numerous insects were seen visiting inflorescences, only species in the families Apidae and Halictidae carried more than traces of pollen. Both the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera , and five native generalists’ bees, including Melissodes maculata and Augochlora pura , were found carrying large amounts of pollen.

 the families Apidae and Halictidae carried more than traces of pollen. Both the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera , and five native generalists’ bees, including Melissodes maculata and Augochlora pura , were found carrying large amounts of pollen. Triadica sebifera can be propagated from cuttings, root suckers, layering and top grafting ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Root suckers are formed abundantly and contribute to its regeneration and persistence ( Meyer, 2011 ). In vitro techniques based on axillary bud proliferation have been developed ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Physiology and Phenology In China, T. sebifera has been recorded flowering from April to August and fruiting from August to December ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ). In USA, flowers are produced from April to June and fruits from August to November ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2023 ). It produces pollen and nectar abundantly during the spring and early summer in USA ( Vogt et al., 2021 ). In a germination experiment performed in northern Florida, seeds started germinating at the end of February, and germination peaked in mid-March to April. May was the latest month in which seeds germinated ( Meyer, 2011 ). Seedlings are shade-tolerant, although they perform better in open habitats. They also withstand occasional flooding and salt intrusion ( Vogt et al., 2021 ). Seedling survival is better in soils with moisture content being ≥31% ( EPPO, 2020 ). Those plants in the USA differ from those of China by allocating more resources to growth and reproduction than to herbivore defence. The species is also able to increase abundance and dominance by capitalizing on stochastic disturbances such as hurricanes through rapid recruitment ( Vogt et al., 2021 ).

The species is also able to increase abundance and dominance by capitalizing on stochastic disturbances such as hurricanes through rapid recruitment ( Vogt et al., 2021 ). Longevity Triadica sebifera generally live 15-50 years with a potential maximum age of 100 years. This species often begins flowering and fruiting when plants are one metre tall or approximately 3 years old. In greenhouse experiments, seedlings flowered in their first year of growth ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023). Activity Patterns Under favourable conditions, T. sebifera is a fast grower and can grow up to 1 metre per year until it is 8 to 10 years old. By the time it is 20 years, it may be up to 13 m tall with a stem diameter of up to 40 cm. In the wild, flowering starts when plants are 3 to 4 years old ( PROSEA, 2023 ; PROTA, 2023 ). Population Size and Density Triadica sebifera can form closed-canopy monocultures ( EPPO, 2018 ; Vogt, 2021). Associations In USA, Paudel et al. (2014) studies suggest that T. sebifera benefits from the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM), although without specifying the fungi associated with the invasive species. Yang et al. (2015) also reported higher AM colonizations in non-native T. sebifera than for native species, possibly accounting for its invasion success. Various generalist fungi associated with T. sebifera , include Armillaria mellea , A. tabescens , Alternaria spp., Lasiodiplodia theobromae ; Pythium spp.; Phymatotrichopsis omnivora , Pseudoc

Various generalist fungi associated with T. sebifera , include Armillaria mellea , A. tabescens , Alternaria spp., Lasiodiplodia theobromae ; Pythium spp.; Phymatotrichopsis omnivora , Pseudocercospora stillingiae , Phoma spp . and Phyllosticta stillingiae ( McCormick, 2005 ; Vogt et al., 2021 ) . According to McCormick (2005) , there are many gaps in the understanding of these fungal associations with T. sebifera. Some of these fungi are associated with dead, compromised trees or decaying plant tissue, and do not attack healthy plants ( Alfieri, 1982 ; Rishbeth, 1991 ). Environmental Requirements Triadica sebifera can be found growing in areas with mean annual temperatures in the range of 15-30°C, though it may tolerate cold winters with a mean minimum temperature of the coolest month of 0°C, and an absolute minimum temperature being above -12°C to -15°C ( PROSEA, 2023 ). Climate modelling studies suggest temperatures of 12 and 14°C being the lower temperature threshold for growth and lower limit of optimal growth, respectively. The upper temperature limit for optimal growth and upper threshold are 35 and 40°C respectively ( EPPO, 2020 ). T. sebifera also prefers areas with a mean annual rainfall ranging from 1500 mm to 2800 mm (but tolerates 700 mm to >3000 mm). It tolerates extended drought with dry seasons of up to 5 months duration. This species is adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and tolerates degraded, saline, waterlogged and moist soils with a pH range of 5-8. It thrives in sunny areas but can also grow in shaded conditions and thus

This species is adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and tolerates degraded, saline, waterlogged and moist soils with a pH range of 5-8. It thrives in sunny areas but can also grow in shaded conditions and thus it may be found growing under closed canopies ( Meyer, 2011 ; ISSG, 2023; PROSEA, 2023 ; PROTA, 2023 ).

A management guide for invasive plants in southern forests. Gen. Tech. Rep. SRS–131. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 120 p.Tallowtree or popcorntree [Triadica sebifera(L.) Small], formerly [Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb.] is a deciduous tree
growing to 60 feet (18 m) tall that can form pure stands, especially in wet prairies. Leaves are broadly ovate to diamondshaped
and turn bright yellow and scarlet in the fall. Abundant bundles of white waxy popcorn-like seeds appear on
branchlets in the fall also. Seeds, high in fat and protein, are consumed and spread by birds and mammals. Saplings
as young as 3 years can produce viable seed and remain reproductive for 100 years to produce 100,000 seeds per
year. Infestations intensify by prolific surface root sprouts. Seed viability in the soil is 2 to 7 years.Management strategiesDo not plant. Remove prior plantings, and control sprouts and seedlings. Bag and dispose of fruit in a dumpster or burn.Tallowtree litter mulch inhibits its own seed germination as well as native seeds.Minimize disturbance within miles of where this plant occurs, and anticipate wider occupation when plants are present before disturbance.High-priority sites to monitor and treat are by water.Treat when new plants are young to prevent seed formation.Cut, bulldoze, and mulch when fruit are not present.Manually pull new seedlings and tree wrench

March and April) with Arsenal AC*, Clearcast*, or Habitat* herbicide in aquatic situations; or when safety to surrounding
vegetation is desired, inject Garlon 3A or a glyphosate herbicide.For felled trees and cut saplings, apply a herbicidea herbicide to stump tops and sides immediately after cutting using Garlon 4 as a 10-percent solution in a basal oil (1 quart per 3-gallon mix) when stumps are less than 6 inches in diameter and a 20-percent solution (2 quarts per 3-gallon mix) on larger stumps, or apply Garlon 3A or a glyphosate herbicide mixed in water as a 20-percent solution (2 quarts per 3-gallon mix) on all sizes of stumps. ORTHO Brush- B-Gon, Enforcer Brush Killer, and Vine-X are effective undiluted for treating cut-stumps and available in retail garden stores (safe to surrounding plants). Follow the label directions.For treatment of extensive infestations in forest situations, apply Velpar L* to the soil surface within 3 feet of the stem (one squirt per 1-inch stem diameter) or in a grid pattern at spacings specified on the herbicide label, or

oil or mineral oil with a penetrant, or fuel oil or diesel fuel (where permitted); undiluted Pathfinder II when safety to
surrounding vegetation is desired; or elsewhere, Stalker* as a 6- to 9-percent solution (1.5 to 2 pints per 3-gallon mix)
in a labeled basal oil product, vegetable oil or mineral oil with a penetrant, or fuel oil or diesel fuel (where permitted) to
young bark as a basal spray.Seedlings and saplings.Thoroughly wet all leaves with one of the following herbicides in water with a surfactant (July
to October): Arsenal AC* as a 0.75-percent solution (3 ounces per 3-gallon mix); Arsenal PowerLine* as a 1.5-percent
solution (6 ounces per 3-gallon mix); Krenite S as a 20-percent solution (5 pints per 3-gallon mix); Clearcast* as a
