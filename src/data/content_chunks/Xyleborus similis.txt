 Invasion: The following diagnostic notes refer to females only and include only the minimum characters required to differentiate this species from other pest species.Adult FemaleLength about 2.2-2.7 mm. Frons convex, entire surface minutely reticulate, with faint, shallow punctures. Antennal club with one obscure suture on posterior face. Pronotum 1.1 times longer than wide; sides nearly straight; anterior margin broadly rounded, without serrations. Elytra 1.7-1.8 times longer than wide; apex narrowly rounded. Elytral declivity sloping, convex, commencing on posterior third to posterior fourth of elytra; face of each elytron with a large, distinct tubercle on lower third in interspace

Elytral declivity sloping, convex, commencing on posterior third to posterior fourth of elytra; face of each elytron with a large, distinct tubercle on lower third in interspace 1, which is outwardly curved around the tubercle sometimes with a few much smaller tubercles near declivital base; several small tubercles in other interspaces; interspace 7 acutely elevated, very weakly crenulate.Immature StagesThe immature stages have not been described.

 Habitat: No encontrado
 Reproduccion: The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Ambrosiodmus, Euwallacea, Xyleborinus and Xylosandrus are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. The biology of X. similis has been studied by Beeson (1930, 1961), Browne (1961) and Kalshoven (1964) . The species is common both in open, disturbed areas and in densely forested areas. It tends to fly around dusk, and is attracted to light. It is most frequently found in stems from about 8 to 25 cm diameter. The lower limit of host size is about 4 cm ( Browne, 1961 ). X. similis is a secondary species attacking stressed, dying, dead or felled trees. It is not known to attack healthy trees. Mahindapala and Subasinghe (1976) report attacks on the bases of living coconut palms, but it is not clear whether the trees were completely healthy. The gallery system

Mahindapala and Subasinghe (1976) report attacks on the bases of living coconut palms, but it is not clear whether the trees were completely healthy. The gallery system consists of branching tunnels in one transverse plane. Beeson (1961) notes that in smaller diameter stems, the side branches are short and soon bifurcate towards the centre of the stem. In larger stems, the side branches may run for several centimetres parallel to the cicrcumference before branching. No brood chambers are constructed either at the cambial level or within the wood. Kalshoven (1964) notes that in mature galleries, a few side branches may penetrate the outer bark and form additional openings to the exterior. The eggs are laid, and the larvae develop and pupate within the gallery system. After mating with their brother(s), the new generation of females emerges through the original entrance hole (or presumably also through any addition openings from the gallery system to the exterior). Kalshoven (1964) found from 10 to 37 offspring in the gallery systems that he investigated, but it is likely that broods can be considerably larger than this. Browne (1961) found young adults 5 weeks after a host tree had been cut, but Beeson (1961) gives a minimum period to emergence of 3 months, and notes that an individual host tree may continue to produce new adults over a much longer period (up to 10 months). It is not known whether this represents a series of broods in the same stem ( Beeson, 1930 ), or a prolonged development period due, for example, to poor growth of the ambrosia fungus that forms the only food of the developing larvae.

It is possible that the ambrosia fungus associated with X. similis is Fusarium solani ( Balasundaran and Sankaran, 1991 ). Breeding is continuous throughout the year, with overlapping generations, so that the species is active at all times, and in all stages of development ( Browne, 1968 ).
 Sintomas: Attacked plants may show signs of wilting, branch die-back, shoot breakage, chronic debilitation, sun-scorch or a general decline in vigour.
