HOSTS
"Cat face" or carpellody is specific to papaya.
SYMPTOMS
The appearance of carpellodic fruits can range from those that resemble female fruits to those that are severely deformed with longitudinal ridges or seams. Carpellodic fruits are generally rounded rather than the more typical pyriform shape and are unmarketable.
BIOLOGY
Carpellody or "cat-face" fruits result when stamens develop abnormally into carpel-like fleshy structures.
Sex expression in hermaphroditic papaya trees is variable and is influenced by environmental factors. The development of carpellodic fruits is favored by low night temperatures in combination with high moisture and nitrogen levels.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Carpellody is an inherited trait thus careful seed selection can reduce its occurrence.
MANAGEMENT
NON-CHEMICAL CONTROL
The "Solo" varieties, because of many years of inbreeding, have lower incidence of carpellody but it does occur occasionally under conditions described above.
