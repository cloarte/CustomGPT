Cochlearia anglicaL. - English Scurvygrass  -Cruciferae / Brassicaceae© John Wilde(Map updated: March 2008)Although the map shows scattered sites in Co Down and elsewhere, the best sites for this plant are along the tidal portions of the River Foyle up as far as Strabane in Co Londonderry.The leaf of this species has a base which tapers into the petiole (the closely similarCochlearia officinalishas a heart-shaped leaf).Good examples of plants of this species are now difficult to find away from  the River Foyle and its estuary, Lough Foyle, perhaps because of introgression withC. officinalis. It is a plant of saltmarshes and muddy tidal shores.All names:Cochlearia anglicaL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
