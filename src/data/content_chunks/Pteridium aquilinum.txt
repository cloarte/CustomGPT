 Invasion: P. aquilinum is a polycarpic geophyte; a perennial fern which reproduces by spores and widely creeping, branching underground stems, sometimes forming colonies. The fronds arise directly from a deep underground rhizome that is much subdivided. The large compound leaves (fronds) are 0.3-1.3 m high, and 15-45 cm long, whereas both fertile and sterile fronds may reach a height of up to 2 m in the UK and can be much smaller under sub-optimal conditions. The leaf stalk, usually mistaken for the stem, actually is attached to the rhizome under the ground. The triangular deciduous leaves turn brown and die after the first autumn frosts in temperate climates, and the new ones arise each spring from the rhizomes. The leaf is divided into numerous segments (leaflets), each of which may be again divided or redivided, with the lowest segments three times compound. The clusters of spore cases densely line the inrolled edges of the underside of the leaves. The sporangium is aggregated into sori on the underside of the frond. Young fronds produce extrafloral nectaries (Grime et al., 1988;Duc et al., 2003).

Thomson (2000) suggested that Tryon's varieties africanum, aquilinum, arachnoideum, decompositum, esculentum, latiusculum and revolutum might best be treated as species; pseudocaudatum and pubescens as varieties within latiusculum; yarrabense and caudatum (at least in part) as hybrids.

In Western Europe the shoots are copper brown during the dormant season and the fronds will be still standing for much of the winter and only gradually break up. The fronds will grow after the winter season whereas in tropical regions this will tend to occur after fires. Wynn et al. (2000) demonstrated significant differences in response to light and temperature regimes between four genotypes grown under experimental conditions. There is much variation in both the total dry mass per unit area (1.8-5.1 kg/m²) and the total rhizome dry mass (0.24-0.42 kg/m²).Pteridium spp. are to a large extent fire-resistant as the rhizomes send up new shoots after the old ones are burnt. In tropical regions the species is often referred to as a typical postfire successional species ( Wesche et al., 2000 ) and after fire may form so-called 'bracken savannas' ( Beard, 1953 ). However, in Sudan, it is absent from the most fiercely burnt hillsides ( Jackson, 1956 ). In Hawaii, where it is uncommon, it is one of the few seasonal sub-montane native species to increase in burned compared to unburned areas ( D'Antonio et al., 2000 ). Similarly, in much of the temperate zones it is known to be fire-responsive ( Cwynar, 1987 ; Skre et al., 1998 ). Indigenous peoples such as the Maoris in New Zealand would appear to have been responsible for the increase of the fern through their use of fire ( Germann and Holland, 2001 ).Reproductive BiologyUp to 30 million spores may be produced by a single frond and spore production tends to be greater in open habitats.

oris in New Zealand would appear to have been responsible for the increase of the fern through their use of fire ( Germann and Holland, 2001 ).Reproductive BiologyUp to 30 million spores may be produced by a single frond and spore production tends to be greater in open habitats. Spores are wind-dispersed. Viable spores are often found in abundance within a soil profile, and a buried spore bank is suspected. Spores may remain viable for up to 10 years. Natural regeneration from spores may occur in spring and is mainly restricted to areas of disturbed or burnt ground. Expansion of established clones will be chiefly vegetative ( Grime et al., 1988 ).Environmental RequirementsPteridium spp. are commonly found at varying altitudes. In the UK, P. aquilinum is found from sea level to 590 m but is more abundant in the uplands ( Grime et al., 1988 ). In the Imatong Mountains of Sudan its altitudinal range is 1800-2600 m ( Jackson, 1956 ) and up to 3200 m in Colombia ( Missouri Botanical Garden, 2003 ). It prefers acid soil, tolerating soil pH of 3.0-7.6. However, in the UK, it is most frequent and abundant below pH 4.5 and particularly on deep soils. It is found on a range of shaded and unshaded habitats but grows best on productive brown-earths and more open habitats. Young shoots are very sensitive to frost and trampling by large mammals ( Grime et al., 1988 ).AssociationsThe roots bear vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza ( Grime et al., 1988 ).

The extrafloral nectaries of young fronds provide food for ants and these may rid the plant of insect predators ( Tempel, 1983 ; Grime et al., 1988 ). In Western Europe herbivory by large mammals such as deer, results in a reduction in many palatable species and with the expansion of P. aquilinum ( Lameire et al., 2000 ; Kirby, 2001 ). In the UK, vegetational change from arable land to woodland over 100 years resulted in the unexpectedly disappearance of P. aquilinum once the woodland had become established ( Harmer et al., 2001 ). Often there is little vegetation under the canopy of P. aquilinum, just a carpet of its litter. The plant is also considered to be allelopathic ( Grime et al., 1988 ).

In Hawaii, where it is uncommon, it is one of the few seasonal sub-montane native species to increase in burned compared to unburned areas ( D'Antonio et al., 2000 ).

oris in New Zealand would appear to have been responsible for the increase of the fern through their use of fire ( Germann and Holland, 2001 ).Reproductive BiologyUp to 30 million spores may be produced by a single frond and spore production tends to be greater in open habitats. Spores are wind-dispersed. Viable spores are often found in abundance within a soil profile, and a buried spore bank is suspected. Spores may remain viable for up to 10 years. Natural regeneration from spores may occur in spring and is mainly restricted to areas of disturbed or burnt ground. Expansion of established clones will be chiefly vegetative ( Grime et al., 1988 ).Environmental RequirementsPteridium spp. are commonly found at varying altitudes. In the UK, P. aquilinum is found from sea level to 590 m but is more abundant in the uplands ( Grime et al., 1988 ). In the Imatong Mountains of Sudan its altitudinal range is 1800-2600 m ( Jackson, 1956 ) and up to 3200 m in Colombia ( Missouri Botanical Garden, 2003 ). It prefers acid soil, tolerating soil pH of 3.0-7.6. However, in the UK, it is most frequent and abundant below pH 4.5 and particularly on deep soils. It is found on a range of shaded and unshaded habitats but grows best on productive brown-earths and more open habitats. Young shoots are very sensitive to frost and trampling by large mammals ( Grime et al., 1988 ).AssociationsThe roots bear vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza ( Grime et al., 1988 ).

The extrafloral nectaries of young fronds provide food for ants and these may rid the plant of insect predators ( Tempel, 1983 ; Grime et al., 1988 ). In Western Europe herbivory by large mammals such as deer, results in a reduction in many palatable species and with the expansion of P. aquilinum ( Lameire et al., 2000 ; Kirby, 2001 ). In the UK, vegetational change from arable land to woodland over 100 years resulted in the unexpectedly disappearance of P. aquilinum once the woodland had become established ( Harmer et al., 2001 ). Often there is little vegetation under the canopy of P. aquilinum, just a carpet of its litter. The plant is also considered to be allelopathic ( Grime et al., 1988 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology GeneticsThe chromosome number of P. aquilinum var. aquilinum is 2n=104 with a nuclear DNA amount of 12.8 pg ( Grime et al., 1988 ). In his taxonomic re-assessment of the genus Thomson (2000) concluded that the DNA evidence suggested that morphotypes in Pteridium were "determined by specific qualitative and quantitative combinations of a limited number of highly conserved, additively assorted, genomic elements". It exhibits polymorphism for cyanogenesis ( Grime et al., 1988 ). Morphological and morphometric analysis by Thomson (2000) elucidated some genetic relationships between varieties, including the distinguishing of an additional grouping of Atlantic Island (Azores, Madeira) and European brackens as an 'aquilinum complex' including var. aquilinum and a number of morphotypes recognised by C.N.

Page and others at various taxonomic levels (near atlanticum, fulvum, pinetorum, osmundaceum). Also, he confirmed that var. yarrabense was a tetraploid hybrid (2n=208) of var. esculentum and var. revolutum, that at least those accessions of var. caudatum examined were tetraploid hybrids (2n=208) involving var. arachnoideum as one progenitor, and that the closest relatives of var. decompositum were var. latiusculum and var. revolutum; and provided evidence of close genomic relationships between var. latiusculum, var. pseudocaudatum and var. pubescens in North America. Thomson (2000) suggested that Tryon's varieties africanum, aquilinum, arachnoideum, decompositum, esculentum, latiusculum and revolutum might best be treated as species; pseudocaudatum and pubescens as varieties within latiusculum; yarrabense and caudatum (at least in part) as hybrids. Thomson and Alonso-Amelot (2002) have dealt with the taxonomic status and relationships of Pteridium caudatum in Central and South America.

However, this datasheet does not separate the species as described by Thomson (2000) and covers all varieties within the over-arching P. aquilinum.Physiology and PhenologyIn temperate climates, fronds emerge from late spring onwards and persist until the autumn. Spores ripen in August to September and are shed in August to October in the UK. Under experimental conditions half of the spores take 4 days to germinate and germination is to some extent inhibited by darkness, and the prothallus will grow better in unshaded habitats ( Grime et al., 1988 ). In Western Europe the shoots are copper brown during the dormant season and the fronds will be still standing for much of the winter and only gradually break up. The fronds will grow after the winter season whereas in tropical regions this will tend to occur after fires. Wynn et al. (2000) demonstrated significant differences in response to light and temperature regimes between four genotypes grown under experimental conditions. There is much variation in both the total dry mass per unit area (1.8-5.1 kg/m²) and the total rhizome dry mass (0.24-0.42 kg/m²).Pteridium spp. are to a large extent fire-resistant as the rhizomes send up new shoots after the old ones are burnt. In tropical regions the species is often referred to as a typical postfire successional species ( Wesche et al., 2000 ) and after fire may form so-called 'bracken savannas' ( Beard, 1953 ).
