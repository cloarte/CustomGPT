The bentgrasses are rather fine-leaved, creeping grasses, used mainlyin lawns and golf putting greens over the northern half of the United States.These species were all introduced into this country from Europe. Colonial bentis most comonly used in lawns. Included here are the varieties Astoria bent and Highland bent. The creeping bents generally do not produce seed and arepropagated by stolons. Seaside bent and Penncross varieties do produce seed and are propagated in that way. None of these bentgrasses is used for pasture or hay.
