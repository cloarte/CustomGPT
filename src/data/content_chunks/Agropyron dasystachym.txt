Thickspike wheatgrass
Gramineae, Poaceae
Agropyron dasystachym
(Hook.) Scribn
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a sod forming wheatgrass native from the Hudson Bay and Alaskasouth to Nevada and Colorado. Stems reach to 3 feet. The creeping rhizomesresult in formation of fairly dense sod. It does well on light textured soilsand is very hardy. Growth starts early and provides good pasturage whilesucculent, but becomes tough and wiry late in the season. It is rarely seededbut is an important native grass over a wide area.
