, rhomboid, measuring approximately 3.7-5 mm long and 2-2.25 mm wide (Hernández-Fuentes et al., 2017). Essentially black, its body is covered with white, red, orange and black scales that give it a reddish-black appearance. The head is almost spherical and largely covered by the eyes, which are oval, elongated and ventrally pointed (Téliz and Mora, 2007;Jones et al., 2019). The snout is long, inclined towards the ventral region, reaching the metathoracic coxae (Jones et al., 2019). Antennae are geniculate and each has a large antennal mass formed by four segments (Kissinger, 1957;SENASICA-DGSV, 2016). Elytra are reddish, with scarce pubescence and lack lateral constriction; the humeral region not reddish and wider than the base of the prothorax; with humeral calluses and an accentuated slope (Muñiz and Barrera, 1958) and their apices slightly acute, somewhat divergent, with a defined longitudinal carina (Kissinger, 1957;DGSV, 2012). The posterior third of pronotum has transverse micro-spines (Arévalo-Guerra and Cano, 2019). There is an almost triangular prosternal ridge between coxae (Hernández-Fuentes et al., 2017). The abdomen is densely covered with whitish scales (Kissinger, 1957); spiracles of the eighth abdominal segment are located on the sides (Arévalo-Guerra and Cano, 2019).

 Reproduccion: A study on mitochondrial DNA sequence shows that Mexican populations of M. aguacatae have high intra-specific genetic variability ( Engstrand et al., 2010 ). DNA data (under Copturus ) are available for the species ( BOLDS, 2022 ). The life cycle comprises the egg, larva, pupa and adult stages. Adults mate preferably in unoccupied branches or trees (Santacruz Ulibarri, n.d.) and 5 days after copulation females begin to oviposit (on average 27.4 days after emergence) during a span of 17.4 ± 3.2 days. The female opens wounds 5-10 mm deep with her beak and mandibles on young branches, to oviposit 1-8 eggs, one egg in each hole ( Gasca-Corona and Equihua-Martínez, 1999 ). The incubation period of the eggs is 10-12 days. Then, they pass through five larval stages in a period of 108-117 days. The pupal stage lasts from 17-19 days and this takes place in the galleries inside the branches, from where the adults later emerge ( Muñiz, 1960 ). Additionally, they present a state of adult preimago that lasts 5-8 days, in which the insect acquires its pigmentation and the cuticle hardens. There are discrepancies in the time elapsed from emergence and copulation; according to Santacruz Ulibarri (n.d.) it is about 15 days, but Cárdenas Valdovinos (1986

There are discrepancies in the time elapsed from emergence and copulation; according to Santacruz Ulibarri (n.d.) it is about 15 days, but Cárdenas Valdovinos (1986) gives 45 days for this event. The sex ratio (males: females) has been calculated at 56: 46 (Coria Ávalos and Muñoz Flores, 2012). The appearance of the adults during the year usually relates to the beginning of the rainy season ( Luna et al., 2017 ; Ávila Jarra, 2021 ). Adults are recorded from June to September in most studies ( Huerta de la Peña, 1990 ; Gasca-Corona and Equihua-Martínez, 1999 ; Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ), but can be observed up to November ( Gasca, 2000 ). Oviposition takes place at the end of July and during August ( Gasca-Corona and Equihua-Martínez, 1999 ). Larvae occur throughout the year but are more abundant from February to May ( Damián et al., 2015 ). Most authors indicate that M. aguacatae shows one generation per year ( Talavera and Padilla, 2003 ; Equihua-Martínez et al., 2007 ; Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ). The average time to complete the relatively long biological cycle of M. aguacatae varies among Mexican localities ( Gudiño and García, 1990 ; Talavera and Padilla, 2003 ; Coria et al., 2007 ).

The average time to complete the relatively long biological cycle of M. aguacatae varies among Mexican localities ( Gudiño and García, 1990 ; Talavera and Padilla, 2003 ; Coria et al., 2007 ). Coria et al. (2007) report an average lifespan for the adult female of 59 days, while the egg lasts 10 days, the larva 128 days, the pupa 21.5 days and the imago 24 +/- 5.6 days. While these authors estimated the complete life cycle at approximately 215.8 days, González-Hernández (2013) reports shorter longevities for the adults (42 days for males and 48 for females), as well as shorter generation times (169-192 days). Similarly, there is also variation in pupal period, which has been reported from 21.5-25 days ( Talavera and Padilla, 2003 ) or much longer ( Huerta de la Peña, 1990 ). Adults are diurnal, found on branches and leaves only when feeding. Adults are active on sunny days, when they are seen on branches with higher incidence of sunlight. The female oviposits on branches that receive sunlight, although she can oviposit on shaded branches ( Coria et al., 2007 ) or on branches that coincide with the east and south cardinal points ( Damián et al., 2015 ). There are few but contrasting reports of adult densities in avocado orchards; these values probably are the result of different sampling methodologies. For example, adults are reported at densities of two to six adults per leaf ( Huerta de la Peña, 1990 ), while Santacruz Ulibarri (n.d.) indicates that there are three to five females for every male at invasion sites, without specifying what is considered as a site.

In a study, the average number of adults on ‘foliage of the avocado trees’ was estimated at 2.63 individuals/tree (Coria et al., 2012), whereas in another study the population average fluctuated between 0.12 to 4.42 individuals per tree (Ávila Jarra, 2021 ). There are also few studies documenting larval densities of M. aguacatae . Infestations depend on the time of year and galleries, with up to 32 or more larvae having been observed ( Uribe, 1999 ). Santacruz Ulibarri (n.d.) reports up to 150 larvae per affected branch. Trees with lower application of fertilizers are reported as more susceptible to attacks ( Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ). Rivera-Martínez et al. (2022) modelled the spatial behaviour of this insect and the population mean was 7.42 individuals per tree, with the lowest density in a first sampling in November and adults no longer found in second samplings of November and December. Adults are known to feed on tender leaves of P. americana trees, while larvae feed on small branches of the same plant species ( Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ). Adults have been observed feeding on the tender leaf galls caused by the hemipteran Trioza anceps .

 of the same plant species ( Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ). Adults have been observed feeding on the tender leaf galls caused by the hemipteran Trioza anceps . Also, attacks increase in diseased trees with ‘avocado sadness’, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi ( Cabrera and Salazar, 1991 ). Muñiz (1959) states secondary infestations by viruses, bacteria and fungi may occur, but no pathogen transmission by M. aguacatae is documented in the available literature. More information is needed on these associations. The life cycle of M. aguacatae is highly dependent on the environmental conditions ( SENASICA-DGSV, 2016 ). The weevil requires temperatures ranging from 22-28°C and relative humidity from 40-75%, which in Mexico occur from May to October. In Mexico, fruit harvest coincides with the main period of precipitation ( Rocha-Arroyo et al., 2011 ), which provides optimal conditions for the reproduction of M. aguacatae (Ávila Jarra, 2021 ). Indeed, rain seems to be an important factor affecting emergence, mating and oviposition of avocado pests in general, including M. aguacatae ( Luna et al., 2017 ). Altitude seems to be an important factor for M. aguacatae . In Mexico, M. aguacatae ’s distribution mimics that of the avocado trees and can be found from 860-2480 metres above sea level (masl), with largest populations of branch borers from 1200-1300 masl and a marked decline above 2100 metres ( Coria et al., 2007 ). Coria et al. (2007) indicate that higher altitudes impose longer development times for M. aguacatae . Day-to-night temperature oscill

Coria et al. (2007) indicate that higher altitudes impose longer development times for M. aguacatae . Day-to-night temperature oscillations relative to the annual oscillations (termed isothermality, O’Donell and Ignizio, 2012) is an important weather condition in the determination of environmental suitability for M. aguacatae ( Luna et al., 2017 ). Also, the insect seems to require alternation of cloudy and sunny days (Santacruz Ulibarri, n.d.).
 Sintomas: Neither the leaves, flowers or fruits are reported as seriously affected by direct attacks from M. aguacatae ( Gudiño and García, 1990 ; Agroproductores, 2019 ). However, adults cause scratches both on the upper and lower sides of the leaves, giving a pattern of irregular spots ( Gudiño and García, 1990 ).

(2022) modelled the spatial behaviour of this insect and the population mean was 7.42 individuals per tree, with the lowest density in a first sampling in November and adults no longer found in second samplings of November and December. Adults are known to feed on tender leaves of P. americana trees, while larvae feed on small branches of the same plant species ( Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ). Adults have been observed feeding on the tender leaf galls caused by the hemipteran Trioza anceps . Also, attacks increase in diseased trees with ‘avocado sadness’, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi

 of the same plant species ( Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ). Adults have been observed feeding on the tender leaf galls caused by the hemipteran Trioza anceps . Also, attacks increase in diseased trees with ‘avocado sadness’, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi ( Cabrera and Salazar, 1991 ). Muñiz (1959) states secondary infestations by viruses, bacteria and fungi may occur, but no pathogen transmission by M. aguacatae is documented in the available literature. More information is needed on these associations. The life cycle of M. aguacatae is highly dependent on the environmental conditions ( SENASICA-DGSV, 2016 ). The weevil requires temperatures ranging from 22-28°C and relative humidity from 40-75%, which in Mexico occur from May to October. In Mexico, fruit harvest coincides with the main period of precipitation ( Rocha-Arroyo et al., 2011 ), which provides optimal conditions for the reproduction of M. aguacatae (Ávila Jarra, 2021 ). Indeed, rain seems to be an important factor affecting emergence, mating and oviposition of avocado pests in general, including M. aguacatae ( Luna et al., 2017 ). Altitude seems to be an important factor for M. aguacatae . In Mexico, M. aguacatae ’s distribution mimics that of the avocado trees and can be found from 860-2480 metres above sea level (masl), with largest populations of branch borers from 1200-1300 masl and a marked decline above 2100 metres ( Coria et al., 2007 ). Coria et al. (2007) indicate that higher altitudes impose longer development times for M. aguacatae . Day-to-night temperature oscill

 and can be found from 860-2480 metres above sea level (masl), with largest populations of branch borers from 1200-1300 masl and a marked decline above 2100 metres ( Coria et al., 2007 ). Coria et al. (2007) indicate that higher altitudes impose longer development times for M. aguacatae . Day-to-night temperature oscillations relative to the annual oscillations (termed isothermality, O’Donell and Ignizio, 2012) is an important weather condition in the determination of environmental suitability for M. aguacatae ( Luna et al., 2017 ). Also, the insect seems to require alternation of cloudy and sunny days (Santacruz Ulibarri, n.d.).
 Sintomas: Neither the leaves, flowers or fruits are reported as seriously affected by direct attacks from M. aguacatae ( Gudiño and García, 1990 ; Agroproductores, 2019 ). However, adults cause scratches both on the upper and lower sides of the leaves, giving a pattern of irregular spots ( Gudiño and García, 1990 ).
 Organos afectados: Persea americana (avocado), Lauraceae, Main, Lozano et al. (2015)
 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics A study on mitochondrial DNA sequence shows that Mexican populations of M. aguacatae have high intra-specific genetic variability ( Engstrand et al., 2010 ). DNA data (under Copturus ) are available for the species ( BOLDS, 2022 ). Reproductive Biology The life cycle comprises the egg, larva, pupa and adult stages. Adults mate preferably in unoccupied branches or trees (Santacruz Ulibarri, n.d.) and 5 days after copulation females begin to oviposit (on average 27.4 days after emergence) during

urus ) are available for the species ( BOLDS, 2022 ). Reproductive Biology The life cycle comprises the egg, larva, pupa and adult stages. Adults mate preferably in unoccupied branches or trees (Santacruz Ulibarri, n.d.) and 5 days after copulation females begin to oviposit (on average 27.4 days after emergence) during a span of 17.4 ± 3.2 days. The female opens wounds 5-10 mm deep with her beak and mandibles on young branches, to oviposit 1-8 eggs, one egg in each hole ( Gasca-Corona and Equihua-Martínez, 1999 ). The incubation period of the eggs is 10-12 days. Then, they pass through five larval stages in a period of 108-117 days. The pupal stage lasts from 17-19 days and this takes place in the galleries inside the branches, from where the adults later emerge ( Muñiz, 1960 ). Additionally, they present a state of adult preimago that lasts 5-8 days, in which the insect acquires its pigmentation and the cuticle hardens. There are discrepancies in the time elapsed from emergence and copulation; according to Santacruz Ulibarri (n.d.) it is about 15 days, but Cárdenas Valdovinos (1986) gives 45 days for this event. The sex ratio (males: females) has been calculated at 56: 46 (Coria Ávalos and Muñoz Flores, 2012). Physiology and Phenology The appearance of the adults during the year usually relates to the beginning of the rainy season ( Luna et al., 2017 ; Ávila Jarra, 2021 ). Adults are recorded from June to September in most studies ( Huerta de la Peña, 1990 ; Gasca-Corona and Equihua-Martínez

 Muñoz Flores, 2012). Physiology and Phenology The appearance of the adults during the year usually relates to the beginning of the rainy season ( Luna et al., 2017 ; Ávila Jarra, 2021 ). Adults are recorded from June to September in most studies ( Huerta de la Peña, 1990 ; Gasca-Corona and Equihua-Martínez, 1999 ; Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ), but can be observed up to November ( Gasca, 2000 ). Oviposition takes place at the end of July and during August ( Gasca-Corona and Equihua-Martínez, 1999 ). Larvae occur throughout the year but are more abundant from February to May ( Damián et al., 2015 ). Most authors indicate that M. aguacatae shows one generation per year ( Talavera and Padilla, 2003 ; Equihua-Martínez et al., 2007 ; Urías-López and Salazar-García, 2008 ). Longevity The average time to complete the relatively long biological cycle of M. aguacatae varies among Mexican localities ( Gudiño and García, 1990 ; Talavera and Padilla, 2003 ; Coria et al., 2007 ). Coria et al. (2007) report an average lifespan for the adult female of 59 days, while the egg lasts 10 days, the larva 128 days, the pupa 21.5 days and the imago 24 +/- 5.6 days. While these authors estimated the complete life cycle at approximately 215.8 days, González-Hernández (2013) reports shorter longevities for the adults (42 days for males and 48 for females), as well as shorter generation times (169-192 days). Similarly, there is also variation in pupal period, which has been reported

 24 +/- 5.6 days. While these authors estimated the complete life cycle at approximately 215.8 days, González-Hernández (2013) reports shorter longevities for the adults (42 days for males and 48 for females), as well as shorter generation times (169-192 days). Similarly, there is also variation in pupal period, which has been reported from 21.5-25 days ( Talavera and Padilla, 2003 ) or much longer ( Huerta de la Peña, 1990 ). Activity Patterns Adults are diurnal, found on branches and leaves only when feeding. Adults are active on sunny days, when they are seen on branches with higher incidence of sunlight. The female oviposits on branches that receive sunlight, although she can oviposit on shaded branches ( Coria et al., 2007 ) or on branches that coincide with the east and south cardinal points ( Damián et al., 2015 ). Population Size and Density There are few but contrasting reports of adult densities in avocado orchards; these values probably are the result of different sampling methodologies. For example, adults are reported at densities of two to six adults per leaf ( Huerta de la Peña, 1990 ), while Santacruz Ulibarri (n.d.) indicates that there are three to five females for every male at invasion sites, without specifying what is considered as a site. In a study, the average number of adults on ‘foliage of the avocado trees’ was estimated at 2.63 individuals/tree (Coria et al., 2012), whereas in another study the population average fluctuated between 0.12 to 4.42 individuals per tree (Ávila Jarra, 2021 ). There are also few studies documenting larval densities of M. aguacatae . Infestations depend on the time of year and galleries, with up to 32 or more
