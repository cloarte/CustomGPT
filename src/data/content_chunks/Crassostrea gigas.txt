Potential Introduction Pathways of 
Ostreid Herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) in 
the United States 
 

  
BACKGROUND 
Distribution: 
Ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OSHV-1) is a contagious viral disease of molluscan shellfish with 
a wide host range (Table 1) [1]. The disease is most often associated with high mortality 
Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS) or Summer Seed Mortality (SSM) outbreaks 
in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), and most published reports and research focus on 
the disease in this species. The reference strain (OsHV-1; GenBank # AY509253) was 
initially sequenced in 1995 in France [1, 2], followed by identification and 
characterization by Segarra et al 2010 of an OsHV-1 genotype microvariant (OsHV-1 
µVar) in France in 2008-2009 [1, 3-8].  
 
Additional OsHV-1 microvariants and variants, and at least two closely related virus 
genotypes, have been detected globally, including in the United States (U.S.)(Table 1) 
[1, 3, 4, 9-11]. OsHV-1 microvariants are defined by the OIE in the Manual of Diagnostic 
Tests for Aquatic Animals [2] in accordance with Segar

 and at least two closely related virus 
genotypes, have been detected globally, including in the United States (U.S.)(Table 1) 
[1, 3, 4, 9-11]. OsHV-1 microvariants are defined by the OIE in the Manual of Diagnostic 
Tests for Aquatic Animals [2] in accordance with Segarra et al 2010 [8], as closely 
related to OsHV-1 µVar, and having specific genetic sequence variations relative to the 
reference strain. OsHV-1 variants differ genetically from the reference strain, but do not 
contain the specific sequence variations associated with microvariants. The term 
“variant” has been used in the literature to collectively refer to the OsHV-1 reference 
strain and all microvariants and variants. This document will follow that terminology. Any 
Summary: There are several plausible pathways of Ostreid Herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) 
transmission to susceptible shellfish populations in the United States (U.S.) as a 
result of introductions from exporting countries as well as movement of virus within 
the U.S.     
Potential import pathways of introduction: Ballast water or ship fouling have been 
associated with introductions of invasive aquatic animal pathogens and species and have 
been implicated in the introduction of OsHV-1 in other countries. Imported live shellfish 
and frozen uncooked seafoods have been identified as pathways of aquatic disease 
introduction. The exposure risks associated with these pathways are affected by the 
volume and countries of origin of imported live shellfish and product, the distribution 
pathways post-port of entry (coastal vs. inland destinations), and handling of live shellfish 
(e.g.,

and frozen uncooked seafoods have been identified as pathways of aquatic disease 
introduction. The exposure risks associated with these pathways are affected by the 
volume and countries of origin of imported live shellfish and product, the distribution 
pathways post-port of entry (coastal vs. inland destinations), and handling of live shellfish 
(e.g., purging, freshening) and disposition pathways of waste shellfish and shells. 
Information on these factors in the U.S. are largely unknown. 
Potential domestic pathways of introduction and spread: Domestically, areas of the 
West coast where OsHV-1 has been detected are associated with greater likelihoods of 
introduction and spread of OsHV-1 virus to susceptible cultured and wild shellfish 
populations via all plausible pathways compared to areas of the West Coast where 
OSHV-1 has not been detected, and along the East and Gulf coasts, Alaska and Hawaii.   
A reliable quantitative estimate of the likelihood of OsHV-1 transmission via each pathway 
is not possible because there are significant data and knowledge gaps.

OsHV-1 variant can cause species variable infection and disease. There are no 
vaccines or treatments available for this disease. 
 
In the U.S., an OsHV-1 variant has been identified as a cause of Pacific oyster larvae 
mortalities in Tomales Bay, California since 2001 [12-15], and was subsequently 
detected in five other cultured shellfish (Eastern oyster, European flat oyster, Kumamoto 
oyster, Manila clam, Mediterranean mussel) [16], and in Inner Bay and Outer Bay. In 
addition, a variant was detected in San

detected in five other cultured shellfish (Eastern oyster, European flat oyster, Kumamoto 
oyster, Manila clam, Mediterranean mussel) [16], and in Inner Bay and Outer Bay. In 
addition, a variant was detected in San Diego Bay in 2018 [12, 14, 17]. No detections of 
OsHV-1 variants in other areas of the West Coast, along the East and Gulf coasts, and 
in Alaska and Hawaii, have been reported. [1, 14]. In Mexico, a variant has been 
detected in cultured Pacific oyster and native mangrove oyster (C. corteziensis) in the 
Gulf of California [18, 19]. To date, OsHV-1 has not been reported in cultured or wild 
shellfish in Canada [1]. However, there is limited published surveillance data available, 
and it is unknown how much surveillance is conducted in susceptible populations in 
North America. Consequently, the actual distribution of OsHV-1 in the U.S., Canada, 
and Mexico is relatively unknown. 
 
In the U.S. susceptible shellfish are present in all coastal waters (Table 2) [20-22]. 
Shellfish are cultured in twenty-two states along the East, Gulf and West coasts 
including Alaska and Hawaii (Table 2) [20-22]. The U.S. imports live fresh and chilled 
susceptible shellfish and frozen and processed shellfish products from at least 11 
countries with reported OsHV-1 presence (Tables 4 – 10). However, it is unknown if 
importing countries that have not reported OsHV-1 conduct routine surveillance for the

-22]. The U.S. imports live fresh and chilled 
susceptible shellfish and frozen and processed shellfish products from at least 11 
countries with reported OsHV-1 presence (Tables 4 – 10). However, it is unknown if 
importing countries that have not reported OsHV-1 conduct routine surveillance for the 
pathogen, so it is possible that additional countries exporting shellfish and shellfish 
products to the U.S. may also have undetected OsHV-1 in susceptible populations. 
 
United States Regulations 
Currently (2020), OsHV-1 is not listed as notifiable by the World Organisation for Animal 
Health (OIE), and is not in the U.S. list of Notifiable Diseases and Conditions [2, 23]. 
However, it is proposed to be notifiable in the U.S. National List of Reportable Animals 
Diseases (NLRAD). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not have 
regulations or restrictions in place regarding the importation of live shellfish. The U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regulates trade of live shellfish; however some live 
shellfish and shellfish products are exempt if they are for human or animal consumption 
and the species is not listed as injurious [24], endangered, threatened [25], or 
Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed [26]. Individual 
states variably regulate importation and inter- and intra-state movement of wild and 
cultured shellfish for aquaculture and consumption (Table 3)[4]. West coast states, 
Alaska and Hawaii require disease freedom testing for OsHV-1, while East and Gulf 
coast states generally do not require testing.

) listed [26]. Individual 
states variably regulate importation and inter- and intra-state movement of wild and 
cultured shellfish for aquaculture and consumption (Table 3)[4]. West coast states, 
Alaska and Hawaii require disease freedom testing for OsHV-1, while East and Gulf 
coast states generally do not require testing.  
 
The National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) is a collaborative program under 
which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) works with the states, the Interstate 
Shellfish Sanitation Conference, and industry to assure the safety of domestic and 
imported shellfish intended for human consumption [27]. Domestic and foreign 
processing establishments are required to follow FDA food safety guidelines. General 
 4 | USDA - APHIS - VS 
 
 
processing sanitation requirements include ensuring safety of the water used to produce 
ice or that contacts food and food contact surfaces, and storage and handling protocols 
to prevent cross-contamination of shellfish and product. In the U.S., sewage and waste 
water, solid waste disposal, and other disposition pathways are required to meet 
Federal and State laws and regulations [27, 28]. Additional requirements for importation 
include inspections of seafood importers, evaluations of filers of seafood products, and 
foreign country program assessments [29]. Aquatic pathogen surveillance testing is not 
performed on raw shellfish, shellfish products, processing equipment, or solid and liquid 
processing waste streams [27] [30, 31]. In March 2018, the FDA published proposed 
determination (FDA-2018-N-0810) which would allow importation of live, fresh, or fresh-
frozen shellfish for consumption from the European Union [32, 33]. Similarly, New 
Zealand

, processing equipment, or solid and liquid 
processing waste streams [27] [30, 31]. In March 2018, the FDA published proposed 
determination (FDA-2018-N-0810) which would allow importation of live, fresh, or fresh-
frozen shellfish for consumption from the European Union [32, 33]. Similarly, New 
Zealand worked with the FDA to establish a memorandum of understanding to allow for 
importation of live shellfish.  
 
Management of ballast water discharge via ballast water treatment and exchange 
(BWTE) is regulated federally (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. Coast 
Guard), and at the state level. Ballast water discharges are required to meet 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) ballast water management Convention D-2 
standards for allowable concentrations of living organisms and microorganisms 
considered “indicators problematic for ballast water” [34-36]. The regulations do not 
contain stipulations regarding viruses. Vessels that do not discharge ballast water, 
discharge only to shore side facilities or to water that presents little threat (public 
drinking water) are not required to install a ballast water treatment system (BWTS) [37]. 
Vessels operating in only one Captain of the Port (COPT) Zone are exempted from 
ballast water exchange reporting and recordkeeping requirements [37]. COPT Zones 
are administrative, are not established using ecological or biological bases, and may not 
be appropriate boundaries for addressing invasive species [36]. The efficacy of BWTE 
is estimated to range from 50 percent to 90 percent [36, 38-40]. Data reporting BWTE 
efficacy on viruses are lacking. The lack of efficacy data has been suggested to be  due 
to lowering of

 administrative, are not established using ecological or biological bases, and may not 
be appropriate boundaries for addressing invasive species [36]. The efficacy of BWTE 
is estimated to range from 50 percent to 90 percent [36, 38-40]. Data reporting BWTE 
efficacy on viruses are lacking. The lack of efficacy data has been suggested to be  due 
to lowering of the concentration of viruses present in ballast water below the limits of 
detection of currently available assays by treatment methods [36, 41].   
 
Epidemiology 
Transmission occurs horizontally via ingestion of virus in water or attached to vectors 
(plankton, organic materials) [3, 42-44], and direct contact [1, 2, 42, 43]. Vertical 
transmission is suspected, but has not been confirmed [1, 3]. Water is considered a 
mechanical transmission vector. OsHV-1 virus enters the water column when infected 
shellfish shed large quantities of virus during disease outbreaks, and when subclinically 
infected adult shellfish periodically shed virus. Latently infected adult Pacific oysters 
intermittently shed virus [1, 3, 16, 43, 45, 46]. 
Clinical signs in Pacific oysters are most common in larvae, develop 3 to 4 days after 
spawning, and are nonspecific (gaping, slow closure of valves, slow growth, reduced 
feeding, weak circular swimming, loss of ability to swim) [1-3, 42]. Highest mortality (40 
percent – 100 percent) occurs peracutely and up to 10 days in larvae, spat and juvenile 
oysters [42, 44] [2, 44, 46]. In Pacific oysters greater than 1 year of age, clinical signs 
may be inapparent or limited to gill erosions [

) [1-3, 42]. Highest mortality (40 
percent – 100 percent) occurs peracutely and up to 10 days in larvae, spat and juvenile 
oysters [42, 44] [2, 44, 46]. In Pacific oysters greater than 1 year of age, clinical signs 
may be inapparent or limited to gill erosions [42]. Virus has been detected in apparently

healthy adult Pacific oysters suggesting latent or subclinical infection [2, 3, 42]. Mortality 
rates in other shellfish species are variable (Table 1).   
 
Recommendations regarding diagnostic test suitability for surveillance and diagnosis 
are described in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Manual of  Diagnostic 
Tests for Aquatic Animals [2]. Diagnostic tests include histopathology, transmission 
electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays [47], and in situ 
hybridization [2, 3]. Virus isolation and culture, antibody-based diagnostics, and 
serological assays are not available. In the U.S., diagnostic testing is available at some 
state laboratories (Table 9) and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspections 
Services’ National Veterinary Services Laboratory.   
 
Pathogenicity appears to be multifactorial and modulated by environmental factors, 
husbandry practices, co-infection with other pathogenic agents, proximity of susceptible 
and infected cultured and wild shellfish populations, host and viral factors [1, 2, 42, 44, 
48, 49]. Similar to other herpesviruses, OsHV-1 is capable of latent or inapparent 
infection, followed by reactivation and replication when a sum of host and environmental

infection with other pathogenic agents, proximity of susceptible 
and infected cultured and wild shellfish populations, host and viral factors [1, 2, 42, 44, 
48, 49]. Similar to other herpesviruses, OsHV-1 is capable of latent or inapparent 
infection, followed by reactivation and replication when a sum of host and environmental 
factors occur [1, 3]. Seasonal and local environmental conditions vary globally [1, 50]; 
with disease occurring in late spring-summer in northern countries (i.e. the U.K., 
Ireland); in the spring in central European countries; and in winter-spring in Australia 
and New Zealand [49, 51, 52]. In California, mortalities typically occur during late-
spring-summer [12-14]. High rates of virus detection in water and shellfish occur in 
shallow, sheltered lagoons and inland facilities [1, 52], and may be linked to greater 
water temperature fluctuations, low tidal currents, and decreased water circulation 
occurring in these areas [1, 44, 49]. 
 
Disease outbreaks occur when water temperatures fluctuate rapidly or reach a 
regionally variable threshold [1, 2, 17, 46, 50, 52], and may be related to changes in 
water physical and chemical properties [1, 53, 54], changes in shellfish physiology [50, 
52, 55, 56], and virus survival at different temperatures [57]. An optimal thermal window 
(16oC – 24oC (60.8oF – 75.2oF)) may exist for viral replication in the host [1, 12]. In 
California, temperatures in excess of 24oC (75.2oF) precede mortalities.  
 
Host factors likely include species susceptibility, age

 [57]. An optimal thermal window 
(16oC – 24oC (60.8oF – 75.2oF)) may exist for viral replication in the host [1, 12]. In 
California, temperatures in excess of 24oC (75.2oF) precede mortalities.  
 
Host factors likely include species susceptibility, age, growth rate, immune responses, 
and genetics [1, 58]. Pacific oysters appear more susceptible to infection than other 
shellfish species, and probability of mortality is greatest in small life stages under one 
year of age (larvae, spat, juveniles) [1, 12, 17, 50]. Differences in Pacific oyster genetics 
(stocks or family lines) appear to influence survival [4, 59, 60] [12].  
 
Husbandry factors associated with disease development include handling of oysters 
during periods of high environmental risk, high stocking density, the proximity between 
susceptible and infected shellfish populations (cultured and wild), culture system type, 
fouling of culture structures, and biosecurity gaps. Lower mortality rates have been 
reported in Pacific oysters planted in the fall versus the spring (standard industry 
planting time) [13]. Lower mortality rates have been observed in Pacific oysters cultured 
on ropes versus baskets or trays and are attributed to stocking density and water

Disease prevention and control measures should include identification of infected and 
susceptible cultured and wild shellfish populations [1], placing hatcheries and nurseries 
onshore or offshore areas not proximate to infected shellfish populations or water 
currents that pass through them [1, 52, 55], regulation of shellfish importation and 
movement (global, regional, local) [1, 42], sourcing seed shellfish from certified disease 
free hatcheries and wild seed from disease free locations [3, 4, 17, 43, 44, 46, 48], 
implementation of Food Safety Plans, business risk management plans, standard 
operating procedures, and biosafety protocols [1], and use of surveillance and 
monitoring plans to monitor domestic and wild shellfish populations [1]. Breeding for 
genetic resistance to OsHV-1 has increased survival of Pacific oysters in France and 
Australia [4, 59, 60], and, in California, lower mortality rates were observed in WA-1 
Pacific oyster stock [12]. It is unknown if selection for survival to one variant infers 
survival to infection by the reference virus or other variants [4]. Use of triploid Pacific 
oysters has been suggested as a means to decrease mortality [1, 59, 60]. Rearing 
practice modifications include delaying or changing spat planting times to avoid 
environmental conditions conducive to OsHV-1 [1, 13, 61, 62]. Raising the height of 
rearing structures in intertidal zones and seawater column to control the water 
temperature, hydrodynamics, and immersion time has been successful in decreasing 
disease development in Pacific oysters [56]. Confinement

rearing structures in intertidal zones and seawater column to control the water 
temperature, hydrodynamics, and immersion time has been successful in decreasing 
disease development in Pacific oysters [56]. Confinement operations may consider 
filtration of sea water (>5 µm), disinfection (Virkon-S (1 percent v/v x 15 minutes); 
sodium hydroxide (20 g/L-1 x 10 min); iodine (0.1 percent x 5 min); formalin (10 percent 
v/v x 30 min), and use of virus inactivation methods (water aging x 48 hours; heating 
water (50oC (122oF) x 5 min; ultraviolet irradiation x 254 nm) [1, 44, 56, 63]. Equipment 
and personal protective equipment should be site specific and cleaned and disinfected 
between uses if not discarded. Control of fouling stationary equipment in open water 
may be beneficial [1]. In event of an outbreak or detection, confinement facilities should 
destroy infected stock, disinfect water and equipment, and fallow the site [1, 64].  
 
SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL ENTRY AND EXPOSURE PATHWAYS 
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES  
 
Ballast water, ship fouling and movement in water:  
The epidemiology associated with observed OsHV-1 spread among shellfish 
populations, and results of natural transmission studies, strongly implicate water as a 
mechanical transmission vector for virus suspended in the water column or attached to 
organic matter and plankton, and swimming or rafting infected shellfish larvae [1, 3, 16

The epidemiology associated with observed OsHV-1 spread among shellfish 
populations, and results of natural transmission studies, strongly implicate water as a 
mechanical transmission vector for virus suspended in the water column or attached to 
organic matter and plankton, and swimming or rafting infected shellfish larvae [1, 3, 16, 
43, 45, 46, 63]. Ballast water and ship fouling have been associated with introductions 
of invasive aquatic animal species and pathogens, followed by dispersal via the water 
column, tides, and currents [38, 39, 65]. Ballast water and ship fouling have been 
implicated in the introduction of OSHV-1 to areas free of the disease in Australia [43].  
 
Shellfish imported for aquaculture purposes: 
Shellfish are infrequently imported for use in aquaculture in the U.S. From 2016 to 2019, 
one shipment of oyster seed (28,580 liters; species not identified; destinations 
 7 | USDA - APHIS - VS 
 
 
unknown) were imported from Canada into the U.S. (Table 3). No juvenile or adult 
shellfish were imported for use in aquaculture during this period. OsHV-1 may be 
introduced via this import pathway depending on what species of shellfish are imported, 
the source countries, and whether the importing states require OsHV-1 freedom testing. 
 
Imported live shellfish and shellfish products for human consumption:  
Importation of live shellfish, and frozen uncooked seafood have been identified as 
pathways of introduction of aquatic diseases [43, 66]. Data summarized for the years 
2016 through 2019 indicate the U.S. imported multiple species of farmed and non

Imported live shellfish and shellfish products for human consumption:  
Importation of live shellfish, and frozen uncooked seafood have been identified as 
pathways of introduction of aquatic diseases [43, 66]. Data summarized for the years 
2016 through 2019 indicate the U.S. imported multiple species of farmed and non-
farmed live fresh and chilled shellfish, and raw frozen and processed shellfish products 
for human consumption from countries with reported OsHV-1 presence (Australia, 
China, France, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, 
Spain, and the U.K.) ( Tables 4). In addition, the FDA recently finalized a molluscan 
shellfish equivalence determination for Spain and the Netherlands, allowing shellfish 
imports from these OsHV-1 positive countries. 
 
Countries exporting live shellfish and shellfish products to the U.S. are required to meet 
FDA requirements for processing; however, imported live shellfish and shellfish 
products are not tested for presence of aquatic disease pathogens during processing or 
prior to movement, export, or sale [29, 67, 68]. OsHV-1 virus remains viable at 
temperatures used to transport and store live shellfish; therefore, it is highly likely that 
OsHV-1 infected food-sized Pacific oysters and other susceptible shellfish are exported 
to the U.S. from countries with reported OsHV-1 presence. Cooked, smoked and 
preserved oyster and shellfish products are prepared at temperatures exceeding those 
published for OsHV-1 virus inactivation (50oC (122oF)) (Table 10).  However, specific 
inactivation efficacy studies of these methods have not

to the U.S. from countries with reported OsHV-1 presence. Cooked, smoked and 
preserved oyster and shellfish products are prepared at temperatures exceeding those 
published for OsHV-1 virus inactivation (50oC (122oF)) (Table 10).  However, specific 
inactivation efficacy studies of these methods have not been published for OsHV-1. The 
exposure risk is difficult to quantify because there is lack of knowledge regarding the 
destination of imported shellfish once they pass through ports of entry, and lack of 
information regarding the prevalence of OsHV-1 or quantity of virus present in imported 
shellfish or shellfish products. Once imported live shellfish and shellfish products enter 
the U.S, the potential exposure pathways of disease introduction to naïve domestic 
cultured and wild shellfish populations include purging and freshening (live shellfish) 
and processing and waste streams (live and processed shellfish) described below.  
 
SUMMARY OF DOMESTIC TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS 
 
Ballast water, ship fouling, and movement in water:  
Because water has been implicated as a mechanical transmission vector for virus 
suspended in the water column or attached to organic matter and plankton, as well 
as swimming or rafting infected shellfish larvae [1, 3, 16, 43, 45, 46, 63], 
transmission of virus along the West Coast of the United States is a likely domestic 
pathway of spread between infected and naïve shellfish populations. Likewise, 
movement of virus in ballast water and ship fouling, followed by dispersal via the 
water column, tides, and currents is another plausible pathway of spread along the 
US West coast [38, 39, 65].

US West coast [38, 39, 65].

Movement of domestic shellfish for aquaculture purposes: 
All coastal states regulate importation, and inter- and intra-state movements of 
shellfish for aquaculture purposes; however, variability in movement permitting and 
disease freedom requirements exists (Table 3)[4], possibly resulting in introduction 
of OsHV-1 infected shellfish to areas where the disease is not known to be present.  
A lack of local, regional, or national surveillance, including access to the results of 
industry testing, limit capability to fully assess OsHV-1 presence/absence 
geographically or within susceptible shellfish populations. OsHV-1 appears 
endemic in specific areas in California [12, 13, 16]; therefore it is highly plausible 
that resident populations of infected shellfish in these areas may serve as sources 
of virus that will be dispersed via water to adjacent areas of the West coast. 
 
Domestic shellfish for human consumption:  
The risks of OsHV-1 introduction to naïve shellfish populations posed by domestically 
sourced live Pacific oysters, shellfish, or processed shellfish products, are regionally 
variable and affected by the storage, distribution, processing, consumption, and 
disposal pathways. Movement and distribution of domestically reared live shellfish to 
commercial markets is not regulated as strictly as movement of shellfish intended for

1 introduction to naïve shellfish populations posed by domestically 
sourced live Pacific oysters, shellfish, or processed shellfish products, are regionally 
variable and affected by the storage, distribution, processing, consumption, and 
disposal pathways. Movement and distribution of domestically reared live shellfish to 
commercial markets is not regulated as strictly as movement of shellfish intended for 
aquaculture, but is subject to FDA, NSSP, FDA, and some state regulations (Table 9); 
however, there is limited accessible data available to evaluate such movements [69]. 
The exposure risk is difficult to quantify because there is lack of knowledge regarding 
the prevalence of OsHV-1 or quantity of virus present in domestic shellfish or shellfish 
products sourced from or produced in areas where OsHV-1 is reported. 
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via wet storage: 
Live domestically reared shellfish are often temporarily held in offshore or onshore wet 
storage after harvesting for purging and to increase the salt content of the shellfish [27, 
70]. Operators must comply with the NSSP Guide for the Control of Molluscan Shellfish 
under FDA purview to maintain the sanitary quality of the stored shellfish [27]. Some 
states also regulate wet storage (Table 9). Commingling of shellfish harvested from 
different areas is restricted, and there are requirements regarding facility structure, 
water quality and treatment, holding temperatures, icing; and record keeping [27]. 
Microbial pathogen control guidelines are specific to zoonotic bacterial pathogens. It is 
unlikely that imported live shellfish are held in domestic wet storage facilities. The risk of 
exposure posed by wet storage is dependent on the location of the facilities in proximity 
to infected and susceptible shellfish, state regulations regarding movements of shell

 icing; and record keeping [27]. 
Microbial pathogen control guidelines are specific to zoonotic bacterial pathogens. It is 
unlikely that imported live shellfish are held in domestic wet storage facilities. The risk of 
exposure posed by wet storage is dependent on the location of the facilities in proximity 
to infected and susceptible shellfish, state regulations regarding movements of shellfish 
intended for food, the source and disposition pathways of the water used, and the pre- 
and post-water treatment methods. The risk of exposure is greatest in areas of the West 
coast where OsHV-1 is present. Offshore facilities pose a plausibly greater risk due to 
their location in the ocean. In areas of the West coast, along the East and Gulf coasts, 
and in Alaska and Hawaii where OsHV-1 surveillance and/or state regulations requiring 
OsHV-1 disease freedom testing prior to movement of shellfish has not resulted in 
detections of virus. Consequently, it is unlikely that this wet storage pathway from these 
populations has occurred.

PROCESSING AND HANDLING  
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via freshening: 
Retail and live markets may freshen live domestically sourced and imported 
shellfish prior to sale by immersion in a tank of artificial seawater or brined 
freshwater, or by running artificial seawater or brined water over the shellfish for 
several days. Shellfish may also be stored on ice or at or below 5oC (41oF). Holding 
tank water and ice melt are likely disposed of via municipal wastewater systems;

freshwater, or by running artificial seawater or brined water over the shellfish for 
several days. Shellfish may also be stored on ice or at or below 5oC (41oF). Holding 
tank water and ice melt are likely disposed of via municipal wastewater systems; 
however, it is possible that commercial entities located near coastlines dispose of 
water and ice melt into the ocean or adjacent waterways. Exposure is plausible in 
any coastal location where imported shellfish or shellfish sourced from OsHV-1 
affected areas of the US may be freshened prior to sale to consumers. 
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via purging (draining, depuration): 
Purging (draining, depuration) is practiced by some consumers to remove sand and grit, 
and reduce microbial contaminants [71]. Use of tap water to make saltwater solutions 
for purging is recommended; however, domestically sourced and imported live shellfish 
purchased in coastal areas may be placed in the ocean or adjacent water sources for 
this purpose. Some states have regulations discouraging this practice; however, 
consumer compliance and enforcement rates of such regulations are generally 
unknown. Exposure via this pathway is plausible wherever infected regionally sourced 
or imported live shellfish may be sold for human consumption.  
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via domestic processing:  
In areas of the West coast where OsHV-1 is present, locally sourced and imported 
infected shellfish likely enter food processing pathways. In areas of the West coast 
where OsHV-1 is not present, along the East and Gulf coasts, and in Alaska and 
Hawaii, imported infected shellfish may enter food production pathways. The exposure 
risk posed by this pathway likely

 coast where OsHV-1 is present, locally sourced and imported 
infected shellfish likely enter food processing pathways. In areas of the West coast 
where OsHV-1 is not present, along the East and Gulf coasts, and in Alaska and 
Hawaii, imported infected shellfish may enter food production pathways. The exposure 
risk posed by this pathway likely is affected by the volumes of infected shellfish that are 
processed, the prevalence of OsHV-1 in infected shellfish, the efficacy of the liquid and 
solid waste stream treatments and disposal pathways, and the proximity of processing 
facilities to susceptible shellfish populations.  
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via disposition of waste shellfish, shellfish 
products and consumption waste:   
Approximately 40 percent of commercial seafood is discarded as waste.  Landfills 
are the most common waste disposal pathways and monitor groundwater for 
microbial contamination [72-74]; however, it is unknown how the methods used are 
associated with the presence of aquatic animal pathogens. Wild animals and birds 
that forage on landfills may function as fomites or transmission vectors. There are 
knowledge gaps regarding the quantity of waste shellfish or shellfish product used 
as bait or discarded by consumers into compost piles, coastal waterways, or other 
pathways that may allow introduction of OsHV-1 to susceptible populations. If 
discarded waste is capable of contaminating ground water or is placed into waters 
adjacent to the ocean, it is plausible that virus will reach susceptible shellfish 
populations via movement of water. This exposure pathway is plausible in any

coastal area where imported infected shellfish and shellfish product may enter 
waste disposal pathways; the potential for exposure on the West coast is greatest 
where OsHV-1 virus may also be present in locally sourced, processed, and 
consumed shellfish. 
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via disposition of shells:   
OsHV-1 virus is present in the soft tissues of shellfish, not in shell constituents; 
however, shells from improperly shucked shellfish might retain tissues containing 
enough virus to pose an exposure risk. According to the literature, disposition of 
shells typically includes collection by solid waste companies (37 percent), disposal 
into the sea (25 percent), and use as compost, animal feed constituents or other 
uses (38 percent) [43]. Oyster shells from commercial entities (restaurants, grocery 
stores) are likely disposed of via landfills; however, it is plausible that commercial 
entities located near coastlines could dispose of shells into the ocean or natural 
waterways. Shells disposed of by consumers likely enter landfills; however, 
disposal of shells into the ocean or natural waterways is plausible. Use of shells in 
the U.S. for raw materials, animal feeds, or sources of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) 
is generally unknown [43]. This exposure pathway is plausible in any coastal area 
where shells from imported infected shellfish may enter waste disposal pathways;

POTENTIAL IMPACTS  
 
The effect that introductions of indigenous or exotic (i.e., variants not indigenous to the 
U.S.) OsHV-1 might have on U.S. shellfish aquaculture depends on a) virulence of the 
introduced variants; b) the susceptibility of shellfish species present in the area; c) the 
location that the introductions occur. There are few studies of comparative 
pathogenicity, virulence and susceptibility among shellfish species to different OsHV-1 
variants that meet the OIE requirements for natural infection [2]. Burge et al 2020 
demonstrated susceptibility of U.S. Pacific oysters to OsHV-1 variants from other 
countries, and that high mortalities can occur (90 percent, French variant; 97.5 percent, 
Australian variant)[75]. A second study demonstrated differential susceptibility of oyster 
species to U.S. OsHV-1 variants in the field, and among oyster species and families of 
U.S. Pacific oysters to OsHV-1 variants from other countries in the laboratory [15]. 
Delmotte et al 2020 demonstrated that some oyster genotypes are more susceptible to 
certain OsHV-1 variants than others under field conditions [76].

U.S. Pacific oysters to OsHV-1 variants from other countries in the laboratory [15]. 
Delmotte et al 2020 demonstrated that some oyster genotypes are more susceptible to 
certain OsHV-1 variants than others under field conditions [76]. 
 
The short-term impacts associated with introduction of OsHV-1 to naïve U.S. local or 
regional shellfish industries has been demonstrated. The emergence of OsHV-1 in 
Tomales Bay, California resulted in doubling of summertime mortality rates of juvenile 
Pacific oysters and loss of farms in that area, or movement of farms to other 
embayments. Cultured and wild Pacific oyster and other susceptible shellfish 
populations are present along the West coast from California to Alaska. Due to the 
endemic presence of OsHV-1 in specific areas of the West Coast, and the potential for 
movement of OsHV-1 virus via water, it is plausible that OsHV-1 will eventually spread 
 11 | USDA - APHIS - VS 
 
 
along the West Coast, with associated local and regional economic effects. Exposure to 
exotic OsHV-1 variants also plausibly could occur via pathways described in this 
document. 
 
Local and regional economic consequences of OsHV-1 introduction to naïve areas of 
the U.S. West Coast Pacific oyster industry is unknown, but may be significant [22]. The 
West Coast shellfish industry primarily cultivates Pacific oysters [21, 77]. In 2013, the 
West Coast industry was comprised of approximately 300 commercial shellfish farms 
and 5 major private hatcheries, employed approximately 3,800 people, and annually 
contributed over USD $270 million to the regional economy [21

West Coast industry was comprised of approximately 300 commercial shellfish farms 
and 5 major private hatcheries, employed approximately 3,800 people, and annually 
contributed over USD $270 million to the regional economy [21, 77]. An economic 
impact report published in 2013 stated that in 2010, Washington state shellfish 
aquaculture spent approximately $100 million USD in the state economy, was 
responsible for approximately 1,900 direct and 801 indirect jobs, and generated an 
estimated $77 million USD in labor income [77]. The California shellfish aquaculture 
industry contributed approximately $12 million USD to the state economy, generating an 
estimated 200 direct and 80 indirect jobs, and $10 million USD in labor income[77]. This 
study did not assess the economic impacts for Oregon.   
 
Introduction of endemic or exotic OsHV-1 to the East and/or Gulf Coasts where naïve 
susceptible wild and/or cultured shellfish are present could result in consequences 
similar to those associated with OsHV-1 emergence and establishment in Tomales Bay. 
Pacific oyster are not cultivated on the East Coast, however, OsHV-1 susceptible 
species, including the Eastern oyster, are present; therefore, the consequences of 
introduction of OsHV-1 to this region would likely be economically impactful [78]. 
Approximately 1000 farms are located in all East Coast states excluding Delaware [79].

these states. In 2012, the total economic impact of shellfish aquaculture (hard clams

Approximately 1000 farms are located in all East Coast states excluding Delaware [79]. 
Economic data relative to shellfish aquaculture is not readily accessible for many of 
these states. In 2012, the total economic impact of shellfish aquaculture (hard clams 
and oysters) in Virginia was 925 jobs, approximately $81 million USD in output, $27 
million USD in income, and $3.6 million USD in taxes. Oyster aquaculture contributed 
approximately 23 percent of output ($19.7 million USD), 25 percent of jobs (232 jobs), 
37 percent of income ($10 million USD), and 33 percent of taxes ($1.2 million USD)[80]. 
Economic data for shellfish aquaculture is not readily accessible for many states along 
the Gulf Coast. In 2016, the Gulf states produced more shellfish by volume than any 
other region in the nation [22], and sources state that 80 percent to 90 percent of 
Eastern oyster production occurs in the Gulf of Mexico; therefore, the consequences of 
introduction of OsHV-1 to this region could be economically impactful [78]. Presently 
there have been no detections of OsHV-1 on the East or Gulf Coasts.  
 
Volumes of shellfish exported by the U.S., including species susceptible to OsHV-1, are 
summarized in Tables 11 to 15. In 2019, the U.S. exported 177,388 kg of Haliotis ssp. 
abalone products (live and prepared product); 2,903,539 kg of live clams and clam 
products; 277,037 kg of live, fresh or chilled Mytillus spp., Perna spp mussels

shellfish products are difficult to assess. Currently, OsHV-1 is not a disease of concern 
to the European Union [81], and the only country that requires testing for OsHV-1 is

Shucked raw oysters Raw oysters are washed prior to shucking, removed from their 
shells, washed again, graded, and rinsed or soaked in chilled 
seawater prior to draining and packaging. Wholesale packaging may 
contain seawater.  
Frozen oysters Are processed as described for shucked oysters, followed by 
freezing at -34oC to -45oC (-31 to -49oF)

seawater prior to draining and packaging. Wholesale packaging may 
contain seawater.  
Frozen oysters Are processed as described for shucked oysters, followed by 
freezing at -34oC to -45oC (-31 to -49oF) for 50 to 60 minutes (air-
blast freezer), 30 to 40 minutes (spiral freezer), or 15 to 20 minutes 
(belt freezer). Frozen oysters are immersed in 0oC to 5oC (32oF to 
41oF) water for glazing, packaged, and stored at -25oC (13oF). 
Canned smoked 
oysters 
Are smoked at 100oC to 120oC (212oF to 248oF) for 10 to 20 
minutes. Meats are canned in edible vegetable oil heated to 100oC 
(212oF). The can is vacuum-sealed, heated to an internal 
temperature greater than 60oC (140o F), then rapid water-cooled 
(35oC (95oF)). 
Canned boiled oysters Brine steam-opened or fresh shucked oysters are used. Oyster 
meats and brine are placed into cans, vacuum-sealed, and 
processed as described for canned smoked oysters.  
Dried oysters Are typically prepared using steam-opened (110oC (230oF] x 7 to 10 
minutes) meats washed in 2 percent to 3 percent salt brine or 
seawater. Meats are steam-treated (80oC (176oF) x 5 minutes) then

(27-38oC (80.6oF to 100.4oF) x 1 to 2 hours, increased to 60o C (140o 
F). Meats are coated with oyster extract several times during the 
drying process. Packaged product is stored at -20o C (-4o F) prior to 
shipment. 
Salt-fermented 
oysters 
Fresh shucked oysters are placed in jars with 10 percent to 20 
percent table salt and spices, followed by temperature-dependent 
fermentation for 3 to 10 days.

Potential Introduction Pathways of 
Ostreid Herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) in 
the United States 
 

  
BACKGROUND 
Distribution: 
Ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OSHV-1) is a contagious viral disease of molluscan shellfish with 
a wide host range (Table 1) [1]. The disease is most often associated with high mortality 
Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS) or Summer Seed Mortality (SSM) outbreaks 
in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), and most published reports and research focus on 
the disease in this species. The reference strain (OsHV-1; GenBank # AY509253) was 
initially sequenced in 1995 in France [1, 2], followed by identification and 
characterization by Segarra et al 2010 of an OsHV-1 genotype microvariant (OsHV-1 
µVar) in France in 2008-2009 [1, 3-8].  
 
Additional OsHV-1 microvariants and variants, and at least two closely related virus 
genotypes, have been detected globally, including in the United States (U.S.)(Table 1) 
[1, 3, 4, 9-11]. OsHV-1 microvariants are defined by the OIE in the Manual of Diagnostic 
Tests for Aquatic Animals [2] in accordance with Segar

 and at least two closely related virus 
genotypes, have been detected globally, including in the United States (U.S.)(Table 1) 
[1, 3, 4, 9-11]. OsHV-1 microvariants are defined by the OIE in the Manual of Diagnostic 
Tests for Aquatic Animals [2] in accordance with Segarra et al 2010 [8], as closely 
related to OsHV-1 µVar, and having specific genetic sequence variations relative to the 
reference strain. OsHV-1 variants differ genetically from the reference strain, but do not 
contain the specific sequence variations associated with microvariants. The term 
“variant” has been used in the literature to collectively refer to the OsHV-1 reference 
strain and all microvariants and variants. This document will follow that terminology. Any 
Summary: There are several plausible pathways of Ostreid Herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) 
transmission to susceptible shellfish populations in the United States (U.S.) as a 
result of introductions from exporting countries as well as movement of virus within 
the U.S.     
Potential import pathways of introduction: Ballast water or ship fouling have been 
associated with introductions of invasive aquatic animal pathogens and species and have 
been implicated in the introduction of OsHV-1 in other countries. Imported live shellfish 
and frozen uncooked seafoods have been identified as pathways of aquatic disease 
introduction. The exposure risks associated with these pathways are affected by the 
volume and countries of origin of imported live shellfish and product, the distribution 
pathways post-port of entry (coastal vs. inland destinations), and handling of live shellfish 
(e.g.,

and frozen uncooked seafoods have been identified as pathways of aquatic disease 
introduction. The exposure risks associated with these pathways are affected by the 
volume and countries of origin of imported live shellfish and product, the distribution 
pathways post-port of entry (coastal vs. inland destinations), and handling of live shellfish 
(e.g., purging, freshening) and disposition pathways of waste shellfish and shells. 
Information on these factors in the U.S. are largely unknown. 
Potential domestic pathways of introduction and spread: Domestically, areas of the 
West coast where OsHV-1 has been detected are associated with greater likelihoods of 
introduction and spread of OsHV-1 virus to susceptible cultured and wild shellfish 
populations via all plausible pathways compared to areas of the West Coast where 
OSHV-1 has not been detected, and along the East and Gulf coasts, Alaska and Hawaii.   
A reliable quantitative estimate of the likelihood of OsHV-1 transmission via each pathway 
is not possible because there are significant data and knowledge gaps.

OsHV-1 variant can cause species variable infection and disease. There are no 
vaccines or treatments available for this disease. 
 
In the U.S., an OsHV-1 variant has been identified as a cause of Pacific oyster larvae 
mortalities in Tomales Bay, California since 2001 [12-15], and was subsequently 
detected in five other cultured shellfish (Eastern oyster, European flat oyster, Kumamoto 
oyster, Manila clam, Mediterranean mussel) [16], and in Inner Bay and Outer Bay. In 
addition, a variant was detected in San

detected in five other cultured shellfish (Eastern oyster, European flat oyster, Kumamoto 
oyster, Manila clam, Mediterranean mussel) [16], and in Inner Bay and Outer Bay. In 
addition, a variant was detected in San Diego Bay in 2018 [12, 14, 17]. No detections of 
OsHV-1 variants in other areas of the West Coast, along the East and Gulf coasts, and 
in Alaska and Hawaii, have been reported. [1, 14]. In Mexico, a variant has been 
detected in cultured Pacific oyster and native mangrove oyster (C. corteziensis) in the 
Gulf of California [18, 19]. To date, OsHV-1 has not been reported in cultured or wild 
shellfish in Canada [1]. However, there is limited published surveillance data available, 
and it is unknown how much surveillance is conducted in susceptible populations in 
North America. Consequently, the actual distribution of OsHV-1 in the U.S., Canada, 
and Mexico is relatively unknown. 
 
In the U.S. susceptible shellfish are present in all coastal waters (Table 2) [20-22]. 
Shellfish are cultured in twenty-two states along the East, Gulf and West coasts 
including Alaska and Hawaii (Table 2) [20-22]. The U.S. imports live fresh and chilled 
susceptible shellfish and frozen and processed shellfish products from at least 11 
countries with reported OsHV-1 presence (Tables 4 – 10). However, it is unknown if 
importing countries that have not reported OsHV-1 conduct routine surveillance for the

-22]. The U.S. imports live fresh and chilled 
susceptible shellfish and frozen and processed shellfish products from at least 11 
countries with reported OsHV-1 presence (Tables 4 – 10). However, it is unknown if 
importing countries that have not reported OsHV-1 conduct routine surveillance for the 
pathogen, so it is possible that additional countries exporting shellfish and shellfish 
products to the U.S. may also have undetected OsHV-1 in susceptible populations. 
 
United States Regulations 
Currently (2020), OsHV-1 is not listed as notifiable by the World Organisation for Animal 
Health (OIE), and is not in the U.S. list of Notifiable Diseases and Conditions [2, 23]. 
However, it is proposed to be notifiable in the U.S. National List of Reportable Animals 
Diseases (NLRAD). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not have 
regulations or restrictions in place regarding the importation of live shellfish. The U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regulates trade of live shellfish; however some live 
shellfish and shellfish products are exempt if they are for human or animal consumption 
and the species is not listed as injurious [24], endangered, threatened [25], or 
Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed [26]. Individual 
states variably regulate importation and inter- and intra-state movement of wild and 
cultured shellfish for aquaculture and consumption (Table 3)[4]. West coast states, 
Alaska and Hawaii require disease freedom testing for OsHV-1, while East and Gulf 
coast states generally do not require testing.

) listed [26]. Individual 
states variably regulate importation and inter- and intra-state movement of wild and 
cultured shellfish for aquaculture and consumption (Table 3)[4]. West coast states, 
Alaska and Hawaii require disease freedom testing for OsHV-1, while East and Gulf 
coast states generally do not require testing.  
 
The National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) is a collaborative program under 
which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) works with the states, the Interstate 
Shellfish Sanitation Conference, and industry to assure the safety of domestic and 
imported shellfish intended for human consumption [27]. Domestic and foreign 
processing establishments are required to follow FDA food safety guidelines. General 
 4 | USDA - APHIS - VS 
 
 
processing sanitation requirements include ensuring safety of the water used to produce 
ice or that contacts food and food contact surfaces, and storage and handling protocols 
to prevent cross-contamination of shellfish and product. In the U.S., sewage and waste 
water, solid waste disposal, and other disposition pathways are required to meet 
Federal and State laws and regulations [27, 28]. Additional requirements for importation 
include inspections of seafood importers, evaluations of filers of seafood products, and 
foreign country program assessments [29]. Aquatic pathogen surveillance testing is not 
performed on raw shellfish, shellfish products, processing equipment, or solid and liquid 
processing waste streams [27] [30, 31]. In March 2018, the FDA published proposed 
determination (FDA-2018-N-0810) which would allow importation of live, fresh, or fresh-
frozen shellfish for consumption from the European Union [32, 33]. Similarly, New

, processing equipment, or solid and liquid 
processing waste streams [27] [30, 31]. In March 2018, the FDA published proposed 
determination (FDA-2018-N-0810) which would allow importation of live, fresh, or fresh-
frozen shellfish for consumption from the European Union [32, 33]. Similarly, New 
Zealand worked with the FDA to establish a memorandum of understanding to allow for 
importation of live shellfish.  
 
Management of ballast water discharge via ballast water treatment and exchange 
(BWTE) is regulated federally (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. Coast 
Guard), and at the state level. Ballast water discharges are required to meet 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) ballast water management Convention D-2 
standards for allowable concentrations of living organisms and microorganisms 
considered “indicators problematic for ballast water” [34-36]. The regulations do not 
contain stipulations regarding viruses. Vessels that do not discharge ballast water, 
discharge only to shore side facilities or to water that presents little threat (public 
drinking water) are not required to install a ballast water treatment system (BWTS) [37]. 
Vessels operating in only one Captain of the Port (COPT) Zone are exempted from 
ballast water exchange reporting and recordkeeping requirements [37]. COPT Zones 
are administrative, are not established using ecological or biological bases, and may not 
be appropriate boundaries for addressing invasive species [36]. The efficacy of BWTE 
is estimated to range from 50 percent to 90 percent [36, 38-40]. Data reporting BWTE 
efficacy on viruses are lacking. The lack of efficacy data has been suggested to be  due 
to lowering of

 administrative, are not established using ecological or biological bases, and may not 
be appropriate boundaries for addressing invasive species [36]. The efficacy of BWTE 
is estimated to range from 50 percent to 90 percent [36, 38-40]. Data reporting BWTE 
efficacy on viruses are lacking. The lack of efficacy data has been suggested to be  due 
to lowering of the concentration of viruses present in ballast water below the limits of 
detection of currently available assays by treatment methods [36, 41].   
 
Epidemiology 
Transmission occurs horizontally via ingestion of virus in water or attached to vectors 
(plankton, organic materials) [3, 42-44], and direct contact [1, 2, 42, 43]. Vertical 
transmission is suspected, but has not been confirmed [1, 3]. Water is considered a 
mechanical transmission vector. OsHV-1 virus enters the water column when infected 
shellfish shed large quantities of virus during disease outbreaks, and when subclinically 
infected adult shellfish periodically shed virus. Latently infected adult Pacific oysters 
intermittently shed virus [1, 3, 16, 43, 45, 46]. 
Clinical signs in Pacific oysters are most common in larvae, develop 3 to 4 days after 
spawning, and are nonspecific (gaping, slow closure of valves, slow growth, reduced 
feeding, weak circular swimming, loss of ability to swim) [1-3, 42]. Highest mortality (40 
percent – 100 percent) occurs peracutely and up to 10 days in larvae, spat and juvenile 
oysters [42, 44] [2, 44, 46]. In Pacific oysters greater than 1 year of age, clinical signs 
may be inapparent or limited to gill erosions [

) [1-3, 42]. Highest mortality (40 
percent – 100 percent) occurs peracutely and up to 10 days in larvae, spat and juvenile 
oysters [42, 44] [2, 44, 46]. In Pacific oysters greater than 1 year of age, clinical signs 
may be inapparent or limited to gill erosions [42]. Virus has been detected in apparently

healthy adult Pacific oysters suggesting latent or subclinical infection [2, 3, 42]. Mortality 
rates in other shellfish species are variable (Table 1).   
 
Recommendations regarding diagnostic test suitability for surveillance and diagnosis 
are described in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Manual of  Diagnostic 
Tests for Aquatic Animals [2]. Diagnostic tests include histopathology, transmission 
electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays [47], and in situ 
hybridization [2, 3]. Virus isolation and culture, antibody-based diagnostics, and 
serological assays are not available. In the U.S., diagnostic testing is available at some 
state laboratories (Table 9) and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspections 
Services’ National Veterinary Services Laboratory.   
 
Pathogenicity appears to be multifactorial and modulated by environmental factors, 
husbandry practices, co-infection with other pathogenic agents, proximity of susceptible 
and infected cultured and wild shellfish populations, host and viral factors [1, 2, 42, 44, 
48, 49]. Similar to other herpesviruses, OsHV-1 is capable of latent or inapparent 
infection, followed by reactivation and replication when a sum of host and environmental

infection with other pathogenic agents, proximity of susceptible 
and infected cultured and wild shellfish populations, host and viral factors [1, 2, 42, 44, 
48, 49]. Similar to other herpesviruses, OsHV-1 is capable of latent or inapparent 
infection, followed by reactivation and replication when a sum of host and environmental 
factors occur [1, 3]. Seasonal and local environmental conditions vary globally [1, 50]; 
with disease occurring in late spring-summer in northern countries (i.e. the U.K., 
Ireland); in the spring in central European countries; and in winter-spring in Australia 
and New Zealand [49, 51, 52]. In California, mortalities typically occur during late-
spring-summer [12-14]. High rates of virus detection in water and shellfish occur in 
shallow, sheltered lagoons and inland facilities [1, 52], and may be linked to greater 
water temperature fluctuations, low tidal currents, and decreased water circulation 
occurring in these areas [1, 44, 49]. 
 
Disease outbreaks occur when water temperatures fluctuate rapidly or reach a 
regionally variable threshold [1, 2, 17, 46, 50, 52], and may be related to changes in 
water physical and chemical properties [1, 53, 54], changes in shellfish physiology [50, 
52, 55, 56], and virus survival at different temperatures [57]. An optimal thermal window 
(16oC – 24oC (60.8oF – 75.2oF)) may exist for viral replication in the host [1, 12]. In 
California, temperatures in excess of 24oC (75.2oF) precede mortalities.  
 
Host factors likely include species susceptibility, age

 [57]. An optimal thermal window 
(16oC – 24oC (60.8oF – 75.2oF)) may exist for viral replication in the host [1, 12]. In 
California, temperatures in excess of 24oC (75.2oF) precede mortalities.  
 
Host factors likely include species susceptibility, age, growth rate, immune responses, 
and genetics [1, 58]. Pacific oysters appear more susceptible to infection than other 
shellfish species, and probability of mortality is greatest in small life stages under one 
year of age (larvae, spat, juveniles) [1, 12, 17, 50]. Differences in Pacific oyster genetics 
(stocks or family lines) appear to influence survival [4, 59, 60] [12].  
 
Husbandry factors associated with disease development include handling of oysters 
during periods of high environmental risk, high stocking density, the proximity between 
susceptible and infected shellfish populations (cultured and wild), culture system type, 
fouling of culture structures, and biosecurity gaps. Lower mortality rates have been 
reported in Pacific oysters planted in the fall versus the spring (standard industry 
planting time) [13]. Lower mortality rates have been observed in Pacific oysters cultured 
on ropes versus baskets or trays and are attributed to stocking density and water

Disease prevention and control measures should include identification of infected and 
susceptible cultured and wild shellfish populations [1], placing hatcheries and nurseries 
onshore or offshore areas not proximate to infected shellfish populations or water 
currents that pass through them [1, 52, 55], regulation of shellfish importation and 
movement (global, regional, local) [1, 42], sourcing seed shellfish from certified disease 
free hatcheries and wild seed from disease free locations [3, 4, 17, 43, 44, 46, 48], 
implementation of Food Safety Plans, business risk management plans, standard 
operating procedures, and biosafety protocols [1], and use of surveillance and 
monitoring plans to monitor domestic and wild shellfish populations [1]. Breeding for 
genetic resistance to OsHV-1 has increased survival of Pacific oysters in France and 
Australia [4, 59, 60], and, in California, lower mortality rates were observed in WA-1 
Pacific oyster stock [12]. It is unknown if selection for survival to one variant infers 
survival to infection by the reference virus or other variants [4]. Use of triploid Pacific 
oysters has been suggested as a means to decrease mortality [1, 59, 60]. Rearing 
practice modifications include delaying or changing spat planting times to avoid 
environmental conditions conducive to OsHV-1 [1, 13, 61, 62]. Raising the height of 
rearing structures in intertidal zones and seawater column to control the water 
temperature, hydrodynamics, and immersion time has been successful in decreasing 
disease development in Pacific oysters [56]. Confinement

rearing structures in intertidal zones and seawater column to control the water 
temperature, hydrodynamics, and immersion time has been successful in decreasing 
disease development in Pacific oysters [56]. Confinement operations may consider 
filtration of sea water (>5 µm), disinfection (Virkon-S (1 percent v/v x 15 minutes); 
sodium hydroxide (20 g/L-1 x 10 min); iodine (0.1 percent x 5 min); formalin (10 percent 
v/v x 30 min), and use of virus inactivation methods (water aging x 48 hours; heating 
water (50oC (122oF) x 5 min; ultraviolet irradiation x 254 nm) [1, 44, 56, 63]. Equipment 
and personal protective equipment should be site specific and cleaned and disinfected 
between uses if not discarded. Control of fouling stationary equipment in open water 
may be beneficial [1]. In event of an outbreak or detection, confinement facilities should 
destroy infected stock, disinfect water and equipment, and fallow the site [1, 64].  
 
SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL ENTRY AND EXPOSURE PATHWAYS 
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES  
 
Ballast water, ship fouling and movement in water:  
The epidemiology associated with observed OsHV-1 spread among shellfish 
populations, and results of natural transmission studies, strongly implicate water as a 
mechanical transmission vector for virus suspended in the water column or attached to 
organic matter and plankton, and swimming or rafting infected shellfish larvae [1, 3, 16

 movement in water:  
The epidemiology associated with observed OsHV-1 spread among shellfish 
populations, and results of natural transmission studies, strongly implicate water as a 
mechanical transmission vector for virus suspended in the water column or attached to 
organic matter and plankton, and swimming or rafting infected shellfish larvae [1, 3, 16, 
43, 45, 46, 63]. Ballast water and ship fouling have been associated with introductions 
of invasive aquatic animal species and pathogens, followed by dispersal via the water 
column, tides, and currents [38, 39, 65]. Ballast water and ship fouling have been 
implicated in the introduction of OSHV-1 to areas free of the disease in Australia [43].  
 
Shellfish imported for aquaculture purposes: 
Shellfish are infrequently imported for use in aquaculture in the U.S. From 2016 to 2019, 
one shipment of oyster seed (28,580 liters; species not identified; destinations 
 7 | USDA - APHIS - VS 
 
 
unknown) were imported from Canada into the U.S. (Table 3). No juvenile or adult 
shellfish were imported for use in aquaculture during this period. OsHV-1 may be 
introduced via this import pathway depending on what species of shellfish are imported, 
the source countries, and whether the importing states require OsHV-1 freedom testing. 
 
Imported live shellfish and shellfish products for human consumption:  
Importation of live shellfish, and frozen uncooked seafood have been identified as 
pathways of introduction of aquatic diseases [43, 66]. Data summarized for the years 
2016 through 2019 indicate the U.S. imported multiple species of farmed and non

V-1 freedom testing. 
 
Imported live shellfish and shellfish products for human consumption:  
Importation of live shellfish, and frozen uncooked seafood have been identified as 
pathways of introduction of aquatic diseases [43, 66]. Data summarized for the years 
2016 through 2019 indicate the U.S. imported multiple species of farmed and non-
farmed live fresh and chilled shellfish, and raw frozen and processed shellfish products 
for human consumption from countries with reported OsHV-1 presence (Australia, 
China, France, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, 
Spain, and the U.K.) ( Tables 4). In addition, the FDA recently finalized a molluscan 
shellfish equivalence determination for Spain and the Netherlands, allowing shellfish 
imports from these OsHV-1 positive countries. 
 
Countries exporting live shellfish and shellfish products to the U.S. are required to meet 
FDA requirements for processing; however, imported live shellfish and shellfish 
products are not tested for presence of aquatic disease pathogens during processing or 
prior to movement, export, or sale [29, 67, 68]. OsHV-1 virus remains viable at 
temperatures used to transport and store live shellfish; therefore, it is highly likely that 
OsHV-1 infected food-sized Pacific oysters and other susceptible shellfish are exported 
to the U.S. from countries with reported OsHV-1 presence. Cooked, smoked and 
preserved oyster and shellfish products are prepared at temperatures exceeding those 
published for OsHV-1 virus inactivation (50oC (122oF)) (Table 10).  However, specific 
inactivation efficacy studies of these methods have not

to the U.S. from countries with reported OsHV-1 presence. Cooked, smoked and 
preserved oyster and shellfish products are prepared at temperatures exceeding those 
published for OsHV-1 virus inactivation (50oC (122oF)) (Table 10).  However, specific 
inactivation efficacy studies of these methods have not been published for OsHV-1. The 
exposure risk is difficult to quantify because there is lack of knowledge regarding the 
destination of imported shellfish once they pass through ports of entry, and lack of 
information regarding the prevalence of OsHV-1 or quantity of virus present in imported 
shellfish or shellfish products. Once imported live shellfish and shellfish products enter 
the U.S, the potential exposure pathways of disease introduction to naïve domestic 
cultured and wild shellfish populations include purging and freshening (live shellfish) 
and processing and waste streams (live and processed shellfish) described below.  
 
SUMMARY OF DOMESTIC TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS 
 
Ballast water, ship fouling, and movement in water:  
Because water has been implicated as a mechanical transmission vector for virus 
suspended in the water column or attached to organic matter and plankton, as well 
as swimming or rafting infected shellfish larvae [1, 3, 16, 43, 45, 46, 63], 
transmission of virus along the West Coast of the United States is a likely domestic 
pathway of spread between infected and naïve shellfish populations. Likewise, 
movement of virus in ballast water and ship fouling, followed by dispersal via the 
water column, tides, and currents is another plausible pathway of spread along the 
US West coast [38, 39, 65].

US West coast [38, 39, 65].

Movement of domestic shellfish for aquaculture purposes: 
All coastal states regulate importation, and inter- and intra-state movements of 
shellfish for aquaculture purposes; however, variability in movement permitting and 
disease freedom requirements exists (Table 3)[4], possibly resulting in introduction 
of OsHV-1 infected shellfish to areas where the disease is not known to be present.  
A lack of local, regional, or national surveillance, including access to the results of 
industry testing, limit capability to fully assess OsHV-1 presence/absence 
geographically or within susceptible shellfish populations. OsHV-1 appears 
endemic in specific areas in California [12, 13, 16]; therefore it is highly plausible 
that resident populations of infected shellfish in these areas may serve as sources 
of virus that will be dispersed via water to adjacent areas of the West coast. 
 
Domestic shellfish for human consumption:  
The risks of OsHV-1 introduction to naïve shellfish populations posed by domestically 
sourced live Pacific oysters, shellfish, or processed shellfish products, are regionally 
variable and affected by the storage, distribution, processing, consumption, and 
disposal pathways. Movement and distribution of domestically reared live shellfish to 
commercial markets is not regulated as strictly as movement of shellfish intended for

1 introduction to naïve shellfish populations posed by domestically 
sourced live Pacific oysters, shellfish, or processed shellfish products, are regionally 
variable and affected by the storage, distribution, processing, consumption, and 
disposal pathways. Movement and distribution of domestically reared live shellfish to 
commercial markets is not regulated as strictly as movement of shellfish intended for 
aquaculture, but is subject to FDA, NSSP, FDA, and some state regulations (Table 9); 
however, there is limited accessible data available to evaluate such movements [69]. 
The exposure risk is difficult to quantify because there is lack of knowledge regarding 
the prevalence of OsHV-1 or quantity of virus present in domestic shellfish or shellfish 
products sourced from or produced in areas where OsHV-1 is reported. 
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via wet storage: 
Live domestically reared shellfish are often temporarily held in offshore or onshore wet 
storage after harvesting for purging and to increase the salt content of the shellfish [27, 
70]. Operators must comply with the NSSP Guide for the Control of Molluscan Shellfish 
under FDA purview to maintain the sanitary quality of the stored shellfish [27]. Some 
states also regulate wet storage (Table 9). Commingling of shellfish harvested from 
different areas is restricted, and there are requirements regarding facility structure, 
water quality and treatment, holding temperatures, icing; and record keeping [27]. 
Microbial pathogen control guidelines are specific to zoonotic bacterial pathogens. It is 
unlikely that imported live shellfish are held in domestic wet storage facilities. The risk of 
exposure posed by wet storage is dependent on the location of the facilities in proximity 
to infected and susceptible shellfish, state regulations regarding movements of shell

 icing; and record keeping [27]. 
Microbial pathogen control guidelines are specific to zoonotic bacterial pathogens. It is 
unlikely that imported live shellfish are held in domestic wet storage facilities. The risk of 
exposure posed by wet storage is dependent on the location of the facilities in proximity 
to infected and susceptible shellfish, state regulations regarding movements of shellfish 
intended for food, the source and disposition pathways of the water used, and the pre- 
and post-water treatment methods. The risk of exposure is greatest in areas of the West 
coast where OsHV-1 is present. Offshore facilities pose a plausibly greater risk due to 
their location in the ocean. In areas of the West coast, along the East and Gulf coasts, 
and in Alaska and Hawaii where OsHV-1 surveillance and/or state regulations requiring 
OsHV-1 disease freedom testing prior to movement of shellfish has not resulted in 
detections of virus. Consequently, it is unlikely that this wet storage pathway from these 
populations has occurred.  
 
TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH SHELLFISH

PROCESSING AND HANDLING  
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via freshening: 
Retail and live markets may freshen live domestically sourced and imported 
shellfish prior to sale by immersion in a tank of artificial seawater or brined 
freshwater, or by running artificial seawater or brined water over the shellfish for 
several days. Shellfish may also be stored on ice or at or below 5oC (41oF). Holding 
tank water and ice melt are likely disposed of via municipal wastewater systems; 
however, it

 immersion in a tank of artificial seawater or brined 
freshwater, or by running artificial seawater or brined water over the shellfish for 
several days. Shellfish may also be stored on ice or at or below 5oC (41oF). Holding 
tank water and ice melt are likely disposed of via municipal wastewater systems; 
however, it is possible that commercial entities located near coastlines dispose of 
water and ice melt into the ocean or adjacent waterways. Exposure is plausible in 
any coastal location where imported shellfish or shellfish sourced from OsHV-1 
affected areas of the US may be freshened prior to sale to consumers. 
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via purging (draining, depuration): 
Purging (draining, depuration) is practiced by some consumers to remove sand and grit, 
and reduce microbial contaminants [71]. Use of tap water to make saltwater solutions 
for purging is recommended; however, domestically sourced and imported live shellfish 
purchased in coastal areas may be placed in the ocean or adjacent water sources for 
this purpose. Some states have regulations discouraging this practice; however, 
consumer compliance and enforcement rates of such regulations are generally 
unknown. Exposure via this pathway is plausible wherever infected regionally sourced 
or imported live shellfish may be sold for human consumption.  
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via domestic processing:  
In areas of the West coast where OsHV-1 is present, locally sourced and imported 
infected shellfish likely enter food processing pathways. In areas of the West coast 
where OsHV-1 is not present, along the East and Gulf coasts, and in Alaska and 
Hawaii, imported infected shellfish may enter food production pathways. The exposure 
risk posed by this pathway likely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 coast where OsHV-1 is present, locally sourced and imported 
infected shellfish likely enter food processing pathways. In areas of the West coast 
where OsHV-1 is not present, along the East and Gulf coasts, and in Alaska and 
Hawaii, imported infected shellfish may enter food production pathways. The exposure 
risk posed by this pathway likely is affected by the volumes of infected shellfish that are 
processed, the prevalence of OsHV-1 in infected shellfish, the efficacy of the liquid and 
solid waste stream treatments and disposal pathways, and the proximity of processing 
facilities to susceptible shellfish populations.  
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via disposition of waste shellfish, shellfish 
products and consumption waste:   
Approximately 40 percent of commercial seafood is discarded as waste.  Landfills 
are the most common waste disposal pathways and monitor groundwater for 
microbial contamination [72-74]; however, it is unknown how the methods used are 
associated with the presence of aquatic animal pathogens. Wild animals and birds 
that forage on landfills may function as fomites or transmission vectors. There are 
knowledge gaps regarding the quantity of waste shellfish or shellfish product used 
as bait or discarded by consumers into compost piles, coastal waterways, or other 
pathways that may allow introduction of OsHV-1 to susceptible populations. If 
discarded waste is capable of contaminating ground water or is placed into waters 
adjacent to the ocean, it is plausible that virus will reach susceptible shellfish 
populations via movement of water. This exposure pathway is plausible in any

coastal area where imported infected shellfish and shellfish product may enter 
waste disposal pathways; the potential for exposure on the West coast is greatest 
where OsHV-1 virus may also be present in locally sourced, processed, and 
consumed shellfish. 
 
Exposure of susceptible shellfish via disposition of shells:   
OsHV-1 virus is present in the soft tissues of shellfish, not in shell constituents; 
however, shells from improperly shucked shellfish might retain tissues containing 
enough virus to pose an exposure risk. According to the literature, disposition of 
shells typically includes collection by solid waste companies (37 percent), disposal 
into the sea (25 percent), and use as compost, animal feed constituents or other 
uses (38 percent) [43]. Oyster shells from commercial entities (restaurants, grocery 
stores) are likely disposed of via landfills; however, it is plausible that commercial 
entities located near coastlines could dispose of shells into the ocean or natural 
waterways. Shells disposed of by consumers likely enter landfills; however, 
disposal of shells into the ocean or natural waterways is plausible. Use of shells in 
the U.S. for raw materials, animal feeds, or sources of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) 
is generally unknown [43]. This exposure pathway is plausible in any coastal area 
where shells from imported infected shellfish may enter waste disposal pathways; 
the potential for exposure on the West coast is greatest where OsHV-1 virus may

is generally unknown [43]. This exposure pathway is plausible in any coastal area 
where shells from imported infected shellfish may enter waste disposal pathways; 
the potential for exposure on the West coast is greatest where OsHV-1 virus may 
also be present in locally sourced shellfish. 
 
POTENTIAL IMPACTS  
 
The effect that introductions of indigenous or exotic (i.e., variants not indigenous to the 
U.S.) OsHV-1 might have on U.S. shellfish aquaculture depends on a) virulence of the 
introduced variants; b) the susceptibility of shellfish species present in the area; c) the 
location that the introductions occur. There are few studies of comparative 
pathogenicity, virulence and susceptibility among shellfish species to different OsHV-1 
variants that meet the OIE requirements for natural infection [2]. Burge et al 2020 
demonstrated susceptibility of U.S. Pacific oysters to OsHV-1 variants from other 
countries, and that high mortalities can occur (90 percent, French variant; 97.5 percent, 
Australian variant)[75]. A second study demonstrated differential susceptibility of oyster 
species to U.S. OsHV-1 variants in the field, and among oyster species and families of 
U.S. Pacific oysters to OsHV-1 variants from other countries in the laboratory [15]. 
Delmotte et al 2020 demonstrated that some oyster genotypes are more susceptible to 
certain OsHV-1 variants than others under field conditions [76].

U.S. Pacific oysters to OsHV-1 variants from other countries in the laboratory [15]. 
Delmotte et al 2020 demonstrated that some oyster genotypes are more susceptible to 
certain OsHV-1 variants than others under field conditions [76]. 
 
The short-term impacts associated with introduction of OsHV-1 to naïve U.S. local or 
regional shellfish industries has been demonstrated. The emergence of OsHV-1 in 
Tomales Bay, California resulted in doubling of summertime mortality rates of juvenile 
Pacific oysters and loss of farms in that area, or movement of farms to other 
embayments. Cultured and wild Pacific oyster and other susceptible shellfish 
populations are present along the West coast from California to Alaska. Due to the 
endemic presence of OsHV-1 in specific areas of the West Coast, and the potential for 
movement of OsHV-1 virus via water, it is plausible that OsHV-1 will eventually spread 
 11 | USDA - APHIS - VS 
 
 
along the West Coast, with associated local and regional economic effects. Exposure to 
exotic OsHV-1 variants also plausibly could occur via pathways described in this 
document. 
 
Local and regional economic consequences of OsHV-1 introduction to naïve areas of 
the U.S. West Coast Pacific oyster industry is unknown, but may be significant [22]. The 
West Coast shellfish industry primarily cultivates Pacific oysters [21, 77]. In 2013, the 
West Coast industry was comprised of approximately 300 commercial shellfish farms 
and 5 major private hatcheries, employed approximately 3,800 people, and annually 
contributed over USD $270 million to the regional economy [21

West Coast industry was comprised of approximately 300 commercial shellfish farms 
and 5 major private hatcheries, employed approximately 3,800 people, and annually 
contributed over USD $270 million to the regional economy [21, 77]. An economic 
impact report published in 2013 stated that in 2010, Washington state shellfish 
aquaculture spent approximately $100 million USD in the state economy, was 
responsible for approximately 1,900 direct and 801 indirect jobs, and generated an 
estimated $77 million USD in labor income [77]. The California shellfish aquaculture 
industry contributed approximately $12 million USD to the state economy, generating an 
estimated 200 direct and 80 indirect jobs, and $10 million USD in labor income[77]. This 
study did not assess the economic impacts for Oregon.   
 
Introduction of endemic or exotic OsHV-1 to the East and/or Gulf Coasts where naïve 
susceptible wild and/or cultured shellfish are present could result in consequences 
similar to those associated with OsHV-1 emergence and establishment in Tomales Bay. 
Pacific oyster are not cultivated on the East Coast, however, OsHV-1 susceptible 
species, including the Eastern oyster, are present; therefore, the consequences of 
introduction of OsHV-1 to this region would likely be economically impactful [78]. 
Approximately 1000 farms are located in all East Coast states excluding Delaware [79]. 
Economic data relative to shellfish aquaculture is not readily accessible for many of 
these states. In 2012, the total economic impact of shellfish aquaculture (hard clams

Approximately 1000 farms are located in all East Coast states excluding Delaware [79]. 
Economic data relative to shellfish aquaculture is not readily accessible for many of 
these states. In 2012, the total economic impact of shellfish aquaculture (hard clams 
and oysters) in Virginia was 925 jobs, approximately $81 million USD in output, $27 
million USD in income, and $3.6 million USD in taxes. Oyster aquaculture contributed 
approximately 23 percent of output ($19.7 million USD), 25 percent of jobs (232 jobs), 
37 percent of income ($10 million USD), and 33 percent of taxes ($1.2 million USD)[80]. 
Economic data for shellfish aquaculture is not readily accessible for many states along 
the Gulf Coast. In 2016, the Gulf states produced more shellfish by volume than any 
other region in the nation [22], and sources state that 80 percent to 90 percent of 
Eastern oyster production occurs in the Gulf of Mexico; therefore, the consequences of 
introduction of OsHV-1 to this region could be economically impactful [78]. Presently 
there have been no detections of OsHV-1 on the East or Gulf Coasts.  
 
Volumes of shellfish exported by the U.S., including species susceptible to OsHV-1, are 
summarized in Tables 11 to 15. In 2019, the U.S. exported 177,388 kg of Haliotis ssp. 
abalone products (live and prepared product); 2,903,539 kg of live clams and clam 
products; 277,037 kg of live, fresh or chilled Mytillus spp., Perna spp mussels

shellfish products are difficult to assess. Currently, OsHV-1 is not a disease of concern 
to the European Union [81], and the only country that requires testing for OsHV-1 is

Shucked raw oysters Raw oysters are washed prior to shucking, removed from their 
shells, washed again, graded, and rinsed or soaked in chilled 
seawater prior to draining and packaging. Wholesale packaging may 
contain seawater.  
Frozen oysters Are processed as described for shucked oysters, followed by

seawater prior to draining and packaging. Wholesale packaging may 
contain seawater.  
Frozen oysters Are processed as described for shucked oysters, followed by 
freezing at -34oC to -45oC (-31 to -49oF) for 50 to 60 minutes (air-
blast freezer), 30 to 40 minutes (spiral freezer), or 15 to 20 minutes 
(belt freezer). Frozen oysters are immersed in 0oC to 5oC (32oF to 
41oF) water for glazing, packaged, and stored at -25oC (13oF). 
Canned smoked 
oysters 
Are smoked at 100oC to 120oC (212oF to 248oF) for 10 to 20 
minutes. Meats are canned in edible vegetable oil heated to 100oC 
(212oF). The can is vacuum-sealed, heated to an internal 
temperature greater than 60oC (140o F), then rapid water-cooled 
(35oC (95oF)). 
Canned boiled oysters Brine steam-opened or fresh shucked oysters are used. Oyster 
meats and brine are placed into cans, vacuum-sealed, and 
processed as described for canned smoked oysters.  
Dried oysters Are typically prepared using steam-opened (110oC (230oF] x 7 to 10 
minutes) meats washed in 2 percent to 3 percent salt brine or 
seawater. Meats are steam-treated (80oC (176oF) x 5 minutes) then

(27-38oC (80.6oF to 100.4oF) x 1 to 2 hours, increased to 60o C (140o 
F). Meats are coated with oyster extract several times during the 
drying process. Packaged product is stored at -20o C (-4o F) prior to 
shipment. 
Salt-fermented 
oysters 
Fresh shucked oysters are placed in jars with 10 percent to 20 
percent table salt and spices, followed by temperature-dependent 
fermentation for 3 to 10 days.
