 SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Environmental and Social Management Framework for GCF project “Adapting Philippine Agriculture to Climate Change” (APA) The Philippines is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change. An analysis of future climate impacts on agriculture and farming communities indicates that large parts of the country will face further exposure to increased temperatures. Through the baseline study and intensive stakeholder consultation, a range of climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) options were examined for the most exposed agricultural systems in the regions most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The objective of this project, “Adapting Philippine Agriculture to Climate Change”, is to increase the resilience of rural men and women in areas vulnerable to climate change, whose livelihoods depend on agriculture while transforming the country agriculture towards climate resilience. This will be achieved through improved capacity of farmers to develop CRA enterprises and adopt financially and economically viable CRA practices, and of the government and the private sectors to build supporting systems for scaling up. The project will support the national agriculture and fisheries modernization and industrialization plan (NAFMIP), while providing a systemic approach to climate change adaptation (CCA) in agriculture for the entire country.
