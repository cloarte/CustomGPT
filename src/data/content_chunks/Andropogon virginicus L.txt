Broomsedge is a native bunchgrass, widely distributed over the UnitedStates, closely related to big and little bluestem grasses. The palatability ofbroomsedge is poor, so it ranks low as livestock feed. However, it thrives onsoils of low fertility and is often the dominant growth on worn out,unproductive soils, affording protection from erosion and some forage. Because of its low palatability it is not used in seeded pastures.
