Koch - wood dock  -Polygonaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)The wood dock is a native perennial and is so-called because its characteristic habitat is woodland, especially on clay. It is similar in general appearance to the clustered dock (Rumex conglomeratus) but unlike that species its fruit has only a single swollen wart (three inR. conglomeratus). Generally speaking, clustered dock grows in much wetter situations.[R. sanguineusvar.sanguineusis a much rarer plant, with bright red leaf-veins, giving it the common name of 'bloody dock'. It has occurred occasionally as a casual, but there are no modern reports from Northern Ireland. It is not native.]All names:Rumex sanguineus var. viridis(Sibth.)
