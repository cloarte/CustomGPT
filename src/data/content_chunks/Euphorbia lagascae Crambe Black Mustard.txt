Diversification has been suggested as a possible strategy for improving thefinancial condition of United States crop producers (Jolliff and Snapp 1988;Jolliff 1989).  Agricultural production of industrial feedstocks, for example,would open additional markets to farmers who typically grow only food and feedcrops.  In some instances, farm production of industrial feedstocks could bequite profitable since high-value specialty chemicals are contained in theseeds of some plants (Hinman 1986).
While crambe, (
Crambe abyssinica
Hochst.), ironweed [
Vernoniagalamensis
(Cass.) Less.], and several other plant species have beenidentified as promising industrial crops (Princen 1983), few studies haveevaluated the potential of present weed species as sources of high-valuespecialty chemicals and industrial feedstocks (Clopton and Triebold 1944;Shultz et al. 1983).  There are several weeds that are well adapted to growingconditions in different regions of the United States and could be grown assources of industrial chemicals if domesticated.  While a plant may containdesirable chemicals or have valuable properties, it is unknown if these plantspecies could be developed for field production.  The objective of thisresearch was to

While a plant may containdesirable chemicals or have valuable properties, it is unknown if these plantspecies could be developed for field production.  The objective of thisresearch was to evaluate the agronomic potential of four weeds occurring in theNorthern Great Plains: fanweed [
Thlaspi arvense
(L.)], black mustard[
Brassica nigra
(L.) Koch], wild mustard [
Brassica kaber
(DC.)Wheeler], and hare's ear mustard [
Conringia orientalis
(L.) Dumort].These four weeds were studied since previous work indicated that each containedvaluable specialty chemicals (Appelqvist 1971), or were related to other plantspecies which were sources of valuable chemicals.  The potential of
Euphorbia lagascae
Spreng., as a field crop was also considered sincepast research indicates it may have potential as an industrial crop (Krewsonand Scott 1966), even though this plant species is neither native to, nornaturalized in, the United States.
METHODOLOGY
1990
A field evaluation was conducted under dryland management at the CarringtonResearch/Extension Center (47°30' N, 99°7' W) in central North Dakota.Seed samples of a single accession of black mustard, hare's ear mustard, and
Euphorbia lagascae
were obtained from the USDA/ARS National Center forAgricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois, while seed of wildmustard and fanweed were collected from wild stands.  Seed of each speciesalong with crambe, an industrial crop which

were obtained from the USDA/ARS National Center forAgricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois, while seed of wildmustard and fanweed were collected from wild stands.  Seed of each speciesalong with crambe, an industrial crop which is grown in North Dakota, wasplanted in nonreplicated 1.4 m
2
plots on May 17.  The agronomicpotential of each species was rated on the basis of its ease of establishment,rate of growth, initiation and duration of flowering, susceptibility to lodgingand pests, seed development (determinate or indeterminate), susceptibility ofseeds to shatter, and other factors.  Height of 10 plants of each species wasmeasured prior to harvest.  A 0.7 m
2
area was harvested by hand fordetermination of dry matter, grain yield, and seed weight.
1991
The six plant species included in the 1990 field experiment were each plantedin 8.2 m
2
plots in a randomized complete block design with fourreplicates.  The agronomic potential of each plant species was evaluated asdescribed.  A sunfleck ceptometer (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA) was usedto quantify the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that wasintercepted by the plant canopy in plots of two replicates on selected datesduring the growing season.  Plants in a 1.9 m

area from the centralportion of each plot were harvested for determination of dry matter, grainyield, and seed weight.  Seed oil content and fatty acid distribution of theoil were determined for a representative sample of each species by massspectroscopy at the Food and Cereal

area from the centralportion of each plot were harvested for determination of dry matter, grainyield, and seed weight.  Seed oil content and fatty acid distribution of theoil were determined for a representative sample of each species by massspectroscopy at the Food and Cereal Science Laboratory at North Dakota StateUniversity, in a manner previously described (Riveland 1991).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fanweed
Fanweed (
syn
. stinkweed, field pennycress, pennycress) was rated ashaving excellent potential as a new crop if established in the fall (
Table 1
).Poor germination of spring-sown fanweed seed was a problem.  As a result, yieldof fanweed was low when planted in the spring.  Metzger (1990) reported thatexposure to temperatures of 0° to 10°C for 3 to 6 weeks can break thedormancy of fanweed seed.  Dormancy can be broken if seed is scarified byscratching the seedcoat (Best and McIntyre 1975), although this was not truefor spring-sown seed in this study.  Broadcast planting rather than seeddrilling is desirable, since exposure to light seems to enhance seedgermination.  Overwintering fanweed plants were in full-flower by mid-May,while other plant species were still seedlings.  Hence, seed production by mostfanweed plants was completed prior to the relatively hot, dry conditions whichdeveloped by mid-July during 1990 and 1991.
Seeds, contained in pods, tended to shatter as plant moisture levels declined;however, plants could be swathed to minimize harvest loss from shattering andto promote uniform seed maturation.  If swathed, fanweed could

, seed production by mostfanweed plants was completed prior to the relatively hot, dry conditions whichdeveloped by mid-July during 1990 and 1991.
Seeds, contained in pods, tended to shatter as plant moisture levels declined;however, plants could be swathed to minimize harvest loss from shattering andto promote uniform seed maturation.  If swathed, fanweed could be harvested inmid-June in the Northern Great Plains, possibly enabling a second crop to beplanted in the field during the same growing season.  Double cropping wouldlikely be possible in more southern portions of its range in North America.
Individual fanweed plants established in the fall produced an average of 1,600seeds, translating into an estimated yield of about 1,500 kg/ha for both years.This yield is similar to that reported in Montana during the 1940s when fanweedwas experimentally grown under irrigated management (Clopton and Triebold1944), and to seed production estimates of wild stands in Canada (Best andMcIntyre 1975).  Seed yields in excess of 1,300 kg/ha are not unusual when seedfrom wild fanweed stands is grown in the northern United States.
Fanweed demonstrated potential as an industrial crop on the basis of seed oilcontent and composition (
Table 2
).  Fanweed seed contained about 26% oil byweight; the oil, in turn, was close to 40% erucic acid (22:1).  Erucic acid isan unusual fatty acid with several industrial applications (Van Dyne et al.1990).  While the level of erucic acid in the seed produced by crambe wasgreater than that produced by fanweed, consideration of pests, crop rotations,and other factors could make fanweed a promising candidate for new cropdevelopment.

 acid isan unusual fatty acid with several industrial applications (Van Dyne et al.1990).  While the level of erucic acid in the seed produced by crambe wasgreater than that produced by fanweed, consideration of pests, crop rotations,and other factors could make fanweed a promising candidate for new cropdevelopment.
Black Mustard
Black mustard was rated as having very good to excellent agronomic potential.Plants were easy to mechanically sow and manage.  Growth was vigorous and largeplants developed (
Table 1
).  Seed production was underway by early July; theseeds which developed were contained in pods from 1.3 to 1.9 cm long whichtended to shatter as plant moisture levels declined.  Plants would probablyneed to be swathed prior to harvesting.  Black mustard may fit as a shortseason crop in some crop rotations in the Northern Great Plains.
Black mustard produced relatively large amounts of seed (>1,200 kg/ha)during 1990 and 1991 (Table 1).  In 1991, close to 1,900 kg/ha of seed wasproduced, making black mustard the highest yielding species evaluated.  Bycomparison, yield of crambe averaged 1,820 kg/ha in 1991.  Unlike fanweed, seeddormancy was not a serious problem with black mustard, so relatively good plantstands were fairly easy to establish in the spring.
Black mustard produced seed that was 32% oil (
Table 2
).  Of this, roughly 40%was erucic acid.  As with fanweed, black mustard demonstrated potential as anindustrial crop, even though crambe seed contained greater amounts of erucicacid.
Wild Mustard
Wild mustard (charlock, kaber mustard) was considered to have very good toexcellent agronomic potential.  Plants were

).  Of this, roughly 40%was erucic acid.  As with fanweed, black mustard demonstrated potential as anindustrial crop, even though crambe seed contained greater amounts of erucicacid.
Wild Mustard
Wild mustard (charlock, kaber mustard) was considered to have very good toexcellent agronomic potential.  Plants were easy to mechanically sow andmanage, and seeds appeared to lend themselves to mechanical harvesting methods.As with fanweed and black mustard, seeds of wild mustard were susceptible toshattering so plants would probably be swathed prior to harvesting the seed ifgrown on a field-scale.
Wild mustard produced roughly 2,000 kg/ha of seed during 1990 and 1991 (
Table 1
).  Individual plants produced an average of 2,076 seeds which were containedin pods approximately 2.5 cm in length.  The seed contained about 26% oil butfailed to be comprised of a high percentage of highly valued fatty acids (
Table 2
).  For this reason, wild mustard was considered to have low potential as anindustrial crop.
Hare's Ear Mustard
Hare's ear mustard (
syn
. hare's mustard) was considered to have moderateagronomic potential.  Plants were generally easy to mechanically sow andmanage.  However, about 15% of the stand was destroyed by an unknown pathogenin 1991.  Plants were short (<40 cm) and some seed pods were less than 10 cmabove the soil surface (
Table 1
).  This could present difficulties in themechanical harvesting process.  Seed could be harvested without first swathingthe plants since seed pods were not susceptible to shattering.
Hare's ear mustard produced relatively low quantities of seed in 1990 and 1991field evaluations; yields averaged 901 kg/ha in 1990 and only 549

 cmabove the soil surface (
Table 1
).  This could present difficulties in themechanical harvesting process.  Seed could be harvested without first swathingthe plants since seed pods were not susceptible to shattering.
Hare's ear mustard produced relatively low quantities of seed in 1990 and 1991field evaluations; yields averaged 901 kg/ha in 1990 and only 549 kg/ha in 1991(Table 1).  Individual plants produced an average of 590 seeds which werecontained in seed pods about 5 cm in length.
Hare's ear mustard produced seed containing about 30% oil, with close to 30% ofthe oil being comprised of erucic acid (
Table 2
).  Other research indicatesthat the oil contains additional fatty acids with industrial applications(Appelqvist, 1971).  It seems that further consideration of hare's ear mustardas an industrial crop is warranted.
Euphorbia lagascae
Euphorbia lagascae
was considered to have the lowest agronomic potentialof all plant species.  Seed development was indeterminate and fruits containingthe seed burst violently as the seed approached maturity.  Still, this plantspecies was agronomically attractive in several respects.  The seed was largeand easy to mechanically sow.  Seedlings grew rapidly and were easy to manage.Grasshoppers and other insect pests did not appear to feed on
Euphorbialagascae
. Improvements in seed retention are needed.
Euphorbia lagascae
produced an abundance of seed in 1990 and 1991 fieldevaluations, but much of the seed could not be collected due to seedshattering.  Hence, harvested seed only amounted to about 200 kg/ha during 1990and 150 kg/ha during 1991 (
Table 1
).  Further studies are needed to assess seedyields

Table 1
).  Further studies are needed to assess seedyields when plants are swathed prior to harvesting.
Euphorbia lagascae
produced seed which contained over 50% oil by weight.Past research determined that the oil contained over 50% vernolic acid (K.Carlson 1991 pers. commun.), making it a promising candidate for new cropdevelopment if genetic improvements and/or management practices could enhancethe mechanical harvestability of seed.
Weed Control
Weeds were a problem and had to be removed by hand throughout the growingseason.  Effective weed control strategies must be developed for each plantspecies.  The plant canopy produced by crambe intercepted more than 90% of theincident PAR after June 13 in the 1991 field evaluation (
Fig. 1
).  Only smallamounts of PAR could penetrate the canopy after this date and reach weedseedlings which were developing underneath.  This may explain why weed pressurewas much greater in hare's ear mustard than in crambe plots, since more than50% of the incident PAR reached weed seedlings developing under a canopy ofhare's ear mustard through most of the growing season.

Fanweed, black mustard, hare's ear mustard, and
Euphorbia lagascae

Fanweed, black mustard, hare's ear mustard, and
Euphorbia lagascae
contain fatty acids with important industrial applications.  These plants havevarying degrees of potential as novel industrial crops.  Fanweed is adapted togrowing conditions in the Great Plains and seems suited to field productionmethods.  Approximately 1,500 kg/ha of seed was produced in 1990-91 fieldevaluations in North Dakota.  This seed contained about 180 kg/ha of erucicacid, an unusual fatty acid with several industrial uses.  Black mustard andhare's ear mustard also produced seed containing erucic acid, but these weedspecies appeared to have less potential than fanweed as industrial crops whenagronomic factors were considered.  Seed harvesting difficulties with
Euphorbia lagascae
and failure of wild mustard seed oil to containhigh-value fatty acids presently limit their potential as industrial crops.

Height of 10 plants of each species wasmeasured prior to harvest.  A 0.7 m
2
area was harvested by hand fordetermination of dry matter, grain yield, and seed weight.

The six plant species included in the 1990 field experiment were each plantedin 8.2 m
2
plots in a randomized complete block design with fourreplicates.  The agronomic potential of each plant species was evaluated asdescribed.  A sunfleck ceptometer (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA) was usedto quantify the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that wasintercepted by the plant canopy in plots of two replicates on selected datesduring the growing season.  Plants in a 1.9 m

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fanweed
Fanweed (
syn
. stinkweed, field pennycress, pennycress) was rated ashaving excellent potential as a new crop if established in the fall (
Table 1
).Poor germination of spring-sown fanweed seed was a problem.  As a result, yieldof fanweed was low when planted in the spring.  Metzger (1990) reported thatexposure to temperatures of 0° to 10°C for 3 to 6 weeks can break thedormancy of fanweed seed.  Dormancy can be broken if seed is scarified byscratching the seedcoat (Best and McIntyre 1975), although this was not truefor spring-sown seed in this study.  Broadcast planting rather than seeddrilling is desirable, since exposure to light seems to enhance seedgermination.  Overwintering fanweed plants were in full-flower by mid-May,while other plant species were still seedlings.  Hence, seed production by mostfanweed plants was completed prior to the relatively hot, dry conditions whichdeveloped by mid-July during 1990 and 1991.
Seeds, contained in pods, tended to shatter as plant moisture levels declined;however, plants could be swathed to minimize harvest loss from shattering andto promote uniform seed maturation.  If swathed, fanweed could

, seed production by mostfanweed plants was completed prior to the relatively hot, dry conditions whichdeveloped by mid-July during 1990 and 1991.
Seeds, contained in pods, tended to shatter as plant moisture levels declined;however, plants could be swathed to minimize harvest loss from shattering andto promote uniform seed maturation.  If swathed, fanweed could be harvested inmid-June in the Northern Great Plains, possibly enabling a second crop to beplanted in the field during the same growing season.  Double cropping wouldlikely be possible in more southern portions of its range in North America.
Individual fanweed plants established in the fall produced an average of 1,600seeds, translating into an estimated yield of about 1,500 kg/ha for both years.This yield is similar to that reported in Montana during the 1940s when fanweedwas experimentally grown under irrigated management (Clopton and Triebold1944), and to seed production estimates of wild stands in Canada (Best andMcIntyre 1975).  Seed yields in excess of 1,300 kg/ha are not unusual when seedfrom wild fanweed stands is grown in the northern United States.
Fanweed demonstrated potential as an industrial crop on the basis of seed oilcontent and composition (
Table 2
).  Fanweed seed contained about 26% oil byweight; the oil, in turn, was close to 40% erucic acid (22:1).  Erucic acid isan unusual fatty acid with several industrial applications (Van Dyne et al.1990).  While the level of erucic acid in the seed produced by crambe wasgreater than that produced by fanweed, consideration of pests, crop rotations,and other factors could make fanweed a promising candidate for new cropdevelopment.

While the level of erucic acid in the seed produced by crambe wasgreater than that produced by fanweed, consideration of pests, crop rotations,and other factors could make fanweed a promising candidate for new cropdevelopment.
Black Mustard
Black mustard was rated as having very good to excellent agronomic potential.Plants were easy to mechanically sow and manage.  Growth was vigorous and largeplants developed (
Table 1
).  Seed production was underway by early July; theseeds which developed were contained in pods from 1.3 to 1.9 cm long whichtended to shatter as plant moisture levels declined.  Plants would probablyneed to be swathed prior to harvesting.  Black mustard may fit as a shortseason crop in some crop rotations in the Northern Great Plains.
Black mustard produced relatively large amounts of seed (>1,200 kg/ha)during 1990 and 1991 (Table 1).  In 1991, close to 1,900 kg/ha of seed wasproduced, making black mustard the highest yielding species evaluated.  Bycomparison, yield of crambe averaged 1,820 kg/ha in 1991.  Unlike fanweed, seeddormancy was not a serious problem with black mustard, so relatively good plantstands were fairly easy to establish in the spring.
Black mustard produced seed that was 32% oil (
Table 2
).  Of this, roughly 40%was erucic acid.  As with fanweed, black mustard demonstrated potential as anindustrial crop, even though crambe seed contained greater amounts of erucicacid.
Wild Mustard
Wild mustard (charlock, kaber mustard) was considered to have very good toexcellent agronomic potential.  Plants were

).  Of this, roughly 40%was erucic acid.  As with fanweed, black mustard demonstrated potential as anindustrial crop, even though crambe seed contained greater amounts of erucicacid.
Wild Mustard
Wild mustard (charlock, kaber mustard) was considered to have very good toexcellent agronomic potential.  Plants were easy to mechanically sow andmanage, and seeds appeared to lend themselves to mechanical harvesting methods.As with fanweed and black mustard, seeds of wild mustard were susceptible toshattering so plants would probably be swathed prior to harvesting the seed ifgrown on a field-scale.
Wild mustard produced roughly 2,000 kg/ha of seed during 1990 and 1991 (
Table 1
).  Individual plants produced an average of 2,076 seeds which were containedin pods approximately 2.5 cm in length.  The seed contained about 26% oil butfailed to be comprised of a high percentage of highly valued fatty acids (
Table 2
).  For this reason, wild mustard was considered to have low potential as anindustrial crop.
Hare's Ear Mustard
Hare's ear mustard (
syn
. hare's mustard) was considered to have moderateagronomic potential.  Plants were generally easy to mechanically sow andmanage.  However, about 15% of the stand was destroyed by an unknown pathogenin 1991.  Plants were short (<40 cm) and some seed pods were less than 10 cmabove the soil surface (
Table 1
).  This could present difficulties in themechanical harvesting process.  Seed could be harvested without first swathingthe plants since seed pods were not susceptible to shattering.
Hare's ear mustard produced relatively low quantities of seed in 1990 and 1991field evaluations; yields averaged 901 kg/ha in 1990 and only 549

 cmabove the soil surface (
Table 1
).  This could present difficulties in themechanical harvesting process.  Seed could be harvested without first swathingthe plants since seed pods were not susceptible to shattering.
Hare's ear mustard produced relatively low quantities of seed in 1990 and 1991field evaluations; yields averaged 901 kg/ha in 1990 and only 549 kg/ha in 1991(Table 1).  Individual plants produced an average of 590 seeds which werecontained in seed pods about 5 cm in length.
Hare's ear mustard produced seed containing about 30% oil, with close to 30% ofthe oil being comprised of erucic acid (
Table 2
).  Other research indicatesthat the oil contains additional fatty acids with industrial applications(Appelqvist, 1971).  It seems that further consideration of hare's ear mustardas an industrial crop is warranted.
Euphorbia lagascae
Euphorbia lagascae
was considered to have the lowest agronomic potentialof all plant species.  Seed development was indeterminate and fruits containingthe seed burst violently as the seed approached maturity.  Still, this plantspecies was agronomically attractive in several respects.  The seed was largeand easy to mechanically sow.  Seedlings grew rapidly and were easy to manage.Grasshoppers and other insect pests did not appear to feed on
Euphorbialagascae
. Improvements in seed retention are needed.
Euphorbia lagascae
produced an abundance of seed in 1990 and 1991 fieldevaluations, but much of the seed could not be collected due to seedshattering.  Hence, harvested seed only amounted to about 200 kg/ha during 1990and 150 kg/ha during 1991 (
Table 1
).  Further studies are needed to assess seedyields

Table 1
).  Further studies are needed to assess seedyields when plants are swathed prior to harvesting.
Euphorbia lagascae
produced seed which contained over 50% oil by weight.Past research determined that the oil contained over 50% vernolic acid (K.Carlson 1991 pers. commun.), making it a promising candidate for new cropdevelopment if genetic improvements and/or management practices could enhancethe mechanical harvestability of seed.
Weed Control
Weeds were a problem and had to be removed by hand throughout the growingseason.  Effective weed control strategies must be developed for each plantspecies.  The plant canopy produced by crambe intercepted more than 90% of theincident PAR after June 13 in the 1991 field evaluation (
Fig. 1
).  Only smallamounts of PAR could penetrate the canopy after this date and reach weedseedlings which were developing underneath.  This may explain why weed pressurewas much greater in hare's ear mustard than in crambe plots, since more than50% of the incident PAR reached weed seedlings developing under a canopy ofhare's ear mustard through most of the growing season.
SUMMARY
Fanweed, black mustard, hare's ear mustard, and
Euphorbia lagascae

Fanweed, black mustard, hare's ear mustard, and
Euphorbia lagascae
contain fatty acids with important industrial applications.  These plants havevarying degrees of potential as novel industrial crops.  Fanweed is adapted togrowing conditions in the Great Plains and seems suited to field productionmethods.  Approximately 1,500 kg/ha of seed was produced in 1990-91 fieldevaluations in North Dakota.  This seed contained about 180 kg/ha of erucicacid, an unusual fatty acid with several industrial uses.  Black mustard andhare's ear mustard also produced seed containing erucic acid, but these weedspecies appeared to have less potential than fanweed as industrial crops whenagronomic factors were considered.  Seed harvesting difficulties with
Euphorbia lagascae
and failure of wild mustard seed oil to containhigh-value fatty acids presently limit their potential as industrial crops.
