Choy Sum, Chinese Cabbage
Cruciferae
Brassica parachinensis

Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This oriental vegetable is very similar in growth habit and culture to Chinesecabbage, which see. However, it is grown for the flowering stalk. The entireplant with the flowering stalk may be harvested and marketed. In exposure ofedible parts daring growth the plant is comparable to sprouting broccoli.
