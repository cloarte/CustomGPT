IMPACT ON FLORIDA’S POTATO CROP   
ISSUE  - A NEW DISEASE IN FLORIDA’S POTATO CROP  
• Florida produces two potato crops – one in spring 
and one in fall. 
• Value of Florida’s 21,000 acres is more than 
$200M/year (2023 NASS) 
• In fall 2022, a crop consultant submitted a sample 
with unusual symptoms and spreading fast to the 
SPDN regional center lab at the University of 
Florida 
• The SPDN diagnosticians identified the fungus, 
Colletotrichum, causing black dot, a new disease for 
Florida.  This disease can cause defoliation if left 
untreated, leading to poor yield. 
RESPONSE 
• The crop scout indicated the foliar disease was present on nearly 100% of the fields scouted 
and routine fungicide sprays were not helping. 
• The SPDN diagnosticians tested the isolates for fungicide sensitivity. 
• The isolates were insensitive to a common fungicide.  Quick response to the consultant 
changed the course of fungicide applications for the crop, halting disease spread and 
protecting the $5M crop. 
RESULTS  
• Timely educational communications through extension contacts and newsletters ensured all 
producers in the state were aware of the disease, how to detect it, and how to treat it 
effectively during a year with especially favorable crop prices. 
 
Great industry-extension teamwork: An experienced scout knew something was unusual 
and had a trusted lab contact to help with accurate ID.  Luckily the lab also was able to 
test for fungicide insensitivity
