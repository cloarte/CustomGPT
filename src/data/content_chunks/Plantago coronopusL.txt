Plantago coronopusL. - Buck's-horn Plantain  -Plantaginaceae© John Wilde(Map updated: March 2008)A common plantain species of rocks and cliffs by the sea, and often accompanied byPlantago maritima. It is distinguished from all otherPlantagospp. by its raggedly toothed leaves.Like all native Irish plantains, the flowers are wind-pollinated and produced in tight club-shaped spikes on the ends of long scapes. The plant is at its most attractive at the stage when the pollen is produced, when the yellow anthers hang out from the flowers on the ends of their long filaments, but otherwise the flower and fruit spike is drab and uninteresting-looking.All names:Plantago coronopusL.;Plantago sabrinae(Cardew & Bak.)
