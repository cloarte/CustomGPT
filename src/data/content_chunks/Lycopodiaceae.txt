2.Lycopodiaceae石松科 shi song keAuthors:Li-Bing Zhang&Kunio IwatsukiPlants terrestrial, helophytic, or epiphytic, small to large. Main stems creeping, pendulous, climbing, or short and erect, mainly protostelic, rarely actinostelic or plectostelic, on substrate surface or subterranean, or forming stolons. Upright shoots once to multiple times dichotomously branched, conspicuously leafy; upper portion of stem and branchlets with or without bulbils. Lateral branches ascending or erect, dichotomously branched or nearly sympodially branched, rarely pseudomonopodially branched. Main stems and lateral branches rounded or flat in cross section. Leaves as microphylls, with 1 unbranched midrib, monomorphic, spirally arranged. Leaves on subterranean parts flat, appressed, not photosynthetic, and scalelike; leaves on aerial parts appressed, ascending or spreading, subulate, linear, lanceolate, ovate, or scalelike, not lustrous or lustrous, remote to dense and imbricate, papery, leathery, or thinly leathery, base truncate, margin entire or serrate. Strobili terminal on branchlets or main stem, abruptly becoming much smaller than or similar to sterile branches or branchlets in size, solitary, erect, nodding, or pendent, terete, sessile or stalked. Sporophylls homomorphic with or different from trophophylls, monomorphic or dimorphic, papery, margin toothed, membranous. Sporangia in axils of sporophylls, yellow, reniform, thick-walled, outer walls variously modified. Spores trilete, thick-
