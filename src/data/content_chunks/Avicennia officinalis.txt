Uses
The wood, used to construct boats, houses, and wharves has been studied as a
pulp source, and the bark and roots are used for tanning.  The bark is used for
dying cloth, the ash for washing it in India (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk 1962).
Javanese and others may consume the bitter fruits and seeds after rather
elaborate processing.  Branches are lopped and given to cattle for fodder.  The
wood has been recommended for creosoted paving blocks.  Its wood is attractive
enough of grain to be useful in cabinetry.
Folk Medicine
According to Hartwell (1967–1971), the fruits are plastered onto tumors in
India.  Indian mangrove is a folk remedy for boils and tumors (Duke and Wain,
1981).  Kirtikar and Basu (1975) suggest that the roots are aphrodisiac.
Unripe seeds are poulticed onto abscesses, boils, and smallpox sores.
Indochinese use the bark for skin afflictions, especially scabies.  According
to Perry (1980), quoting other sources, "A resinous substance exuded from the
bark acts as a contraceptive, and apparently can be taken all year long without
ill effects.  Philippines use the seed for ulcers, the resin for snakebite."

Chemistry
Tanganyikan wood specimens (zero moisture basis) contained 54.7% cellulose,
2.3% ash (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  The wood ash is said to be rich in alkali.  A
green, bitter, medicinal resin oozes from the bark.  Bark contains tannin and
lapachol (Perry, 1980), but the tannin content may be only 2.5% (C.S.I.R.,
1948–1976).
Description
Evergreen tree, sometimes to 25 m, trunk to 1 m in diameter.  Numerous upright
pneumatophores rise above soil from long shallow, horizontal roots.  Bark
brownish-gray, thin, becoming rough and blackish, or outer bark
yellowish-green and inner bark whitish.  Leaves opposite obovate or broadly
oblong, 4–12 cm long, 2–6 cm wide, rounded at tip, acute or rounded at base,
thick, leathery, edges slightly rolled under, upper surfaces shiny green and
hairless, underneath with fine gray-green hairs and resin dots.  Cymes headlike
in panicles, upright near ends of twigs, to 15 cm long and wide.  Flowers many
2–12 together, sessile, malodorous, 7–10 mm long, 12–15 mm across.  Calyx

less, underneath with fine gray-green hairs and resin dots.  Cymes headlike
in panicles, upright near ends of twigs, to 15 cm long and wide.  Flowers many
2–12 together, sessile, malodorous, 7–10 mm long, 12–15 mm across.  Calyx
5-lobed, hairy on edges, with resin dots; corolla bell-shaped, tubular, yellow
or yellow-brown, turning orange, with 4 unequal spreading lobes, stamens 4,
inserted in notches of corolla tube; ovary conical, hairy, imperfectly 4-celled
with 4 ovules, style threadlike; stigma 2-forked.  Capsule broadly ovoid,
flattened, 2.5 cm long.  Seed 1, large, flattened, without seed coat,
germinating in water (Little, 1983).
Germplasm
Reported from the African, Australian, Hindustani, and Indonesian-Indochina
Centers of Diversity, Indian mangrove, or cvs thereof, is reported to tolerate
alkali, disease, insects, high pH, pest, salt, and waterlogging (NAS, 1980a;
Little, 1983).
Distribution
Coasts of southern Asia to Australia and Oceania.  From East Pakistan,
Tanasserim, Andaman Islands, and Sri Lanka through coasts of Vietnam, Thailand,
and Peninsular Malaysia to the Philippines, Sumatra, Madura, Java, Borneo,
Celebes, Sunda Islands, Molucca Islands, and New Guinea; south in Australia to
New South Wales.  Near sea level, to 50 m in Papua.  Not widely introduced
elsewhere (Little, 1983).

New South Wales.  Near sea level, to 50 m in Papua.  Not widely introduced
elsewhere (Little, 1983).
Ecology
Estimated to range from Tropical Moist to Wet through Subtropical Moist to Wet
Forest Life Zones, Indian mangrove is estimated to tolerate annual
precipitation of 10 to 45 dm, annual temperature of 20 to 26°C, and pH of 6
to 8.5.  Mostly on brackish or saline silts of depositing shores and marshes.
Cultivation
According to the NAS (1980a), planting is usually not needed because natural
regeneration is so successful.  In
Avicennia
and
Rhizophora
direct seeding result in ca 90% survival.
Harvesting
Since this mangrove can regrow rapidly from buds beneath the bark along the
trunk and branches, it is said to suffer little from removal of much of the
branchwood (NAS, 1980a).
Yields and Economics
Good mangrove stands can show annual productivity of 10–20(-25) MT/ha/yr, but
for firewood purposes, I would reduce that to 10–20(-25) m
3
/ha/yr,
figuring that at optimal rather than average.  Because of the heaviness of the
wood, a cubic meter of mangrove is generally more valuable than other species.
Litterfall may account for 1/3–1/2 of aboveground productivity.
