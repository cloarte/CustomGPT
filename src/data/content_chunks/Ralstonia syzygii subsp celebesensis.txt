🌍 Distribución: 
🦠 Hospedantes: Musa (banana), Musa acuminata (wild banana)
 Nombres comunes: EnglishBDBblood disease bacterium, Indonesiapenyakit darah, RALSSC, Indonesiapenyakit darah, RALSSC, Bacteria
 Sinonimos: Burkholderia sp. nr solanacearum, Pseudomonas celebensisGäumann 1923, Ralstonia solanacearum phylotype IVPoussier et al. 2000, Xanthomonas celebensis(Gäumann 1923) Dowson 1943, EnglishBDBblood disease bacterium, Indonesiapenyakit darah, RALSSC, Bacteria, Proteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Burkholderiales, Ralstoniaceae, Ralstonia, Ralstonia syzygii subsp. celebesensis
 Invasion: Ralstonia syzygiisubsp.celebesensiscells are small, straight, aerobic, Gram-negative rods, about 0.5 x 1.0-1.5 µm. The bacterium has no motility, flagella, or poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate intracellular inclusions. On TZC medium (Kelman, 1954), commonly used forRalstonia solanacearum, colonies of blood disease bacterium are slow-growing, non-fluidal and have smooth margins with dark red centres. Colonies are non-fluorescent on King's B medium, brown pigment is not produced on tyrosinase medium, but colonies become brown on prolonged incubation on these and other media. Growth

, 1954), commonly used forRalstonia solanacearum, colonies of blood disease bacterium are slow-growing, non-fluidal and have smooth margins with dark red centres. Colonies are non-fluorescent on King's B medium, brown pigment is not produced on tyrosinase medium, but colonies become brown on prolonged incubation on these and other media. Growth occurs at 37°C, but not at 41°C, and is inhibited by 2% NaCl. Optimum temperature for growth is 28°C. Growth is poor (colonies of <1 mm after 7 days) or absent on many common media. Good growth (colonies up to 5 mm after 7-12 days) occurs on iron salts-containing media: buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, periwinkle wilt medium and iron-supplemented casamino acids medium. Grow at pH 6.0-7.5 (Ray et al., 2021).
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: Cultivated / agricultural land, Protected agriculture (e.g. glasshouse production)
 Reproduccion: Ralstonia syzygii subsp. celebesensis is disseminated in soil, water and on farm tools. It is thought to enter host roots through natural openings or wounds ( Safni et al., 2018 ). Infested soil, tools and vehicles move the pathogen within plantations, and movement of infected fruit and planting material enable long-distance spread ( Safni et al., 2018 ). Few observations of the life cycle of blood disease have been reported since the early studies by Gäumann (1921; 1923a), who showed that the bacterium persisted for over a year in soil infested with diseased plant remnants and could infect healthy plants following experimental soil inoculation.

 life cycle of blood disease have been reported since the early studies by Gäumann (1921; 1923a), who showed that the bacterium persisted for over a year in soil infested with diseased plant remnants and could infect healthy plants following experimental soil inoculation. Bacteria survive for several weeks in infected fruits which, because they do not show external symptoms, may be marketed and subsequently discarded by the consumer; the disease may have been introduced to Java in this manner. Early experimental work by Gäumann (1923a) reported that bacteria applied to the stigma of receptive female flowers could penetrate the style and infect the fruits. Following experimental inoculation of bacteria into the base of leaf petioles or pseudostems, bacteria invade all parts of the plant and young plants wilt within 7-10 days. The draft genome sequence of R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis causing banana blood disease in Indonesia is available under NCBI accession number NZ_CP068285.1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_CP068285.1 . The R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis genome encodes no obvious unique metabolic capacities and contained no evidence of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria occupying similar niches ( Remenant et al., 2011 ). R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis harbours a plasmid named pRscUGMSS_Db01 in the strain UGMSS_Db01 with 1,614,911 bp length: GenBank accession number CP068286.1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP068286.1 .
