FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE RESPONSE PLAN: 
THE RED BOOK
1
Presentation updated 
October 2020
Purpose of Plan
• Provides responders with:
– A guiding APHIS policy document  to 
use during an FMD outbreak in 
domestic livestock.
– Current strategic guidance for 
control, containment, and 
eradication of FMD in an outbreak.
2

Target Audience
• Animal health 
emergency 
responders, Federal, 
State, local, and Tribal 
government as well as 
industry partners. 

Red Book Chapters
General to strategic to tactical
• FMD Information
• National FMD Preparedness and Response
• Outbreak Response Goals and Strategy
• Critical Activities and Tools

FMD Response Goals
1. Detect, control, and contain FMD in animals as quickly 
as possible.
2. Eradicate FMD using strategies that are designed to 
stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply, and the 
economy, and to protect public health and the 
environment.
3. Provide science-and risk-based approaches and 
systems to facilitate continuity of business for non-
infected animals and non-contaminated animal 
products.
5

FMD Response Goals, cont.
In summary, achieving these three goals will allow 
individual livestock facilities, States, Tribes, regions, 
and industries to resume normal production as quickly 
as possible. They will also allow the United States to 
regain FMD-free status without the response effort 
causing more disruption and damage than the disease 
outbreak itself.

FMD Response Strategy
Control and Eradication Strategy
• Five potential strategies, including use of emergency 
vaccination.
• Selection of a response strategy depends on several 
factors.
– Spread and distribution of outbreak, and population density of 
susceptible animals.
– Desired FMD-status after an outbreak.
– Resources available, including for vaccination, surveillance, 
diagnostics, and disposal.

FMD Response Strategy
Coordinated Public Awareness Campaign
• Occurs in conjunction with any response strategy 
or strategies.
• Engages and leverages State-Federal-Tribal-
stakeholder relationships to provide unified public 
messages for all audiences.
• Addresses issues and concerns relating to food 
safety, public health, and animal welfare.
• Addresses issues and concerns related to 
interstate commerce, continuity of business, and 
international trade.
