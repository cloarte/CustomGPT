 Invasion: I.cylindricais a perennial grass which varies in height (30-150 cm). The culms (above-ground stems) are short, erect and arise from rhizomes (underground stems). The rhizomes are tough, white, commonly 1 m long but can be considerably more, are extensively branched and covered with papery scale leaves at the nodes. Roots are fibrous, emerging from the base of the culm and the nodes on the rhizome. Leaves are stiff, linear-lanceolate, up to 120 cm long and 4-18 mm wide, with a prominent, off-centre, whitish midrib, scabrid margin and pointed tip. The ligule is an inconspicuous membrane. The inflorescence is a white, spike-like panicle, terminal, fluffy, 5-20 cm long and up to 2.5 cm in diameter. Spikelets are numerous, 3.5-5.0 mm long, each surrounded by a basal ring of silky hairs 10 mm long. The grain is oblong, pointed, brown and 1-1.5 mm long.

 Reproduccion: Genetics Chromosome numbers vary according to the variety of I. cylindrica : 2n = 20 for var. major , 2n = 40 for var. europa and 2n = 60 for var. africana ( Santiago, 1980 ). Genetic variation has also been observed to occur within I. cylindrica . In a study by Cheng and Chou (1997) based on six populations of I. cylindrica collected from various habitats around Taiwan, a high level of genetic heterogeneity was found among populations of I. cylindrica . Genetic differences among the populations were correlated with morphological features. Among the populations studied, only those collected from mangrove areas possessed a hollow structure in the midrib of the leaf and villous trichomes on the abaxial leaf surface, features that are considered to be adaptive mechanisms to saline environments. Chou and Tsai (1999) also found that there is variation in IGS (intergenic spacer) length and sequence of rDNA among intra- and inter-specific populations of I. cylindrica based on PCR-amplified RFLP. I. cylindrica is also known to hybridize with other species, with Gabel (1982) providing evidence of hybridization between I. cylindrica and I. brasiliensis .

 variation in IGS (intergenic spacer) length and sequence of rDNA among intra- and inter-specific populations of I. cylindrica based on PCR-amplified RFLP. I. cylindrica is also known to hybridize with other species, with Gabel (1982) providing evidence of hybridization between I. cylindrica and I. brasiliensis . Intergeneric hybrids have been obtained with Saccharum ( Watson and Dallwitz, 1992 ). Reproductive Biology I. cylindrica is a prolific producer of seeds which are dispersed by wind over long distances to colonize cleared or previously un-infested land. It can produce as many as 3000 seeds per plant ( Holm et al., 1977 ), and 95% of I. cylindrica seeds can germinate within one week of being harvested but can also retain viability for at least one year ( Santiago, 1965 ). I. cylindrica is not capable of self-pollination ( Gabel, 1982 ) and produces viable seeds only through cross-pollination ( McDonald et al., 1996 ). Flowering is variable between individual plants and can occur in response to stress from slashing, grazing, burning, mowing, or the addition of nitrogen ( Holm et al., 1977 ; Willard, 1988 ). Physiology and Phenology Suspected allelopathic properties ( Eussen et al., 1976 ) and a vigorous growth habit have made I. cylindrica one of the most competitive weeds. The aggressive and invasive nature of I. cylindrica is largely attributed to its extensive rhizome system which is concentrated in the upper 20 cm of soil. The lateral buds can remain dormant for long periods and give I. cylindrica its perennating habit. The bud from a single rhizome node can give rise to 350 shoots in 6 weeks, which can cover up to 4 m² in 11 weeks ( Eussen, 1980 ). Other reports of I. cylindrica '

izome system which is concentrated in the upper 20 cm of soil. The lateral buds can remain dormant for long periods and give I. cylindrica its perennating habit. The bud from a single rhizome node can give rise to 350 shoots in 6 weeks, which can cover up to 4 m² in 11 weeks ( Eussen, 1980 ). Other reports of I. cylindrica 's productivity are that 2.73 m of rhizome can be produced in 109 days (Wilcutt et al., 1983) and that a 15 cm length of rhizome can produce 181 shoots per m² in 6.5 months (Lee, 1977). The regenerative capacity of I. cylindrica rhizomes is affected by their age ( Ayeni and Duke, 1985 ); older rhizomes regenerate better than those that are young and contain relatively few nutrients. There is a greater chance of sprouting in larger or longer rhizomes because of their higher nutrient status ( Soerjani and Soemarwoto, 1969 ; Ivens, 1975 ). Mature buds closest to the apex are the first to sprout when the rhizome is fragmented from the parent plant. Rhizomes which develop during the rainy season do not regenerate as well as those formed in the dry season. Bud germination of rhizomes is favoured by exposure to light ( Soerjani, 1970 ). Rhizome regeneration increases when oxygen is introduced into the rhizosphere (Wilcutt et al., 1983) but decreases with increased depth of burial ( Ivens, 1980 ). There is marked seasonal variation in the growth of I. cylindrica . During the dry season, the number of living shoots and the emergence of new shoots are relatively low compared with in the wet season. Any production of new shoots is balanced by the death of older shoots. Low shoot emergence is associated with low rainfall and soil moisture. During the dry season, the mass of dead shoots

, 1980 ). There is marked seasonal variation in the growth of I. cylindrica . During the dry season, the number of living shoots and the emergence of new shoots are relatively low compared with in the wet season. Any production of new shoots is balanced by the death of older shoots. Low shoot emergence is associated with low rainfall and soil moisture. During the dry season, the mass of dead shoots can exceed that of live shoots. It appears that I. cylindrica sacrifices its shoots in order to maintain healthy, nutrient-rich rhizomes. I. cylindrica assimilates carbon dioxide by the C4 photosynthetic pathway ( Paul and Elmore, 1984 ) giving it a competitive advantage over C3 plants (such as rice) in tropical conditions. However, in common with many C4 plants, I. cylindrica is relatively intolerant of shade. Light is inevitably important in the growth of I. cylindrica although contradictory results exist on the production of shoots versus rhizomes under a range of light intensities. In one investigation ( Eussen, 1981 ) it was shown that after 6 months’ growth, I. cylindrica had more rhizomes than shoots at all light intensities (20-100% intensity) but, in another ( Soerjani, 1970 ), I. cylindrica tended to have more shoots (11.5 t/ha) than rhizomes (7.0 t/ha). However, there is evidence that I. cylindrica produces more shoots than rhizomes under low light conditions. I. cylindrica is capable of capturing material flowing from higher areas in the landscape through erosion, hence, it is possible that it can cause the build-up of vesicular arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal inoculum. The spore density and species richness of VA fungi is found to be high in Imperata grasslands, except at the most degraded sites ( Hairiah

The spore density and species richness of VA fungi is found to be high in Imperata grasslands, except at the most degraded sites ( Hairiah et al., 2003 ). Associations There is extensive occurrence of endomycorrhizas on I. cylindrica collected from around Indonesia ( Tjitrosemito et al., 1994 ). The existence of a mycorrhizal relationship is usually associated with the host plant being able to utilize available phosphorus. This gives I. cylindrica an advantage over plants without mycorrhizas in situations where phosphate is limiting. In Nepal, grasslands dominated by I. cylindrica support a number of vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered species such as swamp deer ( Cervus duvauceli ) ( Ghimire, 1996 ), hispid hare ( Caprolagus hispidus ), pygmy hog ( Sus salvanis ) ( Oliver, 1985 ) and Bengal florican ( Eupodotis bengalensis ) ( Inskipp and Inskipp, 1983 ). I. cylindrica grasslands also support a dense population of chital ( Axis axis ) in Nepal. I. cylindrica constitutes the major portion of the diet of hog deer ( Axis porcinus ) which live in protected areas of sub-Himalayan West Bengal ( Bhowmik et al., 1999 ). Environmental Requirements This weed is found at altitudes from sea level to 2700 m and rainfalls of 500-5000 mm/year ( Holm et al., 1977 ).

 Bengal ( Bhowmik et al., 1999 ). Environmental Requirements This weed is found at altitudes from sea level to 2700 m and rainfalls of 500-5000 mm/year ( Holm et al., 1977 ). Fire-based cultivation methods (slash and burn) have been known to transform forest areas to grasslands dominated by I. cylindrica . Aside from this practice, soil degradation resulting from cropping systems that do not supply enough organic inputs in the soil or provide a permanent cover on the soil (i.e. pastures that are routinely mowed, etc.) also allow for colonization by I. cylindrica ( Hairiah et al., 2003 ). I. cylindrica can dominate vast tracts of degraded land because of its ability to survive under conditions of low soil fertility. It is also able to thrive in different types of soil and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH conditions. Once established, it will continue to persist even when there is environmental stress such as drought, flooding or fire. Seedhead formation is induced by slashing, mowing, grazing, burning and the application of fertilizers ( Colvin et al., 1993 ). Burning also stimulates vegetative growth. Under conditions of high light intensity, high temperatures and limited moisture, the C4 pathway of I. cylindrica allows it to photosynthesize more efficiently and gives it a competitive edge over C3 species. Due to its requirement for sunlight, I. cylindrica survives poorly in closed-canopy forest or plantations where shading occurs. According to Moosavi-nia and Dore (1979) , increasing shade levels of >50% reduces shoot dry weight and both rhizome length and dry weight, causing an increase in the shoot/rhizome ratio. The ability of rhizomes to resprout after the above ground biomass has been removed reportedly declined when the mowed stand was subjected to 88% shade for more than 2 months ( Hairiah et al., 2003

The ability of rhizomes to resprout after the above ground biomass has been removed reportedly declined when the mowed stand was subjected to 88% shade for more than 2 months ( Hairiah et al., 2003 ). The light compensation point of I. cylindrica is 32 µmol/m²/s or 2% of ambient sunlight, and biomass reduction was observed when ambient light was 1% or 15 µmol/m²/s ( Gaffney, 1996 ). I. cylindrica grows poorly in heavily cultivated lands where it is kept in check mechanically ( Van Loan et al., 2002 ). It is also sensitive to excessive soil moisture during early seedling development, hence, excessive moisture could restrict invasion of I. cylindrica by seed. However, once established, the tolerance of I. cylindrica to flooding increases ( King and Grace, 2000 ). The spread of I. cylindrica in the USA has been limited to south-eastern parts and this is attributed to temperature. I. cylindrica survived the 1984 winter season in Alabama, USA, where the coldest air temperature recorded was -14°C; however, it did not survive the -28.9°C winter temperature in Texas in 1984 ( Wilcut et al., 1988 ). Cold temperatures may be a limiting factor to the spread of I. cylindrica beyond the south-eastern regions of the USA. However, a red-tipped ornamental cultivar of I. cylindrica , also known as Rubra, Japanese Bloodgrass or Red Baron, is very cold tolerant and has persisted for several years in an ornamental garden in Michigan, USA.

 winter temperature in Texas in 1984 ( Wilcut et al., 1988 ). Cold temperatures may be a limiting factor to the spread of I. cylindrica beyond the south-eastern regions of the USA. However, a red-tipped ornamental cultivar of I. cylindrica , also known as Rubra, Japanese Bloodgrass or Red Baron, is very cold tolerant and has persisted for several years in an ornamental garden in Michigan, USA. Shilling et al. (1997) expressed concern that its introduction and possible hybridization with I. cylindrica will result in hybrids that may exhibit both invasiveness and cold tolerance allowing range extension to northern and western regions of the USA. I. cylindrica thrives at altitudes from sea level to 2000 m in the Himalayas ( Holm et al., 1977 ).

Beauv.] and the closely related native, Brazilian satintail (I. brasiliensisTrin.), are aggressive,
colony-forming dense erect perennial grasses 1 to 6 feet (30 to 180 cm) in height. Hybridization is probable and makes
differentiation difficult. Both have tufts of long leaves hiding short stems, yellow-green blades (each with an offcenter midvein
and finely saw-toothed margins), and silver-plumed flowers and seeds in spring (sporadically year-round). Seed are dispersed
by wind and on contaminated clothing, equipment, and products like pinestraw mulch and fill materials. Seed viability appears
at this time to be significantly less in northern Florida and southern Georgia and higher in southern Alabama and Mississippi.
Dense stands of dried plants remain standing during winter to present a severe fire hazard, while remaining green year-round
in central and southern Florida. These species burn hot even when green.Infestations form dense rhizome mats making eradication difficult, because abundant shoot and rhizome buds usually sprout

 when green.Infestations form dense rhizome mats making eradication difficult, because abundant shoot and rhizome buds usually sprout
after treatment or lay dormant to sprout within months. Rhizomes are sharp tipped and can pierce roots of other plants. Older
infestations will be more difficult to control than new invasions that occur as circular patches.Both species are Federal and State noxious weeds, while red-tipped cultivars are still sold and planted in many Southern States.
These cultivars, bred for cold hardiness, have viable pollen that might spread to the invasive cogongrass plants. Red cultivars
can revert to the green aggressive type. Some Southern States prohibit the sale of the red cultivars. Visit www.cogongrass.org
and other State cogongrass Web sites for more details. Resemble Johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense(L.) Pers.]; purpletop
[Tridens flavus(L.) Hitchc.]; silver plumegrass [Saccharum alopecuroidum(L.) Nutt.]; and sugarcane plumegrass [S. giganteum(Walter) Pers.]—all having a stem, do not produce fluffy seed heads, and no sharp-tipped rhizomes jutting up from the soil
surface. Also resemble longleaf woodoats [Chasmanthium sessiliflorum(Poir.) Yates] that occurs in shaded colonies in forests
but lacks offcenter midveins and silky flowers having tufts of spiked flowers and seeds along a slender stalk.Management strategiesDo not plant the red-tipped cultivars (Japanese bloodgrass and Red Baron).

Remove prior plantings, and control sprouts and seedlings.Treat when new plants are young and located through frequent surveillance of lands in infested zones.Minimize disturbance within miles of where this plant occurs, and anticipate wider occupation when plants are present or adjacent before disturbance.Repeated cultivation and planting of aggressive grasses or herbicide resistant crops can restore pastures and croplands.Burning and bush-mowing treatments can remove standing plants for more efficient herbicide treatments. However, burning usually causes rapid infestation expansion and can kill native shrubs and trees that constrain spread.Do not use or transport fill dirt, rock, hay, or pinestraw from infested lands.Seed production can be stopped by mowing, burning, or herbicide treatments in early stages of flowering or even shortly before flowering. However, these treatments can prompt later flowering/seeding as well.Clean seed and rhizomes from equipment and personnel working in infestations before leaving the infested site.Forage quality is low, eaten only when shoots are young and tender by horses, goats, sheep, mules, and some cattle.Recommended control proceduresThoroughly wet all leaves with one of the following herbicides in water with a surfactant when grass is actively growing and at least 1to 2 feet high or older growth from June to September: Chopper Gen2* as a 2-percent solution (8 ounces per 3-gallon mix) or Arsenal AC* as a 1-percent solution (4 ounces per 3-gallon mix).

Repeat applications in subsequent years may be required for eradication. A glyphosate herbicide may be tank mixed as a 2- to 5-percent solution with Chopper Gen2* at 2 percent (8 ounces per 3-gallon mix) or Arsenal AC* at 1 percent (4 ounces per 3-gallon mix). This treatment will accelerate burndown of actively growing shoots but may not improve rhizome kill.When safety to surrounding vegetation is desired (especially hardwoods, shrubs, and pines), apply a glyphosate herbicide as a 2- to 5-percent solution (8 to 20 ounces per 3-gallon mix). Two applications per growing season (just before flowering in spring and again in late summer to regrowth) are typically necessary. Apply in successive years when regrowth is present until no live rhizomes are observed for eradication; at the same time promote or establish desirable plants.* Nontarget plants may be killed or injured by root uptake.ImagesDownload the publication as PDFRetrieved from "http://wiki.bugwood.org/index.php?title=Archive:MGIPSF/Imperata_cylindrica&oldid=33883"

 Invasion: I.cylindricais a perennial grass which varies in height (30-150 cm). The culms (above-ground stems) are short, erect and arise from rhizomes (underground stems). The rhizomes are tough, white, commonly 1 m long but can be considerably more, are extensively branched and covered with papery scale leaves at the nodes. Roots are fibrous, emerging from the base of the culm and the nodes on the rhizome. Leaves are stiff, linear-lanceolate, up to 120 cm long and 4-18 mm wide, with a prominent, off-centre, whitish midrib, scabrid margin and pointed tip. The ligule is an inconspicuous membrane. The inflorescence is a white, spike-like panicle, terminal, fluffy, 5-20 cm long and up to 2.5 cm in diameter. Spikelets are numerous, 3.5-5.0 mm long, each surrounded by a basal ring of silky hairs 10 mm long. The grain is oblong, pointed, brown and 1-1.5 mm long.

 Reproduccion: Genetics Chromosome numbers vary according to the variety of I. cylindrica : 2n = 20 for var. major , 2n = 40 for var. europa and 2n = 60 for var. africana ( Santiago, 1980 ). Genetic variation has also been observed to occur within I. cylindrica . In a study by Cheng and Chou (1997) based on six populations of I. cylindrica collected from various habitats around Taiwan, a high level of genetic heterogeneity was found among populations of I. cylindrica . Genetic differences among the populations were correlated with morphological features. Among the populations studied, only those collected from mangrove areas possessed a hollow structure in the midrib of the leaf and villous trichomes on the abaxial leaf surface, features that are considered to be adaptive mechanisms to saline environments. Chou and Tsai (1999) also found that there is variation in IGS (intergenic spacer) length and sequence of rDNA among intra- and inter-specific populations of I. cylindrica based on PCR-amplified RFLP. I. cylindrica is also known to hybridize with other species, with Gabel (1982) providing evidence of hybridization between I. cylindrica and I. brasiliensis .

 variation in IGS (intergenic spacer) length and sequence of rDNA among intra- and inter-specific populations of I. cylindrica based on PCR-amplified RFLP. I. cylindrica is also known to hybridize with other species, with Gabel (1982) providing evidence of hybridization between I. cylindrica and I. brasiliensis . Intergeneric hybrids have been obtained with Saccharum ( Watson and Dallwitz, 1992 ). Reproductive Biology I. cylindrica is a prolific producer of seeds which are dispersed by wind over long distances to colonize cleared or previously un-infested land. It can produce as many as 3000 seeds per plant ( Holm et al., 1977 ), and 95% of I. cylindrica seeds can germinate within one week of being harvested but can also retain viability for at least one year ( Santiago, 1965 ). I. cylindrica is not capable of self-pollination ( Gabel, 1982 ) and produces viable seeds only through cross-pollination ( McDonald et al., 1996 ). Flowering is variable between individual plants and can occur in response to stress from slashing, grazing, burning, mowing, or the addition of nitrogen ( Holm et al., 1977 ; Willard, 1988 ). Physiology and Phenology Suspected allelopathic properties ( Eussen et al., 1976 ) and a vigorous growth habit have made I. cylindrica one of the most competitive weeds. The aggressive and invasive nature of I. cylindrica is largely attributed to its extensive rhizome system which is concentrated in the upper 20 cm of soil. The lateral buds can remain dormant for long periods and give I. cylindrica its perennating habit. The bud from a single rhizome node can give rise to 350 shoots in 6 weeks, which can cover up to 4 m² in 11 weeks ( Eussen, 1980 ). Other reports of I. cylindrica '

izome system which is concentrated in the upper 20 cm of soil. The lateral buds can remain dormant for long periods and give I. cylindrica its perennating habit. The bud from a single rhizome node can give rise to 350 shoots in 6 weeks, which can cover up to 4 m² in 11 weeks ( Eussen, 1980 ). Other reports of I. cylindrica 's productivity are that 2.73 m of rhizome can be produced in 109 days (Wilcutt et al., 1983) and that a 15 cm length of rhizome can produce 181 shoots per m² in 6.5 months (Lee, 1977). The regenerative capacity of I. cylindrica rhizomes is affected by their age ( Ayeni and Duke, 1985 ); older rhizomes regenerate better than those that are young and contain relatively few nutrients. There is a greater chance of sprouting in larger or longer rhizomes because of their higher nutrient status ( Soerjani and Soemarwoto, 1969 ; Ivens, 1975 ). Mature buds closest to the apex are the first to sprout when the rhizome is fragmented from the parent plant. Rhizomes which develop during the rainy season do not regenerate as well as those formed in the dry season. Bud germination of rhizomes is favoured by exposure to light ( Soerjani, 1970 ). Rhizome regeneration increases when oxygen is introduced into the rhizosphere (Wilcutt et al., 1983) but decreases with increased depth of burial ( Ivens, 1980 ). There is marked seasonal variation in the growth of I. cylindrica . During the dry season, the number of living shoots and the emergence of new shoots are relatively low compared with in the wet season. Any production of new shoots is balanced by the death of older shoots. Low shoot emergence is associated with low rainfall and soil moisture. During the dry season, the mass of dead shoots

During the dry season, the number of living shoots and the emergence of new shoots are relatively low compared with in the wet season. Any production of new shoots is balanced by the death of older shoots. Low shoot emergence is associated with low rainfall and soil moisture. During the dry season, the mass of dead shoots can exceed that of live shoots. It appears that I. cylindrica sacrifices its shoots in order to maintain healthy, nutrient-rich rhizomes. I. cylindrica assimilates carbon dioxide by the C4 photosynthetic pathway ( Paul and Elmore, 1984 ) giving it a competitive advantage over C3 plants (such as rice) in tropical conditions. However, in common with many C4 plants, I. cylindrica is relatively intolerant of shade. Light is inevitably important in the growth of I. cylindrica although contradictory results exist on the production of shoots versus rhizomes under a range of light intensities. In one investigation ( Eussen, 1981 ) it was shown that after 6 months’ growth, I. cylindrica had more rhizomes than shoots at all light intensities (20-100% intensity) but, in another ( Soerjani, 1970 ), I. cylindrica tended to have more shoots (11.5 t/ha) than rhizomes (7.0 t/ha). However, there is evidence that I. cylindrica produces more shoots than rhizomes under low light conditions. I. cylindrica is capable of capturing material flowing from higher areas in the landscape through erosion, hence, it is possible that it can cause the build-up of vesicular arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal inoculum. The spore density and species richness of VA fungi is found to be high in Imperata grasslands, except at the most degraded sites ( Hairiah

The spore density and species richness of VA fungi is found to be high in Imperata grasslands, except at the most degraded sites ( Hairiah et al., 2003 ). Associations There is extensive occurrence of endomycorrhizas on I. cylindrica collected from around Indonesia ( Tjitrosemito et al., 1994 ). The existence of a mycorrhizal relationship is usually associated with the host plant being able to utilize available phosphorus. This gives I. cylindrica an advantage over plants without mycorrhizas in situations where phosphate is limiting. In Nepal, grasslands dominated by I. cylindrica support a number of vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered species such as swamp deer ( Cervus duvauceli ) ( Ghimire, 1996 ), hispid hare ( Caprolagus hispidus ), pygmy hog ( Sus salvanis ) ( Oliver, 1985 ) and Bengal florican ( Eupodotis bengalensis ) ( Inskipp and Inskipp, 1983 ). I. cylindrica grasslands also support a dense population of chital ( Axis axis ) in Nepal. I. cylindrica constitutes the major portion of the diet of hog deer ( Axis porcinus ) which live in protected areas of sub-Himalayan West Bengal ( Bhowmik et al., 1999 ).

 Bengal ( Bhowmik et al., 1999 ). Environmental Requirements This weed is found at altitudes from sea level to 2700 m and rainfalls of 500-5000 mm/year ( Holm et al., 1977 ). Fire-based cultivation methods (slash and burn) have been known to transform forest areas to grasslands dominated by I. cylindrica . Aside from this practice, soil degradation resulting from cropping systems that do not supply enough organic inputs in the soil or provide a permanent cover on the soil (i.e. pastures that are routinely mowed, etc.) also allow for colonization by I. cylindrica ( Hairiah et al., 2003 ). I. cylindrica can dominate vast tracts of degraded land because of its ability to survive under conditions of low soil fertility. It is also able to thrive in different types of soil and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH conditions. Once established, it will continue to persist even when there is environmental stress such as drought, flooding or fire. Seedhead formation is induced by slashing, mowing, grazing, burning and the application of fertilizers ( Colvin et al., 1993 ). Burning also stimulates vegetative growth. Under conditions of high light intensity, high temperatures and limited moisture, the C4 pathway of I. cylindrica allows it to photosynthesize more efficiently and gives it a competitive edge over C3 species. Due to its requirement for sunlight, I. cylindrica survives poorly in closed-canopy forest or plantations where shading occurs. According to Moosavi-nia and Dore (1979) , increasing shade levels of >50% reduces shoot dry weight and both rhizome length and dry weight, causing an increase in the shoot/rhizome ratio. The ability of rhizomes to resprout after the above ground biomass has been removed reportedly declined when the mowed stand was subjected to 88% shade for more than 2 months ( Hairiah et al., 2003

The ability of rhizomes to resprout after the above ground biomass has been removed reportedly declined when the mowed stand was subjected to 88% shade for more than 2 months ( Hairiah et al., 2003 ). The light compensation point of I. cylindrica is 32 µmol/m²/s or 2% of ambient sunlight, and biomass reduction was observed when ambient light was 1% or 15 µmol/m²/s ( Gaffney, 1996 ). I. cylindrica grows poorly in heavily cultivated lands where it is kept in check mechanically ( Van Loan et al., 2002 ). It is also sensitive to excessive soil moisture during early seedling development, hence, excessive moisture could restrict invasion of I. cylindrica by seed. However, once established, the tolerance of I. cylindrica to flooding increases ( King and Grace, 2000 ). The spread of I. cylindrica in the USA has been limited to south-eastern parts and this is attributed to temperature. I. cylindrica survived the 1984 winter season in Alabama, USA, where the coldest air temperature recorded was -14°C; however, it did not survive the -28.9°C winter temperature in Texas in 1984 ( Wilcut et al., 1988 ). Cold temperatures may be a limiting factor to the spread of I. cylindrica beyond the south-eastern regions of the USA. However, a red-tipped ornamental cultivar of I. cylindrica , also known as Rubra, Japanese Bloodgrass or Red Baron, is very cold tolerant and has persisted for several years in an ornamental garden in Michigan, USA.

Shilling et al. (1997) expressed concern that its introduction and possible hybridization with I. cylindrica will result in hybrids that may exhibit both invasiveness and cold tolerance allowing range extension to northern and western regions of the USA. I. cylindrica thrives at altitudes from sea level to 2000 m in the Himalayas ( Holm et al., 1977 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics Chromosome numbers vary according to the variety of I. cylindrica : 2n = 20 for var. major , 2n = 40 for var. europa and 2n = 60 for var. africana ( Santiago, 1980 ). Genetic variation has also been observed to occur within I. cylindrica . In a study by Cheng and Chou (1997) based on six populations of I. cylindrica collected from various habitats around Taiwan, a high level of genetic heterogeneity was found among populations of I. cylindrica . Genetic differences among the populations were correlated with morphological features. Among the populations studied, only those collected from mangrove areas possessed a hollow structure in the midrib of the leaf and villous trichomes on the abaxial leaf surface, features that are considered to be adaptive mechanisms to saline environments. Chou and Tsai (1999) also found that there is variation in IGS (intergenic spacer) length and sequence of rDNA among intra- and inter-specific populations of I. cylindrica based on PCR-amplified RFLP.

Chou and Tsai (1999) also found that there is variation in IGS (intergenic spacer) length and sequence of rDNA among intra- and inter-specific populations of I. cylindrica based on PCR-amplified RFLP. I. cylindrica is also known to hybridize with other species, with Gabel (1982) providing evidence of hybridization between I. cylindrica and I. brasiliensis . Intergeneric hybrids have been obtained with Saccharum ( Watson and Dallwitz, 1992 ). Reproductive Biology I. cylindrica is a prolific producer of seeds which are dispersed by wind over long distances to colonize cleared or previously un-infested land. It can produce as many as 3000 seeds per plant ( Holm et al., 1977 ), and 95% of I. cylindrica seeds can germinate within one week of being harvested but can also retain viability for at least one year ( Santiago, 1965 ). I. cylindrica is not capable of self-pollination ( Gabel, 1982 ) and produces viable seeds only through cross-pollination ( McDonald et al., 1996 ). Flowering is variable between individual plants and can occur in response to stress from slashing, grazing, burning, mowing, or the addition of nitrogen ( Holm et al., 1977 ; Willard, 1988 ). Physiology and Phenology Suspected allelopathic properties ( Eussen et al., 1976 ) and a vigorous growth habit have made I. cylindrica one of the most competitive weeds. The aggressive and invasive nature of I. cylindrica is largely attributed to its extensive rhizome system which is concentrated in the upper 20 cm of soil.

 1976 ) and a vigorous growth habit have made I. cylindrica one of the most competitive weeds. The aggressive and invasive nature of I. cylindrica is largely attributed to its extensive rhizome system which is concentrated in the upper 20 cm of soil. The lateral buds can remain dormant for long periods and give I. cylindrica its perennating habit. The bud from a single rhizome node can give rise to 350 shoots in 6 weeks, which can cover up to 4 m² in 11 weeks ( Eussen, 1980 ). Other reports of I. cylindrica 's productivity are that 2.73 m of rhizome can be produced in 109 days (Wilcutt et al., 1983) and that a 15 cm length of rhizome can produce 181 shoots per m² in 6.5 months (Lee, 1977). The regenerative capacity of I. cylindrica rhizomes is affected by their age ( Ayeni and Duke, 1985 ); older rhizomes regenerate better than those that are young and contain relatively few nutrients. There is a greater chance of sprouting in larger or longer rhizomes because of their higher nutrient status ( Soerjani and Soemarwoto, 1969 ; Ivens, 1975 ). Mature buds closest to the apex are the first to sprout when the rhizome is fragmented from the parent plant. Rhizomes which develop during the rainy season do not regenerate as well as those formed in the dry season. Bud germination of rhizomes is favoured by exposure to light ( Soerjani, 1970 ). Rhizome regeneration increases when oxygen is introduced into the rhizosphere (Wilcutt et al., 1983) but decreases with increased depth of burial ( Ivens, 1980 ). There is marked seasonal variation in the growth of I. cylindrica . During the dry season, the number of living shoots and the emergence of new shoots are relatively low compared with in the

Tech. Rep. SRS–131. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 120 p.Cogongrass [Imperata cylindrica(L.) P. Beauv.] and the closely related native, Brazilian satintail (I. brasiliensisTrin.), are aggressive,
colony-forming dense erect perennial grasses 1 to 6 feet (30 to 180 cm) in height. Hybridization is probable and makes
differentiation difficult. Both have tufts of long leaves hiding short stems, yellow-green blades (each with an offcenter midvein
and finely saw-toothed margins), and silver-plumed flowers and seeds in spring (sporadically year-round). Seed are dispersed
by wind and on contaminated clothing, equipment, and products like pinestraw mulch and fill materials. Seed viability appears
at this time to be significantly less in northern Florida and southern Georgia and higher in southern Alabama and Mississippi.
Dense stands of dried plants remain standing during winter to present a severe fire hazard, while remaining green year-round
in central and southern Florida. These species burn hot even when green.Infestations form dense rhizome mats making eradication difficult, because abundant shoot and rhizome buds usually sprout
after treatment or lay dormant to sprout within months. Rhizomes are sharp tipped and can pierce roots of other plants. Older

 when green.Infestations form dense rhizome mats making eradication difficult, because abundant shoot and rhizome buds usually sprout
after treatment or lay dormant to sprout within months. Rhizomes are sharp tipped and can pierce roots of other plants. Older
infestations will be more difficult to control than new invasions that occur as circular patches.Both species are Federal and State noxious weeds, while red-tipped cultivars are still sold and planted in many Southern States.
These cultivars, bred for cold hardiness, have viable pollen that might spread to the invasive cogongrass plants. Red cultivars
can revert to the green aggressive type. Some Southern States prohibit the sale of the red cultivars. Visit www.cogongrass.org
and other State cogongrass Web sites for more details. Resemble Johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense(L.) Pers.]; purpletop
[Tridens flavus(L.) Hitchc.]; silver plumegrass [Saccharum alopecuroidum(L.) Nutt.]; and sugarcane plumegrass [S. giganteum(Walter) Pers.]—all having a stem, do not produce fluffy seed heads, and no sharp-tipped rhizomes jutting up from the soil
surface. Also resemble longleaf woodoats [Chasmanthium sessiliflorum(Poir.) Yates] that occurs in shaded colonies in forests
but lacks offcenter midveins and silky flowers having tufts of spiked flowers and seeds along a slender stalk.Management strategiesDo not plant the red-tipped cultivars (Japanese bloodgrass and Red Baron). Remove prior plantings, and control sprouts and seedlings.Treat when new plants are young and located through frequent surveillance of lands in infested zones.Minimize

but lacks offcenter midveins and silky flowers having tufts of spiked flowers and seeds along a slender stalk.Management strategiesDo not plant the red-tipped cultivars (Japanese bloodgrass and Red Baron). Remove prior plantings, and control sprouts and seedlings.Treat when new plants are young and located through frequent surveillance of lands in infested zones.Minimize disturbance within miles of where this plant occurs, and anticipate wider occupation when plants are present or adjacent before disturbance.Repeated cultivation and planting of aggressive grasses or herbicide resistant crops can restore pastures and croplands.Burning and bush-mowing treatments can remove standing plants for more efficient herbicide treatments. However, burning usually causes rapid infestation expansion and can kill native shrubs and trees that constrain spread.Do not use or transport fill dirt, rock, hay, or pinestraw from infested lands.Seed production can be stopped by mowing, burning, or herbicide treatments in early stages of flowering or even shortly before flowering. However, these treatments can prompt later flowering/seeding as well.Clean seed and rhizomes from equipment and personnel working in infestations before leaving the infested site.Forage quality is low, eaten only when shoots are young and tender by horses, goats, sheep, mules, and some cattle.Recommended control proceduresThoroughly wet all leaves with one of the following herbicides in water with a surfactant when grass is actively growing and at least 1to 2 feet high or older growth from June to September: Chopper Gen2* as a 2-percent solution (8 ounces per 3-gallon mix) or Arsenal AC* as a 1-percent solution (4 ounces per 3-gallon mix). Repeat applications in subsequent years may be required for eradication. A glyphosate herbicide may be tank mixed as a 2- to 5-percent solution with Chopper Gen2* at 2

 September: Chopper Gen2* as a 2-percent solution (8 ounces per 3-gallon mix) or Arsenal AC* as a 1-percent solution (4 ounces per 3-gallon mix). Repeat applications in subsequent years may be required for eradication. A glyphosate herbicide may be tank mixed as a 2- to 5-percent solution with Chopper Gen2* at 2 percent (8 ounces per 3-gallon mix) or Arsenal AC* at 1 percent (4 ounces per 3-gallon mix). This treatment will accelerate burndown of actively growing shoots but may not improve rhizome kill.When safety to surrounding vegetation is desired (especially hardwoods, shrubs, and pines), apply a glyphosate herbicide as a 2- to 5-percent solution (8 to 20 ounces per 3-gallon mix). Two applications per growing season (just before flowering in spring and again in late summer to regrowth) are typically necessary. Apply in successive years when regrowth is present until no live rhizomes are observed for eradication; at the same time promote or establish desirable plants.* Nontarget plants may be killed or injured by root uptake.ImagesDownload the publication as PDFRetrieved from "http://wiki.bugwood.org/index.php?title=Archive:MGIPSF/Imperata_cylindrica&oldid=33883"
