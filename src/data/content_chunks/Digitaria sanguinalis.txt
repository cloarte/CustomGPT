 Reproduccion: The chromosome number of D. sanguinalis is 2 n = 36 ( Gould, 1963 ). Digitaria sanguinalis is self-compatible and able to reproduce both by self- and cross-pollination ( Cruden, 1977 ; Mas and Verdú, 2018 ). The anthers and stigmas are simultaneously exserted from the tip of the florets and dehiscence occurs just prior to or alongside with exsertion ( Cruden, 1977 ). A large plant can produce 150,000 'seeds' (caryopses), which are dormant when shed ( Mitich, 1988 ). Seed dormancy is caused by the caryopsis covering structures and the caryopsis coat. Removing the lemmas increased germination by 62.2% and dehulling the caryopses using emery paper resulted in 95% germination ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Chemical scarification with sulphuric acid or potassium hydroxide did not significantly increase the germination of intact spikelets. In contrast, soaking spikelets in water for 4 days increased germination by 20% ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Maximum germination occurs in the first year, but seeds can remain viable for up

 resulted in 95% germination ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Chemical scarification with sulphuric acid or potassium hydroxide did not significantly increase the germination of intact spikelets. In contrast, soaking spikelets in water for 4 days increased germination by 20% ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Maximum germination occurs in the first year, but seeds can remain viable for up to 3 years. Seed viability declines rapidly after 3 years ( Masin et al., 2006 ). Digitaria sanguinalis is a C4 annual, late spring-and summer-germinating plant. Seed germination is not light-sensitive, but is favoured by alternating temperatures. The minimum temperature for germination is 10°-15°C and the normal germination depth in the field is 0.5-2 cm ( Laudien and Koch, 1972 ). Emergence does not occur from depths greater than 6 cm, at which a depth-imposed dormancy is induced ( Benvenuti et al., 2001 ). In the laboratory, suitable temperature, soil moisture and seed depth for emergence for this species were 25°-35°C, 80-100% and 0-2 cm, respectively ( Li et al., 1999 ). Tillering in D. sanguinalis initiates after emergence of the fourth leaf. A large plant can produce up to 700 tillers ( Mitich, 1988 ). Mature plants can cover extensive areas developing a 'mulch' or 'tuft' 40-60 cm deep ( Kissman and Groth, 1993 ). King and Oliver (1994) evaluated the influence of temperature and water potential on water uptake, germination and emergence of D. sanguinalis in order to predict emergence in the field. Maximum germination at 15°C was 12% at 0 kPa and 60% at 25°C at 0 to -200 kPa osmotic potential. Maximum emergence (77%) occurred at 25°C and

 Oliver (1994) evaluated the influence of temperature and water potential on water uptake, germination and emergence of D. sanguinalis in order to predict emergence in the field. Maximum germination at 15°C was 12% at 0 kPa and 60% at 25°C at 0 to -200 kPa osmotic potential. Maximum emergence (77%) occurred at 25°C and at soil water potential of -30 kPa. The model predicted the time of onset of germination and the time to reach maximum emergence. A test of the water balance showed that water loss through cuticular transpiration was greatest in D. sanguinalis compared with four broad-leaved weeds, although the length of time drought-stressed leaves that were able to survive was greater in D. sanguinalis than Papaver rhoeas , Matricaria perforata and Alopecurus myosuroides ( Kazinczi and Hunyadi, 1992 ). The water potential of rice was nearly always significantly lower than D. sanguinalis among other weed species ( IRRI, 1979 ). In a 13-year survey in Toulouse (France) crop rotation, irrigation and soil type all had marked effects on the quantitative and qualitative composition of the soil seedbank. Echinochloa crus-galli and D. sanguinalis predominated where continuous maize and sorghum had been grown under irrigated conditions ( Debaeke et al., 1990 ). In the Argentinian Pampa, D. sanguinalis is one of the more frequent Poaceae in the soil. The average seed population is 2900 seeds/m² in a wheat-soya bean-maize rotation (Leguizamón et al., 1981) and 3900 seeds/m² under a continuous maize crop ( Leguizamón and Cruz, 1981 ).

In a long-term study where tillage systems were compared in different rotations, Puricelli and Tuesca (1997) found that the population density of D. sanguinalis was greater in no-tillage than in conventional tilled plots. In a soyabean-maize rotation, D. sanguinalis was the dominant summer annual showing an increase in density during the course of the experiment in no-tillage plots. Nisensohn et al. (1997) studied the effect of different tillage systems on the soil seed bank composition and weed seedling emergence in a soyabean-maize rotation. D. sanguinalis was the dominant species in both tillage systems and was significantly denser in no-tillage systems. Similar results were reported by Zanin et al. (1997) . Correlations between seed bank and seedling densities of D. sanguinalis were significant in no-tillage but not in mouldboard plough systems ( Cardina et al., 1996 ). Digitaria sanguinalis is a summer annual grass ( Gallart et al., 2008 ; 2010). Digitaria sanguinalis is distributed worldwide mostly in the cooler latitudes and is less frequent in warm regions ( Gould, 1979 ). It is adapted to many soil types, but grows best on well-drained soils, especially sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam soils ( Blount et al., 2003 ). It needs sunny places and is extremely drought tolerant, growing in areas with less than 100 mm average rainfall ( Chaudhary et al., 1981 ).

It needs sunny places and is extremely drought tolerant, growing in areas with less than 100 mm average rainfall ( Chaudhary et al., 1981 ). It is found on sands and wet loams in warmer places ( Behrendt and Hanf, 1979 ).

Leaves are flat, measuring 0.75-6 inches long and up to 0.5 inches wide, with a prominent mid-rib and pubescent on both sides. Crabgrass have membranous ligules that are truncated and have a jagged appearance. The sheath (area where the leaf and stem join) is covered with straight, long hairs. The stem is rather stout, may exhibit a decumbent (reclining) growth pattern, and additional roots may form at the soil/node region. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of branches with spikelets arranged in two rows of a flattened rachis. Large crabgrass may grow up to 3 1/2 feet in height.HabitatsThe preference is full or partial sun, moist to slightly dry conditions, and a heavy clay-loam soil. Habitats include disturbed areas of prairies, weedy meadows, edges of degraded wetlands, areas along roads and railroads, lawns and gardens, vacant lots, fields, grassy paths, and highly disturbed areas.ImpactsCrabgrass can present significant challenges to corn growers if not managed properly.

 to corn growers if not managed properly. Crabgrass is also a problem in other cultivated crops.Biology and EcologyCrabgrass reproduces by seeds. When the soil temperature reaches 55-60 degrees F, crabgrass begins to germinate. However, the soil temperature must be in this range for a minimum of one week. Seeds germinate best from early spring to late summer. Crabgrass continues to grow until midsummer when days become shorter, and vegetative growth slows as plants enter their reproductive stage. Purplish seed heads form until frost kills the plants. Plants that emerge early in the season and have a long period of vegetative growth are much larger and more competitive than plants that germinate late in the season. Crabgrass has a prolific tillering or branching habit. A single plant is capable of producing 150 to 700 tillers and 150,000 seeds. Crabgrass seeds are dormant for a short period of time after they shed from plants.  Most growth occurs during the hot weather of summer because of its C4 metabolism.Management ApproachesCrabgrass cannot be controlled in one growing season because of the large number of viable seeds that accumulate in the soil from years of infestation. Controlling seed production for several years will help reduce the viable seed supply.Biological ControlThere are no biological control agents available for crabgrass.Mechanical and Cultural ControlCrabgrass plants are very adaptive to mowing height. Plants can produce seeds at mowing heights as low as 1/2-inch.Chemical ControlThere is been one reported case of crabgrass resistance to ACC ase inhibitors in Wisconsin.

 Reproduccion: The chromosome number of D. sanguinalis is 2 n = 36 ( Gould, 1963 ). Digitaria sanguinalis is self-compatible and able to reproduce both by self- and cross-pollination ( Cruden, 1977 ; Mas and Verdú, 2018 ). The anthers and stigmas are simultaneously exserted from the tip of the florets and dehiscence occurs just prior to or alongside with exsertion ( Cruden, 1977 ). A large plant can produce 150,000 'seeds' (caryopses), which are dormant when shed ( Mitich, 1988 ). Seed dormancy is caused by the caryopsis covering structures and the caryopsis coat. Removing the lemmas increased germination by 62.2% and dehulling the caryopses using emery paper resulted in 95% germination ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Chemical scarification with sulphuric acid or potassium hydroxide did not significantly increase the germination of intact spikelets. In contrast, soaking spikelets in water for 4 days increased germination by 20% ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Maximum germination occurs in the first year, but seeds can remain viable for up

 resulted in 95% germination ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Chemical scarification with sulphuric acid or potassium hydroxide did not significantly increase the germination of intact spikelets. In contrast, soaking spikelets in water for 4 days increased germination by 20% ( Gallart et al., 2008 ). Maximum germination occurs in the first year, but seeds can remain viable for up to 3 years. Seed viability declines rapidly after 3 years ( Masin et al., 2006 ). Digitaria sanguinalis is a C4 annual, late spring-and summer-germinating plant. Seed germination is not light-sensitive, but is favoured by alternating temperatures. The minimum temperature for germination is 10°-15°C and the normal germination depth in the field is 0.5-2 cm ( Laudien and Koch, 1972 ). Emergence does not occur from depths greater than 6 cm, at which a depth-imposed dormancy is induced ( Benvenuti et al., 2001 ). In the laboratory, suitable temperature, soil moisture and seed depth for emergence for this species were 25°-35°C, 80-100% and 0-2 cm, respectively ( Li et al., 1999 ). Tillering in D. sanguinalis initiates after emergence of the fourth leaf. A large plant can produce up to 700 tillers ( Mitich, 1988 ). Mature plants can cover extensive areas developing a 'mulch' or 'tuft' 40-60 cm deep ( Kissman and Groth, 1993 ). King and Oliver (1994) evaluated the influence of temperature and water potential on water uptake, germination and emergence of D. sanguinalis in order to predict emergence in the field. Maximum germination at 15°C was 12% at 0 kPa and 60% at 25°C at 0 to -200 kPa osmotic potential. Maximum emergence (77%) occurred at 25°C and

 Oliver (1994) evaluated the influence of temperature and water potential on water uptake, germination and emergence of D. sanguinalis in order to predict emergence in the field. Maximum germination at 15°C was 12% at 0 kPa and 60% at 25°C at 0 to -200 kPa osmotic potential. Maximum emergence (77%) occurred at 25°C and at soil water potential of -30 kPa. The model predicted the time of onset of germination and the time to reach maximum emergence. A test of the water balance showed that water loss through cuticular transpiration was greatest in D. sanguinalis compared with four broad-leaved weeds, although the length of time drought-stressed leaves that were able to survive was greater in D. sanguinalis than Papaver rhoeas , Matricaria perforata and Alopecurus myosuroides ( Kazinczi and Hunyadi, 1992 ). The water potential of rice was nearly always significantly lower than D. sanguinalis among other weed species ( IRRI, 1979 ). In a 13-year survey in Toulouse (France) crop rotation, irrigation and soil type all had marked effects on the quantitative and qualitative composition of the soil seedbank. Echinochloa crus-galli and D. sanguinalis predominated where continuous maize and sorghum had been grown under irrigated conditions ( Debaeke et al., 1990 ). In the Argentinian Pampa, D. sanguinalis is one of the more frequent Poaceae in the soil. The average seed population is 2900 seeds/m² in a wheat-soya bean-maize rotation (Leguizamón et al., 1981) and 3900 seeds/m² under a continuous maize crop ( Leguizamón and Cruz, 1981 ).

In a long-term study where tillage systems were compared in different rotations, Puricelli and Tuesca (1997) found that the population density of D. sanguinalis was greater in no-tillage than in conventional tilled plots. In a soyabean-maize rotation, D. sanguinalis was the dominant summer annual showing an increase in density during the course of the experiment in no-tillage plots. Nisensohn et al. (1997) studied the effect of different tillage systems on the soil seed bank composition and weed seedling emergence in a soyabean-maize rotation. D. sanguinalis was the dominant species in both tillage systems and was significantly denser in no-tillage systems. Similar results were reported by Zanin et al. (1997) . Correlations between seed bank and seedling densities of D. sanguinalis were significant in no-tillage but not in mouldboard plough systems ( Cardina et al., 1996 ). Digitaria sanguinalis is a summer annual grass ( Gallart et al., 2008 ; 2010). Digitaria sanguinalis is distributed worldwide mostly in the cooler latitudes and is less frequent in warm regions ( Gould, 1979 ). It is adapted to many soil types, but grows best on well-drained soils, especially sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam soils ( Blount et al., 2003 ). It needs sunny places and is extremely drought tolerant, growing in areas with less than 100 mm average rainfall ( Chaudhary et al., 1981 ).

The average seed population is 2900 seeds/m² in a wheat-soya bean-maize rotation (Leguizamón et al., 1981) and 3900 seeds/m² under a continuous maize crop ( Leguizamón and Cruz, 1981 ).

, D. sanguinalis is one of the more frequent Poaceae in the soil. The average seed population is 2900 seeds/m² in a wheat-soya bean-maize rotation (Leguizamón et al., 1981) and 3900 seeds/m² under a continuous maize crop ( Leguizamón and Cruz, 1981 ). In a long-term study where tillage systems were compared in different rotations, Puricelli and Tuesca (1997) found that the population density of D. sanguinalis was greater in no-tillage than in conventional tilled plots. In a soyabean-maize rotation, D. sanguinalis was the dominant summer annual showing an increase in density during the course of the experiment in no-tillage plots. Nisensohn et al. (1997) studied the effect of different tillage systems on the soil seed bank composition and weed seedling emergence in a soyabean-maize rotation. D. sanguinalis was the dominant species in both tillage systems and was significantly denser in no-tillage systems. Similar results were reported by Zanin et al. (1997) . Correlations between seed bank and seedling densities of D. sanguinalis were significant in no-tillage but not in mouldboard plough systems ( Cardina et al., 1996 ). Longevity Digitaria sanguinalis is a summer annual grass ( Gallart et al., 2008 ; 2010). Environmental Requirements Digitaria sanguinalis is distributed worldwide mostly in the cooler latitudes and is less frequent in warm regions ( Gould, 1979 ). It is adapted to many soil types, but grows best on well-drained soils, especially sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam soils ( Blount et al., 2003 ).

Leaves are flat, measuring 0.75-6 inches long and up to 0.5 inches wide, with a prominent mid-rib and pubescent on both sides. Crabgrass have membranous ligules that are truncated and have a jagged appearance. The sheath (area where the leaf and stem join) is covered with straight, long hairs. The stem is rather stout, may exhibit a decumbent (reclining) growth pattern, and additional roots may form at the soil/node region. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of branches with spikelets arranged in two rows of a flattened rachis. Large crabgrass may grow up to 3 1/2 feet in height.HabitatsThe preference is full or partial sun, moist to slightly dry conditions, and a heavy clay-loam soil. Habitats include disturbed areas of prairies, weedy meadows, edges of degraded wetlands, areas along roads and railroads, lawns and gardens, vacant lots, fields, grassy paths, and highly disturbed areas.ImpactsCrabgrass can present significant challenges to corn growers if not managed properly. Crabgrass is also a problem in other cultivated crops.Biology and EcologyCrabgrass reproduces by seeds. When the soil temperature reaches 55-60 degrees F, crabgrass begins to germinate.

 to corn growers if not managed properly. Crabgrass is also a problem in other cultivated crops.Biology and EcologyCrabgrass reproduces by seeds. When the soil temperature reaches 55-60 degrees F, crabgrass begins to germinate. However, the soil temperature must be in this range for a minimum of one week. Seeds germinate best from early spring to late summer. Crabgrass continues to grow until midsummer when days become shorter, and vegetative growth slows as plants enter their reproductive stage. Purplish seed heads form until frost kills the plants. Plants that emerge early in the season and have a long period of vegetative growth are much larger and more competitive than plants that germinate late in the season. Crabgrass has a prolific tillering or branching habit. A single plant is capable of producing 150 to 700 tillers and 150,000 seeds. Crabgrass seeds are dormant for a short period of time after they shed from plants.  Most growth occurs during the hot weather of summer because of its C4 metabolism.Management ApproachesCrabgrass cannot be controlled in one growing season because of the large number of viable seeds that accumulate in the soil from years of infestation. Controlling seed production for several years will help reduce the viable seed supply.Biological ControlThere are no biological control agents available for crabgrass.Mechanical and Cultural ControlCrabgrass plants are very adaptive to mowing height. Plants can produce seeds at mowing heights as low as 1/2-inch.Chemical ControlThere is been one reported case of crabgrass resistance to ACC ase inhibitors in Wisconsin.
