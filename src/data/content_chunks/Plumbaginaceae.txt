PlumbaginaceaeA. L. Jussieu白花丹科 bai hua dan keAuthors:Tse-Hsiang Peng&Rudolf V. KamelinShrublets, shrubs, or herbs. Stems striate or reduced to a caudex. Leaves simple, alternate or basal, sessile or petiolate but petiole usually indistinct from blade; stipules absent; leaf blade entire or rarely pinnately lobed, with chalk glands on both surfaces. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, unbranched or branched, spicate, spicate-racemose, subcapitate, capitate, or paniculate, arranged into complanate spikes if branched, all composed of 1--10 or more cymules or helicoid cymes; cymules or helicoid cymes usually known as spikelets, 1--5-flowered; bracts 1 at base of each spikelet; bractlets 1 or 2 at base of each flower. Flowers bisexual, actinomorphic, sessile or very shortly pedicellate. Calyx persistent, hypogynous, tubular to funnelform, 5-ribbed, 5-lobed. Corolla hypogynous, petals connate but sometimes only at base, lobes or segments 5 and twisted. Stamens opposite corolla lobes, hypogynous or inserted at corolla base; anthers 2-locular, dehiscing longitudinally. Pistil 1. Ovary superior, 1-locular. Styles 5, free or connate. Stigmas 5. Ovule 1, pendulous from a basal funicle. Capsules usually enclosed within calyx. Seeds 1 per capsule; embryo straight, surrounded by thin starchy endosperm.About 25 genera and 440 species: worldwide, main diversity in C
