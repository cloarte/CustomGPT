 Reproduccion: The literature on the biology and ecology of Pityokteines curvidens is very rich, the most important papers being those by Kraemer (1950) , Chararas (1958; 1962), Kailidis and Georgevits (1971) , Vasechko (1971) and Harring (1978) .
 Sintomas: The beginning of an attack on a tree by P. curvidens is recognisable on the bark by the emission of frass from the entrance holes of the reproductive galleries, sometimes without other clear symptoms of stress to the tree. The diameter of the entrance holes is about 1.5 mm. The change of the normal canopy colour to light-yellow at first and then red usually takes about two months (see pictures).

chko (1971) and Harring (1978) . Physiology and phenology P. curvidens normally overwinters in the adult stage under the bark of dead trees colonised during the reproductive phase. However, it can also survive the winter under the bark healthy firs, somewhat damaging the infested trees ( Braun, 1941b ). It frequently overwinters in the larval or pupal stages; in fact it is possible to find parent beetles, differently aged larvae, as well as pupae and newly emerged adults under the bark at the same time. The pupal stage is the most vulnerable to low temperatures. According to Chararas (1962) , when the average temperature is under 16°C in September, only larvae overwinter. Adults leave the winter sites and start their reproductive phase from the second half of April or somewhat later according to the climatic conditions, altitude and exposure of the stands ( Cecconi, 1924 ; Chararas, 1962 ). P. curvidens passes through two or three generations per year under the most favourable conditions in Mediterranean fir stands, whereas it usually has only one generation in Central Europe ( Chararas, 1962 ). When there are two generations, the second one starts in August. Reproductive biology P. curvidens is a polygamous species like all others in the genus. After finding suitable trees to colonise, the pioneer males start boring their galleries under the bark, where they feed on living tissues. After 24 to 36 hours of feeding, they begin to release the aggregation pheromone via their frass; the main component is S-ipsenolo ((S)-2-methyl-6-methylene-7-octen-4-ol). Only males release this pheromone, which repels the other two congeneric species, P. spinidens and P. vorontzovi ( Harring et al., 1975 ; Harring and Mori, 1977 ; Harring

; the main component is S-ipsenolo ((S)-2-methyl-6-methylene-7-octen-4-ol). Only males release this pheromone, which repels the other two congeneric species, P. spinidens and P. vorontzovi ( Harring et al., 1975 ; Harring and Mori, 1977 ; Harring, 1978 ). Thus they rarely colonise the same tree. A P. curvidens &apos;family&apos; usually consists of one male plus two, three or rarely four females. The gallery system usually lacks a distinct nuptial chamber hollowed in the alburnum (see Pictures), unlike that of the other congeneric Palaearctic species (see Pictures). The entrance hole is followed by a longitudinal chamber 1-2 cm long; from its end, the females start digging their transverse tunnels, 3-8 cm long, slightly hollowing the alburnum. When there is only one male and two females, the gallery system scheme is the classic double horizontal brace (see Pictures); however, depending on the number of females, it can sometimes be asymmetrically incomplete or more intricate. Each female can lay 25-150 eggs in niches hollowed with their mandibles on both sides of the maternal gallery. After the first egg-laying and after feeding again, the females can dig another short tunnel and lay other eggs, starting a new, delayed generation ( Chararas, 1962 ; Pennacchio et al., 2002b ). Embryonic development can last six days on trees in sunny stands up to 800 m altitude, but can extend to 17 days at higher altitude or on shaded firs. The larvae start feeding and digging galleries, 5-8 cm long, orthogonal to the maternal ones (see Pictures); their development can last from 30 to 50 days depending on the same environmental factors.

The larvae start feeding and digging galleries, 5-8 cm long, orthogonal to the maternal ones (see Pictures); their development can last from 30 to 50 days depending on the same environmental factors. When mature, the larvae bore into the alburnum, reaching a depth of 1-8 mm, where they dig the pupal cell (6 x 2 mm). There they change into pupae and 10-18 days later into adults (see Pictures). The adults emerge from the tree bark after feeding on phloem tissues for 17-39 days (the maturation phase) during which they attain their definitive dark brown colour ( Chararas, 1962 ). Environmental requirements: in native fir stands, P. curvidens usually colonises uprooted, split, otherwise damaged or very old trees, whereas in artificial stands, it can be favoured by strong attacks by defoliators ( Schimitschek, 1936 ; Hesko, 1966 ), by a lack of culture management practices or by infections of roots by rot (e.g. Armillaria) due to either waterlogging or a prolonged dry spells. The latter is more frequent in the southern areas of the geographical range of Abies alba, i.e., along the Apennines in Italy. P. curvidens can also be favoured by branchwood from forest utilization when the diameter of branches is more than 15 cm. P. curvidens prefers well exposed edge trees, more rarely colonizing shaded ones. Colonization of a new host plant starts from the tip and then reaches the base. Even very old trees with thick bark can be attacked. P. curvidens is often associated with other scolytid species, i.e., Cryphalus piceae, Trypodendron lineatum, Pityoph

On the same trees, we also usually find the weevil Pissodes piceae and the cerambycids Rhagium inquisitor, Corymbia rubra and Anastrangalia dubia. Other organisms, such as nematodes, have a phoresic interrelationship with P. curvidens, e.g., Bursaphelenchus abietinu, B. hofmanni, B. nuesslini (Nematoda: Aphelenchoididae) (they have no phytosanitary importance in their native areas), Fucsia sp.
