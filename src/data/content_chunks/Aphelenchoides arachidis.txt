 Reproduccion: A. arachidis is a facultative endoparasite of the seed testa, pod shell, roots and hypocotyl of groundnuts. It also feeds ectoparasitically on roots and on fungi. Nematodes are found in the parenchymatous tissues of the groundnut testa, root cortex and hypocotyl, but not in the central stele or vascular bundles. The nematodes are not found in the cotyledons or embryos of the seeds. In the hypocotyl they occur intercellularly. In testas, nematodes are found mainly in the sub-epidermal parenchymatous layer where walls are broken and cells enlarged, and around the tracheids. Development of A. arachidis occurs within the pod shells, testas, hypocotyl and roots. All stages of the nematode are found in testas of young seeds, but at the end of the growing season and in mature seeds, heavily infested testas mainly contain the juvenile stages with few adults.Invasion of developing pods occurs 10 days after the groundnut fruiting pegs have penetrated the soil. Few nematodes are found in pods until 30 days after pod development, but thereafter nematode numbers increase rapidly in infested pods, with most found at about 60 days ( Bos, 1977b ; Bridge et al., 1977 ; Bridge and Hunt, 1985).

 pods, with most found at about 60 days ( Bos, 1977b ; Bridge et al., 1977 ; Bridge and Hunt, 1985).
 Sintomas: In groundnut seeds, A. arachidis is found only in the tissues of the testa, mainly in the sub-epidermal parenchymatous layer, and around the tracheids. These seed coats become discoloured when large numbers of nematodes (>2000/testa) are present. Heavily infested seeds, immediately after removal from fresh, mature pods, have translucent testas, are a lighter brown and have darker vascular strands within the testas. However, after the seeds have dried, testas infested with nematodes are often wrinkled and a darker brown than normal seeds. Testas infested with A. arachidis are thicker and more uneven than normal testas. The epidermal layer is reduced in infested testas and the basal tissues including the aleurone layer are disorganized. When dried there appears to be abnormal moisture loss and the seeds become shrivelled ( Bridge et al., 1977 ).Many A. arachidis are also found in pod shells of groundnuts without any obvious symptoms.
