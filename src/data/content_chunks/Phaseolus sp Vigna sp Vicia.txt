Beans of several genera and species, and numerous varieties, are important foodcrops and are of some importance as feed crops in many countries. All areannuals, grown from seeds. The fruits are pods in which the seeds arecontained. In green or snap beans, also termed 'string', pods are harvestedbefore ripening, and both pods and the immature seeds are consumed, mainly aspot vegetables. In some kinds, the seeds when near full grown, but while stillimmature, are threshed from the pods and frozen or canned. In dry or fieldbeans pods and seeds are allowed to ripen, then threshed and seeds only areconsumed. Plants may be "bush," non-climbing and reaching a height of 15 to 30inches; or "vine" or "pole," vining types reaching 10 or more feet in length.
