 Reproduccion: Gossypium barbadense is a tetraploid 2 n = 4 x = 52 ( OECD, 2010 ). Gossypium barbadense is propagated through seed. Insects can cause considerable outcrossing, but self-pollination is the dominant mating system. Most pollination occurs during dawn, because that is when the flowers open. After pollination, the flowers turn pink and then red the next day. On the second day, they start withering and die on the third day ( PIER, 2012 ). Depending on cultivar and climate, the growth period ranges from 160 to 220 days. Normally, the crop stands on the field for 6 months. In the wild, it usually takes longer than 1 year to reach reproductive maturity ( PIER, 2012 ). The hypocotyl appears above the ground 4-10 days after sowing. Cotton remains unbranched until at least 1 month after planting. Branching is dimorphic. The main-stem apex initiates main-stem leaves and lateral buds in the axils of these leaves. Normally, only one bud develops. At lower nodes, the true axillary bud remains vegetative and may develop into a vegetative branch (monopodium), replicating the main stem and carried at an acute angle. After floral induction, the extra-axillary buds at subsequent main-stem nodes are reproductive and develop into horizontal fruiting branches (sympodia). In G. barbadense , the first fruiting branch appears at node 10-12 of the main stem. A sympodial apex initiates one true leaf and then transforms into a flower primordium. The axillary bud between the flower bud and the leaf continues growth of the branch, producing a further segment, which in turn also terminates with a flower bud and a leaf which has an axillary bud. The development of successive axillary buds along a branch may be repeated,

 the main stem. A sympodial apex initiates one true leaf and then transforms into a flower primordium. The axillary bud between the flower bud and the leaf continues growth of the branch, producing a further segment, which in turn also terminates with a flower bud and a leaf which has an axillary bud. The development of successive axillary buds along a branch may be repeated, leading to a typical zigzag structure. After 50-65 days, the first visible flower buds appear as small, green, pyramidal structures, known as ‘squares’, whilst developing fruit are termed ‘bolls’. The main stem does not carry flowers. Flowering starts about 8 weeks after planting, and normally continues for 6 weeks or more; but under optimum conditions, the bulk of the crop is derived from the first 3-4 weeks of flowering. The time taken from flowering to the opening of the boll is about 8 weeks. Fibres reach their full, genetically determined length during the first 4 weeks, and then cellulose is deposited inside the fibre cell during the next 4 weeks until maturity. In general, the crop cycle is 120-220 days with seedlings emerging 5-15, or as much as 30, days after sowing, and the first true leaf unfolding 7-9 days later. All these processes vary with temperature. Upon germination, seedlings send a long tap root and the plant remains unbranched for about 1 month. Fruiting branches develop as primary branches on the main stem. Secondary branches develop on vegetative branches ( PIER, 2012 ). Gossypium barbadense needs full sun, high humidity and high rainfall. It requires a temperature of (15-)22-32(-38)°C. The optimum temperature for germination is 34°C, for the growth of seedlings 24-29°C, and for later continuous growth 34°C. It is very sensitive to

The optimum temperature for germination is 34°C, for the growth of seedlings 24-29°C, and for later continuous growth 34°C. It is very sensitive to frost. Low temperatures increase the production of vegetative branches and extends the cropping period while high temperatures increase the number of fruiting branches and reduces the cropping period. Cotton is susceptible to frost. High temperature increases the number of fruiting branches and reduces the cropping period. Cotton is a sun-loving plant and cannot tolerate shade, particularly in the seedling stage. Reduced light intensity, due to prolonged overcast weather, shading from interplanted crops or too dense a stand of cotton, retards flowering and fruiting and increases boll shedding. Shedding of over 50% of squares, flowers or young bolls, due to early bollworm, drought or waterlogging, is normal. Upland cottons are day-neutral. Gossypium barbadense requires rainfall of (500-)750-1250(-1500) mm during the growing season. The crop will not tolerate very heavy rainfall and, where grown as a rain-fed crop, the average rainfall is usually 800-1200 mm. Modern cotton cultivars have some ability to overcome drought, and recover from a dry spell to resume growth and fruiting. Adequate, but not excessive, moisture is required for early vegetative growth. The first flowering period requires relative dryness to speed up formation of fruiting branches. An increase in moisture is required for boll setting and renewed growth, followed by dry weather for ripening and harvest.

Sufficient soil moisture is essential during the flowering period ( PIER, 2012 ). It can be grown on a variety of soils from light sandy soils to heavy alluvium and rendzina-type clays. Soils must be permeable to water and to roots to a depth of at least 100 cm, preferably over 150 cm, with pH 5.5-8.5. Cotton is one of the more salt-tolerant crops.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics Gossypium barbadense is a tetraploid 2 n = 4 x = 52 ( OECD, 2010 ). Reproductive Biology Gossypium barbadense is propagated through seed. Insects can cause considerable outcrossing, but self-pollination is the dominant mating system. Most pollination occurs during dawn, because that is when the flowers open. After pollination, the flowers turn pink and then red the next day. On the second day, they start withering and die on the third day ( PIER, 2012 ). Physiology and Phenology Depending on cultivar and climate, the growth period ranges from 160 to 220 days. Normally, the crop stands on the field for 6 months. In the wild, it usually takes longer than 1 year to reach reproductive maturity ( PIER, 2012 ). The hypocotyl appears above the ground 4-10 days after sowing. Cotton remains unbranched until at least 1 month after planting. Branching is dimorphic. The main-stem apex initiates main-stem leaves and lateral buds in the axils of these leaves

. In the wild, it usually takes longer than 1 year to reach reproductive maturity ( PIER, 2012 ). The hypocotyl appears above the ground 4-10 days after sowing. Cotton remains unbranched until at least 1 month after planting. Branching is dimorphic. The main-stem apex initiates main-stem leaves and lateral buds in the axils of these leaves. Normally, only one bud develops. At lower nodes, the true axillary bud remains vegetative and may develop into a vegetative branch (monopodium), replicating the main stem and carried at an acute angle. After floral induction, the extra-axillary buds at subsequent main-stem nodes are reproductive and develop into horizontal fruiting branches (sympodia). In G. barbadense , the first fruiting branch appears at node 10-12 of the main stem. A sympodial apex initiates one true leaf and then transforms into a flower primordium. The axillary bud between the flower bud and the leaf continues growth of the branch, producing a further segment, which in turn also terminates with a flower bud and a leaf which has an axillary bud. The development of successive axillary buds along a branch may be repeated, leading to a typical zigzag structure. After 50-65 days, the first visible flower buds appear as small, green, pyramidal structures, known as ‘squares’, whilst developing fruit are termed ‘bolls’. The main stem does not carry flowers. Flowering starts about 8 weeks after planting, and normally continues for 6 weeks or more; but under optimum conditions, the bulk of the crop is derived from the first 3-4 weeks of flowering. The time taken from flowering to the opening of the boll is about 8 weeks. Fibres reach their full, genetically determined length during the first 4 weeks, and then cellulose is deposited inside the fibre cell during the next

 weeks after planting, and normally continues for 6 weeks or more; but under optimum conditions, the bulk of the crop is derived from the first 3-4 weeks of flowering. The time taken from flowering to the opening of the boll is about 8 weeks. Fibres reach their full, genetically determined length during the first 4 weeks, and then cellulose is deposited inside the fibre cell during the next 4 weeks until maturity. Activity Patterns In general, the crop cycle is 120-220 days with seedlings emerging 5-15, or as much as 30, days after sowing, and the first true leaf unfolding 7-9 days later. All these processes vary with temperature. Upon germination, seedlings send a long tap root and the plant remains unbranched for about 1 month. Fruiting branches develop as primary branches on the main stem. Secondary branches develop on vegetative branches ( PIER, 2012 ). Environmental Requirements Gossypium barbadense needs full sun, high humidity and high rainfall. It requires a temperature of (15-)22-32(-38)°C. The optimum temperature for germination is 34°C, for the growth of seedlings 24-29°C, and for later continuous growth 34°C. It is very sensitive to frost. Low temperatures increase the production of vegetative branches and extends the cropping period while high temperatures increase the number of fruiting branches and reduces the cropping period. Cotton is susceptible to frost. High temperature increases the number of fruiting branches and reduces the cropping period. Cotton is a sun-loving plant and cannot tolerate shade, particularly in the seedling stage. Reduced light intensity, due to prolonged overcast weather, shading from interplanted crops or too dense a stand of cotton, retards flowering and fruiting and increases boll shedding. Shedding of over 50% of squares, flowers or young bolls, due to early bollworm, drought or waterlogging, is

loving plant and cannot tolerate shade, particularly in the seedling stage. Reduced light intensity, due to prolonged overcast weather, shading from interplanted crops or too dense a stand of cotton, retards flowering and fruiting and increases boll shedding. Shedding of over 50% of squares, flowers or young bolls, due to early bollworm, drought or waterlogging, is normal. Upland cottons are day-neutral. Gossypium barbadense requires rainfall of (500-)750-1250(-1500) mm during the growing season. The crop will not tolerate very heavy rainfall and, where grown as a rain-fed crop, the average rainfall is usually 800-1200 mm. Modern cotton cultivars have some ability to overcome drought, and recover from a dry spell to resume growth and fruiting. Adequate, but not excessive, moisture is required for early vegetative growth. The first flowering period requires relative dryness to speed up formation of fruiting branches. An increase in moisture is required for boll setting and renewed growth, followed by dry weather for ripening and harvest. Sufficient soil moisture is essential during the flowering period ( PIER, 2012 ). It can be grown on a variety of soils from light sandy soils to heavy alluvium and rendzina-type clays. Soils must be permeable to water and to roots to a depth of at least 100 cm, preferably over 150 cm, with pH 5.5-8.5. Cotton is one of the more salt-tolerant crops.
