Rosa caesiasens.lat.Smith - rose  -Rosaceae© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)Together withRosa caninasensu stricto, this is a member of theRosa caninaaggregate, known collectively as dog roses. It differs fromR. caninasens. strict. by having pronounced wine-red colouring on the stems, a pink flower, and the styles forming a woolly mass completely covering the disk (top) of the hip. It is probably fairly frequent in Northern Ireland, but not as common as its hybrid withR. canina, which is calledR. x dumalis.Because of the difficulty in distinguishing this species fromR. caninaandR. x dumalisthe distribution map can only be taken as a rough guide to its distribution.All names:Rosa caesiasens.lat.Smith;Rosa dumalisauct. non Bechst.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
