 Invasion: GeneralA. mangium is a large tree, to 30 m tall, with a straight bole, which may be over half the total tree height. Trees with a diameter over 50 cm are rare. It may be reduced to a small tree or large shrub of 7-10 m on adverse sites. The bark surface is rough, furrowed longitudinally, and varies in colour from pale grey-brown to brown. The lower bole is sometimes fluted.A detailed botanical description is provided byPedley (1975).FoliageBorne on very acutely angled, glabrous and stout branchlets, the mature phyllodes of A. mangium are very large, normally 11-27 cm long and 3-10 cm broad. They are dark green, glabrous on a glabrous pulvinus 0.6-1 cm long. The phyllodes are characterized by four (rarely three or five) main longitudinal nerves, basally confluent but distinct from lower margin, minor nerves strongly anastomosing to form a prominent reticulum (Maslin and McDonald, 1996).Inflorescences, flowers and fruitsThe whitish (or cream) flowers

The phyllodes are characterized by four (rarely three or five) main longitudinal nerves, basally confluent but distinct from lower margin, minor nerves strongly anastomosing to form a prominent reticulum (Maslin and McDonald, 1996).Inflorescences, flowers and fruitsThe whitish (or cream) flowers are in rather loose spikes 5-12 cm long on peduncles 0.6-1 cm long, singly or in pairs in the upper axils. The seed pods are linear, tightly coiled when ripe, sometimes tightly spirally coiled, slightly woody, 7-8 cm long and 0.3-0.5 cm wide. The seeds are black and shiny, longitudinal, ovate to oblong 3-5 x 2-3 mm with a yellow or bright orange (rarely red) funicle folded to form an oily, fleshy aril beneath the seed.PhenologyA. mangium is a fast-growing, evergreen species. It is able to grow throughout the year if conditions are suitable. In Thailand, it has been observed that growth appears to slow down or cease in response to the combination of low rainfall and cool temperatures in January-February. Trees start to grow actively again in April before the start of the wet season (Atipanumpai, 1989).Flowering phenology differs throughout its natural and planted range. In its natural habitat, flowers are present during February to May in Australia and the seed matures in October-December (Sedgley et al., 1992). Farther north the fruits mature earlier with seed available from July in Indonesia, and late September in Papua New Guinea (Skelton, 1987;Turnbull et al., 1983).As an exotic, the normal flowering cycle may be disrupted and flowering can occur throughout the year; however, a distinct peak is usually discernible (Awang

The peak is reported to be June-July in Peninsular Malaysia (Zakaria and Awang, 1991), January in Sabah (Sedgley et al., 1992), October-November in Taiwan (Kiang et al., 1989) and September in Thailand (Kijkar, 1992). Mature fruits occur 3-4 months after flowering.

 Reproduccion: Sporophytic count for this species is 2n=26 ( IPCN Chromosome Reports, 2016 ). Acacia mangium reproduces by seeds contained in linear pods, which are tightly coiled when ripe, slightly woody, 7-8 cm long and 3-5 mm wide. The seeds are black and shiny, ovate to oblong 3-5 x 2-3 mm ( Doran and Turnbull, 1997 ). Time between flowering and seed maturity is between 180-210 days ( FAO, 2016 ). A. mangium produces a large seedbank (estimated between 66,800 and 115,000 seeds per kg) and a low germination rate (approx. 3% under natural conditions); considering this, as well as the seeds’ impermeability to water and the species’ flowering period of up to 8 months per year, the species poses high potential to be invasive and to

 A. mangium produces a large seedbank (estimated between 66,800 and 115,000 seeds per kg) and a low germination rate (approx. 3% under natural conditions); considering this, as well as the seeds’ impermeability to water and the species’ flowering period of up to 8 months per year, the species poses high potential to be invasive and to remain persistent, even despite the use of physical and chemical control methods on seedlings and trees ( Aguiar et al., 2014 ). In its native range, A. mangium flowering follows the wet season in north Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, holding its fruit through the dry season and releasing seed at the onset of the monsoons ( Turnbull et al., 1983 ; Skelton, 1987 ; Sedgley et al., 1992 ). A similar pattern may be responsible of the peak flowerings where this species is cultivated: June and July in Peninsular Malaysia ( Zakaria and Awang, 1991 ), January in Sabah ( Sedgley et al., 1992 ), October and November in Taiwan ( Kiang et al., 1989 ) and September in Thailand ( Kijkar, 1992 ). Acacia mangium is capable of growing in a range of environmental conditions. It can tolerate nutrient-deficient soil, heavy soil, lateritic soils (soil with high amounts of iron and aluminum oxides), low pH, poor soil, slopes and weeds ( Duke, 1983 ; Otsamo, 2002 ; Krisnawati et al., 2011 ). It is, however, sensitive to salinity and frost and in fires, young trees will be killed, while mature ones are more resistant but may be killed in very hot fires ( Krisnawati et al., 2011 ; FAO, 2016 ). In South Kalimantan, potassium appears to be a limiting factor to growth, while in Malaysia phosphorus appears to be a critical soil nutrient for growth ( Srivastava, 1993

The following data in the Environmental Requirements Table is derived from Duke (1983) and FAO (2016) . The natural occurrence of A. mangium overlaps the tropical warm and hot climatic zones, either humid or wet. The following data pertain to the species' natural range, while papers in Booth (1996) provide climatic profiles (summarized in the table) for the species combining information from both natural and planted occurrences.The temperatures are high and equable throughout the year. The mean maximum of the hottest month is about 30-34ºC and the mean minimum of the coolest about 15-22ºC. Despite the high mean minimum, the daily maximum temperature rarely exceeds 38ºC. The area is frost-free. The species is unsuitable for areas where the absolute minimum temperature falls below 0ºC (e.g. Yan et al., 1996 ).The mean annual rainfall is between about 1500-3000 mm. In a typical location the 50 percentile rainfall is 2150 mm, the 10 percentile 1300 mm and the lowest on record 1000 mm. The seasonal distribution is monsoonal or shows a strongly developed summer maximum with January-March very wet. The driest months are July-October, but with each averaging over 40 mm. In Queensland, A. mangium grows on the metamorphic, granitic, and acid volcanic formations of the foothills of the coastal ranges and on the sandy or loamy alluvium of the coastal plain.

In Queensland, A. mangium grows on the metamorphic, granitic, and acid volcanic formations of the foothills of the coastal ranges and on the sandy or loamy alluvium of the coastal plain. The soils are acid grey-brown podzolics, red and yellow friable earths, and loams of moderate to low fertility.In Papua New Guinea and adjacent areas of Irian Jaya, Indonesia, A. mangium occurs on the relict alluvial plain known as the Oriomo Plateau. It is also abundant on the flood plains of the Aramia and Fly Rivers.A. mangium is found mainly on well-drained, strongly acid soils with a shallow clay loam overlying a heavy clay, and sometimes on imperfectly drained soils subject to brief flooding in the wet season and rapid drying out in the dry season. It is usually replaced by A. auriculiformis and Melaleuca spp. on sites that have prolonged flooding. The soils are gleyed red and yellow earths or red and yellow latosols ( Bleeker, 1983 ). They are generally of low fertility and are especially poor in available phosphorus.

Climate The natural occurrence of A. mangium overlaps the tropical warm and hot climatic zones, either humid or wet. The following data pertain to the species' natural range, while papers in Booth (1996) provide climatic profiles (summarized in the table) for the species combining information from both natural and planted occurrences.The temperatures are high and equable throughout the year. The mean maximum of the hottest month is about 30-34ºC and the mean minimum of the coolest about 15-22ºC. Despite the high mean minimum, the daily maximum temperature rarely exceeds 38ºC. The area is frost-free. The species is unsuitable for areas where the absolute minimum temperature falls below 0ºC (e.g. Yan et al., 1996 ).The mean annual rainfall is between about 1500-3000 mm. In a typical location the 50 percentile rainfall is 2150 mm, the 10 percentile 1300 mm and the lowest on

, the daily maximum temperature rarely exceeds 38ºC. The area is frost-free. The species is unsuitable for areas where the absolute minimum temperature falls below 0ºC (e.g. Yan et al., 1996 ).The mean annual rainfall is between about 1500-3000 mm. In a typical location the 50 percentile rainfall is 2150 mm, the 10 percentile 1300 mm and the lowest on record 1000 mm. The seasonal distribution is monsoonal or shows a strongly developed summer maximum with January-March very wet. The driest months are July-October, but with each averaging over 40 mm. Soil and Physiography In Queensland, A. mangium grows on the metamorphic, granitic, and acid volcanic formations of the foothills of the coastal ranges and on the sandy or loamy alluvium of the coastal plain. The soils are acid grey-brown podzolics, red and yellow friable earths, and loams of moderate to low fertility.In Papua New Guinea and adjacent areas of Irian Jaya, Indonesia, A. mangium occurs on the relict alluvial plain known as the Oriomo Plateau. It is also abundant on the flood plains of the Aramia and Fly Rivers.A. mangium is found mainly on well-drained, strongly acid soils with a shallow clay loam overlying a heavy clay, and sometimes on imperfectly drained soils subject to brief flooding in the wet season and rapid drying out in the dry season. It is usually replaced by A. auriculiformis and Melaleuca spp. on sites that have prolonged flooding. The soils are gleyed red and yellow earths or red and yellow latosols ( Bleeker, 1983 ). They are generally of low fertility and are especially poor in available phosphorus.
