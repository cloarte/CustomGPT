ProteaceaeA. L. Jussieu山龙眼科 shan long yan keAuthors:Huaxing Qiu&Peter H. WestonTrees or shrubs. Stipules absent. Leaves alternate, rarely opposite or whorled, simple or variously divided. Inflorescences axillary, ramiflorous, cauliflorous, or terminal, simple or rarely compound, with flowers borne laterally either in pairs or sometimes singly, racemose, sometimes spicate, paniculate, or condensed into a head; bracts subtending flower pairs usually small, sometimes accrescent and woody; floral bracts usually minute or absent. Flowers bisexual or rarely unisexual and dioecious, actinomorphic or zygomorphic. Perianth segments (3 or)4(or 5), valvate, usually tubular in bud; limb short, variously split at anthesis. Stamens 4, opposite perianth segments; filaments usually adnate to perianth and not distinct; anthers basifixed, usually 2-loculed, longitudinally dehiscent, connective often prolonged. Hypogynous glands 4 (or 1-3 or absent), free or variously connate. Ovary superior, 1-loculed, sessile or stipitate; ovules 1 or 2(or more), pendulous, laterally or basally, rarely subapically attached. Style terminal, simple, often apically clavate; stigma terminal or lateral, mostly small. Fruit a follicle, achene, or drupe or drupaceous. Seeds 1 or 2(or few to many), sometimes winged; endosperm absent (or vestigial); embryo usually straight; cotyledons thin or thick and fleshy; radicle short, inferior.About 80 genera and ca.
