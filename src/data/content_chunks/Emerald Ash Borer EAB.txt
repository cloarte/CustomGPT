Emerald Ash Borer Survey Guidelines 
Introduction 
Survey for emerald ash borer (EAB) has undergone an evolution of tactics, scope, and 
application since discovery of the pest in 2002. Survey was originally based on visually 
detectable symptoms (D-shaped EAB exit holes, longitudinal bark cracks, epicormic branching, 
woodpecker feeding sites, etc.) survey was changed to girdled trees, then to the use of traps 
with lures. 
 
Visual survey was applied at various levels of intensity and with various techniques (e.g., 
ground surveys, ladders, climbing devices, bucket trucks). While visual surveys are unlikely to 
detect newly infested trees, they are useful when setting up EAB parasitoid release sites. 
 
Since 2012, trap placement has been based on a survey sampling design developed in 
collaboration with the APHIS EAB Program and the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest Health 
Technology Enterprise Team. The current EAB survey will use similar methodology based 
on last year’s survey, but will not be part of the PPQ EAB program. This computer-
generated EAB survey sampling design product combines a scientific model of the 
likelihood of detecting EAB with historical EAB detections. Simply stated, the survey 
sampling design model will provide general geographic areas to deploy EAB traps resulting 
in the highest probability of pest detection.  
 
Since the EAB program is placing a greater emphasis on biocontrol activities, the use of traps 
for detection of EAB will receive less emphasis. Traps and lure will remain available for our 
cooperators while supplies last. As of

 design model will provide general geographic areas to deploy EAB traps resulting 
in the highest probability of pest detection.  
 
Since the EAB program is placing a greater emphasis on biocontrol activities, the use of traps 
for detection of EAB will receive less emphasis. Traps and lure will remain available for our 
cooperators while supplies last. As of January, 2020 some 13,000 purple prism traps and 
55,000 Z-3-hexenol lures were available for distribution from our Mission warehouse.  
 
Survey Objective 
The EAB Program will not conduct a national survey but will support cooperators to determine 
whether additional pockets of infestation may exist undetected surrounding the known infested 
areas, to better define the leading edge, and mainly to identify areas for future biological control 
activities. The objective of the survey is to detect further spread of EAB along the leading edge 
and to find suitable locations for the release of biological control organisms. 
 
Visual survey  
Visual surveys should be based on symptoms, such as epicormic shoot growth, declining or dead 
canopy, longitudinal bark cracks, woodpecker damage and D-shaped EAB exit holes. Visual 
survey is not very effective for newly infested areas, as these infestations are often high in the 
canopy, but when trees become more heavily infested, they will be easier to detect and may also 
be amenable to the deployment of EAB parasitoids. (See Appendices A and C of the EAB 
Biological Control Release and Recovery Guidelines for more signs of EAB infestation. 
 
All survey and public outreach activities should be coordinated with Tribes, Federal, State, 
and local agencies and organizations to ensure efficient use of resources.

Trap Placement Protocols 
The risk-based sampling design generates a science-based, survey within a 100 mile buffer area 
near newly detected EAB infestations. The sampling design identifies locations where traps may 
be placed identified by latitude, longitude, county, and state. 
 
Trap placement should be coordinated with State Plant Regulatory Officials and Tribal 
governments where Tribal lands are involved. Coordination also should occur with other Federal, 
State, and local agencies, and non-governmental organizations involved in the program. To 
ensure the highest probability of detecting EAB, traps should be set in trees that meet the criteria 
as described in the Trap and Sign Placement paragraph on page 5 of these guidelines. 
 
The list of trap locations generated by the survey sampling design includes the latitude and 
longitude for the center point of each location in which a trap is to be placed. Navigating to each 
location will require the use of a global positioning system (GPS) unit. Set-up and guidance 
information for GPS units is provided in Appendix B on page 16.

FIGURE 1. Emerald ash borer survey map (Please see page 19 for larger format map).  
A limited number of threatened and endangered species of insects could be caught in the purple 
prism trap. These species include the delta green ground beetle, Hine’s emerald dragonfly, 
Mitchell’s satyr butterfly, Saint Francis’ satyr butterfly, the Laguna mountains skipper, and the 
valley elderberry longhorned beetle. Sampling locations within critical habitat areas for 
potentially affected threatened and endangered insect species were discarded from the sampling 
design. Traps must not be set in critical habitat areas for these species. In addition, to avoid 
inadvertent capture of Karner blue butterflies, traps should not be set in jack pine and oak 
savannah with well drained sandy soils habitat in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, 
and Wisconsin. Please consult EAB Program management for guidance if needed. 
  

USDA APHIS PPQ 15  
In locations where high-risk facilities or conditions are present and suitable ash trees are located, 
traps should be located in an ash tree as near as possible to the high-risk facility. Prioritized high-
risk facilities should include: 
 
1. Campground, recreation area, cottage community, summer camp 
2. Major transportation artery, rest area, truck stop 
3. Sawmill, firewood dealer, nursery, tree care company 
4. Recently landscaped residential and commercial property 
5. Site of high attendance/ high profile cultural event: Pow-Wow ground, hunting lodge, 
NASCAR track, horse trail ride site, motor cross site, rafting and fishing camp

5. Site of high attendance/ high profile cultural event: Pow-Wow ground, hunting lodge, 
NASCAR track, horse trail ride site, motor cross site, rafting and fishing camp 
 
NOTE: Ash trees within the location exhibiting two or more of the symptoms listed below should 
also be examined using destructive sampling techniques (i.e., the removal of bark to inspect for 
EAB): 
 
 Canopy stress/dieback 
 Epicormic shoots/suckering 
 Bark splits 
 Woodpecker damage 
 D-shaped exit holes (3-4 mm diameter) 
 Larval galleries 
 
Conducting Survey and Inspections: 
 Identification of most suitable site and tree within the designated location 
 Distribution of educational material where appropriate 
 Placement and maintenance of traps 
 Visual survey of the environment for ash trees exhibiting signs and symptoms of 
EAB in proximity of the traps. 
 
NOTE: For various reasons it may not be possible to place a trap in a location as designated 
by the survey sampling design. Those locations must be recorded according to the following 
definitions: 
 
Omitted: The location is inaccessible – no trap can be set 
Declined: The location is viable but survey resources are limited – no trap can be set

Purple Prism Trap Assembly and Placement 
Timing of Trap Placement: Research indicates that an accumulation of 450 growing degree days 
(base 50oF) results in initial emergence of EAB adults. Traps should be placed just prior to 450 
growing degree days (GDD) and lure replacement is recommended to occur just prior to the 60 
day expiration date. In order to assist States with timing of trap placement, a map of the United 
States depicting predictive areas of initial emergence are appended to this document (Please see 
page 20 for GDD map). Appendix C (see page 17) defines, by state, when initial emergence is 
predicted to occur. 
 
Trap: A prism trap consisting of three 14” x 24” panels with several holes for trap and lure 
attachment (Fig. 2) will be used. The trap is constructed from a sheet of pre-glued purple 
corrugated plastic. An instructional video detailing trap assembly and use can be found on the 
APHIS website under Pest Management here. (Please note that when assembled the pre-glued 
face of the panels should be the exterior face.) 
 
 
USDA APHIS PPQ 16  
After the trap is assembled into its prism shape, spreaders are attached to the trap at holes (labeled 
3 in Fig. 2). The lure is attached to a loop on the spreader using a cable tie (Fig. 3).

FIGURE 2:  Prism trap diagram 
 
FIGURE 3: Lures hung from loop on spreader using a cable tie 
 
Lure: One pouch of (Z)-3-hexanol lure is recommended to be attached to each trap.  The lure 
provided by commercial firms is produced as a pouch and designed to last in the field for 60 days. 
Lure attachment to the trap should be reinforced with duct tape placed at the very top to ensure 
continued attachment during inclement weather. Do not cover the lure with duct tape as that will 
inhibit the release of the lure. If possible, any unused lure remaining at the end of the trapping 
season should be stored (refrigerated or frozen) for future use in EAB surveys. Research suggests 
that the Manuka oil lure provides a negligible increase in trap efficacy, therefore the EAB 
Program has decided to discontinue its use in the national survey. However, any remaining 
Manuka oil lure from previous surveys within the past two to three years may also be used. 
 
Lure Handling, Transport, and Storage: 
The (Z)-3-hexenol lure pouches emit odors and volatiles which pose safety and health concerns in 
confined spaces. EAB Program managers have worked closely with the APHIS Safety and Health 
managers and the lure manufacturer to develop protocols for the safe handling, transport, and 
storage of the lures. In summary, prior to deployment, lures must be kept cold at all times by 
storing in a freezer. During transport, lures must be kept in coolers with cold packs or ice and 
stored in isolation from the

managers and the lure manufacturer to develop protocols for the safe handling, transport, and 
storage of the lures. In summary, prior to deployment, lures must be kept cold at all times by 
storing in a freezer. During transport, lures must be kept in coolers with cold packs or ice and 
stored in isolation from the vehicle’s cab, or, as an alternative, kept in coolers with screw top lids 
that also must be chilled with cold packs or ice. Coolers should be labeled “NOT FOR FOOD OR 
BEVERAGE USE”. To avoid skin irritation during handling, gloves may be worn. Additional 
information and precautions can be found in a Job Hazard Assessment and Material Safety Data 
Sheets for the lure pouches and are available from the local APHIS PPQ Safety Coordinator or 
supervisor for more details. 
 

USDA APHIS PPQ 17  
Trap and Sign Placement: Traps must be placed in ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). If possible, ash 
trees should be 8” or greater in diameter with larger or largest ash tree in a stand of trees located 
along edges, in open areas, or in open stands such as in parks within the grid cell. Traps should 
be placed in the lower to mid canopy, but with the bottom edge of the trap no lower than five feet 
above the ground. They should be placed on the sunny side of the tree, most typically, the south 
or southwest side.

A wire hanger will be used to hang purple prism traps (Fig. 4). A telescoping pole that extends to 
24’ (different models are available at home improvement stores and other retailers), and fitted 
with a hook to place the purple trap in one of the lower limbs, is recommended. The full 
extension of the pole may or may not be necessary. If all limbs are too high to reach with a pole, 
a throw line may be tossed over a limb, and a rope with a trap attached may be hoisted up into the 
canopy (Fig. 5).

USDA APHIS PPQ 18  
Trap Maintenance: A lure will last approximately 60 days and should be replaced just prior to 
expiration. Traps should be inspected for adult EAB at the time of lure replacement. 
 
If trap surfaces are loaded with debris, they should be renewed by removing the debris and 
scraping the sticky compound. Scraping can be accomplished with a trowel or putty knife. If 
necessary, stickier compound can be added using a paint roller or trowel. The sticky surface 
should remain intact throughout the season unless a trap is allowed to come in repeated contact 
with an adjacent branch or tree bole. Traps must not be removed prior to August 1 and before 
1,500 GDDs have been exceeded.

should remain intact throughout the season unless a trap is allowed to come in repeated contact 
with an adjacent branch or tree bole. Traps must not be removed prior to August 1 and before 
1,500 GDDs have been exceeded. 
 
Trap Disposition: While the polypropylene material of the traps is recyclable, the sticky 
compound that is adhered to the panels renders the traps undesirable to most recyclers. 
Alternatively, one may seek a user of waste fuel material for trap disposition. Hangers and 
spreaders are reusable and should be retained for future use. Hangers and spreaders that cannot 
be reused should be recycled. 
 
Lindgren Green Multi-funnel Trap Assembly and Placement 
Timing of Trap Placement: The timing for placement of Lindgren green multi-funnel traps is 
identical to the purple prism trap. Research indicates that an accumulation of 450 growing degree 
days (base 50oF) results in initial emergence of EAB adults. Traps should be placed just prior to 
450 growing degree days (GDD) and lure replacement is recommended to occur just prior to the 
60 day expiration date. In order to assist States with timing of trap placement, a map of the U.S. 
depicting predictive bands of initial emergence are appended to this document (see page 20 for 
GDD map). Appendix C (see page 17) defines, by state, when initial emergence is predicted to 
occur. 
 
Trap: The trap is constructed from 12 green plastic funnels with a green dome-shaped top and a 
plastic collection cup at the bottom. Trap funnels and the dome are held together

occur. 
 
Trap: The trap is constructed from 12 green plastic funnels with a green dome-shaped top and a 
plastic collection cup at the bottom. Trap funnels and the dome are held together by black pegs. 
The collection cup is secured to the bottom with a twist-on motion.  An eye screw at the top of 
the trap is used for rope attachment (see Figs. 6, 7). Multi-funnel traps are pre-assembled and 
pre- coated in a 1:1 solution of Fluon before shipment to field locations. The Fluon application 
provides a slippery surface that assists with the capture of EAB. Due to the modular nature of the 
traps, some minor assembly may be required. 
 
FIGURE 6: Multi-funnel traps hanging in ash trees 

USDA APHIS PPQ 19  
 
Trap hanging: A rope should be thrown over a branch at approximately 16-26’ above the ground. 
The limb hanger and pole should not be used for hanging the multi-funnel trap. The branch 
should be alive and sturdy (> 2” diameter), as smaller or dead branches could snap under the 
weight of the trap. An arborist throw weight (12, 14, or 16 oz.) can be tied to one end of the rope. 
Take care to clear the rope from all lower branches so that the trap can be pulled up and down 
like an elevator when servicing. The rope should have a clear path to the ground. The trap may 
need to be raised and lowered at an angle from the tree to accomplish this. Give yourself enough 
slack so

Take care to clear the rope from all lower branches so that the trap can be pulled up and down 
like an elevator when servicing. The rope should have a clear path to the ground. The trap may 
need to be raised and lowered at an angle from the tree to accomplish this. Give yourself enough 
slack so that you can tie the rope to an adjacent tree. 
 
A bowline knot, similar to the one shown here is the preferred method: 
(http://wow.uscgaux.info/content.php?unit=081-07-04&category=knots-know-how)   
 
Using these knots, tie the rope to two points on each trap. For the multi-funnel trap these points 
are the top metal hanger and one of the three holes on the bottom funnel used for peg attachment. 
The knot is important as high winds will sometimes cause the traps to come down if the knots are 
not tied properly. 
 
When hanging the traps try to rest the top of the trap against the bottom of the tree limb. This 
should prevent the rope from twisting on itself. When attaching the collection cup, take care to 
make sure that it is securely attached to the bottom funnel. 
 
FIGURE 7. Green multi-funnel trap with attachment points for ropes and lures. 
 
Prior to raising the trap in the tree, fill the cup with approximately 2 inches of propylene glycol 
(RV antifreeze; usually pink in color). Do NOT use any product containing ethanol as products 
containing this will evaporate over time, especially in hot, dry climates or under drought 
conditions. Propylene glycol should not be diluted with water prior to filling the cup as it will be

containing this will evaporate over time, especially in hot, dry climates or under drought 
conditions. Propylene glycol should not be diluted with water prior to filling the cup as it will be 
diluted by rainwater over time. 
 

USDA APHIS PPQ 20  
Once the trap is hoisted, tie it off to a tree (the one the trap is hanging from will work for this). 
Take care when tying this rope off to place it out of the reach of children or others who may 
want to pull it down. 
 
Trap checking: When checking the multi-funnel trap, the contents of the trap should be poured 
through a paper filter. A paper cone paint strainer is the preferred method (Fig. 8), although a 
coffee filter may also work but will retain more moisture. The strainer should then be placed 
inside a leak proof plastic bag. While wire closed bags (e.g., Whirlpaks) are the preferred 
method, a plastic zipper (e.g., Ziploc) bag will also work. Please make sure to label and seal the 
bag completely to prevent leaks. A small amount, such as one teaspoon, of ethanol may be added 
to the bag to help preserve the specimens for sorting in the lab. As long as the liquid in the cup is 
still pink, and does not smell too badly, it can be reused instead of discarded during traps checks. 
Place a propylene glycol collection container under the filter when pouring out the sample.

A (Z)-3-hexanol lure pouch should be hung from the lower loop of the prism trap spreader or 
from one of the holes used for peg attachment near the top of the multi-funnel trap with a small 
plastic cable tie. The lure should be changed before its expiration in 60 days. 
 
Trap and Lure Handling, Transport, and Storage: 
EAB Program managers have worked closely with the APHIS PPQ Safety and Health Managers 
and the trap and lure manufacturers to develop protocols for the safe handling, transport, and 
storage of our traps and lures. The green multi-funnel trap is coated with a fluoropolymer resin 
commonly referred to as “fluon”. EAB Program uses manufacturer pre-treated “fluon” traps only 
for program use. This slippery resin may be an irritant to some which can be negated through the 
use of nitrile gloves during handling. Eye protection, such as vented splash goggles and face 
shield, should be worn while raising the trap into position in order to avoid any propylene glycol 
spillage contacting the eyes. The (Z)-3-hexanol lure pouches emit odors and volatiles which pose 
safety and health concerns in confined spaces. Prior to deployment, lures must be kept cold at all 
times by storing in a freezer. During transport, lures must be kept in coolers with cold packs or

During handling of lure, open down-wind in an open well-ventilated environment. Additional 
information and precautions can be found in a Job Hazard Assessment and Safety Data Sheets for 
“fluon”, propylene glycol, and the (Z)-3-hexanol lure pouches in each sites specific Safety Data 
Sheet manual. Contact your local APHIS PPQ Safety Coordinator or supervisor for more details.

captured should be collected. When reattaching cups, please make sure that all pegs are securely 
locked in place as they may come loose under some weather conditions. 
 
Trap Disposition: Multi-funnel traps are designed to be used over several field seasons. At the 
end of the season, the collection cups may be gently scrubbed, and dirt may be wiped away from 
funnels with a cloth, take care not to remove too much of the slippery Fluon coating. Traps will 
collapse into a smaller form for storage and subsequent reuse. 
 
Screening for Suspect Buprestidae and Specimen Submission 
Any suspect Buprestidae adult or suspect EAB adult specimen collected from a trap in a non-
quarantined county should be placed in a dry vial. If the specimen is from a purple prism trap, use 
the sticky compound from the trap to stick the specimen to the side of the vial and/or gently pad 
with soft tissue placed into the vial on top of the specimen(s) to prevent damage during shipping.

APHIS wants to make it clear that the national “Integrated Plant Health Information System” 
(IPHIS) is not required as a field data collection tool, however operationally specific data is of 
great importance and therefore APHIS has designated the IPHIS application to be utilized as the 
final holding tank or centralized database for EAB data. 
 
IPHIS requires internet access, USDA eAuthentication credentials, and approved access to an 
IPHIS or cooperator office. If you need USDA eAuthentication USDA employees should contact 
their supervisors, and all other cooperators should work through their State Plant Regulatory 
Official and State Plant Health Director. 
 
After receiving network access, eAuthentication credentials and IPHIS access, users can log into 
the system and utilize two types of data entry methods. These include the IPHIS web interface 
and an Excel spreadsheet to upload files. The AllInOne Excel spreadsheet upload file, for initial 
trap installations and omits, is also available here. 
 
Please use the IPHIS template “EAB Natl Survey” for capturing EAB trapping and omit data. 
 
Note: IPHIS can now receive unlimited uploaded records in a spreadsheet. 
 
The data fields created for the 2012 through 2019 EAB surveys are also used in the EAB survey. 
APHIS does not ask surveyors to collect symptom data, and the fields for diameter at breast 
height (DBH) and trap height are optional. Additional optional fields include: (1) site type

including omitted and declined locations, and (3) fields to record omit reasons for assigned grids 
and comments. 
 
Please record the state’s assigned grid number as IPHIS’ Location Name; the IPHIS site name can 
also be assigned this value. Traps placed outside assigned grid number cell locations should use 
the following naming convention for location name: 
 
2 letters for state designation + 3 letters for surveyor’s initials + 3 digit sequential trap number 
(e.g., IAJAD003 for Iowa, John A. Doe, Trap 3). 
 
The state’s sequential trap number begins with 001 for the first trap not having an assigned 
grid number and increases by one for each additional trap; second trap is 002, the third is 003 
and so on. 
 
For consistency with other state trapping programs, we encourage users to use existing 
procedures and tools for recording data in the field. A field data form for the manual recording of 
USDA APHIS PPQ 23  
data is in Appendix D. Organizations using paper, spreadsheets, or third party software can enter

Communication: 
The risk-based survey sampling design continues to determine trap dispersal. A variety of 
materials will be developed to facilitate communication and understanding among key audiences 
who include Federal, State, and Tribal partners, survey cooperators and contractors, the media, 
and the public at large. Materials will include but are not limited to key messages, talking points, 
and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s). 
 
The highly visible purple prism traps and Lindgren green multi-funnel traps generate curiosity 
which often results in public questions and media inquiries. Individuals involved in the actual 
placement and maintenance of traps should be conversant with survey messages and understand 
media protocols. Furthermore, the EAB survey provides an opportunity to communicate other 
program messages addressing control, regulation, and the human-assisted spread of the pest. 
Communication staff and program personnel should also be broadly familiar with the core 
program messages about these issues. 
 
Outreach & Education: 
The active participation of target audiences to assist in preventing the spread of emerald ash borer 
throughout the United States is critical. Outreach is an integral element of the EAB Program 
supporting regulatory, survey, and control.—It is a basic task for all program staff and a value- 
added opportunity for each personal encounter, engagement, or exchange. Formal strategic

added opportunity for each personal encounter, engagement, or exchange. Formal strategic 
communication and outreach campaigns targeting industries that move regulated material should 
be implemented together with public awareness campaigns designed to provide education to 
citizens about the dangers of moving infested host materials such as firewood. Since the beetle is 
difficult to detect, the more people trained to identify EAB symptoms or damage and report 
suspects, the greater the opportunity for successful outcomes. Outreach activities encourage the 
public to recognize and report possible beetle damage in their area as well as suspected incidents 
of quarantine violations.

Appendix A. Details of Survey Sampling Design Construction. 
 
The EAB survey employs a computer-generated risk assessment product to guide the 
deployment of detection tools in a way which results in the following benefits: 
 
 increase the number of successful EAB detections outside the known infested area 
 improve land managers capability of detecting EAB close to the date of a new attack 
 find locations that are best suited to implement biological control 
 
The EAB risk assessment model was developed using a combination of statistical models for 
predicting where EAB was most likely to be detected. This is a major change in modeling procedure 
from years prior to 2016, which employed the MaxEnt statistical model, which used only positive 
detections for EAB. Given the last few years of nationally consistent data collection which reports 
both positive and negative detections, APHIS upgraded the models to utilize that information in order

 where EAB was most likely to be detected. This is a major change in modeling procedure 
from years prior to 2016, which employed the MaxEnt statistical model, which used only positive 
detections for EAB. Given the last few years of nationally consistent data collection which reports 
both positive and negative detections, APHIS upgraded the models to utilize that information in order 
to avoid some major statistical assumptions regarding the data, and discovered that all the models 
concurred in predicting risk in the known infested area but differed widely in extrapolating that risk 
to outside the infested area. This is consistent with knowledge concerning the difficulty of pest 
detection, so an “ensemble” of the models was created to mitigate model uncertainty between 
statistical platforms. There were two model applications for each statistical platform, both using all 
2011-2017 trap data: one model included the distance from any prior year positive trap as a predictor 
variable (modeling active spread) and one model did not include distance from prior detections as a 
predictor variable (modeling full geographic potential). 
 
EAB is an actively spreading pest and a false negative could be reported for two reasons: 1) the 
location is suitable but not yet infested, or 2) the pest is present but undetected. Utilizing negative trap 
location could be too restrictive in the model fitting process because of the potential for false 
negatives. While MaxEnt demonstrates flexibility regarding the “potential” of locations of having a 
pest present, we found that MaxEnt’s default assumption of pest prevalence (EAB can occupy up to 
50% of the landscape) caused great overestimation of risk compared to models that utilized actual 
absence information. Since the EAB risk assessment model is updated each year, APHIS is

 the “potential” of locations of having a 
pest present, we found that MaxEnt’s default assumption of pest prevalence (EAB can occupy up to 
50% of the landscape) caused great overestimation of risk compared to models that utilized actual 
absence information. Since the EAB risk assessment model is updated each year, APHIS is mitigating 
the issue by allowing the model to update with new information as the pest invades new 
environmental gradients. 
 
Four parameters were required to run the models. These were: 
1) the dependent detection data from the APHIS IPHIS dataset (2011-2018), which consists of both 
negative and positive trap data 
2) selected independent variables that correlate with the presence of EAB 
3) a defined geographic area of interest. 
4) modeled negative trap data limited to traps within 60 km of a positive trap. 
 
The independent variables were selected in the previous year using the following sources: 
1. scientific literature 
2. expert opinion 
3. anecdotal evidence 
4. correlation analyses 
5. preliminary statistical analyses. 
USDA APHIS PPQ 25  
Dissemination of trap resources is thus determined by this EAB risk assessment model, combined 
with a spatially balanced sample design. The model has a known inclusion probability for every 
grid cell and provides an objective and transparent methodology for selecting trap locations. Since 
we are utilizing an ensemble model which is actually a percentage of model agreement of pest 
presence (rather than risk of pest presence like in previous years), the sample design will utilize 
this ranking of model agreement as the inclusion probability surface. The sampling design 
increases spatial independence among sample locations and therefore, maximizes sampling 
efficiency and provides the most information available per sample unit

Emerald Ash Borer Survey Guidelines 
Introduction 
Survey for emerald ash borer (EAB) has undergone an evolution of tactics, scope, and 
application since discovery of the pest in 2002. Survey was originally based on visually 
detectable symptoms (D-shaped EAB exit holes, longitudinal bark cracks, epicormic branching, 
woodpecker feeding sites, etc.) survey was changed to girdled trees, then to the use of traps 
with lures. 
 
Visual survey was applied at various levels of intensity and with various techniques (e.g., 
ground surveys, ladders, climbing devices, bucket trucks). While visual surveys are unlikely to 
detect newly infested trees, they are useful when setting up EAB parasitoid release sites. 
 
Since 2012, trap placement has been based on a survey sampling design developed in 
collaboration with the APHIS EAB Program and the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest Health 
Technology Enterprise Team. The current EAB survey will use similar methodology based 
on last year’s survey, but will not be part of the PPQ EAB program. This computer-
generated EAB survey sampling design product combines a scientific model of the 
likelihood of detecting EAB with historical EAB detections. Simply stated, the survey 
sampling design model will provide general geographic areas to deploy EAB traps resulting 
in the highest probability of pest detection.  
 
Since the EAB program is placing a greater emphasis on biocontrol activities, the use of traps 
for detection of EAB will receive less emphasis. Traps and lure will remain available for our 
cooperators while supplies last. As of

 design model will provide general geographic areas to deploy EAB traps resulting 
in the highest probability of pest detection.  
 
Since the EAB program is placing a greater emphasis on biocontrol activities, the use of traps 
for detection of EAB will receive less emphasis. Traps and lure will remain available for our 
cooperators while supplies last. As of January, 2020 some 13,000 purple prism traps and 
55,000 Z-3-hexenol lures were available for distribution from our Mission warehouse.  
 
Survey Objective 
The EAB Program will not conduct a national survey but will support cooperators to determine 
whether additional pockets of infestation may exist undetected surrounding the known infested 
areas, to better define the leading edge, and mainly to identify areas for future biological control 
activities. The objective of the survey is to detect further spread of EAB along the leading edge 
and to find suitable locations for the release of biological control organisms. 
 
Visual survey  
Visual surveys should be based on symptoms, such as epicormic shoot growth, declining or dead 
canopy, longitudinal bark cracks, woodpecker damage and D-shaped EAB exit holes. Visual 
survey is not very effective for newly infested areas, as these infestations are often high in the 
canopy, but when trees become more heavily infested, they will be easier to detect and may also 
be amenable to the deployment of EAB parasitoids. (See Appendices A and C of the EAB 
Biological Control Release and Recovery Guidelines for more signs of EAB infestation. 
 
All survey and public outreach activities should be coordinated with Tribes, Federal, State, 
and local agencies and organizations to ensure efficient use of resources.

All survey and public outreach activities should be coordinated with Tribes, Federal, State, 
and local agencies and organizations to ensure efficient use of resources. 
 
 
 

USDA APHIS PPQ 14  
Trap Placement Protocols 
The risk-based sampling design generates a science-based, survey within a 100 mile buffer area 
near newly detected EAB infestations. The sampling design identifies locations where traps may 
be placed identified by latitude, longitude, county, and state. 
 
Trap placement should be coordinated with State Plant Regulatory Officials and Tribal 
governments where Tribal lands are involved. Coordination also should occur with other Federal, 
State, and local agencies, and non-governmental organizations involved in the program. To 
ensure the highest probability of detecting EAB, traps should be set in trees that meet the criteria 
as described in the Trap and Sign Placement paragraph on page 5 of these guidelines. 
 
The list of trap locations generated by the survey sampling design includes the latitude and 
longitude for the center point of each location in which a trap is to be placed. Navigating to each 
location will require the use of a global positioning system (GPS) unit. Set-up and guidance 
information for GPS units is provided in Appendix B on page 16.

FIGURE 1. Emerald ash borer survey map (Please see page 19 for larger format map).  
A limited number of threatened and endangered species of insects could be caught in the purple 
prism trap. These species include the delta green ground beetle, Hine’s emerald dragonfly, 
Mitchell’s satyr butterfly, Saint Francis’ satyr butterfly, the Laguna mountains skipper, and the 
valley elderberry longhorned beetle. Sampling locations within critical habitat areas for 
potentially affected threatened and endangered insect species were discarded from the sampling 
design. Traps must not be set in critical habitat areas for these species. In addition, to avoid 
inadvertent capture of Karner blue butterflies, traps should not be set in jack pine and oak 
savannah with well drained sandy soils habitat in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, 
and Wisconsin. Please consult EAB Program management for guidance if needed. 
  

USDA APHIS PPQ 15  
In locations where high-risk facilities or conditions are present and suitable ash trees are located, 
traps should be located in an ash tree as near as possible to the high-risk facility. Prioritized high-
risk facilities should include: 
 
1. Campground, recreation area, cottage community, summer camp 
2. Major transportation artery, rest area, truck stop 
3. Sawmill, firewood dealer, nursery, tree care company 
4. Recently landscaped residential and commercial property 
5. Site of high attendance/ high profile cultural event: Pow-Wow ground, hunting lodge,

NASCAR track, horse trail ride site, motor cross site, rafting and fishing camp 
 
NOTE: Ash trees within the location exhibiting two or more of the symptoms listed below should 
also be examined using destructive sampling techniques (i.e., the removal of bark to inspect for 
EAB): 
 
 Canopy stress/dieback 
 Epicormic shoots/suckering 
 Bark splits 
 Woodpecker damage 
 D-shaped exit holes (3-4 mm diameter) 
 Larval galleries 
 
Conducting Survey and Inspections: 
 Identification of most suitable site and tree within the designated location 
 Distribution of educational material where appropriate 
 Placement and maintenance of traps 
 Visual survey of the environment for ash trees exhibiting signs and symptoms of 
EAB in proximity of the traps. 
 
NOTE: For various reasons it may not be possible to place a trap in a location as designated 
by the survey sampling design. Those locations must be recorded according to the following 
definitions: 
 
Omitted: The location is inaccessible – no trap can be set 
Declined: The location is viable but survey resources are limited – no trap can be set

Purple Prism Trap Assembly and Placement 
Timing of Trap Placement: Research indicates that an accumulation of 450 growing degree days 
(base 50oF) results in initial emergence of EAB adults. Traps should be placed just prior to 450 
growing degree days (GDD) and lure replacement is recommended to occur just prior to the 60 
day expiration date. In order to assist States with timing of trap placement, a map of the United 
States depicting predictive areas of initial emergence are appended to this document (Please see 
page 20 for GDD map). Appendix C (see page 17) defines, by state, when initial emergence is 
predicted to occur. 
 
Trap: A prism trap consisting of three 14” x 24” panels with several holes for trap and lure 
attachment (Fig. 2) will be used. The trap is constructed from a sheet of pre-glued purple 
corrugated plastic. An instructional video detailing trap assembly and use can be found on the 
APHIS website under Pest Management here. (Please note that when assembled the pre-glued 
face of the panels should be the exterior face.) 
 
 
USDA APHIS PPQ 16  
After the trap is assembled into its prism shape, spreaders are attached to the trap at holes (labeled 
3 in Fig. 2). The lure is attached to a loop on the spreader using a cable tie (Fig. 3).

FIGURE 2:  Prism trap diagram 
 
FIGURE 3: Lures hung from loop on spreader using a cable tie 
 
Lure: One pouch of (Z)-3-hexanol lure is recommended to be attached to each trap.  The lure 
provided by commercial firms is produced as a pouch and designed to last in the field for 60 days. 
Lure attachment to the trap should be reinforced with duct tape placed at the very top to ensure 
continued attachment during inclement weather. Do not cover the lure with duct tape as that will 
inhibit the release of the lure. If possible, any unused lure remaining at the end of the trapping 
season should be stored (refrigerated or frozen) for future use in EAB surveys. Research suggests 
that the Manuka oil lure provides a negligible increase in trap efficacy, therefore the EAB 
Program has decided to discontinue its use in the national survey. However, any remaining 
Manuka oil lure from previous surveys within the past two to three years may also be used. 
 
Lure Handling, Transport, and Storage: 
The (Z)-3-hexenol lure pouches emit odors and volatiles which pose safety and health concerns in 
confined spaces. EAB Program managers have worked closely with the APHIS Safety and Health 
managers and the lure manufacturer to develop protocols for the safe handling, transport, and 
storage of the lures. In summary, prior to deployment, lures must be kept cold at all times by 
storing in a freezer. During transport, lures must be kept in coolers with cold packs or ice and 
stored in isolation from the

managers and the lure manufacturer to develop protocols for the safe handling, transport, and 
storage of the lures. In summary, prior to deployment, lures must be kept cold at all times by 
storing in a freezer. During transport, lures must be kept in coolers with cold packs or ice and 
stored in isolation from the vehicle’s cab, or, as an alternative, kept in coolers with screw top lids 
that also must be chilled with cold packs or ice. Coolers should be labeled “NOT FOR FOOD OR 
BEVERAGE USE”. To avoid skin irritation during handling, gloves may be worn. Additional 
information and precautions can be found in a Job Hazard Assessment and Material Safety Data 
Sheets for the lure pouches and are available from the local APHIS PPQ Safety Coordinator or 
supervisor for more details. 
 

USDA APHIS PPQ 17  
Trap and Sign Placement: Traps must be placed in ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). If possible, ash 
trees should be 8” or greater in diameter with larger or largest ash tree in a stand of trees located 
along edges, in open areas, or in open stands such as in parks within the grid cell. Traps should 
be placed in the lower to mid canopy, but with the bottom edge of the trap no lower than five feet 
above the ground. They should be placed on the sunny side of the tree, most typically, the south 
or southwest side.

A wire hanger will be used to hang purple prism traps (Fig. 4). A telescoping pole that extends to 
24’ (different models are available at home improvement stores and other retailers), and fitted 
with a hook to place the purple trap in one of the lower limbs, is recommended. The full 
extension of the pole may or may not be necessary. If all limbs are too high to reach with a pole, 
a throw line may be tossed over a limb, and a rope with a trap attached may be hoisted up into the 
canopy (Fig. 5).

USDA APHIS PPQ 18  
Trap Maintenance: A lure will last approximately 60 days and should be replaced just prior to 
expiration. Traps should be inspected for adult EAB at the time of lure replacement. 
 
If trap surfaces are loaded with debris, they should be renewed by removing the debris and 
scraping the sticky compound. Scraping can be accomplished with a trowel or putty knife. If 
necessary, stickier compound can be added using a paint roller or trowel. The sticky surface 
should remain intact throughout the season unless a trap is allowed to come in repeated contact 
with an adjacent branch or tree bole. Traps must not be removed prior to August 1 and before 
1,500 GDDs have been exceeded.

Trap Disposition: While the polypropylene material of the traps is recyclable, the sticky 
compound that is adhered to the panels renders the traps undesirable to most recyclers. 
Alternatively, one may seek a user of waste fuel material for trap disposition. Hangers and 
spreaders are reusable and should be retained for future use. Hangers and spreaders that cannot 
be reused should be recycled. 
 
Lindgren Green Multi-funnel Trap Assembly and Placement 
Timing of Trap Placement: The timing for placement of Lindgren green multi-funnel traps is 
identical to the purple prism trap. Research indicates that an accumulation of 450 growing degree 
days (base 50oF) results in initial emergence of EAB adults. Traps should be placed just prior to 
450 growing degree days (GDD) and lure replacement is recommended to occur just prior to the 
60 day expiration date. In order to assist States with timing of trap placement, a map of the U.S. 
depicting predictive bands of initial emergence are appended to this document (see page 20 for 
GDD map). Appendix C (see page 17) defines, by state, when initial emergence is predicted to 
occur.

plastic collection cup at the bottom. Trap funnels and the dome are held together by black pegs. 
The collection cup is secured to the bottom with a twist-on motion.  An eye screw at the top of 
the trap is used for rope attachment (see Figs. 6, 7). Multi-funnel traps are pre-assembled and 
pre- coated in a 1:1 solution of Fluon before shipment to field locations. The Fluon application 
provides a slippery surface that assists with the capture of EAB. Due to the modular nature of the 
traps, some minor assembly may be required. 
 
FIGURE 6: Multi-funnel traps hanging in ash trees 

USDA APHIS PPQ 19  
 
Trap hanging: A rope should be thrown over a branch at approximately 16-26’ above the ground. 
The limb hanger and pole should not be used for hanging the multi-funnel trap. The branch 
should be alive and sturdy (> 2” diameter), as smaller or dead branches could snap under the 
weight of the trap. An arborist throw weight (12, 14, or 16 oz.) can be tied to one end of the rope. 
Take care to clear the rope from all lower branches so that the trap can be pulled up and down 
like an elevator when servicing. The rope should have a clear path to the ground. The trap may 
need to be raised and lowered at an angle from the tree to accomplish this. Give yourself enough 
slack so

Take care to clear the rope from all lower branches so that the trap can be pulled up and down 
like an elevator when servicing. The rope should have a clear path to the ground. The trap may 
need to be raised and lowered at an angle from the tree to accomplish this. Give yourself enough 
slack so that you can tie the rope to an adjacent tree. 
 
A bowline knot, similar to the one shown here is the preferred method: 
(http://wow.uscgaux.info/content.php?unit=081-07-04&category=knots-know-how)   
 
Using these knots, tie the rope to two points on each trap. For the multi-funnel trap these points 
are the top metal hanger and one of the three holes on the bottom funnel used for peg attachment. 
The knot is important as high winds will sometimes cause the traps to come down if the knots are 
not tied properly. 
 
When hanging the traps try to rest the top of the trap against the bottom of the tree limb. This 
should prevent the rope from twisting on itself. When attaching the collection cup, take care to 
make sure that it is securely attached to the bottom funnel.

Prior to raising the trap in the tree, fill the cup with approximately 2 inches of propylene glycol 
(RV antifreeze; usually pink in color). Do NOT use any product containing ethanol as products 
containing this will evaporate over time, especially in hot, dry climates or under drought 
conditions. Propylene glycol should not be diluted with water prior to filling the cup as it will be

Once the trap is hoisted, tie it off to a tree (the one the trap is hanging from will work for this). 
Take care when tying this rope off to place it out of the reach of children or others who may 
want to pull it down. 
 
Trap checking: When checking the multi-funnel trap, the contents of the trap should be poured 
through a paper filter. A paper cone paint strainer is the preferred method (Fig. 8), although a 
coffee filter may also work but will retain more moisture. The strainer should then be placed 
inside a leak proof plastic bag. While wire closed bags (e.g., Whirlpaks) are the preferred 
method, a plastic zipper (e.g., Ziploc) bag will also work. Please make sure to label and seal the 
bag completely to prevent leaks. A small amount, such as one teaspoon, of ethanol may be added 
to the bag to help preserve the specimens for sorting in the lab. As long as the liquid in the cup is 
still pink, and does not smell too badly, it can be reused instead of discarded during traps checks. 
Place a propylene glycol collection container under the filter when pouring out the sample.

A (Z)-3-hexanol lure pouch should be hung from the lower loop of the prism trap spreader or 
from one of the holes used for peg attachment near the top of the multi-funnel trap with a small 
plastic cable tie. The lure should be changed before its expiration in 60 days. 
 
Trap and Lure Handling, Transport, and Storage: 
EAB Program managers have worked closely with the APHIS PPQ Safety and Health Managers 
and the trap and lure manufacturers to develop protocols for the safe handling, transport, and 
storage of our traps and lures. The green multi-funnel trap is coated with a fluoropolymer resin 
commonly referred to as “fluon”. EAB Program uses manufacturer pre-treated “fluon” traps only 
for program use. This slippery resin may be an irritant to some which can be negated through the 
use of nitrile gloves during handling. Eye protection, such as vented splash goggles and face 
shield, should be worn while raising the trap into position in order to avoid any propylene glycol 
spillage contacting the eyes. The (Z)-3-hexanol lure pouches emit odors and volatiles which pose 
safety and health concerns in confined spaces. Prior to deployment, lures must be kept cold at all 
times by storing in a freezer. During transport, lures must be kept in coolers with cold packs or

times by storing in a freezer. During transport, lures must be kept in coolers with cold packs or 
ice and stored in isolation from the vehicle’s cab, or, as an alternative, kept in coolers with screw 
top lids that also must be chilled with cold packs or ice. Coolers should be labeled “NOT FOR 
FOOD OR BEVERAGE USE”. To avoid skin irritation during handling, gloves may be worn. 
During handling of lure, open down-wind in an open well-ventilated environment. Additional 
information and precautions can be found in a Job Hazard Assessment and Safety Data Sheets for 
“fluon”, propylene glycol, and the (Z)-3-hexanol lure pouches in each sites specific Safety Data 
Sheet manual. Contact your local APHIS PPQ Safety Coordinator or supervisor for more details.

Trap and Sign Placement: Traps must be placed in ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). If possible, ash 
trees should be 8” or greater in diameter with larger or largest ash tree in a stand of trees located 
along edges, in open areas, or in open stands such as in parks within the grid cell. Traps should 
be placed in the lower to mid canopy, but with the bottom edge of the trap no lower than five feet 
above the ground. They should be placed on the sunny side of the tree, most typically, the south 
or southwest side.

be placed in the lower to mid canopy, but with the bottom edge of the trap no lower than five feet 
above the ground. They should be placed on the sunny side of the tree, most typically, the south 
or southwest side. 
 
Trap Maintenance: The lure will last approximately 60 days and should be replaced just prior to 
expiration. Multi-funnel traps should be checked every two-three weeks and any insects that are 
captured should be collected. When reattaching cups, please make sure that all pegs are securely 
locked in place as they may come loose under some weather conditions. 
 
Trap Disposition: Multi-funnel traps are designed to be used over several field seasons. At the 
end of the season, the collection cups may be gently scrubbed, and dirt may be wiped away from 
funnels with a cloth, take care not to remove too much of the slippery Fluon coating. Traps will 
collapse into a smaller form for storage and subsequent reuse. 
 
Screening for Suspect Buprestidae and Specimen Submission 
Any suspect Buprestidae adult or suspect EAB adult specimen collected from a trap in a non-
quarantined county should be placed in a dry vial. If the specimen is from a purple prism trap, use 
the sticky compound from the trap to stick the specimen to the side of the vial and/or gently pad 
with soft tissue placed into the vial on top of the specimen(s) to prevent damage during shipping. 
Sorted specimens collected from Lindgren traps should be placed in a vial and gently padded with 
soft tissue placed into the vial on top of the specimen(s) to prevent damage

Data Management Structure: 
APHIS wants to make it clear that the national “Integrated Plant Health Information System” 
(IPHIS) is not required as a field data collection tool, however operationally specific data is of 
great importance and therefore APHIS has designated the IPHIS application to be utilized as the 
final holding tank or centralized database for EAB data. 
 
IPHIS requires internet access, USDA eAuthentication credentials, and approved access to an 
IPHIS or cooperator office. If you need USDA eAuthentication USDA employees should contact 
their supervisors, and all other cooperators should work through their State Plant Regulatory 
Official and State Plant Health Director. 
 
After receiving network access, eAuthentication credentials and IPHIS access, users can log into 
the system and utilize two types of data entry methods. These include the IPHIS web interface 
and an Excel spreadsheet to upload files. The AllInOne Excel spreadsheet upload file, for initial 
trap installations and omits, is also available here. 
 
Please use the IPHIS template “EAB Natl Survey” for capturing EAB trapping and omit data. 
 
Note: IPHIS can now receive unlimited uploaded records in a spreadsheet. 
 
The data fields created for the 2012 through 2019 EAB surveys are also used in the EAB survey. 
APHIS does not ask surveyors to collect symptom data, and the fields for diameter at breast 
height (DBH) and trap height are optional. Additional optional fields include: (1) site type 
categories and additional free text, (2) a field for assigned locations with no trap placement, 
including omitted and declined locations, and (3) fields to record omit reasons for assigned grids

categories and additional free text, (2) a field for assigned locations with no trap placement, 
including omitted and declined locations, and (3) fields to record omit reasons for assigned grids 
and comments. 
 
Please record the state’s assigned grid number as IPHIS’ Location Name; the IPHIS site name can 
also be assigned this value. Traps placed outside assigned grid number cell locations should use 
the following naming convention for location name: 
 
2 letters for state designation + 3 letters for surveyor’s initials + 3 digit sequential trap number 
(e.g., IAJAD003 for Iowa, John A. Doe, Trap 3). 
 
The state’s sequential trap number begins with 001 for the first trap not having an assigned 
grid number and increases by one for each additional trap; second trap is 002, the third is 003 
and so on. 
 
For consistency with other state trapping programs, we encourage users to use existing 
procedures and tools for recording data in the field. A field data form for the manual recording of 
USDA APHIS PPQ 23  
data is in Appendix D. Organizations using paper, spreadsheets, or third party software can enter 
data directly into the web interface or “bulk” upload data from the Excel spreadsheet using the 
web upload tool. 
 
It is very important for survey personnel to upload data every other week throughout the 
season!

Communication: 
The risk-based survey sampling design continues to determine trap dispersal. A variety of 
materials will be developed to facilitate communication and understanding among key audiences 
who include Federal, State, and Tribal partners, survey cooperators and contractors, the media, 
and the public at large. Materials will include but are not limited to key messages, talking points, 
and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s). 
 
The highly visible purple prism traps and Lindgren green multi-funnel traps generate curiosity 
which often results in public questions and media inquiries. Individuals involved in the actual 
placement and maintenance of traps should be conversant with survey messages and understand 
media protocols. Furthermore, the EAB survey provides an opportunity to communicate other 
program messages addressing control, regulation, and the human-assisted spread of the pest. 
Communication staff and program personnel should also be broadly familiar with the core 
program messages about these issues. 
 
Outreach & Education: 
The active participation of target audiences to assist in preventing the spread of emerald ash borer 
throughout the United States is critical. Outreach is an integral element of the EAB Program 
supporting regulatory, survey, and control.—It is a basic task for all program staff and a value-

added opportunity for each personal encounter, engagement, or exchange. Formal strategic 
communication and outreach campaigns targeting industries that move regulated material should 
be implemented together with public awareness campaigns designed to provide education to 
citizens about the dangers of moving infested host materials such as firewood. Since the beetle is 
difficult to detect, the more people trained to identify EAB symptoms or damage and report 
suspects, the greater the opportunity for successful outcomes. Outreach activities encourage the 
public to recognize and report possible beetle damage in their area as well as suspected incidents 
of quarantine violations.

Appendix A. Details of Survey Sampling Design Construction. 
 
The EAB survey employs a computer-generated risk assessment product to guide the 
deployment of detection tools in a way which results in the following benefits: 
 
 increase the number of successful EAB detections outside the known infested area 
 improve land managers capability of detecting EAB close to the date of a new attack 
 find locations that are best suited to implement biological control 
 
The EAB risk assessment model was developed using a combination of statistical models for 
predicting where EAB was most likely to be detected. This is a major change in modeling procedure 
from years prior to 2016, which employed the MaxEnt statistical model, which used only positive 
detections for EAB. Given the last few years of nationally consistent data collection which reports 
both positive and negative detections, APHIS upgraded the models to utilize that information in order

 where EAB was most likely to be detected. This is a major change in modeling procedure 
from years prior to 2016, which employed the MaxEnt statistical model, which used only positive 
detections for EAB. Given the last few years of nationally consistent data collection which reports 
both positive and negative detections, APHIS upgraded the models to utilize that information in order 
to avoid some major statistical assumptions regarding the data, and discovered that all the models 
concurred in predicting risk in the known infested area but differed widely in extrapolating that risk 
to outside the infested area. This is consistent with knowledge concerning the difficulty of pest 
detection, so an “ensemble” of the models was created to mitigate model uncertainty between 
statistical platforms. There were two model applications for each statistical platform, both using all 
2011-2017 trap data: one model included the distance from any prior year positive trap as a predictor 
variable (modeling active spread) and one model did not include distance from prior detections as a 
predictor variable (modeling full geographic potential). 
 
EAB is an actively spreading pest and a false negative could be reported for two reasons: 1) the 
location is suitable but not yet infested, or 2) the pest is present but undetected. Utilizing negative trap 
location could be too restrictive in the model fitting process because of the potential for false 
negatives. While MaxEnt demonstrates flexibility regarding the “potential” of locations of having a 
pest present, we found that MaxEnt’s default assumption of pest prevalence (EAB can occupy up to 
50% of the landscape) caused great overestimation of risk compared to models that utilized actual 
absence information. Since the EAB risk assessment model is updated each year, APHIS is

 the “potential” of locations of having a 
pest present, we found that MaxEnt’s default assumption of pest prevalence (EAB can occupy up to 
50% of the landscape) caused great overestimation of risk compared to models that utilized actual 
absence information. Since the EAB risk assessment model is updated each year, APHIS is mitigating 
the issue by allowing the model to update with new information as the pest invades new 
environmental gradients. 
 
Four parameters were required to run the models. These were: 
1) the dependent detection data from the APHIS IPHIS dataset (2011-2018), which consists of both 
negative and positive trap data 
2) selected independent variables that correlate with the presence of EAB 
3) a defined geographic area of interest. 
4) modeled negative trap data limited to traps within 60 km of a positive trap. 
 
The independent variables were selected in the previous year using the following sources: 
1. scientific literature 
2. expert opinion 
3. anecdotal evidence 
4. correlation analyses 
5. preliminary statistical analyses. 
USDA APHIS PPQ 25  
Dissemination of trap resources is thus determined by this EAB risk assessment model, combined 
with a spatially balanced sample design. The model has a known inclusion probability for every 
grid cell and provides an objective and transparent methodology for selecting trap locations. Since 
we are utilizing an ensemble model which is actually a percentage of model agreement of pest 
presence (rather than risk of pest presence like in previous years), the sample design will utilize 
this ranking of model agreement as the inclusion probability surface. The sampling design 
increases spatial independence among sample locations and therefore, maximizes sampling 
efficiency and provides the most information available per sample unit
