A revised Standard that takes into account the discussions of the Panel will be prepared and sent for a new country consultation. PM7/NEW Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv . poinsettiae The Panel reviewed and discussed the first draft of the Diagnostic Protocol. A revised Diagnostic Protocol that takes into account the discussions of the Panel will be prepared and sent to the Panel for approval before it is sent for country consultation. PM7/NEW Xanthomonas phaseoli and Xanthomonas citri pv . fuscans The Panel reviewed and discussed the first draft of the Diagnostic Protocol. A revised Diagnostic Protocol that takes into account the discussions of the Panel will be prepared and sent to the Panel for approval before it is sent for country consultation. Plans for future new diagnostic protocols A proposal was made to develop a new Diagnostic Protocol on Xanthomonas translucens pv. translucens , a pest whose main hosts are domesticated and wild barley ( Hordeum vulgare, Hordeum marinum ), but occasional asymptomatic isolation from wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and rye ( Secale cereale ) have been recently reported. The Panel agreed to discuss again the need to develop a Diagnostic Protocol on Xanthomonas translucens pv. translucens at their next meeting. Plans for future revisions The Panel discussed the need to revise the published EPPO Standards and Diagnostic Protocols in Bacteriology. It was agreed that the following EPPO Diagnostic Protocols should be revised: PM 7/021 Ralstonia solanacearum, R. pseudosolanacearum and R. syzygii,

ens at their next meeting. Plans for future revisions The Panel discussed the need to revise the published EPPO Standards and Diagnostic Protocols in Bacteriology. It was agreed that the following EPPO Diagnostic Protocols should be revised: PM 7/021 Ralstonia solanacearum, R. pseudosolanacearum and R. syzygii, PM 7/042 Clavibacter michiganensis subsp . michiganensis , and PM 7/121 ' Candidatus Liberibacter africanus’, ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter americanus’ and ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’. Other topics Discussions of the EPPO Secretariat with the European co-operation for Accreditation An online meeting between the EPPO Secretariat and the European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) was organized at the beginning of December 2023. Guidelines will be developed and sent to the EA in 2024. The EPPO Secretariat will contact the EPPO Panels on diagnostics (all disciplines) to identify the experts to be involved in the drafting of the guidelines. Brainstoming on the terms detection and identification The Panel brainstormed on the use of the terms detection and identification in bacteriology. The brainstorming, organised with all EPPO Panels on Diagnostics, aims to harmonise the terminology across the disciplines and to simplify the Diagnostic Protocols. EPPO Databases on diagnostics The Panel received an update on the EPPO Database on Diagnostic Expertise and on EPPO-Q-bank. A proposal was made to consider a new barcode mutS and include it in EPPO-Q-bank and in the EPPO Diagnostic Protocol PM 7/129 DNA barcoding as an identification tool for a number of regulated pests.

A proposal was made to consider a new barcode mutS and include it in EPPO-Q-bank and in the EPPO Diagnostic Protocol PM 7/129 DNA barcoding as an identification tool for a number of regulated pests. Euphresco The most recent Euphresco research projects on bacteriology were presented. The Panel was also informed about the EU funding that Euphresco received to develop into a global network (EUPHRESCO III project). Next Panel meeting The next meeting of the Panel on Diagnostics in Bacteriology will be held at the end of 2025 in France.
