Gill. et Hook. ex Hook. (Euphorbiaceae), a nativeshrub of Patagonia Argentina and Chile, produces seeds with high drying oilcontent and is being evaluated as a potential new crop for this region.
Natural populations of this species from three different locations inPatagonia, Argentina were studied in order to assess seed production, oilcontent and quality of different type of seeds.

The adaptation of this species to temperate semi-deserts,together with other features such as seed attachment to the mother plant, theease with which dormancy can be broken by chilling or storage, and thepossibility of asexual propagation by rhizome cuttings, increase the interestand possibilities of domestication and cultivation of the species.

A number of agave species have been cultivated throughout the world for sometime.  Notable among these are
Agave sisalana
, grown in plantations inAfrica Asia and Brazil as a source of sisal fiber
Agave fourcroydes,
grown in Mexico and the Caribbean Islands, providing henequen fiber;
Agavetequilana
in Mexico for tequila liquor, and various species for productionof hecogenin and smilagenin, pharmaceutical steroidal sapogenins.
Several multi-hectare agave plantations have been established in SouthernArizona since 1980 to evaluate growth potential of both native and introducedagave species under desert conditions.  This is the first extensive evaluationof agave as a row crop in the United States.  With one or two supplementalirrigations at the Marana Agricultural Center, several agave species achievedbiomass accumulations greater than 100 kg over a three-

This is the first extensive evaluationof agave as a row crop in the United States.  With one or two supplementalirrigations at the Marana Agricultural Center, several agave species achievedbiomass accumulations greater than 100 kg over a three-year growth period.Infra-red thermal measurements indicated that all species showed CAM metabolismunder periods of high temperature stress (in excess of 40°C) with adapteddesert species responding more quickly to irrigation than introduced tropicalspecies.  Root and crown tissues of
A. americana,
the fastest growingspecies tested, contained 50% carbohydrate on a dry weight basis, which wouldqualify them as a viable botanical ethanol source.  HPLC analyses of steroidcontent of these species are underway, as are fiber analyses.  In summary,these data support agave as a potential multi-use crop for the and Southwest.Ability to grow with less than 30 cm rainfall per year makes agave a low inputcrop adaptable to large areas of this region presently not under cultivation.

Rapid, pestfree growth of 10 t/ha-yr of dry wood make it suitable for energy croppingunder a short-rotation coppicing system.  The tallow tree bears seed after 3years with yields of up to 12 t/ha-yr from mature wild trees.  The seedscontain a saturated solid fat, or tallow, on the outside and an unsaturatedliquid inside the kernel.  Commercial and industrial raw materials obtainablefrom the seed are fuel oil drying oil, surfactants, soaps, emulsifiers, cocoabutter, seed meal, confections, detergents, and bioactive extracts.  Othereconomic benefits are as a forage crop for honey production, firewood, soilreclamation, and ornamental planting.
