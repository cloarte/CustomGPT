 Invasion: A. squamosa, a small deciduous tree about 3-5(-6) m tall, produces its first branches near the base of the trunk. The branches are irregularly spreading and the young growth is densely pubescent (Leon, 1917;Carangal et al., 1961). The leaves are alternate, ovate-oblong or elliptic-oblong, thin, sparsely downy, dark green above, 8-15 cm long and 2-5 cm wide. When young, leaves are pubescent and give a peculiar smell when crushed (Troup et al., 1975). The petiole is about 1.0-1.5 cm long (Coronel, 1983). The small, pendulous flowers occur singly or in pairs in the leaf axils of young shoots or opposite the leaves. The pedicel is 1.5-2.5 cm long and hairy. The three sepals are short, deciduous, densely or thinly pubescent, and 0.2-0.3 cm long. The 6 petals are biseriate. The three outer petals are lanceolate, thick, fleshy, trigonous, finely pubescent, yellowish-green on the outside, yellowish-white inside, 2.0-2.5 cm long and 0.5-1.0 cm wide. The three inner petals alternate

2-0.3 cm long. The 6 petals are biseriate. The three outer petals are lanceolate, thick, fleshy, trigonous, finely pubescent, yellowish-green on the outside, yellowish-white inside, 2.0-2.5 cm long and 0.5-1.0 cm wide. The three inner petals alternate with the outer ones and are minute, sometimes absent, ovate and never more than 0.1 cm long. The stamens are numerous, yellowish-white in many rows on the glabrous, raised receptacle (torus), 0.12-0.15 cm long and crowded in a whorl around the gynoecium. The pistils are also numerous, dark violet, finely pubescent, and are found above the stamens. The stigmas are sessile, stuck together, and deciduous. The stamens and pistils form a cone-shaped structure at the centre of the flower (Coronel, 1983). The fruit is a syncarp developed from the fusion of numerous ovaries. It is irregularly heart-shaped, about 5-20 cm in diameter. The exterior is marked by polygonal tubercles which correspond to the fused carpels from which the fruit is formed. The ripe fruit is light yellowish-green or purple and the exterior readily separates along the lines between the tubercles. The flesh is white, soft and juicy with a mild, agreeable flavour. The numerous seeds are obovoid or elliptic, dark brown or black, shiny, slightly compressed, 1.0-1.5 cm long and 0.5-0.8 cm wide, and each is enclosed in the edible pulp.

 Reproduccion: There are some recognized cultivars of sugar apple, most of these being in India, their names giving an idea of their origin as introductions: ‘Mammoth’, ‘Barbados’, ‘British Guinea’, ‘Balondegar’, ‘Red Sitaphal’, and ‘Sindhan’, the last being local to Gujarat, and a dwarf cultivar, ‘Lal Sitiphal’ ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). Three forms of A. squamosa exist in the Philippines, a green-fruited seeded form grown in most parts of the country, a purple-fruited seeded form reportedly introduced from India ( Galang, 1955 ) and a seedless green-fruited form whose origin is unknown. It is the green-fruited seeded form from which selection of superior strains is advised ( Coronel, 1983 ); however, to date there has been very little selection of superior seedlings. Sugar apple ( A. squamosa ) and cherimoya ( A. reticulata ) were hybridized by PJ Webster in 1907 in Florida, USA, producing a new fruit called atemoya.

Sugar apple ( A. squamosa ) and cherimoya ( A. reticulata ) were hybridized by PJ Webster in 1907 in Florida, USA, producing a new fruit called atemoya. Crossing also occurred naturally in the field in Australia in 1850 and again in Palestine in 1930, and the hybrid is in commercial production in Australia (where it is confusingly called custard apple), as well as the USA, Israel, South Africa, the Philippines and numerous parts of Central and South America. This hybrid is preferred because there appears to be no pollination difficulties ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). A. squamosa can regenerate rapidly by seed or asexual propagation. The seeds stay viable for some, and 90-95% germination occurs 20-30 days after sowing if the seeds are freshly harvested ( Miraflores, 1915 ; Paguirigan, 1951 ; Galang, 1955 ). A. squamosa can also be propagated by stem cuttings using healthy branches of matured wood during the dormant period ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961). Wester (1912) observed that the fruitfulness of A. squamosa in the Philippines is due to the presence of certain species of coleopterous insects which abound there and pollinate the flowers. A. squamosa begins to bear fruit 2-4 years after planting, but the yield per tree is usually very low, on average 40-75 fruits per year ( Cabbab and Soliven, 1938 ). Fruits are considered mature when the skin between the segments has turned greenish-yellow to creamy-yellow. Fruits left to ripen on the tree are eaten by birds and bats, and the fruit has a tendency to burst open on the tree if left to overmature. The fruits mature

 low, on average 40-75 fruits per year ( Cabbab and Soliven, 1938 ). Fruits are considered mature when the skin between the segments has turned greenish-yellow to creamy-yellow. Fruits left to ripen on the tree are eaten by birds and bats, and the fruit has a tendency to burst open on the tree if left to overmature. The fruits mature at irregular intervals over a period of about 3 months and are harvested as they mature. Fully mature fruits ripen 2-5 days after harvest and they should be eaten as soon as they ripen because they are perishable ( Gonzalez, 1934 ; Ochse et al., 1961; Viñas, 1972 ). A. squamosa grows in the open or in partly shaded areas. When young, it requires shaded areas and at a later stage full overhead light for vigorous growth. It can withstand drought as it has deciduous growth characteristics during dry periods. In India, fruit set takes place after the commencement of the rainy season (Thakur and Singh, 1965, 1967). Those fruits that are set during the summer will generally dry up from high temperatures and low relative humidity. Fruit set during summer may be increased by irrigating the trees and providing shade. Fruit growth of green-fruited and red-fruited A. squamosa is rapid from August to mid-September. Afterwards it gradually slows down in the red-fruited form. The growth rate of the green-fruited form, however, still increases into October, after which it slows down and ceases by mid-November (Thakur and Singh, 1965). In Florida, the fruiting season begins in mid summer (wet season) with irregular ripening lasting 3 months. In the Philippines, fruiting occurs during the beginning of the rainy season (summer) and in India, fruiting also occurs in the wet season (August to mid September) and can occur

In the Philippines, fruiting occurs during the beginning of the rainy season (summer) and in India, fruiting also occurs in the wet season (August to mid September) and can occur from October to November (the end of the wet season) ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). In Mexico, flowering occurs at the end of the dry season (March to May) with fruiting at the end of the wet season (September to November). In Brazil, flowering occurs at the end of the dry season (March to May) and fruiting in the wet season (December to January) ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). A. squamosa thrives well in warm and humid tropical and subtropical lowlands below 1000-1200 m altitude ( Paguirigan, 1951 ; Galang, 1955 ; Viñas, 1972 ), and is relatively drought-tolerant but does not fruit well in high rainfall regimes. While it is less tender than some of its relatives, it cannot cope with freezing temperatures or prolonged periods of cold weather ( Noonan, 1953 ). It can, however, withstand drought well and can be grown successfully in areas with a prolonged dry season ( Verkataratanam and Satyanaranaswamy, 1956 ; Cantillang, 1976 ). Its deciduous growth habit contributes to its drought resistance because it does not have leaves during the majority of months in the dry season. Dry weather during the flowering season seems to be preferable, but fruits are frequently set at the beginning of the rainy season ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961).

 the majority of months in the dry season. Dry weather during the flowering season seems to be preferable, but fruits are frequently set at the beginning of the rainy season ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961). A. squamosa is not demanding in its soil requirements, perhaps being the most adaptable of the Annona species, as it can tolerate wind and dry climates as well as infertile, sandy, and limestone soil so long as it is well-drained (Staples and Herbst, 2005; Paraguay Checklist, 2015 ). It cannot tolerate waterlogging for any length of time. A. squamosa grows well on sands, sandy or silty loams, and clays. However, consistently higher yields appear to be obtained from trees grown on sandy loams ( Coronel, 1983 ; Verheij and Coronel, 1991 ). The root system is relatively shallow, so that it does not require very deep soil. Like most other fruit crops, it prefers slightly acidic soil conditions with a pH of 5.5-6.5 ( Coronel, 1983 ) and can tolerate mild salinity ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). Elevation range for the species is generally low. In North America it has been reported growing between 0-50 m ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2015 ) and 0-100 m in Panama ( Panama Checklist, 2014 ), while in the lowland rainforests of Bolivia it grows between 0-500 m ( Bolivia Checklist, 2015 ), and along coastal regions of Ecuador between 0-500 m ( Vascular Plants of Ecuador, 2015 ). Similarly, in Nicaragua the species is cultivated in lowland parts of the Pacific region between 30-145 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2015 ). In Colombia the species has been reported at slightly higher altitudes of 500-1000 m in moist tropical forest ( Vascular Plants of Antioquia, 2015 ). A. squamosa thri

The flowers, borne singly or in pairs in the leaf axils on stalks 1 to 1 1/2 in (2.5-4 cm) long, are clasped by a 3-parted calyx and have 3 triangular, thick, waxy, velvety, whitish outer petals, 3 pale-yellow inner petals, and numerous stamens.  Typically compound, the pineapple-scented fruit is smooth but with the carpers distinctly outlined on the surface; yellow or orange when ripe; rounded oval; 1 to 4 in (2.5-10 cm) long; fleshy; seedy.
Origin and Distribution
This species is native and common in savannas throughout tropical Africa from the Cape Verde Islands and the Nile and Upper Guinea to the Transvaal and Zululand.  It is little-known outside its natural range.  It was long ago introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture into Florida as a potential rootstock for related species, and into Puerto Rico in 1924 and again in 1925 and grown at the Insular Experiment Station, Rio Piedras.  According to G.L. Cruz (1979), verbatim from his 1965 publication (see Bibliography), it has become well established as

According to G.L. Cruz (1979), verbatim from his 1965 publication (see Bibliography), it has become well established as
araticum da areia
in Brazil, especially around Minas Gerais, Bahia and Espirito Santo, but he describes the fruit as rough-surfaced and 8 to 12 in (20-30 cm) in diameter, so he must have it confused with some other species unless there is great variation among seedlings.
Varieties
The botanical variety,
deltoides
, with elliptic to oblongelliptic leaves, rounded to broadly deltoid at the base, is the most common form in Ghana.  Eggeling mentions a variety
porpetac
in Uganda with oblong-elliptic, ovalelliptic or elliptic leaves, rounded-obtuse or broadly cuneate at the base.  There is reportedly a dwarf form, the fruits of which are borne so low they touch the ground, and are of better quality than those of taller types.
Climate
The wild custard apple is limited to tropical areas up to an elevation of 5,000 ft (1,500 m) and thrives best where its roots can reach water.  It remains leafless for several months in the dry season.
Food Uses
The fruit pulp is edible and said to have an apricot-like flavor.  Williamson quotes an unidentified source as saying that it is one of the best of the indigenous fruits in parts of tropical Africa.  It is much appreciated in the wild by shepherds.  According to Irvine, the unopened flower buds are used in soup and to season native dishes; and

It is much appreciated in the wild by shepherds.  According to Irvine, the unopened flower buds are used in soup and to season native dishes; and the leaves are eaten.
Food Value
The dried leaves contain 8.2% protein.
Other Uses
Fruit:
The green fruit, because of its high tannin content, is made into ink.
Leaves:
Fresh leaves are employed as fodder for domestic animals.  Boiled leaves serve as native perfume, and dried leaves are used as filling for mattresses.
Wood:
The soft, grayish wood is fashioned into hoe handles and employed in building huts.
Ashes:
The wood ashes are used in making soap and native snuff.
Bark and roots:
The bark yields a yellow or brown dye.  It is pounded in water and the liquid is then used as a hair dressing.  A poor-quality fiber derived from the bark is made into rope for tying fences.  A combination of the bark and roots serves as an insecticide, and the root has been used for homicidal purposes.  The irritant, gummy sap of the bark is an adhesive for arrow poison.  There are many superstitious uses of the various parts of the plant.
Medicinal Uses:
Fresh fruits in quantity and dried fruits are applied on Guinea worm sores.  The parched green fruits are taken to relieve diarrhea and dysentery.  A tea of the young leafy twigs or of the roots is taken to alleviate pulmonary complaints.  An infusion of the leaves is a popular eye lotion.

A tea of the young leafy twigs or of the roots is taken to alleviate pulmonary complaints.  An infusion of the leaves is a popular eye lotion.  Dried, powdered leaves are regarded as purgative and as a remedy for mucous diarrhea.  With quantities of water, the pulverized leaves are given to horses to expel worms.  Combined with the roots and bark and other materials, they are said to be effective in treating yaws in horses.  The leaves also enter into a tonic for horses.  Venereal diseases and intestinal disorders are treated with preparations of the roots.  The bark is chewed to relieve stomachache.  It is an emetic and a vermifuge and is given to overcome convulsions in children.  The bark infusion, held in the mouth, relieves toothache.  In the Upper Volta, an ointment made from the bark is applied on burns.  Bark and roots together will halt dysentery, expel worms, and are part of a remedy for sleeping sickness.  The root infusion is employed as eye drops.  Charcoal of the burned roots is applied on twitching eyelids.  The root bark is considered an antidote for snakebite and is used by Nigerian medicine men as a cancer remedy.  Investigations have revealed antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 ascites, and antibiotic activity.  The trunk bark contains alkaloids, including 0.02% anonaine, also tannins and saponins.  The leaves contain rutin, quercetin and quercetrin.

.  It grows wild from sea-level to 2, 000 ft (650 m) throughout the West Indies and southward into Peru and Brazil, and is cultivated in the Philippines and rarely in Florida.
The tree somewhat resembles that of the soursop but has a more spreading crown and very glossy leaves.  It is slightly hardier and bears more or less continuously.  The fruit is nearly round or broad-ovoid, to 6 in (15 cm) long.  Its dark-green skin is studded with numerous short, fleshy ";spines";.  It becomes very soft and falls when ripe.  The pulp is yellow, peculiarly aromatic, sour to subacid and bitter, fibrous, and contains many light-brown, plump seeds.  The quality is variable but generally very poor.

The fruit is generally regarded as inedible but is referred to as ";edible but mediocre"; in Brazil.  There, the firm core attached to the base of the peduncle is pulled out and eaten as a tidbit.  In southern Florida, exotic parrots eat the fruits and scatter the seeds, and a few trees are consequently occurring as escapes.  The tree is of minor interest to horticulturists as an ornamental and rootstock.  The wood is soft, fibrous and useful only as fuel.
The pond apple,
A. glabra
L. (syn.
A. palustris
L.), is also called alligator apple, monkey apple, custard apple, corkwood,
mamon de perro, cayur, cayuda
, and various other colloquial names.  It grows wild in the Florida Everglades and in coastal swamps and marshes of the Bahamas and throughout the West Indies, in southern Mexico, Central America, and southward into Peru and Argentine; also on the coast of West Tropical Africa.  It is occasionally planted in southern Florida and has been introduced into Malaya and the Philippines.
The tree may reach 45 ft (13.5 m), is rather open and spreading; may become very thick at the base; has glossy, leathery, deciduous leaves.  The fruit is oval or heartshaped, to 5 in (12.5 cm) long with thin, faintly reticulated, glossy yellow skin and salmon-colored, resinous, subacid, dryish pulp containing many light-brown, flattened-oval, longitudinally-winged seeds that float on water.

The fruit is oval or heartshaped, to 5 in (12.5 cm) long with thin, faintly reticulated, glossy yellow skin and salmon-colored, resinous, subacid, dryish pulp containing many light-brown, flattened-oval, longitudinally-winged seeds that float on water.  When fully ripe and soft, the pulp is edible and some specimens are of fair quality and have been made into jelly or wine.  The pond apple is of value as a ";survival"; food in extremity and of great importance as fare for wild creatures.  Fishermen fashion the light, corklike wood into floats.  The leaf decoction is a common, multipurpose folk remedy in the Netherlands Antilles, Mexico and South America.  Seedlings are useful as rootstock for other Annona species in wet soils.

 Invasion: A. squamosa, a small deciduous tree about 3-5(-6) m tall, produces its first branches near the base of the trunk. The branches are irregularly spreading and the young growth is densely pubescent (Leon, 1917;Carangal et al., 1961). The leaves are alternate, ovate-oblong or elliptic-oblong, thin, sparsely downy, dark green above, 8-15 cm long and 2-5 cm wide. When young, leaves are pubescent and give a peculiar smell when crushed (Troup et al., 1975). The petiole is about 1.0-1.5 cm long (Coronel, 1983). The small, pendulous flowers occur singly or in pairs in the leaf axils of young shoots or opposite the leaves. The pedicel is 1.5-2.5 cm long and hairy. The three sepals are short, deciduous, densely or thinly pubescent, and 0.2-0.3 cm long. The 6 petals are biseriate. The three outer petals are lanceolate, thick, fleshy, trigonous, finely pubescent, yellowish-green on the outside, yellowish-white inside, 2.0-2.5 cm long and 0.5-1.0 cm wide. The three inner petals alternate

2-0.3 cm long. The 6 petals are biseriate. The three outer petals are lanceolate, thick, fleshy, trigonous, finely pubescent, yellowish-green on the outside, yellowish-white inside, 2.0-2.5 cm long and 0.5-1.0 cm wide. The three inner petals alternate with the outer ones and are minute, sometimes absent, ovate and never more than 0.1 cm long. The stamens are numerous, yellowish-white in many rows on the glabrous, raised receptacle (torus), 0.12-0.15 cm long and crowded in a whorl around the gynoecium. The pistils are also numerous, dark violet, finely pubescent, and are found above the stamens. The stigmas are sessile, stuck together, and deciduous. The stamens and pistils form a cone-shaped structure at the centre of the flower (Coronel, 1983). The fruit is a syncarp developed from the fusion of numerous ovaries. It is irregularly heart-shaped, about 5-20 cm in diameter. The exterior is marked by polygonal tubercles which correspond to the fused carpels from which the fruit is formed. The ripe fruit is light yellowish-green or purple and the exterior readily separates along the lines between the tubercles. The flesh is white, soft and juicy with a mild, agreeable flavour. The numerous seeds are obovoid or elliptic, dark brown or black, shiny, slightly compressed, 1.0-1.5 cm long and 0.5-0.8 cm wide, and each is enclosed in the edible pulp.

 Reproduccion: There are some recognized cultivars of sugar apple, most of these being in India, their names giving an idea of their origin as introductions: ‘Mammoth’, ‘Barbados’, ‘British Guinea’, ‘Balondegar’, ‘Red Sitaphal’, and ‘Sindhan’, the last being local to Gujarat, and a dwarf cultivar, ‘Lal Sitiphal’ ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). Three forms of A. squamosa exist in the Philippines, a green-fruited seeded form grown in most parts of the country, a purple-fruited seeded form reportedly introduced from India ( Galang, 1955 ) and a seedless green-fruited form whose origin is unknown. It is the green-fruited seeded form from which selection of superior strains is advised ( Coronel, 1983 ); however, to date there has been very little selection of superior seedlings. Sugar apple ( A. squamosa ) and cherimoya ( A. reticulata ) were hybridized by PJ Webster in 1907 in Florida, USA, producing a new fruit called atemoya.

Sugar apple ( A. squamosa ) and cherimoya ( A. reticulata ) were hybridized by PJ Webster in 1907 in Florida, USA, producing a new fruit called atemoya. Crossing also occurred naturally in the field in Australia in 1850 and again in Palestine in 1930, and the hybrid is in commercial production in Australia (where it is confusingly called custard apple), as well as the USA, Israel, South Africa, the Philippines and numerous parts of Central and South America. This hybrid is preferred because there appears to be no pollination difficulties ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). A. squamosa can regenerate rapidly by seed or asexual propagation. The seeds stay viable for some, and 90-95% germination occurs 20-30 days after sowing if the seeds are freshly harvested ( Miraflores, 1915 ; Paguirigan, 1951 ; Galang, 1955 ). A. squamosa can also be propagated by stem cuttings using healthy branches of matured wood during the dormant period ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961). Wester (1912) observed that the fruitfulness of A. squamosa in the Philippines is due to the presence of certain species of coleopterous insects which abound there and pollinate the flowers. A. squamosa begins to bear fruit 2-4 years after planting, but the yield per tree is usually very low, on average 40-75 fruits per year ( Cabbab and Soliven, 1938 ). Fruits are considered mature when the skin between the segments has turned greenish-yellow to creamy-yellow. Fruits left to ripen on the tree are eaten by birds and bats, and the fruit has a tendency to burst open on the tree if left to overmature. The fruits mature

 low, on average 40-75 fruits per year ( Cabbab and Soliven, 1938 ). Fruits are considered mature when the skin between the segments has turned greenish-yellow to creamy-yellow. Fruits left to ripen on the tree are eaten by birds and bats, and the fruit has a tendency to burst open on the tree if left to overmature. The fruits mature at irregular intervals over a period of about 3 months and are harvested as they mature. Fully mature fruits ripen 2-5 days after harvest and they should be eaten as soon as they ripen because they are perishable ( Gonzalez, 1934 ; Ochse et al., 1961; Viñas, 1972 ). A. squamosa grows in the open or in partly shaded areas. When young, it requires shaded areas and at a later stage full overhead light for vigorous growth. It can withstand drought as it has deciduous growth characteristics during dry periods. In India, fruit set takes place after the commencement of the rainy season (Thakur and Singh, 1965, 1967). Those fruits that are set during the summer will generally dry up from high temperatures and low relative humidity. Fruit set during summer may be increased by irrigating the trees and providing shade. Fruit growth of green-fruited and red-fruited A. squamosa is rapid from August to mid-September. Afterwards it gradually slows down in the red-fruited form. The growth rate of the green-fruited form, however, still increases into October, after which it slows down and ceases by mid-November (Thakur and Singh, 1965). In Florida, the fruiting season begins in mid summer (wet season) with irregular ripening lasting 3 months. In the Philippines, fruiting occurs during the beginning of the rainy season (summer) and in India, fruiting also occurs in the wet season (August to mid September) and can occur

 slows down and ceases by mid-November (Thakur and Singh, 1965). In Florida, the fruiting season begins in mid summer (wet season) with irregular ripening lasting 3 months. In the Philippines, fruiting occurs during the beginning of the rainy season (summer) and in India, fruiting also occurs in the wet season (August to mid September) and can occur from October to November (the end of the wet season) ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). In Mexico, flowering occurs at the end of the dry season (March to May) with fruiting at the end of the wet season (September to November). In Brazil, flowering occurs at the end of the dry season (March to May) and fruiting in the wet season (December to January) ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). A. squamosa thrives well in warm and humid tropical and subtropical lowlands below 1000-1200 m altitude ( Paguirigan, 1951 ; Galang, 1955 ; Viñas, 1972 ), and is relatively drought-tolerant but does not fruit well in high rainfall regimes. While it is less tender than some of its relatives, it cannot cope with freezing temperatures or prolonged periods of cold weather ( Noonan, 1953 ). It can, however, withstand drought well and can be grown successfully in areas with a prolonged dry season ( Verkataratanam and Satyanaranaswamy, 1956 ; Cantillang, 1976 ). Its deciduous growth habit contributes to its drought resistance because it does not have leaves during the majority of months in the dry season. Dry weather during the flowering season seems to be preferable, but fruits are frequently set at the beginning of the rainy season ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961).

 the majority of months in the dry season. Dry weather during the flowering season seems to be preferable, but fruits are frequently set at the beginning of the rainy season ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961). A. squamosa is not demanding in its soil requirements, perhaps being the most adaptable of the Annona species, as it can tolerate wind and dry climates as well as infertile, sandy, and limestone soil so long as it is well-drained (Staples and Herbst, 2005; Paraguay Checklist, 2015 ). It cannot tolerate waterlogging for any length of time. A. squamosa grows well on sands, sandy or silty loams, and clays. However, consistently higher yields appear to be obtained from trees grown on sandy loams ( Coronel, 1983 ; Verheij and Coronel, 1991 ). The root system is relatively shallow, so that it does not require very deep soil. Like most other fruit crops, it prefers slightly acidic soil conditions with a pH of 5.5-6.5 ( Coronel, 1983 ) and can tolerate mild salinity ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). Elevation range for the species is generally low. In North America it has been reported growing between 0-50 m ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2015 ) and 0-100 m in Panama ( Panama Checklist, 2014 ), while in the lowland rainforests of Bolivia it grows between 0-500 m ( Bolivia Checklist, 2015 ), and along coastal regions of Ecuador between 0-500 m ( Vascular Plants of Ecuador, 2015 ). Similarly, in Nicaragua the species is cultivated in lowland parts of the Pacific region between 30-145 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2015 ). In Colombia the species has been reported at slightly higher altitudes of 500-1000 m in moist tropical forest ( Vascular Plants of Antioquia, 2015 ). A. squamosa thri

Its deciduous growth habit contributes to its drought resistance because it does not contain leaves during the majority of months in the dry season. Dry weather during the flowering season seems to be preferable, but fruits are frequently set at the beginning of the rainy season ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961). A. squamosa is not demanding in its soil requirements, provided that soil drainage is good. It cannot tolerate standing water for any length of time.

Fruits are considered mature when the skin between the segments has turned greenish-yellow to creamy-yellow. Fruits left to ripen on the tree are eaten by birds and bats, and the fruit has a tendency to burst open on the tree if left to overmature. The fruits mature at irregular intervals over a period of about 3 months and

Fruits left to ripen on the tree are eaten by birds and bats, and the fruit has a tendency to burst open on the tree if left to overmature. The fruits mature at irregular intervals over a period of about 3 months and are harvested as they mature. Fully mature fruits ripen 2-5 days after harvest and they should be eaten as soon as they ripen because they are perishable ( Gonzalez, 1934 ; Ochse et al., 1961; Viñas, 1972 ). Physiology and Phenology A. squamosa grows in the open or in partly shaded areas. When young, it requires shaded areas and at a later stage full overhead light for vigorous growth. It can withstand drought as it has deciduous growth characteristics during dry periods. In India, fruit set takes place after the commencement of the rainy season (Thakur and Singh, 1965, 1967). Those fruits that are set during the summer will generally dry up from high temperatures and low relative humidity. Fruit set during summer may be increased by irrigating the trees and providing shade. Fruit growth of green-fruited and red-fruited A. squamosa is rapid from August to mid-September. Afterwards it gradually slows down in the red-fruited form. The growth rate of the green-fruited form, however, still increases into October, after which it slows down and ceases by mid-November (Thakur and Singh, 1965). In Florida, the fruiting season begins in mid summer (wet season) with irregular ripening lasting 3 months. In the Philippines, fruiting occurs during the beginning of the rainy season (summer) and in India, fruiting also occurs in the wet season (August to mid September) and can occur from October to November (the

-November (Thakur and Singh, 1965). In Florida, the fruiting season begins in mid summer (wet season) with irregular ripening lasting 3 months. In the Philippines, fruiting occurs during the beginning of the rainy season (summer) and in India, fruiting also occurs in the wet season (August to mid September) and can occur from October to November (the end of the wet season) ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). In Mexico, flowering occurs at the end of the dry season (March to May) with fruiting at the end of the wet season (September to November). In Brazil, flowering occurs at the end of the dry season (March to May) and fruiting in the wet season (December to January) ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). Environmental Requirements A. squamosa thrives well in warm and humid tropical and subtropical lowlands below 1000-1200 m altitude ( Paguirigan, 1951 ; Galang, 1955 ; Viñas, 1972 ), and is relatively drought-tolerant but does not fruit well in high rainfall regimes. While it is less tender than some of its relatives, it cannot cope with freezing temperatures or prolonged periods of cold weather ( Noonan, 1953 ). It can, however, withstand drought well and can be grown successfully in areas with a prolonged dry season ( Verkataratanam and Satyanaranaswamy, 1956 ; Cantillang, 1976 ). Its deciduous growth habit contributes to its drought resistance because it does not have leaves during the majority of months in the dry season. Dry weather during the flowering season seems to be preferable, but fruits are frequently set at the beginning of the rainy season ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961).

 in the dry season. Dry weather during the flowering season seems to be preferable, but fruits are frequently set at the beginning of the rainy season ( Noonan, 1953 ; Ochse et al., 1961). A. squamosa is not demanding in its soil requirements, perhaps being the most adaptable of the Annona species, as it can tolerate wind and dry climates as well as infertile, sandy, and limestone soil so long as it is well-drained (Staples and Herbst, 2005; Paraguay Checklist, 2015 ). It cannot tolerate waterlogging for any length of time. A. squamosa grows well on sands, sandy or silty loams, and clays. However, consistently higher yields appear to be obtained from trees grown on sandy loams ( Coronel, 1983 ; Verheij and Coronel, 1991 ). The root system is relatively shallow, so that it does not require very deep soil. Like most other fruit crops, it prefers slightly acidic soil conditions with a pH of 5.5-6.5 ( Coronel, 1983 ) and can tolerate mild salinity ( Pinto et al., 2005 ). Elevation range for the species is generally low. In North America it has been reported growing between 0-50 m ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2015 ) and 0-100 m in Panama ( Panama Checklist, 2014 ), while in the lowland rainforests of Bolivia it grows between 0-500 m ( Bolivia Checklist, 2015 ), and along coastal regions of Ecuador between 0-500 m ( Vascular Plants of Ecuador, 2015 ). Similarly, in Nicaragua the species is cultivated in lowland parts of the Pacific region between 30-145 m ( Flora of Nicaragua, 2015 ). In Colombia the species has been reported at slightly higher altitudes of 500-1000 m in moist tropical forest ( Vascular Plants of Antioquia, 2015 ). Climate A. squamosa thrives well in

Description
This is a sprawling shrub or a tree to 20 ft (6 m) high with smooth, silvery bark.  The leaves are aromatic, deciduous, alternate, blue-green, broad-elliptic or broadovate, 3 to 7 in (7.5-17.5 cm) long, 1 1/2 to 4 in (4-10 cm) wide, rounded at apex and base, blue-green above, downy, prominently veined beneath.  The flowers, borne singly or in pairs in the leaf axils on stalks 1 to 1 1/2 in (2.5-4 cm) long, are clasped by a 3-parted calyx and have 3 triangular, thick, waxy, velvety, whitish outer petals, 3 pale-yellow inner petals, and numerous stamens.  Typically compound, the pineapple-scented fruit is smooth but with the carpers distinctly outlined on the surface; yellow or orange when ripe; rounded oval; 1 to 4 in (2.5-10 cm) long; fleshy; seedy.
Origin and Distribution
This species is native and common in savannas throughout tropical Africa from the Cape Verde Islands and the Nile and Upper Guinea to the Transvaal and Zululand.  It is little-known outside its natural range.  It was long ago introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture into Florida as a potential rootstock for related species, and into Puerto Rico in 1924 and again in 1925 and grown at the Insular Experiment Station, Rio Piedras.  According to G.L. Cruz (1979), verbatim from his 1965 publication (see Bibliography), it has become well established as

According to G.L. Cruz (1979), verbatim from his 1965 publication (see Bibliography), it has become well established as
araticum da areia
in Brazil, especially around Minas Gerais, Bahia and Espirito Santo, but he describes the fruit as rough-surfaced and 8 to 12 in (20-30 cm) in diameter, so he must have it confused with some other species unless there is great variation among seedlings.
Varieties
The botanical variety,
deltoides
, with elliptic to oblongelliptic leaves, rounded to broadly deltoid at the base, is the most common form in Ghana.  Eggeling mentions a variety
porpetac
in Uganda with oblong-elliptic, ovalelliptic or elliptic leaves, rounded-obtuse or broadly cuneate at the base.  There is reportedly a dwarf form, the fruits of which are borne so low they touch the ground, and are of better quality than those of taller types.
Climate
The wild custard apple is limited to tropical areas up to an elevation of 5,000 ft (1,500 m) and thrives best where its roots can reach water.  It remains leafless for several months in the dry season.
Food Uses
The fruit pulp is edible and said to have an apricot-like flavor.  Williamson quotes an unidentified source as saying that it is one of the best of the indigenous fruits in parts of tropical Africa.  It is much appreciated in the wild by shepherds.  According to Irvine, the unopened flower buds are used in soup and to season native dishes; and

It is much appreciated in the wild by shepherds.  According to Irvine, the unopened flower buds are used in soup and to season native dishes; and the leaves are eaten.
Food Value
The dried leaves contain 8.2% protein.
Other Uses
Fruit:
The green fruit, because of its high tannin content, is made into ink.
Leaves:
Fresh leaves are employed as fodder for domestic animals.  Boiled leaves serve as native perfume, and dried leaves are used as filling for mattresses.
Wood:
The soft, grayish wood is fashioned into hoe handles and employed in building huts.
Ashes:
The wood ashes are used in making soap and native snuff.
Bark and roots:
The bark yields a yellow or brown dye.  It is pounded in water and the liquid is then used as a hair dressing.  A poor-quality fiber derived from the bark is made into rope for tying fences.  A combination of the bark and roots serves as an insecticide, and the root has been used for homicidal purposes.  The irritant, gummy sap of the bark is an adhesive for arrow poison.  There are many superstitious uses of the various parts of the plant.
Medicinal Uses:
Fresh fruits in quantity and dried fruits are applied on Guinea worm sores.  The parched green fruits are taken to relieve diarrhea and dysentery.  A tea of the young leafy twigs or of the roots is taken to alleviate pulmonary complaints.  An infusion of the leaves is a popular eye lotion.

 and dried fruits are applied on Guinea worm sores.  The parched green fruits are taken to relieve diarrhea and dysentery.  A tea of the young leafy twigs or of the roots is taken to alleviate pulmonary complaints.  An infusion of the leaves is a popular eye lotion.  Dried, powdered leaves are regarded as purgative and as a remedy for mucous diarrhea.  With quantities of water, the pulverized leaves are given to horses to expel worms.  Combined with the roots and bark and other materials, they are said to be effective in treating yaws in horses.  The leaves also enter into a tonic for horses.  Venereal diseases and intestinal disorders are treated with preparations of the roots.  The bark is chewed to relieve stomachache.  It is an emetic and a vermifuge and is given to overcome convulsions in children.  The bark infusion, held in the mouth, relieves toothache.  In the Upper Volta, an ointment made from the bark is applied on burns.  Bark and roots together will halt dysentery, expel worms, and are part of a remedy for sleeping sickness.  The root infusion is employed as eye drops.  Charcoal of the burned roots is applied on twitching eyelids.  The root bark is considered an antidote for snakebite and is used by Nigerian medicine men as a cancer remedy.  Investigations have revealed antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 ascites, and antibiotic activity.  The trunk bark contains alkaloids, including 0.02% anonaine, also tannins and saponins.  The leaves contain rutin, quercetin and quercetrin.

.  It grows wild from sea-level to 2, 000 ft (650 m) throughout the West Indies and southward into Peru and Brazil, and is cultivated in the Philippines and rarely in Florida.
The tree somewhat resembles that of the soursop but has a more spreading crown and very glossy leaves.  It is slightly hardier and bears more or less continuously.  The fruit is nearly round or broad-ovoid, to 6 in (15 cm) long.  Its dark-green skin is studded with numerous short, fleshy ";spines";.  It becomes very soft and falls when ripe.  The pulp is yellow, peculiarly aromatic, sour to subacid and bitter, fibrous, and contains many light-brown, plump seeds.  The quality is variable but generally very poor.

The fruit is generally regarded as inedible but is referred to as ";edible but mediocre"; in Brazil.  There, the firm core attached to the base of the peduncle is pulled out and eaten as a tidbit.  In southern Florida, exotic parrots eat the fruits and scatter the seeds, and a few trees are consequently occurring as escapes.  The tree is of minor interest to horticulturists as an ornamental and rootstock.  The wood is soft, fibrous and useful only as fuel.
The pond apple,
A. glabra
L. (syn.
A. palustris
L.), is also called alligator apple, monkey apple, custard apple, corkwood,
mamon de perro, cayur, cayuda
, and various other colloquial names.  It grows wild in the Florida Everglades and in coastal swamps and marshes of the Bahamas and throughout the West Indies, in southern Mexico, Central America, and southward into Peru and Argentine; also on the coast of West Tropical Africa.  It is occasionally planted in southern Florida and has been introduced into Malaya and the Philippines.
The tree may reach 45 ft (13.5 m), is rather open and spreading; may become very thick at the base; has glossy, leathery, deciduous leaves.  The fruit is oval or heartshaped, to 5 in (12.5 cm) long with thin, faintly reticulated, glossy yellow skin and salmon-colored, resinous, subacid, dryish pulp containing many light-brown, flattened-oval, longitudinally-winged seeds that float on water.

The fruit is oval or heartshaped, to 5 in (12.5 cm) long with thin, faintly reticulated, glossy yellow skin and salmon-colored, resinous, subacid, dryish pulp containing many light-brown, flattened-oval, longitudinally-winged seeds that float on water.  When fully ripe and soft, the pulp is edible and some specimens are of fair quality and have been made into jelly or wine.  The pond apple is of value as a ";survival"; food in extremity and of great importance as fare for wild creatures.  Fishermen fashion the light, corklike wood into floats.  The leaf decoction is a common, multipurpose folk remedy in the Netherlands Antilles, Mexico and South America.  Seedlings are useful as rootstock for other Annona species in wet soils.
