 Invasion: Populus nigrais a deciduous dioecious tree, with a broad and dense crown (pyramidal inP. nigravar.italica) and a longevity of 200-300 years (Allegri, 1971). Old specimens can reach heights of 20-40 m with a d.b.h. of 60-100 (200) cm. Trunks are more or less straight with thick knots and stout branches, sometimes with suckers at the base. The root system is lateral, shallow or deep, depending on soil layer and depth of water table; the bark is more or less dark brown or dull grey (Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023). Older trees are deeply furrowed with large burrs. Branchlets are yellowish, glabrous, terete.

 Reproduccion: Populus nigra var. italica is diploid with 2n=38 chromosomes ( Dickman and Kuzovkina, 2008 ). As Lombardy poplar ( P. nigra var. italica ) is a natural male clone, it produces no seed. Its pollen, however, allows gene flow and intraspecific and interspecific hybridization to occur. Flowering of male flowers begins when trees are 4-10 years old and occurs in early spring, before full leaf emergence. The roots are very vigorous and invasive, and can destroy land drainage systems and damage foundations. Populus roots can develop dual mycorrhizal associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and with non-mycorrhizal fungal endophytes ( Kulczyk-Skrzeszewska and Kieliszewska-Rokicka, 2021 ). Populus nigra trees live for 200-300 years, but var. italica is much more short-lived, being susceptible to damage from a range of pests and diseases which disfigure the tree, cause branch drop and lead to eventual mortality, often succumbing within 15 years, but more often 30-50 years. Older trees become more and more susceptible to being blown over in strong winds. This rapid decline has made them unpopular nowadays with landscaping professionals ( Beaulieu, 2015 ).

This rapid decline has made them unpopular nowadays with landscaping professionals ( Beaulieu, 2015 ). Populus nigra var. italica grows in temperate zones with a bimodal rainfall regime. To perform well, it needs an average of 700 mm of rain per year, distributed in spring and autumn, and it can tolerate dry summers. In general, there is a relationship between summer temperatures and growth in locations with adequate supplies of soil moisture. In areas with heavy rainfall, it performs poorly. It can grow on chalk, sand, clay or loam soils of acid, neutral or alkaline pH. Populus nigra grows in temperate zones with a bimodal rainfall regime. To perform well, it needs an average of 700 mm of rain per year, distributed in spring and autumn, and it can tolerate dry summers. In general, there is a relationship between summer temperatures and growth in locations with adequate supplies of soil moisture. In areas with heavy rainfall, P. nigra performs poorly. Resistance to frost is related to provenance, with northern provenances (North Russia and Siberia) performing adequately in very cold conditions ( Gadirca, 1998 ). Populus nigra grows best on soils with a medium texture and a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. Heavy, clayey soils can also be tolerated, but a well-aerated layer of soil needs to be maintained. The optimum conditions are a deep (60 cm minimum), well-textured soil with high fertility ( FAO, 1980 ; Kuz'menko, 1992 ), flat or gently sloping areas, such as towards the bottom of south-facing slopes.
