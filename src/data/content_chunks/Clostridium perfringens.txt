3.3.2   Preparation of C. perfringens type C standard beta antitoxin 
 
1. Clostridium perfringens type C antitoxin IRP 645 contains 550 units of 
beta antitoxin per mL (AU/mL) and has been standardized against the 
World Health Organization C. perfringens (C. welchii) type C 
International antitoxin. Each vial contains 0.6 mL of antitoxin.  
 
2.  A dilution of standard beta antitoxin containing 10 (AU/mL) is used in 
the toxin-neutralization test. Follow the current Reagent Data Sheet to 
prepare the dilution.  
 
3.3.3   Preparation of C. perfringens type C standard beta toxin 
 
1.  Follow the current Reagent Data Sheet to prepare the dilution of  
C. perfringens type C beta toxin IRP 692. IRP 692, diluted 1:10, is stable 
when stored at -60°C or lower. 
 
Note: A volume of 0.5 mL of standard beta toxin and 0.5 mL of 
peptone diluent represents 10 Lo doses. A volume of 0.9 mL of the 
standard beta toxin and 0.1 mL of peptone diluent represents  
10 L+ doses (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). For the purposes of this 
SAM, 10 Lo dose is defined as the greatest amount of toxin that, when 
mixed with 10 AU, results in 100% survival of all mice

 of the 
standard beta toxin and 0.1 mL of peptone diluent represents  
10 L+ doses (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). For the purposes of this 
SAM, 10 Lo dose is defined as the greatest amount of toxin that, when 
mixed with 10 AU, results in 100% survival of all mice inoculated 
intravenously (IV) with 0.2 mL of this mixture. The 10 L+ dose is 
defined as the least amount of toxin that, when mixed with 10 AU, 
results in the death of 80%-100% of all mice inoculated IV with  
0.2 mL of this mixture. 
 
 
4.  Performance of the Test 
 
4.1   Toxin neutralization 
 
4.1.1   Product and standard beta toxin 
 
1. Mix a sufficient volume of standard beta toxin and peptone diluent  
(0.5 mL of standard beta toxin and 0.5 mL peptone diluent (10 Lo doses)) 
for each product antitoxin dilution and the Lo control using a 17 x 120-mm 
conical tube.

4.2 Inoculation of mice 
 
4.2.1   Inject 0.2 mL of each standard beta toxin-product antitoxin mixture into 
each of 5 mice. 
 
4.2.2   Inject 0.2 mL of each standard beta toxin-standard beta antitoxin mixture 
into each of 5 mice. 
 
4.2.3   Inoculate all mice intravenously into a lateral tail vein. Use 1-cc needle 
locking syringes fitted with 25- to 27-gauge x 1- to 1 1/4-inch needles.  
 
4.2.4   Always inoculate the mice receiving the standard beta toxin-standard beta 
antitoxin mixtures (controls) last.

4.2.5   Mouse inoculations should be completed within 1 hour of placing the 
toxin-antitoxin mixtures in the ice. 
 
4.2.6   The test is concluded 24 hours after the mice are inoculated. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1 Criteria for a valid test 
 
5.1.1 All 5 mice inoculated with the standard 10 Lo/10 AU control mixture must 
survive. 
 
5.1.2 At least 4 of the 5 mice inoculated with the standard 10 L+/10 AU control 
mixture must die. 
 
Note: Moribund animals exhibiting clinical signs consistent with the expected 
disease pathogenesis that are unable to rise or move under their own power 
may be humanely euthanized and considered as deaths as outlined in             
9 CFR 117.4. 
 
5.2 Interpretation of serial results 
 
5.2.1   The product contains at least 500 International Units of beta antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:50 dilution of product-standard beta 
toxin mixture survive. 
 
5.2.2   The product contains at least 600 International Units of beta antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:60 dilution of product-standard beta
Text Len: 1283
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:50 dilution of product-standard beta 
toxin mixture survive. 
 
5.2.2   The product contains at least 600 International Units of beta antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:60 dilution of product-standard beta 
toxin survive. 
 
5.2.3   The product is considered unsatisfactory if it contains less than 500 
International Units of beta antitoxin per mL. (If any mice inoculated with the 1:50 
dilution and 10 Lo doses of standard beta toxin die, the product is considered to 
contain less than 500 International Units per mL.)

3.3.2   Preparation of C. perfringens type C standard beta antitoxin 
 
1. Clostridium perfringens type C antitoxin IRP 645 contains 550 units of 
beta antitoxin per mL (AU/mL) and has been standardized against the 
World Health Organization C. perfringens (C. welchii) type C 
International antitoxin. Each vial contains 0.6 mL of antitoxin.  
 
2.  A dilution of standard beta antitoxin containing 10 (AU/mL) is used in 
the toxin-neutralization test. Follow the current Reagent Data Sheet to 
prepare the dilution.  
 
3.3.3   Preparation of C. perfringens type C standard beta toxin 
 
1.  Follow the current Reagent Data Sheet to prepare the dilution of  
C. perfringens type C beta toxin IRP 692. IRP 692, diluted 1:10, is stable 
when stored at -60°C or lower. 
 
Note: A volume of 0.5 mL of standard beta toxin and 0.5 mL of 
peptone diluent represents 10 Lo doses. A volume of 0.9 mL of the 
standard beta toxin and 0.1 mL of peptone diluent represents  
10 L+ doses (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). For the purposes of this 
SAM, 10 Lo dose is defined as the greatest amount of toxin that, when 
mixed with 10 AU, results in 100% survival of all mice

 of the 
standard beta toxin and 0.1 mL of peptone diluent represents  
10 L+ doses (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). For the purposes of this 
SAM, 10 Lo dose is defined as the greatest amount of toxin that, when 
mixed with 10 AU, results in 100% survival of all mice inoculated 
intravenously (IV) with 0.2 mL of this mixture. The 10 L+ dose is 
defined as the least amount of toxin that, when mixed with 10 AU, 
results in the death of 80%-100% of all mice inoculated IV with  
0.2 mL of this mixture.

4.1   Toxin neutralization 
 
4.1.1   Product and standard beta toxin 
 
1. Mix a sufficient volume of standard beta toxin and peptone diluent  
(0.5 mL of standard beta toxin and 0.5 mL peptone diluent (10 Lo doses)) 
for each product antitoxin dilution and the Lo control using a 17 x 120-mm 
conical tube.

each of 5 mice. 
 
4.2.2   Inject 0.2 mL of each standard beta toxin-standard beta antitoxin mixture 
into each of 5 mice. 
 
4.2.3   Inoculate all mice intravenously into a lateral tail vein. Use 1-cc needle 
locking syringes fitted with 25- to 27-gauge x 1- to 1 1/4-inch needles.  
 
4.2.4   Always inoculate the mice receiving the standard beta toxin-standard beta 
antitoxin mixtures (controls) last.

4.2.5   Mouse inoculations should be completed within 1 hour of placing the 
toxin-antitoxin mixtures in the ice. 
 
4.2.6   The test is concluded 24 hours after the mice are inoculated. 
 
 
5.  Interpretation of the Test Results 
 
5.1 Criteria for a valid test 
 
5.1.1 All 5 mice inoculated with the standard 10 Lo/10 AU control mixture must 
survive. 
 
5.1.2 At least 4 of the 5 mice inoculated with the standard 10 L+/10 AU control 
mixture must die. 
 
Note: Moribund animals exhibiting clinical signs consistent with the expected 
disease pathogenesis that are unable to rise or move under their own power 
may be humanely euthanized and considered as deaths as outlined in             
9 CFR 117.4. 
 
5.2 Interpretation of serial results 
 
5.2.1   The product contains at least 500 International Units of beta antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:50 dilution of product-standard beta 
toxin mixture survive. 
 
5.2.2   The product contains at least 600 International Units of beta antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:60 dilution of product-standard beta
Text Len: 1283
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:50 dilution of product-standard beta 
toxin mixture survive. 
 
5.2.2   The product contains at least 600 International Units of beta antitoxin per 
mL if 5 of the 5 mice inoculated with the 1:60 dilution of product-standard beta 
toxin survive. 
 
5.2.3   The product is considered unsatisfactory if it contains less than 500 
International Units of beta antitoxin per mL. (If any mice inoculated with the 1:50 
dilution and 10 Lo doses of standard beta toxin die, the product is considered to 
contain less than 500 International Units per mL.)
