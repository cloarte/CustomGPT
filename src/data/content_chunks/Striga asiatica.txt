The blossoms are usually red but occasionally yellow blossoms occur. Unlike other weeds that only compete with crops for sunlight, water, nutrients, and space—witchweed attaches itself to host plant roots and causes direct damage. Currently witchweed is only found in seven North and South Carolina counties. Witchweed can only grow if it's attached to another plant. It deprives its host of valuable nutrients, energy, and moisture causing significant yield reductions. Each witchweed plant can produce thousands of seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for over a decade. Witchweed is native to Africa, India, the Middle East, and China. Before APHIS's eradication efforts, witchweed was found in 38 North and South Carolina counties. What To Look For Seasonal Activity Witchweed emerges from the soil beginning in late June and flowers about 2 weeks later. Swollen seed pods follow, liberating thousands of microscopic seeds, which can live in the soil for at least 10 years.

We also work with State and local partners to detect, contain, and eradicate infestations. Eradication happens in three phases: Surveys to find and map all infestations Quarantines to prevent people from spreading witchweed beyond the infested region Control activities to prevent existing plants from producing seeds We work with Federal and State partners as well as the general public.
