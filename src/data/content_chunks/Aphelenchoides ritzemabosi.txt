 Reproduccion: A. ritzemabosi is an obligate plant parasite, inhabiting leaves, buds, growing points and outer layers of stem; in soil it does not complete its life cycle or survive the winter. It feeds endoparasitically on mesophyll cells of leaves, and ectoparasitically on buds and growing points ( Southey, 1952 ; Siddiqi, 1974 ). The nematodes move in the water film over plants, not within the stem tissue, to reach the leaves and buds. Rain splashes and leaf contacts contribute to re-infestation and spread ( Wallace, 1959 ). The leaves are invaded through the stomata. The nematodes feed on the parenchymatous tissue of the mesophyll and destroy the cells, resulting in leaf spots or blotches, easily seen on the under surface. The nematodes leave brown tissue through the stomata and migrate in the water film on the surface to infect terminal flower buds which produce deformed and under-sized blossoms. As many as 15,000 nematodes may be found in one leaf of chrysanthemum ( MAFF, 1969 ); over 300 individuals per 14 g of infested aster seeds have been recovered ( Brown, 1956 ). Limonium sinuatum attacked by A. ritzemabosi also showed a high level of infestation, more than 100 individuals per 2.5 g foliar tissue ( Bohm and Aruta, 1985 ). A. ritzemabosi multiplies bisexually and not by parthenogenesis; fertilized females go on reproducing for 6 months without further fertilization ( French and Barraclough, 1961 ). In chrysanthemum leaves, a female lays about 25-30 eggs in a compact group; eggs hatch in 3-4 days and the juveniles take 9-10 days to reach maturity; the life cycle takes 10-13

xually and not by parthenogenesis; fertilized females go on reproducing for 6 months without further fertilization ( French and Barraclough, 1961 ). In chrysanthemum leaves, a female lays about 25-30 eggs in a compact group; eggs hatch in 3-4 days and the juveniles take 9-10 days to reach maturity; the life cycle takes 10-13 days ( Wallace, 1960 ). In leaves of groundsel (Senecio vulgaris) the life cycle is completed in 14-15 days ( Stewart, 1921 ). In susceptible chrysanthemum varieties the female remains in the leaf at one place, feeds on adjoining cells and lays many eggs which hatch into rapidly developing juveniles; however, in resistant varieties the female moves about rapidly through the tissues, feeding on cells, but lays only a few eggs whose emerging juveniles fail to reach maturity ( Wallace, 1961 ). In strawberry fields in Poland, both Aphelenchoides fragariae and A. ritzemabosi showed peak populations in March-May and November-January, and were influenced by moisture and temperature ( Szczygiel and Hasior, 1972 ). Like other plant-parasitic Aphelenchoides species such as A. fragariae, A. besseyi and A. blastophthorus, A. ritzemabosi can reproduce on fungi, and soil fungi may therefore contribute to its survival in the absence of a host ( Hooper and Cowland, 1986 ). Survival and source of infection A. ritzemabosi survives unfavourable conditions through anhydrobiosis, as it possesses multiple contraction ability, i.e. coiling coupled with transverse and longitudinal folding of the cuticle. It survived immersion in paraffin oil for 12 days (Saeed and Roessner, 1984). Christie (1959) revived specimens in dried chrysanthemum leaves after 16 months, but not after 19 months; Ste

avourable conditions through anhydrobiosis, as it possesses multiple contraction ability, i.e. coiling coupled with transverse and longitudinal folding of the cuticle. It survived immersion in paraffin oil for 12 days (Saeed and Roessner, 1984). Christie (1959) revived specimens in dried chrysanthemum leaves after 16 months, but not after 19 months; Steiner (1924) revived them after 22 months; Voss (1930) after 2 years; and Goodey (1933) after 3 years. A. ritzemabosi overwinters in dormant buds and growing points of chrysanthemum stools; stools rather than the soil serve as the source of infestation ( Hesling and Wallace, 1961 ). The nematode is also carried on the seeds of aster ( Brown, 1956 ). No change in nematode population per number of hearts occurred when strawberry plants infested with A. ritzemabosi and A. fragariae were stored at a room temperature of 14-15°C or in an unheated glasshouse in winter. However, at 20°C the population increased several times. Under cold-storage conditions of -2 to -1°C, an increase of 56% was registered ( Hirling, 1972 ); at 4°C, 33% revived after 3 years ( French and Barraclough, 1962 ). Several weeds are hosts (goosegrass, chickweed, buttercup, sowthistle, speedwell) hence weed control is important. Culture A. ritzemabosi was mass cultured on courgette and/or marrow tissues at 16-18°C (Hooper and Cowland, 1988). In oat callus tissue, the nematode increased 50-fold in 6 weeks, although oat is not a recorded host ( Webster, 1966 ); numbers increased in plant growth-stimulating substances ( Webster, 1967 ).

In oat callus tissue, the nematode increased 50-fold in 6 weeks, although oat is not a recorded host ( Webster, 1966 ); numbers increased in plant growth-stimulating substances ( Webster, 1967 ). It also reproduced and multiplied in callus tissues of carrot, tobacco, periwinkle and marigold; the reproduction seemed to be influenced by the concentration of cations in the culture ( Dolliver et al., 1962 ). Monoxenic cultures of A. ritzemabosi, Ditylenchus dipsaci, Pratylenchus penetrans and Pratylenchus vulnus were obtained on lucerne and clover callus tissue by the method of Eriksson (described by Bossis and Caubel, 1982 ). Interactions with other Organisms Cross and Pitcher (1952) co-inoculated A. ritzemabosi and Corynebacterium fascians [Rhodococcus fascians] to strawberry runners and produced the 'cauliflower' disease resulting in the continued production of axillary buds on affected crown. In such an interaction, nematodes appear to act as vectors for the bacteria and may also stimulate bacterial growth either by producing a suitable metabolite or by modifying the host substrate ( Pitcher, 1963 ). In southern regions of Russia, A. ritzemabosi and highly virulent strains of C. fascians are thought to be responsible for 'cauliflower' symptoms, and less virulent strains are thought to cause 'red plants' or 'alaminate leaves' (Drozdovski et al., 1971). The alaminate leaves condition of strawberry is due either to the nematodes alone, or to the nematodes acting in association with less

 strains of C. fascians are thought to be responsible for 'cauliflower' symptoms, and less virulent strains are thought to cause 'red plants' or 'alaminate leaves' (Drozdovski et al., 1971). The alaminate leaves condition of strawberry is due either to the nematodes alone, or to the nematodes acting in association with less virulent strains of C. fascians ( Pitcher and Cross, 1958 ). In experiments, population growth of Ditylenchus dipsaci on tobacco was depressed by simultaneous infection with A. ritzemabosi. The latter species was not affected by D. dipsaci in the leaves; however, in the stems and petioles, where A. ritzemabosi does not normally develop, its population growth was enhanced, possibly due to the chemical and histological changes induced by D. dipsaci ( Weischer, 1974 ). In tests on tobacco plants, A. ritzemabosi was inhibited by Tobacco mosaic virus , Tobacco rattle virus , Tomato ringspot virus , Raspberry ringspot virus and Tomato black ring virus , and favoured by Arabis mosaic virus . The negative or positive influence of a virus is due to the various physiological changes it causes in a plant, and not to a direct influence on the nematodes which ingest the virus particles with the cell contents ( Weischer, 1969 , 1975). A. ritzemabosi was found in association with Phytophthora cryptogea on diseased gloxinia plants in Florida (Stokes and Alfieri, 1969).
 Sintomas: A. ritzemabosi causes angular leaf spot in several hosts, and also causes dwarfing and leaf wilt.

 Sintomas: A. ritzemabosi causes angular leaf spot in several hosts, and also causes dwarfing and leaf wilt. As an endoparasite, it enters the leaves through the stomata and moves about, feeding on the mesophyll cells. The cells in infested areas are killed and the leaves develop brown lesions delimited by the veins ( Franklin, 1959 ). Infested leaves become crinkled and deformed, occasionally accompanied by discoloration, with blotches and chlorotic patches turning into brown and white-yellow areas. The entire plant appears stunted and dwarfed.The symptoms on chrysanthemum include characteristic brown spots limited to the veins, and a progressive yellowing of the whole leaf. These symptoms are due to combined action of the nematode and other organisms ( Cayrol and Combettes, 1972 ). Leaf symptoms on infested Chrysanthemum maximum include reddish-yellow lesions on the lower leaves of young plants; in older plants these leaves are markedly chlorotic and a large area of the leaf surface becomes necrotic. The foliage is scanty and the flowers are few and deformed. Leaves in the upper part of plants have shown slightly higher resistance than those in the lower part ( Cid del Prado and Sosa-Moss, 1978 ). Direct effects are mechanical damage caused by the stylet, and damage due to hormones of growth and division ( Cayrol and Combettes, 1972 ). Attacked violets are stunted, and affected leaves curl down, wither and die; under surfaces of leaves showed typical water-soaked blotches ( Thomas, 1968 ). Stunting and shoot blindness occurred on attacked Crassula coccinia ( Atkinson, 1964 ).

 Reproduccion: A. ritzemabosi is an obligate plant parasite, inhabiting leaves, buds, growing points and outer layers of stem; in soil it does not complete its life cycle or survive the winter. It feeds endoparasitically on mesophyll cells of leaves, and ectoparasitically on buds and growing points ( Southey, 1952 ; Siddiqi, 1974 ). The nematodes move in the water film over plants, not within the stem tissue, to reach the leaves and buds. Rain splashes and leaf contacts contribute to re-infestation and spread ( Wallace, 1959 ). The leaves are invaded through the stomata. The nematodes feed on the parenchymatous tissue of the mesophyll and destroy the cells, resulting in leaf spots or blotches, easily seen on the under surface. The nematodes leave brown tissue through the stomata and migrate in the water film on the surface to infect terminal flower buds which produce deformed and under-sized blossoms. As many as 15,000 nematodes may be found in one leaf of chrysanthemum ( MAFF, 1969 ); over 300 individuals per 14 g of infested aster seeds have been recovered ( Brown, 1956 ). Limonium sinuatum attacked by A. ritzemabosi also showed a high level of infestation, more than 100 individuals per 2.5 g foliar tissue ( Bohm and Aruta, 1985 ). A. ritzemabosi multiplies bisexually and not by parthenogenesis; fertilized females go on reproducing for 6 months without further fertilization ( French and Barraclough, 1961 ). In chrysanthemum leaves, a female lays about 25-30 eggs in a compact group; eggs hatch in 3-4 days and the juveniles take 9-10 days to reach maturity; the life cycle takes 10-13

xually and not by parthenogenesis; fertilized females go on reproducing for 6 months without further fertilization ( French and Barraclough, 1961 ). In chrysanthemum leaves, a female lays about 25-30 eggs in a compact group; eggs hatch in 3-4 days and the juveniles take 9-10 days to reach maturity; the life cycle takes 10-13 days ( Wallace, 1960 ). In leaves of groundsel (Senecio vulgaris) the life cycle is completed in 14-15 days ( Stewart, 1921 ). In susceptible chrysanthemum varieties the female remains in the leaf at one place, feeds on adjoining cells and lays many eggs which hatch into rapidly developing juveniles; however, in resistant varieties the female moves about rapidly through the tissues, feeding on cells, but lays only a few eggs whose emerging juveniles fail to reach maturity ( Wallace, 1961 ). In strawberry fields in Poland, both Aphelenchoides fragariae and A. ritzemabosi showed peak populations in March-May and November-January, and were influenced by moisture and temperature ( Szczygiel and Hasior, 1972 ). Like other plant-parasitic Aphelenchoides species such as A. fragariae, A. besseyi and A. blastophthorus, A. ritzemabosi can reproduce on fungi, and soil fungi may therefore contribute to its survival in the absence of a host ( Hooper and Cowland, 1986 ). Survival and source of infection A. ritzemabosi survives unfavourable conditions through anhydrobiosis, as it possesses multiple contraction ability, i.e. coiling coupled with transverse and longitudinal folding of the cuticle. It survived immersion in paraffin oil for 12 days (Saeed and Roessner, 1984). Christie (1959) revived specimens in dried chrysanthemum leaves after 16 months, but not after 19 months; Ste

avourable conditions through anhydrobiosis, as it possesses multiple contraction ability, i.e. coiling coupled with transverse and longitudinal folding of the cuticle. It survived immersion in paraffin oil for 12 days (Saeed and Roessner, 1984). Christie (1959) revived specimens in dried chrysanthemum leaves after 16 months, but not after 19 months; Steiner (1924) revived them after 22 months; Voss (1930) after 2 years; and Goodey (1933) after 3 years. A. ritzemabosi overwinters in dormant buds and growing points of chrysanthemum stools; stools rather than the soil serve as the source of infestation ( Hesling and Wallace, 1961 ). The nematode is also carried on the seeds of aster ( Brown, 1956 ). No change in nematode population per number of hearts occurred when strawberry plants infested with A. ritzemabosi and A. fragariae were stored at a room temperature of 14-15°C or in an unheated glasshouse in winter. However, at 20°C the population increased several times. Under cold-storage conditions of -2 to -1°C, an increase of 56% was registered ( Hirling, 1972 ); at 4°C, 33% revived after 3 years ( French and Barraclough, 1962 ). Several weeds are hosts (goosegrass, chickweed, buttercup, sowthistle, speedwell) hence weed control is important. Culture A. ritzemabosi was mass cultured on courgette and/or marrow tissues at 16-18°C (Hooper and Cowland, 1988). In oat callus tissue, the nematode increased 50-fold in 6 weeks, although oat is not a recorded host ( Webster, 1966 ); numbers increased in plant growth-stimulating substances ( Webster, 1967 ).

In oat callus tissue, the nematode increased 50-fold in 6 weeks, although oat is not a recorded host ( Webster, 1966 ); numbers increased in plant growth-stimulating substances ( Webster, 1967 ). It also reproduced and multiplied in callus tissues of carrot, tobacco, periwinkle and marigold; the reproduction seemed to be influenced by the concentration of cations in the culture ( Dolliver et al., 1962 ). Monoxenic cultures of A. ritzemabosi, Ditylenchus dipsaci, Pratylenchus penetrans and Pratylenchus vulnus were obtained on lucerne and clover callus tissue by the method of Eriksson (described by Bossis and Caubel, 1982 ). Interactions with other Organisms Cross and Pitcher (1952) co-inoculated A. ritzemabosi and Corynebacterium fascians [Rhodococcus fascians] to strawberry runners and produced the 'cauliflower' disease resulting in the continued production of axillary buds on affected crown. In such an interaction, nematodes appear to act as vectors for the bacteria and may also stimulate bacterial growth either by producing a suitable metabolite or by modifying the host substrate ( Pitcher, 1963 ). In southern regions of Russia, A. ritzemabosi and highly virulent strains of C. fascians are thought to be responsible for 'cauliflower' symptoms, and less virulent strains are thought to cause 'red plants' or 'alaminate leaves' (Drozdovski et al., 1971). The alaminate leaves condition of strawberry is due either to the nematodes alone, or to the nematodes acting in association with less

 strains of C. fascians are thought to be responsible for 'cauliflower' symptoms, and less virulent strains are thought to cause 'red plants' or 'alaminate leaves' (Drozdovski et al., 1971). The alaminate leaves condition of strawberry is due either to the nematodes alone, or to the nematodes acting in association with less virulent strains of C. fascians ( Pitcher and Cross, 1958 ). In experiments, population growth of Ditylenchus dipsaci on tobacco was depressed by simultaneous infection with A. ritzemabosi. The latter species was not affected by D. dipsaci in the leaves; however, in the stems and petioles, where A. ritzemabosi does not normally develop, its population growth was enhanced, possibly due to the chemical and histological changes induced by D. dipsaci ( Weischer, 1974 ). In tests on tobacco plants, A. ritzemabosi was inhibited by Tobacco mosaic virus , Tobacco rattle virus , Tomato ringspot virus , Raspberry ringspot virus and Tomato black ring virus , and favoured by Arabis mosaic virus . The negative or positive influence of a virus is due to the various physiological changes it causes in a plant, and not to a direct influence on the nematodes which ingest the virus particles with the cell contents ( Weischer, 1969 , 1975). A. ritzemabosi was found in association with Phytophthora cryptogea on diseased gloxinia plants in Florida (Stokes and Alfieri, 1969).
 Sintomas: A. ritzemabosi causes angular leaf spot in several hosts, and also causes dwarfing and leaf wilt.

 Sintomas: A. ritzemabosi causes angular leaf spot in several hosts, and also causes dwarfing and leaf wilt. As an endoparasite, it enters the leaves through the stomata and moves about, feeding on the mesophyll cells. The cells in infested areas are killed and the leaves develop brown lesions delimited by the veins ( Franklin, 1959 ). Infested leaves become crinkled and deformed, occasionally accompanied by discoloration, with blotches and chlorotic patches turning into brown and white-yellow areas. The entire plant appears stunted and dwarfed.The symptoms on chrysanthemum include characteristic brown spots limited to the veins, and a progressive yellowing of the whole leaf. These symptoms are due to combined action of the nematode and other organisms ( Cayrol and Combettes, 1972 ). Leaf symptoms on infested Chrysanthemum maximum include reddish-yellow lesions on the lower leaves of young plants; in older plants these leaves are markedly chlorotic and a large area of the leaf surface becomes necrotic. The foliage is scanty and the flowers are few and deformed. Leaves in the upper part of plants have shown slightly higher resistance than those in the lower part ( Cid del Prado and Sosa-Moss, 1978 ). Direct effects are mechanical damage caused by the stylet, and damage due to hormones of growth and division ( Cayrol and Combettes, 1972 ). Attacked violets are stunted, and affected leaves curl down, wither and die; under surfaces of leaves showed typical water-soaked blotches ( Thomas, 1968 ). Stunting and shoot blindness occurred on attacked Crassula coccinia ( Atkinson, 1964 ).
