Plant Notes:  Rose Vervain is a native herbaceous annual or short-lived perennial in the Verbena family (Verbenaceae). It occurs throughout Alabama except for the southern-most counties. Rose Vervain grows in prairies, in cedar glades, in hardwood or pine forests, and on roadsides. It is an annual or short-lived perennial with a short rhizome. The stems are erect or decumbent with up-turned tips and may root at the nodes. Stems are green or purplish green in color, branched from the base, 4-angled, and pubescent. Leaves are opposite, petiolate, ovate to lanceolate in outline, pinnately lobed or dissected (sometimes deeply so), and pubescent. Fascicles of reduced leaves often occur in the leaf axils. Fragrant flowers are produced in terminal spikes that continue to elongate as new flowers are produced and fruit mature. Individual flowers are subtended by bracts that are shorter than to as long as the calyx. The calyx is tubular and pubescent with 4-5 lobes. The corolla is salverform with a long tube on 5 lobes. The lobes are shallowly notched and the lower lobe is larger than the others. The corolla is pink, rosy pink, or lavender in color. The fruit is a schizocarp

The lobes are shallowly notched and the lower lobe is larger than the others. The corolla is pink, rosy pink, or lavender in color. The fruit is a schizocarp. Rose Vervain is often available from wildflower nurseries. It prefers a well-draining soil in full sun. It is drought tolerant once established. Rose Vervain can be used in prairies, in rock gardens, and along walks. Plants produce an abundance of nectar and attract many butterfly species.—A. Diamond  ;
