Juniperus communisL. - Juniper  -Cupressaceae© Graham Day© Paul Hackney© Ralph Forbes(Map updated: March 2008)© Ralph Forbes© Derek PolleyJuniper is a prickly-leafed shrub of usually dense growth, mostly low-growing because it tends to be found in exposed situations such as rocky outcrops, limestone pavement and inland and maritime cliffs. Although a conifer, it produces a blue-black fleshy berry instead of the usual woody cone normally expected of coniferous trees and shrubs.Juniper, yew (Taxus baccata) and Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris), are the only conifers native to Northern Ireland. Scots pine became extinct hundreds of years ago, but has been re-introduced from Scotland and northern Europe.All names:Juniperus communisL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
