Pubescent wheatgrass
Gramineae, Poaceae
Agropyron intermedium
var.
trichophorum
(Link) Halac.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a sod-forming grass native to Europe and Asia Minor, closelyrelated to Intermediate Wheatgrass and having the same range of adaptation. The heads and seeds of pubescent are covered with short, stiff hairs. A namedvariety of pubescent, Topar, is better adapted to low-fertility soils and ismore drought resistant than intermediate. In palatability and generalappearance pubescent is very similar to intermediate.
