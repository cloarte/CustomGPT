Little bluestem
Gramineae
Schizachyrium scoparium
(Michx.) Nash
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a vigorous, long-lived native bunchgrass, widely distributedover the United States; but most prevalent in the Central and Southern GreatPlains. It is usually found associated with big bluestem grass. It is moredrought resistant that big bluestem, and a smaller plant - reaching not over 3feet. Leaves are up to 8 inches long, and not over 0.25 inch wide. It furnishesdependable grazing and cured hay, but is not highly palatable. It is especiallyvaluable for erosion control.
