 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for S. canadensis is 2 n = 36 ( Spjut, 2015 ; USDA-ARS, 2020 ). Flowers of S. canadensis do not have nectaries and it is thought that this species is pollinated by wind ( Charlebois et al., 2010 ). In North America, S. canadensis produces flowers from May to September and fruits from July to October ( Stevens, 2001 ). In tropical areas, it produces flowers and fruits throughout the year ( Charlebois et al., 2010 ). The flowers are faintly perfumed. Sambucus canadensis is a short-lived perennial species. In the wild, plants often produce flowers and fruit after 2-3 years and can reach full size in 3-4 years ( Stevens, 2001 ). In North America, elderberries are important sources of summer food for many species of songbirds, grouse, pheasant and pigeons ( Martin et al., 1951 ; Stevens, 2001 ). The valley elderberry longhorn beetle, Desmocerus californicus dimorphus, a species listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act, uses S. canadensis as a food plant. The elderberry beetle is endemic to oak [ Quercus ] woodlands in Sacramento and the upper San Joaquin Valley of California where S. canadensis grows. The primary threat to this beetle species is loss of habitat, insecticide and herbicide use and lack of elderberry shrubs as a food plant ( Stevens, 2001 ; US Fish & Wildlife Service, 2017).

The primary threat to this beetle species is loss of habitat, insecticide and herbicide use and lack of elderberry shrubs as a food plant ( Stevens, 2001 ; US Fish & Wildlife Service, 2017). Sambucus canadensis can grow in temperate, tropical and subtropical climates with mean annual precipitation ranging from 400 mm to >2000 mm and mean annual temperature ranging from 5°C to 20°C (tolerates temperatures down to -20°C). In the northern part of its distribution range, this species overwinters in temperatures as low as -40°C. S. canadensis grows best in moist soils with pH ranging from 4.2 to 8.0. It is adapted to grow in swamps and bogs and in transition zones between wetland and upland ( Stevens, 2001 ; Charlebois et al., 2010 ).
