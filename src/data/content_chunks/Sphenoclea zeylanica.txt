 Reproduccion: The basic chromosome number for the family is x = 12 ( Les, 2017 ); chromosome counts of 2 n = 24, 32, 40, 42, 48 have been reported for S. zeylanica ( Lammers, 2016 ). Flowers of S. zeylanica are hermaphroditic. Although some insect pollination may occur, the plants are believed to be primarily autogamous (self-pollinated). The fruit-set output in this species is very high and almost every flower on every inflorescence sets fruit ( Cook, 1996 ; Les, 2017 ). In India, S. zeylanica has been recorded flowering and fruiting from November to January ( India Biodiversity Portal, 2018 ). In the United States, flowering and fruiting activity has been recorded from May to early December ( Carter et al., 2014 ). In China and tropical America, flowers and fruits are produced throughout the year ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2018 ; Flora of Nicaragua, 2018 ). Sphenoclea zeylanica is an annual, fast-growing herb ( Flora of Panama, 2018 ). Sphenoclea zeylanica is a plant of lowland tropical and subtropical areas where it inhabits freshwater to brackish wetlands with salinity ~18 ppt. This species can be found growing in standing water or as an emergent plant on nearly any type of damp substrate. It tolerates extreme water level fluctuations by becoming submersed seasonally and will also thrive under dry, more terrestrial conditions. Light is a requirement for germination. It prefers water pH of 6.9-8.0 and water depth <

It tolerates extreme water level fluctuations by becoming submersed seasonally and will also thrive under dry, more terrestrial conditions. Light is a requirement for germination. It prefers water pH of 6.9-8.0 and water depth <1 m. It is also adapted to both partial shade and sunny areas ( Caton et al., 2010 ; Useful Tropical Plants, 2014 ; Les, 2017 ).
