Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) Response  
Introduction to FAD Preparedness and Response Plan 
The Imperative for Foreign Animal Disease Preparedness and Response (FAD PReP) 
Why Prepare? 
An FAD outbreak in the United States will have many consequences. Animal health, 
and animal agriculture will be threatened; an FAD outbreak may impact the 
security, cost, and safety of our Nation’s food supply. Preparing for and responding 
to FADs—such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), classical swine fever 
(CSF), Newcastle disease (ND), and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)—are critical 
actions to safeguard animal health, public health, the environment, and the nation’s 
economy. Additionally, the social and psychological impact on producers, owners, 
and consumers can be significant.

Historic and Potential Future Consequences of an FAD Outbreak 
The 2001 FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom had an estimated impact between $12–18 billion.1 The United States has been free 
of FMD since 1929, but studies have estimated an incursion of FMD would result in detrimental economic losses; one study reached 
as high as $228 billion.2  The impact would come from lost international trade and disrupted interstate trade, as well as

of FMD since 1929, but studies have estimated an incursion of FMD would result in detrimental economic losses; one study reached 
as high as $228 billion.2  The impact would come from lost international trade and disrupted interstate trade, as well as from costs 
directly associated with the eradication effort, such as depopulation, indemnity, carcass disposal, and cleaning and disinfection. In 
addition, there would be direct and indirect costs related to foregone production, unemployment, and losses in related businesses.  
Between 2014 and 2015, the United States experienced its largest FAD outbreak, HPAI. Estimates suggest the outbreak had a $3.3 
billion impact on the U.S. economy, with $1.6 billion in direct losses from depopulated poultry flocks.3 In part, this was a 
consequence of partial or full trade embargoes from over 30 countries; there was a reported decline in poultry and egg exports of 14 
percent from January to June 2015. With these restrictions, egg prices where the highest observed in over 30 years (adjusted for 
inflation). 
FAD Investigations from 2001–2020 
In the past 20 years, there have been over 13,000 
possible FAD or emerging disease incidents 
investigated by APHIS Veterinary Services and State 
collaborators throughout the United States. In most 
years, only a small percentage of those were 
confirmed by the investigation to be an emerging 
disease or FAD, but as noted above, the introduction 
of a single contagious FAD can result in serious 
consequences. It is imperative we continue to remain

The Goals and Mission of FAD PReP 
In the event of an FAD outbreak in the United States, the three response goals are to  
1. detect, control, and contain the disease in animals as quickly as possible; 
2. eradicate the disease using strategies that seek to protect public health and the 
environment, and stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply, and the economy; and 
3. provide science- and risk-based approaches and systems to facilitate continuity of 
business for non-infected animals and non-contaminated animal products. 
Achieving these three goals will allow individual livestock facilities, States, Tribes, regions, and industries to resume normal 
production as rapidly as possible. The objective is to allow the United States to regain disease-free status without the response 
effort causing more disruption and damage than the disease outbreak itself.

products, and services for 
preparing for and 
responding to animal 
health emergencies.  
Challenges & Lessons Learned 
Challenges of Responding to an FAD 
Responding to an FAD event—large or small—may be complex and difficult, challenging all stakeholders involved. A response effort 
must have the capability to be rapidly scaled to the incident. This may involve many resources, personnel, and countermeasures.  
Establishing commonly accepted and understood response goals and guidelines, as accomplished by the FAD PReP materials, will 
help to broaden awareness of accepted objectives as well as potential problems.  
Lessons Learned from Past FAD Outbreaks

Lessons Learned from Past FAD Outbreaks 
In order to achieve successful outcomes in future FAD response efforts, it is important to identify, understand, and apply lessons 
learned. FAD PReP uses these lessons as a foundation for developing documents and materials: 
• Provides unified State-Federal-Tribal-industry planning that respects local knowledge. 
• Ensures there are clearly defined, obtainable, and unified goals for response. 
• Employs science-based and risk-management approaches that protect public health, animal health, the environment, the 
food supply, and the U.S. economy.  
• Ensures guidelines, strategies, and procedures are communicated and understood by responders and stakeholders. 
• Resolves competing interests prior to an outbreak and addresses them q uickly during an outbreak. 
• Ensures there is the capability for rapid detection and effective FAD tracing.  
• Acknowledges that high expectations for successful outcomes may require the rapid scale-up of resources during an event.
