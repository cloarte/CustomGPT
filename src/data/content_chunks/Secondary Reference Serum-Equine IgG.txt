1. Reagent Name: Secondary Reference Serum-Equine IgG; Stock for Equine IgG Species 
Standard 
2. Strain or Source: Defibrinated Equine plasma 
3. Lot Number: 10849 
4. Fill Date: March 2003 
5. Expiration Date: April 30, 2026 
Precautions: This material has Sodium Azide at a final concentration of 0.1% w/v. Skin 
exposure should be treated by washing with soap and water. Eye exposure should be 
treated by flushing with a running stream of water under low pressure for at least twenty 
minutes. Cases of ingestion or injection need immediate consultation with a health care 
professional. Disposal should be conducted in consultation with the institutional safety 
committee. 
6. Intended Use: This serum based secondary reference is for use in assays designed to 
detect and quantify equine IgG. Detection methods are limited to those relying on specific 
reagents such as antibodies directed against equine IgG since other equine serum proteins 
including immunoglobulins are present in this preparation. This is a concentrate and must be 
diluted as indicated in “Instructions for Use” for preparation of the Equine Ig

reagents such as antibodies directed against equine IgG since other equine serum proteins 
including immunoglobulins are present in this preparation. This is a concentrate and must be 
diluted as indicated in “Instructions for Use” for preparation of the Equine IgG Species Standard. 
7. Instructions for Use: This preparation is provided as frozen preparation containing 
28.02 mg/mL ± 0.56 mg/mL (2SD) (2802 mg/dL or 2802 mg%) Equine IgG, that is diluted 1/6 
(1 part Secondary reference equine serum IgG is diluted with 5 parts of buffer). This final 
material is the equine IgG Species Standard described in 9 CFR 113.499(a).6. The value is 
nominally at 400 mg/dL which is accepted as the serum level of IgG consistent with passive 
protection in foals and is within the margin of error for the assay. The recommended buffer is 
0.05M Sodium Phosphate containing 0.15M NaCl at pH 7.2. 
8. Test of Reagent: This reagent is positive for equine IgG and contains 28.02 mg/mL 
(2802 mg/dL or 2802 mg%). 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 2.0-mL cryogenic vials; 1.0 mL/vial.

10. Storage Conditions: It is recommended that the contents of each vial be dispensed in 
aliquots of approximately 200 µL upon receipt and then frozen at -20°C or less in a sealed 
container. This precaution is essential in order to avoid the denaturing effects of repeated 
freezing and thawing and to conserve the reference.
