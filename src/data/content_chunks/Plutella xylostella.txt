 Reproduccion: Plutella xylostella individuals are genetically similar worldwide, with substantial gene flow having been documented among distant geographic populations ( Caprio and Tabashnik, 1992 ; Chang et al., 1997 ; Li et al., 2006 ; Pichon et al., 2006 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Murthy et al., 2014 ; Perry et al., 2020 ). However, genetically distinct entities (e.g. individuals that resist certain insecticides) may be present within local populations ( Tabashnik et al., 1997 ). Plutella xylostella is a holometabolous insect with four life stages, egg, larva, pupa and imago (adult). Mating takes place soon after adults emerge, generally at night and duration of copulation may be 50 to 109 min ( Lee et al., 1995 ). Females oviposit most of the eggs on the first day after copulation and depending on number of matings they produce 71.27 ± 4.68 to 127.87 ± 21.98 eggs ( Wang et al., 2005 ).

 soon after adults emerge, generally at night and duration of copulation may be 50 to 109 min ( Lee et al., 1995 ). Females oviposit most of the eggs on the first day after copulation and depending on number of matings they produce 71.27 ± 4.68 to 127.87 ± 21.98 eggs ( Wang et al., 2005 ). Multiple matings reduce fecundity and reproductive success. Development of each life stage is as follows: Egg- The small (0.44 x 0.26 mm) yellowish eggs can readily be seen in the field using a hand lens ( Harcourt, 1961 ). The incubation period of P. xylostella eggs depends upon temperature. Harcourt (1957) reported it to be 4-8 days in Ontario, Canada, the average being 5.6 days, whereas in Malaysia, it averaged only 3 days ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). Yamada and Kawasaki (1983) have determined the effective thermal total (degree-days) for the development of the egg to be 52 above 7.2°C (threshold temperature for egg development). The rate of hatching is negatively correlated with temperature ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). Larva- There are four instars. The first instar normally mines in the leaf tissue. After the first instar, the larvae are surface feeders and eat voraciously. Fully-grown caterpillars are green and 10-12 mm long ( New South Wales Department of Agriculture, 1983 ). The rate of development of larvae is temperature dependent. Development of the larval stage was 15-21 days (first instar, 4.0-5.5; second instar, 3.5-4.5; third instar, 3.4-5.0; and fourth instar, 4.2-5.6) in Ontario ( Harcourt, 1957 ), 10-30 days in New South Wales,

 dependent. Development of the larval stage was 15-21 days (first instar, 4.0-5.5; second instar, 3.5-4.5; third instar, 3.4-5.0; and fourth instar, 4.2-5.6) in Ontario ( Harcourt, 1957 ), 10-30 days in New South Wales, Australia ( New South Wales Department of Agriculture, 1983 ); but only 6 days in Malaysia ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). In Yamada and Kawasaki's (1983) laboratory study, the larval period ranged from 7.8 to 19.5 days at the temperature range of 32.5-17.5°C. With a threshold temperature of 8.5°C, the effective thermal total (degree-days) for larval development is 161 ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). Liu et al. (1985) detected differences in developmental rate among field populations. They concluded this to be due to the differences in field environments such as climate, food source, etc. Thus, differences among populations and temperature conditions should be taken into account while predicting build-up of populations of P. xylostella larvae and deciding the time of sampling. Idris (1998) and Sarfraz et al. (2007; 2011) reported that the developmental times of P. xylostella larvae were significantly affected by feeding on various cultivated and wild food plants. The nutritional quality of host plants also affects larval development times ( Sarfraz et al., 2009b ). Pupa- The pupae are encased in loosely woven cocoons, often fastened to the plant parts (mostly leaves) and frequently hidden in crevices near the bud. Spinning of the cocoon by the fully-grown larvae is followed by 1 or 2 days of quiescence that marks the prepupal stage. The time from cocoon spinning to pupation is

 ). Pupa- The pupae are encased in loosely woven cocoons, often fastened to the plant parts (mostly leaves) and frequently hidden in crevices near the bud. Spinning of the cocoon by the fully-grown larvae is followed by 1 or 2 days of quiescence that marks the prepupal stage. The time from cocoon spinning to pupation is temperature dependent; maximum development being at 27.5°C ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). In Ontario, the prepupal stage varied from 1 to 2 days and the pupal stage from 5 to 15 days with an average of 8.5 days ( Harcourt, 1957 ), whereas in New South Wales, Australia the pupal stage is reported to be 1-2 weeks. In tropical countries such as Malaysia, the pupal period may be less than 4 days ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). According to Yamada and Kawasaki (1983) , the pupal period under laboratory conditions ranges from 3.9 to 9.6 days for a temperature range of 32.5-17.5°C. The threshold temperature for pupal development is 9.8°C, the effective thermal total (day-degrees) for the pupal stage is calculated to be 61. The rate of adult emergence is 42-53.4% within the temperature range of 17.5-27.5°C. Above this temperature, emergence decreases ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). Adult- The sex ratio is more or less 1:1. Mating begins at dusk on the day of emergence. Oviposition begins shortly after dusk and reaches its peak about 2 h later; few eggs are laid after midnight. The average longevity of female and male is 16 and 12 days, respectively. Almost 95% of the females begin laying eggs on the day of emergence; this process lasts 10 days and the number of eggs laid per female ranges from 159 (

ating begins at dusk on the day of emergence. Oviposition begins shortly after dusk and reaches its peak about 2 h later; few eggs are laid after midnight. The average longevity of female and male is 16 and 12 days, respectively. Almost 95% of the females begin laying eggs on the day of emergence; this process lasts 10 days and the number of eggs laid per female ranges from 159 ( Harcourt, 1957 ) to 288 ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). Sivapragasam and Heong (1984) showed that temperature had a significant effect on adult survival, oviposition rates and generation and that the temperature most favourable for P. xylostella was around 30°C on the basis of the intrinsic rate of increase (rmax). The relationship between temperature and longevity fitted a logistic equation whilst relationships of oviposition rate and rmax with temperature fitted polynomial equations. Generations- P. xylostella has a wide ecological tolerance, which enables it to reproduce under extremely varied climatic conditions. As its life history is influenced by temperature, the generation time varies accordingly ( Chua and Lim, 1977 ). In warm conditions the life cycle takes about 3 weeks although it may sometimes be as short as 16 days ( New South Wales Department of Agriculture, 1983 ). In more temperate climates it may be extended up to 6 weeks ( Canada Department of Agriculture, 1976 ) or more ( Harcourt, 1957 ). Wu (1968) determined that one generation could be completed in 13-34 days at room temperature (23°C), 13-37 days in field conditions and 17-20 days at a constant temperature of 23°C. Thus, there could be as many as 19 generations of this pest per annum in the laboratory and 18 generations outside. However, in the field, 10-14 generations have been recorded in the tropics ( Hardy, 1938 ; Bonnemaison, 1965 ; Abraham and Padmanaban, 1968 ; K

 days in field conditions and 17-20 days at a constant temperature of 23°C. Thus, there could be as many as 19 generations of this pest per annum in the laboratory and 18 generations outside. However, in the field, 10-14 generations have been recorded in the tropics ( Hardy, 1938 ; Bonnemaison, 1965 ; Abraham and Padmanaban, 1968 ; Koshihara and Yamada, 1981 ) but only four generations in cold places such as Ottawa, Canada ( Harcourt, 1957 ). Harcourt (1954) calculated that one generation of P. xylostella required 283 degree-days in the laboratory above a threshold of 7.3°C, whereas Bahar et al. (2014) reported 143 degree-days above a threshold of 4.23°C. Similar results (293 degree-days) were also obtained under field conditions ( Butts and McEwen, 1981 ). Umeya and Yamada (1973) detected slight local differences in development characteristics such as threshold temperature (ranging from 7.4 to 9.5°C) but concluded that these differences were related neither to the geographical location nor to the climatic gradient. Seasonality- P. xylostella breeds all the year round in the tropics but in colder regions it likely overwinters in a quiescent state in no specific overwintering stage ( Harcourt, 1954 ; Razumov, 1970 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). In places of extremely low temperature where the moth cannot even hibernate, annual infestations arise from adult migration from nearby warmer regions in the spring ( Harcourt, 1961 ; Putnam, 1978 ; Butts and McEwen, 1981 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Yang et al., 2015 ).

 arise from adult migration from nearby warmer regions in the spring ( Harcourt, 1961 ; Putnam, 1978 ; Butts and McEwen, 1981 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). In Canada, seasonal abundance of P. xylostella in any given year depends on two major factors: overwintering populations in the southern USA and northern Mexico, and spring winds to transport the moths north into eastern and western Canada ( Harcourt and Cass, 1966 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). Many reports describe the seasonal abundance of diamondback moth in relation to different climatic conditions ( Harcourt, 1957 ; Shaw, 1959 ; Wu, 1968 ; Iga, 1985 ). Although the moth breeds throughout the year in tropical conditions, the species, along with many other leaf-feeding insects, infests cruciferous crops such as Chinese cabbage or common cabbage during the cool and dry season. Heavy rain appears to be detrimental to infestation ( Talekar and Lee, 1985 ). However, Yamada and Kawasaki (1983) reported that the rates of development (e.g. hatching, pupation, adult emergence) of P. xylostella were not affected by the level of humidity. Rainfall, along with other limiting factors (e.g. food scarcity, natural enemies), influences its population density as shown in life table and other ecological studies ( Harcourt, 1963 ; Iga, 1985 ; Sivapragasam et al., 1988 ). Understanding of the physiological processes of P. xylostella has advanced in recent years and offers the potential to revolutionize management of this pest ( Philips et al., 2014 ).

Molecular technologies have played an important role. Gong et al. (2010) cloned and sequenced two full-length cDNA codings for chemosensory proteins, and determined that these proteins are found in all larval stages and thus may have olfactory and non-olfactory functions. Shi et al. (2020) found the genes, Fib-L, P25 and Fib-H, that are involved in cocoon spinning and cocoon structure in the final instar of P. xylostella larvae. Sun et al. (2013) identified and cloned six candidate pheromone receptor genes in P. xyllostella which display male-biased expression and Lee et al. (2011) found that suppression of P. xyllostella pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (Plx-PBANr) reduced pheromone production of females. Bautista et al. (2009) found that overexpression of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP6BG1 is linked to resistance of P. xylostella larvae to permethrin. Endersby et al. (2011) documented that the skdrl and cdr alleles of the sodium channel para gene confer resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Australian populations of P. xylostella . Ward et al. (2021) identified an amino acid substitution linked to diamide resistance. You et al. (2013) performed whole-genome sequence of P. xylostella and identified 1412 unique genes associated with perception and the detoxification of plant defence compounds. Xia et al. (2013) and Li et al.

(2017) used DNA sequencing to examine the midgut microbiota of P. xylostella and found differences in the midgut microbiota among susceptible and insecticide-resistant lines. Shi et al. (2013; 2015) found that parasitism by Cotesia vestalis significantly downregulated, or delayed, expression of genes encoding pro-neuropeptides and may account for the previously decreased feeding behaviour, reduced growth rates and aborted development in the host larvae. Xu et al. (2017) identified 23 miRNAs some of which play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction between P. xylostella and Isaria fumosorosea [ Cordyceps fumosorosea ]. Plutella xylostella adults live for approximately 33.5 days after emergence under ideal conditions (e.g. temperatures from 22.4 to 29.8ºC and 38-80% relative humidity) ( Canico et al., 2013 ). However, other factors such as food quality, body size, temperature regimes and abiotic factors influence longevity (see Atwal, 1955 ; Shirai, 1995 ; Mohapatra et al., 2006 ; Golizadeh et al., 2009 ). Plutella xylostella appears not to hibernate during cold periods nor does it aestivate during hot spells. In cool conditions, it undergoes quiescent periods whereby reproduction processes are reduced ( Gu, 2009 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). It is a highly migrant species ( Chu, 1986 ; Chapman et al., 2002 ; Furlong et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2013 ) and what triggers this

 hibernate during cold periods nor does it aestivate during hot spells. In cool conditions, it undergoes quiescent periods whereby reproduction processes are reduced ( Gu, 2009 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). It is a highly migrant species ( Chu, 1986 ; Chapman et al., 2002 ; Furlong et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2013 ) and what triggers this behaviour is still unknown. Populations of P. xylostella can reach extremely high numbers depending on number of generations, food availability and mortality parameters. A study at Uttar Pradesh, India in cauliflower found that population densities of P. xylostella were highest (31.43 larvae and pupae/plant at one location) at the end of September when favourable temperatures (13.4 to 24.8°C) and relative humidity (59.3 to 89.0 %), low rainfall (14.0 mm) and parasitism levels of 10% occurred ( Ahmad and Ansari, 2010 ).
 Sintomas: The first-instar (neonate) larvae mine into leaf tissue immediately after hatching and emerge to become surface feeders beginning in the second instar. With their chewing mouthparts the larvae feed voraciously on the leaves leaving a papery epidermis intact. This type of damage gives the appearance of translucent windows or 'shot holes' in the leaf blades. P. xylostella larvae and, in many cases, pupae are found on the damaged leaves. In cases of severe infestation, entire leaves could be lost, leaving only the veins.

The time from cocoon spinning to pupation is temperature dependent; maximum development being at 27.5°C ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). In Ontario, the prepupal stage varied from 1 to 2 days and the pupal stage from 5 to 15 days with an average of 8.5 days ( Harcourt, 1957 ), whereas in New South Wales, Australia the pupal stage is reported to be 1-2 weeks. In tropical countries such as Malaysia, the pupal period may be less than 4 days ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ).

The relationship between temperature and longevity fitted a logistic equation whilst relationships of oviposition rate and rmax with temperature fitted polynomial equations. Generations- P. xylostella has a wide ecological tolerance, which enables it to reproduce under extremely varied climatic conditions. As its life history is influenced by temperature, the generation time varies accordingly ( Chua and Lim, 1977 ). In warm conditions the life cycle takes about 3 weeks although it may sometimes be as short as 16 days ( New South Wales Department of Agriculture, 1983 ). In more temperate climates it may be extended up to 6 weeks ( Canada Department of Agriculture, 1976 ) or more ( Harcourt, 1957 ). Wu (1968) determined that one generation could be completed in 13-34 days at room temperature (23°C), 13-37 days in field conditions and 17-20 days at a constant temperature of 23°C. Thus, there could be as many as 19 generations of this pest per annum in the laboratory and 18 generations outside. However, in the field, 10-14 generations have been recorded in the tropics ( Hardy, 1938 ; Bonnemaison, 1965 ; Abraham and Padmanaban, 1968 ; Koshihara and Yamada, 1981 ) but only four generations in cold places such as Ottawa, Canada ( Harcourt, 1957 ). Harcourt (1954) calculated that one generation of P. xylostella required 283 degree-days in the laboratory above a threshold of 7.3°C, whereas Bahar et al. (2014) reported 143 degree-days above a threshold of 4.23°C. Similar results (293 degree-days) were also obtained under field conditions ( Butts and McEwen, 1981 ). Umeya and Yamada (1973) detected slight local differences in development characteristics such as threshold temperature (ranging from 7

 threshold of 7.3°C, whereas Bahar et al. (2014) reported 143 degree-days above a threshold of 4.23°C. Similar results (293 degree-days) were also obtained under field conditions ( Butts and McEwen, 1981 ). Umeya and Yamada (1973) detected slight local differences in development characteristics such as threshold temperature (ranging from 7.4 to 9.5°C) but concluded that these differences were related neither to the geographical location nor to the climatic gradient. Seasonality- P. xylostella breeds all the year round in the tropics but in colder regions it likely overwinters in a quiescent state in no specific overwintering stage ( Harcourt, 1954 ; Razumov, 1970 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). In places of extremely low temperature where the moth cannot even hibernate, annual infestations arise from adult migration from nearby warmer regions in the spring ( Harcourt, 1961 ; Putnam, 1978 ; Butts and McEwen, 1981 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). In Canada, seasonal abundance of P. xylostella in any given year depends on two major factors: overwintering populations in the southern USA and northern Mexico, and spring winds to transport the moths north into eastern and western Canada ( Harcourt and Cass, 1966 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). Many reports describe the seasonal abundance of diamondback moth in relation to different climatic conditions ( Harcourt, 1957 ; Shaw, 1959 ; Wu, 1968 ; Iga, 1985 ). Although the moth breeds throughout the year in tropical conditions, the species, along with many other leaf-feeding insects, infests cruciferous crops such as Chinese cabbage or common cabbage during the cool and dry season. Heavy rain appears to be detrimental to infestation ( Tal

 in relation to different climatic conditions ( Harcourt, 1957 ; Shaw, 1959 ; Wu, 1968 ; Iga, 1985 ). Although the moth breeds throughout the year in tropical conditions, the species, along with many other leaf-feeding insects, infests cruciferous crops such as Chinese cabbage or common cabbage during the cool and dry season. Heavy rain appears to be detrimental to infestation ( Talekar and Lee, 1985 ). However, Yamada and Kawasaki (1983) reported that the rates of development (e.g. hatching, pupation, adult emergence) of P. xylostella were not affected by the level of humidity. Rainfall, along with other limiting factors (e.g. food scarcity, natural enemies), influences its population density as shown in life table and other ecological studies ( Harcourt, 1963 ; Iga, 1985 ; Sivapragasam et al., 1988 ). Physiology and Phenology Understanding of the physiological processes of P. xylostella has advanced in recent years and offers the potential to revolutionize management of this pest ( Philips et al., 2014 ). Molecular technologies have played an important role. Gong et al. (2010) cloned and sequenced two full-length cDNA codings for chemosensory proteins, and determined that these proteins are found in all larval stages and thus may have olfactory and non-olfactory functions. Shi et al. (2020) found the genes, Fib-L, P25 and Fib-H, that are involved in cocoon spinning and cocoon structure in the final instar of P. xylostella larvae. Sun et al. (2013) identified and cloned six candidate pheromone receptor genes in P. xyllostella which display male-biased expression and Lee et al. (2011) found that suppression of P. xyllostella pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (Pl

 structure in the final instar of P. xylostella larvae. Sun et al. (2013) identified and cloned six candidate pheromone receptor genes in P. xyllostella which display male-biased expression and Lee et al. (2011) found that suppression of P. xyllostella pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (Plx-PBANr) reduced pheromone production of females. Bautista et al. (2009) found that overexpression of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP6BG1 is linked to resistance of P. xylostella larvae to permethrin. Endersby et al. (2011) documented that the skdrl and cdr alleles of the sodium channel para gene confer resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Australian populations of P. xylostella . Ward et al. (2021) identified an amino acid substitution linked to diamide resistance. You et al. (2013) performed whole-genome sequence of P. xylostella and identified 1412 unique genes associated with perception and the detoxification of plant defence compounds. Xia et al. (2013) and Li et al. (2017) used DNA sequencing to examine the midgut microbiota of P. xylostella and found differences in the midgut microbiota among susceptible and insecticide-resistant lines. Shi et al. (2013; 2015) found that parasitism by Cotesia vestalis significantly downregulated, or delayed, expression of genes encoding pro-neuropeptides and may account for the previously decreased feeding behaviour, reduced growth rates and aborted development in the host larvae. Xu et al. (2017) identified 23 miRNAs some of which play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction between P. xylostella and Isaria fumosorosea [ Cordyceps fumosorosea

(2017) identified 23 miRNAs some of which play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction between P. xylostella and Isaria fumosorosea [ Cordyceps fumosorosea ]. Longevity Plutella xylostella adults live for approximately 33.5 days after emergence under ideal conditions (e.g. temperatures from 22.4 to 29.8ºC and 38-80% relative humidity) ( Canico et al., 2013 ). However, other factors such as food quality, body size, temperature regimes and abiotic factors influence longevity (see Atwal, 1955 ; Shirai, 1995 ; Mohapatra et al., 2006 ; Golizadeh et al., 2009 ). Activity Patterns Plutella xylostella appears not to hibernate during cold periods nor does it aestivate during hot spells. In cool conditions, it undergoes quiescent periods whereby reproduction processes are reduced ( Gu, 2009 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). It is a highly migrant species ( Chu, 1986 ; Chapman et al., 2002 ; Furlong et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2013 ) and what triggers this behaviour is still unknown. Population Size and Density Populations of P. xylostella can reach extremely high numbers depending on number of generations, food availability and mortality parameters. A study at Uttar Pradesh, India in cauliflower found that population densities of P. xylostella were highest (31.43 larvae and pupae/plant at one location) at the end of September when favourable temperatures (13.4 to 24.8°C) and relative humidity (59.3 to 89.0 %), low rainfall (14.0 mm) and parasitism levels of 10% occurred ( Ahmad

Ranges in size from about 1.3 mm when hatching to a length of 8.6 mm in the fourth instar. Wriggles rapidly when disturbed and may drop from plant by a silken thread.BiologyHostsMany, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, collards, kale, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, turnip, radish, mustard, and watercress.Life cycleThe moth mates in the evening hours and lays eggs singly or in loose groups attached to the foliage. Larvae hatch in 3-5 days and develop through 4 larval instars in about 11 days under warm temperature conditions. First instar larvae feed on just the underside of leaves, causing a "window pane" effect - the upper epidermis still intact. Fourth instar larvae spin cocoons attached to lower leaf surfaces or the stem. Moths emerge from cocoons in about a week. The entire life cycle under warm conditions is approximately 3-4 weeks.Seasonal distributionIn Georgia there are multiple generations per year, with generation time slowing considerably in the winter months. Traditionally numbers were very low in the winter, but in recent years, greater moth activity has been noted when temperatures are higher than normal in December and January.Damage to CropLarvae feed on foliage with early instars causing window paning or small channels in the leaf surface and larger larvae causing perforations in the leaf. Low populations, under 0.3 larvae/plant, are not economically damaging early in the growing season, but should be controlled above this level. Cocoons are a source of insect contaminants late in the season and should be prevented 3 weeks before harvest.ManagementScout weekly to determine if 0.3 larvae/plant threshold has been reached.

Cocoons are a source of insect contaminants late in the season and should be prevented 3 weeks before harvest.ManagementScout weekly to determine if 0.3 larvae/plant threshold has been reached. Allow a 1-2 month production break in mid-summer to avoid building up populations between spring and fall (note populations tend to be lower in the winter months in many years). Rotate insecticides as this insect can temporarily developresistanceto many pesticides with their excessive use. In Georgia, excessive, season-long use of a single insecticide ingredient has recently resulted in high levels of insecticide resistance to even some of the newest chemistries. Encourage beneficial insects, e.g. the wasp parasitoid Diadegama insulare, by avoiding chemicals toxic to parasitoids with effective alternatives like Bacillus thuringiensis sprays.Originally compiled fromInsects Associated with Vegetable Crops in Georgia: Cole CropsRetrieved from "http://wiki.bugwood.org/index.php?title=Plutella_xylostella&oldid=3977"

 Reproduccion: Plutella xylostella individuals are genetically similar worldwide, with substantial gene flow having been documented among distant geographic populations ( Caprio and Tabashnik, 1992 ; Chang et al., 1997 ; Li et al., 2006 ; Pichon et al., 2006 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Murthy et al., 2014 ; Perry et al., 2020 ). However, genetically distinct entities (e.g. individuals that resist certain insecticides) may be present within local populations ( Tabashnik et al., 1997 ). Plutella xylostella is a holometabolous insect with four life stages, egg, larva, pupa and imago (adult). Mating takes place soon after adults emerge, generally at night and duration of copulation may be 50 to 109 min ( Lee et al., 1995 ). Females oviposit most of the eggs on the first day after copulation and depending on number of matings they produce 71.27 ± 4.68 to 127.87 ± 21.98 eggs ( Wang et al., 2005 ).

 soon after adults emerge, generally at night and duration of copulation may be 50 to 109 min ( Lee et al., 1995 ). Females oviposit most of the eggs on the first day after copulation and depending on number of matings they produce 71.27 ± 4.68 to 127.87 ± 21.98 eggs ( Wang et al., 2005 ). Multiple matings reduce fecundity and reproductive success. Development of each life stage is as follows: Egg- The small (0.44 x 0.26 mm) yellowish eggs can readily be seen in the field using a hand lens ( Harcourt, 1961 ). The incubation period of P. xylostella eggs depends upon temperature. Harcourt (1957) reported it to be 4-8 days in Ontario, Canada, the average being 5.6 days, whereas in Malaysia, it averaged only 3 days ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). Yamada and Kawasaki (1983) have determined the effective thermal total (degree-days) for the development of the egg to be 52 above 7.2°C (threshold temperature for egg development). The rate of hatching is negatively correlated with temperature ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). Larva- There are four instars. The first instar normally mines in the leaf tissue. After the first instar, the larvae are surface feeders and eat voraciously. Fully-grown caterpillars are green and 10-12 mm long ( New South Wales Department of Agriculture, 1983 ). The rate of development of larvae is temperature dependent. Development of the larval stage was 15-21 days (first instar, 4.0-5.5; second instar, 3.5-4.5; third instar, 3.4-5.0; and fourth instar, 4.2-5.6) in Ontario ( Harcourt, 1957 ), 10-30 days in New South Wales,

 dependent. Development of the larval stage was 15-21 days (first instar, 4.0-5.5; second instar, 3.5-4.5; third instar, 3.4-5.0; and fourth instar, 4.2-5.6) in Ontario ( Harcourt, 1957 ), 10-30 days in New South Wales, Australia ( New South Wales Department of Agriculture, 1983 ); but only 6 days in Malaysia ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). In Yamada and Kawasaki's (1983) laboratory study, the larval period ranged from 7.8 to 19.5 days at the temperature range of 32.5-17.5°C. With a threshold temperature of 8.5°C, the effective thermal total (degree-days) for larval development is 161 ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). Liu et al. (1985) detected differences in developmental rate among field populations. They concluded this to be due to the differences in field environments such as climate, food source, etc. Thus, differences among populations and temperature conditions should be taken into account while predicting build-up of populations of P. xylostella larvae and deciding the time of sampling. Idris (1998) and Sarfraz et al. (2007; 2011) reported that the developmental times of P. xylostella larvae were significantly affected by feeding on various cultivated and wild food plants. The nutritional quality of host plants also affects larval development times ( Sarfraz et al., 2009b ). Pupa- The pupae are encased in loosely woven cocoons, often fastened to the plant parts (mostly leaves) and frequently hidden in crevices near the bud. Spinning of the cocoon by the fully-grown larvae is followed by 1 or 2 days of quiescence that marks the prepupal stage. The time from cocoon spinning to pupation is

 ). Pupa- The pupae are encased in loosely woven cocoons, often fastened to the plant parts (mostly leaves) and frequently hidden in crevices near the bud. Spinning of the cocoon by the fully-grown larvae is followed by 1 or 2 days of quiescence that marks the prepupal stage. The time from cocoon spinning to pupation is temperature dependent; maximum development being at 27.5°C ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). In Ontario, the prepupal stage varied from 1 to 2 days and the pupal stage from 5 to 15 days with an average of 8.5 days ( Harcourt, 1957 ), whereas in New South Wales, Australia the pupal stage is reported to be 1-2 weeks. In tropical countries such as Malaysia, the pupal period may be less than 4 days ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). According to Yamada and Kawasaki (1983) , the pupal period under laboratory conditions ranges from 3.9 to 9.6 days for a temperature range of 32.5-17.5°C. The threshold temperature for pupal development is 9.8°C, the effective thermal total (day-degrees) for the pupal stage is calculated to be 61. The rate of adult emergence is 42-53.4% within the temperature range of 17.5-27.5°C. Above this temperature, emergence decreases ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). Adult- The sex ratio is more or less 1:1. Mating begins at dusk on the day of emergence. Oviposition begins shortly after dusk and reaches its peak about 2 h later; few eggs are laid after midnight. The average longevity of female and male is 16 and 12 days, respectively. Almost 95% of the females begin laying eggs on the day of emergence; this process lasts 10 days and the number of eggs laid per female ranges from 159 (

ating begins at dusk on the day of emergence. Oviposition begins shortly after dusk and reaches its peak about 2 h later; few eggs are laid after midnight. The average longevity of female and male is 16 and 12 days, respectively. Almost 95% of the females begin laying eggs on the day of emergence; this process lasts 10 days and the number of eggs laid per female ranges from 159 ( Harcourt, 1957 ) to 288 ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ). Sivapragasam and Heong (1984) showed that temperature had a significant effect on adult survival, oviposition rates and generation and that the temperature most favourable for P. xylostella was around 30°C on the basis of the intrinsic rate of increase (rmax). The relationship between temperature and longevity fitted a logistic equation whilst relationships of oviposition rate and rmax with temperature fitted polynomial equations. Generations- P. xylostella has a wide ecological tolerance, which enables it to reproduce under extremely varied climatic conditions. As its life history is influenced by temperature, the generation time varies accordingly ( Chua and Lim, 1977 ). In warm conditions the life cycle takes about 3 weeks although it may sometimes be as short as 16 days ( New South Wales Department of Agriculture, 1983 ). In more temperate climates it may be extended up to 6 weeks ( Canada Department of Agriculture, 1976 ) or more ( Harcourt, 1957 ). Wu (1968) determined that one generation could be completed in 13-34 days at room temperature (23°C), 13-37 days in field conditions and 17-20 days at a constant temperature of 23°C. Thus, there could be as many as 19 generations of this pest per annum in the laboratory and 18 generations outside. However, in the field, 10-14 generations have been recorded in the tropics ( Hardy, 1938 ; Bonnemaison, 1965 ; Abraham and Padmanaban, 1968 ; K

 days in field conditions and 17-20 days at a constant temperature of 23°C. Thus, there could be as many as 19 generations of this pest per annum in the laboratory and 18 generations outside. However, in the field, 10-14 generations have been recorded in the tropics ( Hardy, 1938 ; Bonnemaison, 1965 ; Abraham and Padmanaban, 1968 ; Koshihara and Yamada, 1981 ) but only four generations in cold places such as Ottawa, Canada ( Harcourt, 1957 ). Harcourt (1954) calculated that one generation of P. xylostella required 283 degree-days in the laboratory above a threshold of 7.3°C, whereas Bahar et al. (2014) reported 143 degree-days above a threshold of 4.23°C. Similar results (293 degree-days) were also obtained under field conditions ( Butts and McEwen, 1981 ). Umeya and Yamada (1973) detected slight local differences in development characteristics such as threshold temperature (ranging from 7.4 to 9.5°C) but concluded that these differences were related neither to the geographical location nor to the climatic gradient. Seasonality- P. xylostella breeds all the year round in the tropics but in colder regions it likely overwinters in a quiescent state in no specific overwintering stage ( Harcourt, 1954 ; Razumov, 1970 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). In places of extremely low temperature where the moth cannot even hibernate, annual infestations arise from adult migration from nearby warmer regions in the spring ( Harcourt, 1961 ; Putnam, 1978 ; Butts and McEwen, 1981 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Yang et al., 2015 ).

 arise from adult migration from nearby warmer regions in the spring ( Harcourt, 1961 ; Putnam, 1978 ; Butts and McEwen, 1981 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). In Canada, seasonal abundance of P. xylostella in any given year depends on two major factors: overwintering populations in the southern USA and northern Mexico, and spring winds to transport the moths north into eastern and western Canada ( Harcourt and Cass, 1966 ; Hopkinson and Soroka, 2010 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). Many reports describe the seasonal abundance of diamondback moth in relation to different climatic conditions ( Harcourt, 1957 ; Shaw, 1959 ; Wu, 1968 ; Iga, 1985 ). Although the moth breeds throughout the year in tropical conditions, the species, along with many other leaf-feeding insects, infests cruciferous crops such as Chinese cabbage or common cabbage during the cool and dry season. Heavy rain appears to be detrimental to infestation ( Talekar and Lee, 1985 ). However, Yamada and Kawasaki (1983) reported that the rates of development (e.g. hatching, pupation, adult emergence) of P. xylostella were not affected by the level of humidity. Rainfall, along with other limiting factors (e.g. food scarcity, natural enemies), influences its population density as shown in life table and other ecological studies ( Harcourt, 1963 ; Iga, 1985 ; Sivapragasam et al., 1988 ). Understanding of the physiological processes of P. xylostella has advanced in recent years and offers the potential to revolutionize management of this pest ( Philips et al., 2014 ).

Molecular technologies have played an important role. Gong et al. (2010) cloned and sequenced two full-length cDNA codings for chemosensory proteins, and determined that these proteins are found in all larval stages and thus may have olfactory and non-olfactory functions. Shi et al. (2020) found the genes, Fib-L, P25 and Fib-H, that are involved in cocoon spinning and cocoon structure in the final instar of P. xylostella larvae. Sun et al. (2013) identified and cloned six candidate pheromone receptor genes in P. xyllostella which display male-biased expression and Lee et al. (2011) found that suppression of P. xyllostella pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (Plx-PBANr) reduced pheromone production of females. Bautista et al. (2009) found that overexpression of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP6BG1 is linked to resistance of P. xylostella larvae to permethrin. Endersby et al. (2011) documented that the skdrl and cdr alleles of the sodium channel para gene confer resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Australian populations of P. xylostella . Ward et al. (2021) identified an amino acid substitution linked to diamide resistance. You et al.

(2017) used DNA sequencing to examine the midgut microbiota of P. xylostella and found differences in the midgut microbiota among susceptible and insecticide-resistant lines. Shi et al. (2013; 2015) found that parasitism by Cotesia vestalis significantly downregulated, or delayed, expression of genes encoding pro-neuropeptides and may account for the previously decreased feeding behaviour, reduced growth rates and aborted development in the host larvae. Xu et al. (2017) identified 23 miRNAs some of which play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction between P. xylostella and Isaria fumosorosea [ Cordyceps fumosorosea ]. Plutella xylostella adults live for approximately 33.5 days after emergence under ideal conditions (e.g. temperatures from 22.4 to 29.8ºC and 38-80% relative humidity) ( Canico et al., 2013 ). However, other factors such as food quality, body size, temperature regimes and abiotic factors influence longevity (see Atwal, 1955 ; Shirai, 1995 ; Mohapatra et al., 2006 ; Golizadeh et al., 2009 ). Plutella xylostella appears not to hibernate during cold periods nor does it aestivate during hot spells. In cool conditions, it undergoes quiescent periods whereby reproduction processes are reduced ( Gu, 2009 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). It is a highly migrant species ( Chu, 1986 ; Chapman et al., 2002 ; Furlong et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2013 ) and what triggers this

In cool conditions, it undergoes quiescent periods whereby reproduction processes are reduced ( Gu, 2009 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). It is a highly migrant species ( Chu, 1986 ; Chapman et al., 2002 ; Furlong et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2013 ) and what triggers this behaviour is still unknown. Populations of P. xylostella can reach extremely high numbers depending on number of generations, food availability and mortality parameters. A study at Uttar Pradesh, India in cauliflower found that population densities of P. xylostella were highest (31.43 larvae and pupae/plant at one location) at the end of September when favourable temperatures (13.4 to 24.8°C) and relative humidity (59.3 to 89.0 %), low rainfall (14.0 mm) and parasitism levels of 10% occurred ( Ahmad and Ansari, 2010 ).
 Sintomas: The first-instar (neonate) larvae mine into leaf tissue immediately after hatching and emerge to become surface feeders beginning in the second instar. With their chewing mouthparts the larvae feed voraciously on the leaves leaving a papery epidermis intact. This type of damage gives the appearance of translucent windows or 'shot holes' in the leaf blades. P. xylostella larvae and, in many cases, pupae are found on the damaged leaves. In cases of severe infestation, entire leaves could be lost, leaving only the veins.

The time from cocoon spinning to pupation is temperature dependent; maximum development being at 27.5°C ( Yamada and Kawasaki, 1983 ). In Ontario, the prepupal stage varied from 1 to 2 days and the pupal stage from 5 to 15 days with an average of 8.5 days ( Harcourt, 1957 ), whereas in New South Wales, Australia the pupal stage is reported to be 1-2 weeks. In tropical countries such as Malaysia, the pupal period may be less than 4 days ( Ooi and Kelderman, 1979 ).

(2009) found that overexpression of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP6BG1 is linked to resistance of P. xylostella larvae to permethrin. Endersby et al. (2011) documented that the skdrl and cdr alleles of the sodium channel para gene confer resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Australian populations of P. xylostella . Ward et al. (2021) identified an amino acid substitution linked to diamide resistance. You et al. (2013) performed whole-genome sequence of P. xylostella and identified 1412 unique genes associated with perception and the detoxification of plant defence compounds. Xia et al. (2013) and Li et al. (2017) used DNA sequencing to examine the midgut microbiota of P. xylostella and found differences in the midgut microbiota among susceptible and insecticide-resistant lines. Shi et al. (2013; 2015) found that parasitism by Cotesia vestalis significantly downregulated, or delayed, expression of genes encoding pro-neuropeptides and may account for the previously decreased feeding behaviour, reduced growth rates and aborted development in the host larvae. Xu et al. (2017) identified 23 miRNAs some of which play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction between P. xylostella and Isaria fumosorosea [ Cordyceps fumosorosea

 encoding pro-neuropeptides and may account for the previously decreased feeding behaviour, reduced growth rates and aborted development in the host larvae. Xu et al. (2017) identified 23 miRNAs some of which play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction between P. xylostella and Isaria fumosorosea [ Cordyceps fumosorosea ]. Longevity Plutella xylostella adults live for approximately 33.5 days after emergence under ideal conditions (e.g. temperatures from 22.4 to 29.8ºC and 38-80% relative humidity) ( Canico et al., 2013 ). However, other factors such as food quality, body size, temperature regimes and abiotic factors influence longevity (see Atwal, 1955 ; Shirai, 1995 ; Mohapatra et al., 2006 ; Golizadeh et al., 2009 ). Activity Patterns Plutella xylostella appears not to hibernate during cold periods nor does it aestivate during hot spells. In cool conditions, it undergoes quiescent periods whereby reproduction processes are reduced ( Gu, 2009 ; Dancau et al., 2018 ). It is a highly migrant species ( Chu, 1986 ; Chapman et al., 2002 ; Furlong et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2013 ) and what triggers this behaviour is still unknown. Population Size and Density Populations of P. xylostella can reach extremely high numbers depending on number of generations, food availability and mortality parameters. A study at Uttar Pradesh, India in cauliflower found that population densities of P. xylostella were highest (31.43 larvae and pupae/plant at one location) at the end of September when favourable temperatures (13.4 to 24.8°C) and relative humidity (59.3 to 89.0 %), low rainfall (14.0 mm) and parasitism levels of 10% occurred ( Ahmad

. Larvae are light to dark green, tapering slightly at both ends with four pairs of prolegs, with slightly darker head and scattered hairs. Ranges in size from about 1.3 mm when hatching to a length of 8.6 mm in the fourth instar. Wriggles rapidly when disturbed and may drop from plant by a silken thread.BiologyHostsMany, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, collards, kale, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, turnip, radish, mustard, and watercress.Life cycleThe moth mates in the evening hours and lays eggs singly or in loose groups attached to the foliage. Larvae hatch in 3-5 days and develop through 4 larval instars in about 11 days under warm temperature conditions. First instar larvae feed on just the underside of leaves, causing a "window pane" effect - the upper epidermis still intact. Fourth instar larvae spin cocoons attached to lower leaf surfaces or the stem. Moths emerge from cocoons in about a week. The entire life cycle under warm conditions is approximately 3-4 weeks.Seasonal distributionIn Georgia there are multiple generations per year, with generation time slowing considerably in the winter months. Traditionally numbers were very low in the winter, but in recent years, greater moth activity has been noted when temperatures are higher than normal in December and January.Damage to CropLarvae feed on foliage with early instars causing window paning or small channels in the leaf surface and larger larvae causing perforations in the leaf. Low populations, under 0.3 larvae/plant, are not economically damaging early in the growing season, but should be controlled above this level. Cocoons are a source of insect contaminants late in the season and should be prevented 3 weeks before harvest.ManagementScout weekly to determine if 0.3 larvae/plant threshold has been reached.

Cocoons are a source of insect contaminants late in the season and should be prevented 3 weeks before harvest.ManagementScout weekly to determine if 0.3 larvae/plant threshold has been reached. Allow a 1-2 month production break in mid-summer to avoid building up populations between spring and fall (note populations tend to be lower in the winter months in many years). Rotate insecticides as this insect can temporarily developresistanceto many pesticides with their excessive use. In Georgia, excessive, season-long use of a single insecticide ingredient has recently resulted in high levels of insecticide resistance to even some of the newest chemistries. Encourage beneficial insects, e.g. the wasp parasitoid Diadegama insulare, by avoiding chemicals toxic to parasitoids with effective alternatives like Bacillus thuringiensis sprays.Originally compiled fromInsects Associated with Vegetable Crops in Georgia: Cole CropsRetrieved from "http://wiki.bugwood.org/index.php?title=Plutella_xylostella&oldid=3977"
