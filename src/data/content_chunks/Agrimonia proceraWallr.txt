Agrimonia proceraWallr. - Fragrant Agrimony  -Rosaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)This is very similar toAgrimonia eupatoria(common agrimony) but is much less common. It appears to avoid calcareous coils, but the two species can occur together in mixed populations such as on the Whitepark Bay dunes. Fragrant agrimony has leaves covered with scented glands and the lower spines on the fruit are bent downwards. The two species do not hybridize.All names:Agrimonia proceraWallr.;Agrimonia odorataauct. non (L.)
