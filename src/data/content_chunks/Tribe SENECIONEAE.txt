Pappus 1- to many seriate, bristles few or numerous or 0, rarely absent from all florets, white or colored, persistent or caducous. Pollen "senecioid" or sometimes "helianthoid."About 150-170 genera and ca. 3,500 species: worldwide; 23 genera (four endemic, three introduced), and 464 species (315 endemic, six introduced) in China.This is a major tribe in the Asteraceae. Nordenstam (in Kadereit & C. Jeffrey, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 8: 208-241. 2007) recognized 151 genera, and, more recently, Nordenstam et al. estimated the number to around 160 (in V. A. Funk et al., Syst. Evol. Biogeogr. Compositae, 503-525. 2009). Some new genera have recently been added and a few more will be published, so the number will probably increase to ca. 170. Subtribal classification is problematic. Sometimes only two or three subtribes are recognized, viz., Senecioninae, Tussilagininae, and Blennospermatinae Rydberg. The latter is better included in the Tussilagininae, except forAbrotanellaCassini, which should be treated as

The latter is better included in the Tussilagininae, except forAbrotanellaCassini, which should be treated as a monogeneric subtribe, Abrotanellinae (Robinson et al., Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 84: 893-906. 1997; Nordenstam et al., loc. cit.). A satisfactory subtribal classification would probably recognize ca. eight subtribes, but it has not yet been produced. The Chinese members of the tribe Senecioneae are here provisionally divided into three subtribes: Tussilagininae (Cassini) Dumortier, Tephroseridinae C. Jeffrey & Y. L. Chen, and Senecioninae (Cassini) Dumortier (Farfugium,Ligularia, andCremanthodiumwere treated in Senecioninae in FRPS (77(2): 1-171. 1989) but are here referred to the Tussilagininae). Twenty-three genera with 463 species are recorded in the present treatment. Plants in some genera have economic value, such asGynura,Ligularia,Parasenecio,Petasites, andTussilago, which are used medicinally. Several genera are well known in horticulture (Doronicum,Euryops(Cassini) Cassini,Farfugium,KleiniaMiller,Ligularia,Parasenecio,Pericallis,Senecio,Sinacalia,SteirodiscusLessing, etc.).1(1)Antheropod
