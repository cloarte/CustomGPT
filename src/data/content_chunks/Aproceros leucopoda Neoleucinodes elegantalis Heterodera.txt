21 st Meeting of the Panel on PRA Development Paris, 2012-01-24/26 The 21 st Meeting of the Panel on PRA Development was held in the EPPO headquarters in Paris on 2011-01-25/28. The Panel mainly foc used on the Express Scheme for Pest Risk Analysis. This new scheme provides a simplified procedure for undertaking a rapid PRA to determine whether an organism has the characteristics of a quarantine pest, and if appropriate, to identify potential management options. The Panel tested the scheme on pests from the Alert List (or candidate for the Alert List): Aproceros leucopoda (a forest insect pest) , Neoleucinodes elegantalis (a tomato insect pest) , Heterodera zeae (a nematode pest on maize) , and Acidovorax citrulli (a bacterium on cucurbits). The Panel agreed that the Express PRA scheme was good to allow the rapid acquisition of a full picture of risks associated with a pest. It was reviewed in detail and amended to improve clarity. The revised version will be presented to Panel on Phytosanitary Measures which will meet in 2012-03-13/15. A computerized version within CAPRA will be prepared. The Panel was presented a detailed overview of EFSA Plant Health activities by Mr Stancanelli. The Panel also discussed its future activities.
