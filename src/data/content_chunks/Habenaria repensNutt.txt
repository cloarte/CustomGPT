Plant Notes:  Water Spider Orchid is a native herbaceous perennial in the Orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to the southern half of Alabama. Water Spider Orchid can grow rooted in mud or in floating mats of vegetation. It is found in ponds and lakes, in beaver ponds, in roadside ditches, and in sloughs. It is a perennial from thick fleshy roots, some of which produce tubers. The plant is often colonial from new shoots produced along the roots. Stems are erect to decumbent and vary in length from a few inches to over a foot. Leaves are alternate, sessile with the base sheathing the stem, lanceolate to elliptic in outline, entire, and glabrous. The leaves are reduced in size upwards on the stem. Flowers are produced in a terminal raceme. Individual flowers are greenish or yellowish-green in color and subtended by a bract. There are three ovate sepals and three petals. The two lateral petals are divided, with the upper division erect and falcate and the lower division filiform. The lip petal is divided into 3 filiform segments. The flowers have a cylindrical spur extending below them. Flower have a vanilla scent and are pollinated by moths. The fruit is a capsule with many dust-like seed. Water Spider Orchid is sometimes available from nurseries. It is easy to grow
