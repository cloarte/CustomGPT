AntennaScape, pedicel, and flagellumAphid antennas are composed of three muscularized articulated truesegments. Thescapeis the first, thepedicelsecond, and the remainder of the antenna is theflagellum. Most features used for aphid identification are those of the four (rarely three)flagellomeres. In common parlance, each of theantennomeresis referred to as asegment.
FlagellumThe flagellum is composed of the four (or three) terminalsegmentsof the antenna.It measured as a straight line from the base of third antennal segment to the tip of the sixth (or fifth, when there are only five). In cases where the antenna is strongly curved on the slide, it may be best to measure the length of the flagellum as the sum of its individual segments.Antennal segmentsThe length of each of the four (or 3)segmentsof theflagellumare easily measured.Third antennal segmentBoth the length (black arrows) and diameter (white arrows) of the thirdantennalsegmentare important measurements. The number ofsensoriaand the length of the longestsetaon thesegmentare also used.Last antennal segmentTheterminalantennalsegment, usually the sixth but sometimes the fifth, is divided into the base and the processus terminalis (PT). The PT is sometimes called theunguis, which is not to be confused with tarsal claw of other insects.The base of the terminal antennal segment is measured from its base to thedistalmargin of theprimary sensorium. The PT is measured from thedistalmargin of theprimary sensoriumto the tip of the antenna.Last antennal segmentThe PT can be longer or shorter than the base of the terminal antennal segment.Primary and secondary

The fifth antennal segment also usually bears aprimary sensorium, and sometimes the fourth antennal segment does as well.Primary sensoriaon the fourth and fifth segments are located towards thedistalend of the segment and usually at a slight angle to the main axis of the segment (like theprimary sensoriumof the terminal antennal segment). When present,seondary sensoria, also known asrhinaria, may be found on the third, fourth, or fifth antennal segments. They are usually smaller than theprimary sensoriaand generally in the same plane as the main axis of the segment.When countingsensoria, AphID does not considerprimary sensoria. Count onlyrhinaria(=secondary sensoria).Circular sensoriaThese are standard circularsecondary sensoriaarrayed as a line along the full length of the third antennal segment.Sensoria clustered at baseThese are standard circularsecondary sensoriaclustered at thebaseof the third antennal segment.Annular sensoriaThese areannularsecondary sensoriaarrayed along the full length of the third, fourth, and fifth antennal segments. Each one almost completely encircles the antenna.
