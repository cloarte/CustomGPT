 Invasion: The following diagnostic notes refer to females only and include only the minimum characters required to differentiate this species from other pest species.Adult FemaleLength 4.0-5.0 mm. Frons convex, shining, finely reticulate, with scattered, large, deep punctures and scattered, long, erect setae. Antennal club with one suture on posterior face. Pronotum as long as wide; sides weakly arcuate, anterior margin broadly rounded, serrations absent. Elytra 1.7 times longer than wide, 1.7 times longer than pronotum, apex broadly rounded; striae not impressed, punctures distinct; interstriae about as wide as striae, each with a median row of long, erect setae. Elytral declivity sloping, weakly concave on lower half, striae and interstriae as on disc but also with a median row of small granules in each interstria.Immatures StagesThe immature stages have not been described.

 Reproduccion: The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Xylosandrus, Xyleborinus and Euwallacea are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. The biology of E. destruens has been studied by Alphen de Veer (1956), Browne (1961) , Kalshoven (1961, 1962), and Roberts (1977, as Xyle

 the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. The biology of E. destruens has been studied by Alphen de Veer (1956), Browne (1961) , Kalshoven (1961, 1962), and Roberts (1977, as Xyleborus nandarivatus). The adult females fly at night and are attracted to light. Stems down to a diameter of 7 cm are attacked ( Browne, 1961 ). The gallery system consists of a main radial gallery which in large stems may penetrate up to 8-9 cm into the wood, and from which several branch galleries run off obliquely on either side, all in one horizontal plane. From near the gallery entrance, a vertical gallery may be started running longitudinally along the stem. This in turn gives rise to further branches in another horizontal plane. Eventually there may be three or four 'stories' ( Kalshoven, 1962 ), and the total length of the system may exceed 1 m. It may take several weeks before egg-laying starts ( Kalshoven, 1962 ). The eggs are laid at intervals in clutches in the branch galleries, and larvae hatching from each clutch appear to complete their development within the branch in which the eggs were laid. The young females move around within the nest, and later extensions of the gallery appear to be carried out largely by them ( Roberts, 1977 ). The gallery system may be active for more than 6 months. The maximum brood size appears to be about 60-70, but is often much less ( Kalshoven, 1962 ; Roberts, 1977 ). The sex ratio varies from about 1:10 to 1:16 in favour of females.

The relationship of climate to the incidence of X. destruens as a pest of teak has been discussed by Ferguson (1949) and Alphen de Veer (1956). Most damage is caused where the annual rainfall is high (over 2000 mm) and the ratio of wet to dry months is less than 7:3. In general, the species tends to attack through bark wounds, or after the tree has become stressed, but can also attack apparently healthy trees of 10-20 cm diameter ( Browne, 1961 ; Kalshoven, 1961 ). Breeding is continuous throughout the year, with overlapping generations.
 Sintomas: Attacked plants may show signs of wilting, branch die-back, shoot breakage, chronic debilitation, sun-scorch or a general decline in vigour.
