ical appendages; setae commonly barbellate or laciniate, rarely plumose, apices acute or obtuse, usually gradually tapering, sometimes dilated, very rarely conspicuously narrowing.About 180 genera and ca. 2,000 species: concentrated in Mexico and Central and South America, with relatively few native species in the Old World; several pantropical weeds widespread in the Old World; ten genera (seven introduced) and 25 species (six endemic, nine introduced) in China.The tribe appears to be nearly restricted to the W Hemisphere, suggesting a Neotropical origin. The subtribes show a mixed distribution pattern, with explosive speciation in several, especially those occurring in Brazil, the Caribbean, Colombia, and Mexico. There are many pantropical and pansubtropical weeds in the tribe. Uses of members of the tribe have been briefly summarized by King and Robinson (Monogr. Syst. Bot. 22: 1-581. 1987).
