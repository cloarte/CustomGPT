Overview
Appearance
Lonicera morrowii
is a multistemmed, upright, deciduous shrub that grows up to 8 ft. (2.5 m) tall. The bark is light brown and often pubescent on young stems. Stems are hollow.
Foliage
The grayish-green leaves are opposite, elliptic to oblong, 2-3 in. (5.1-7.6 cm) long and hairy underneath. Often it is one of the first shrubs to leaf out in the spring.
Flowers
The fragrant paired flowers are tubular, white to cream-colored, 0.75 in. (1.9 cm) in diameter and develop from May to June.
Fruit
The abundant berries are 0.25 in. (0.6 cm) in diameter, ripen to orange or red in color, often persist throughout winter and occur on 0.5 in. (1.3 cm) pedicels.
Ecological Threat
Lonicera morrowii
readily invades open woodlands, old fields, and other disturbed sites. It can spread rapidly due to birds and mammals dispersing the seeds and can form a dense understory thicket which can restrict native plant growth and tree seedling establishment.
Lonicera morrowii
is a native of eastern Asia and was first introduced into North America in the late 1800s. It has been planted widely as an ornamental and for wildlife food and cover.
