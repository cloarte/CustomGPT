1. Reagent Name: Avian Lymphoid Leukosis Virus Type A Positive Control (PC) 
2. Strain or Source: RAV-1 
3. Lot Number: 12-02 
4. Fill Date: November 22, 2011 
5. Expiration Date: None 
Precautions: Lymphoid leukosis virus is infectious for chickens and certain other avian species. 
6. Intended Use: This product is used as a positive control virus in the Avian Leukosis 
Virus ELISA (Idexx Avian Leukosis Test kit; CVB-PRO-0036). 
7. Instructions for Use: The PC virus is bottled at a 1:100 dilution. Four ten-fold serial 
dilutions are made, for a final concentration of 1 x 10-6 . This concentration is the starting 
inoculum for CEFs inoculation for subsequent passage and use in the ELISA test. 
8. Test of Reagent: ALV-A, Lot LLA 90-1 is the stock virus from which the diluted 
positive control preparation is produced. The stock virus was determined to be free from chicken 
anemia virus (CAV) by PCR (Veterinary Services Memorandum No. 800.89), and no evidence 
of other avian extraneous agents was detected. The diluted PC virus is tested in accordance with 
the 9 CFR requirements by the Center for Veterinary Biologics as indicated below:

12. Origin and Passage History: The ALV-A isolate was obtained from Dr. William 
Okazaki, Regional Poultry Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan. Virus stock was expanded once 
in chick embryos and twice in chick embryos fibroblast cell cultures and given the designation of 
ALV-A lot LLA90-1. I 
13. Method of Preparation: ALV-A Lot LLA 90-1 is removed from the -70 freezer and is 
thawed using a 37± 2oC incubator or water bath. Dilute 1:100 using 199 Earles (National Centers 
for Animal Health (NCAH) Media #20010) without fetal bovine serum (FBS), and place into a 
sterile receptacle. The diluted virus is mixed for 10 ± 2 minutes on a stir plate. Once mixed, the 
diluted control is placed in an ice bath and
