26 th Meeting of the Panel on Phytosanitary Measures for Potato Santa Cruz de Tenerife, ES, 2020-02-11/13 The 26 th meeting of the Panel on Phytosanitary Measures for Potato took place in Santa Cruz de Tenerife (ES) on 2020-02-11/13. The Panel discussed Standards under revision or development. Standards under revision In July 2019, a subgroup of the Panel revised the introduction, the scope and developed a new appendix for Standard PM 9/2 5 National regulatory control system for Bactericera cockerelli and ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum ’. This revision allows the inclusion of measures to reduce the risk of ‘ Ca . L. solanacearum’ (e.g. haplotypes C, D & E) spreading to potato production systems when listed as a regulated non-quarantine pest (RNQP) on seed potato. After discussion on the revised version of the Standard, the Panel agreed that it could be sent for country consultation. Standards under development The Panel considered the comments received during country consultation on the draft Standard PM 3/NEW Testing of potato varieties to assess resistance to Synchytrium endobioticum. After a revision by the Expert working group (EWG), a finalized version will be presented for approval at the Working Party on Phytosanitary Regulations. The draft Standard PM 3/NEW Management of phytosanitary risks for potato crops from movement of soil associated with root crops and potatoes was discussed in July 2019 within a subgroup of the Panel and was then provided to international stakeholders’ associations to gather additional comments. The Panel improved the draft which needs further development. A revised version will be presented to the Panel in 2021. The draft Standard PM 3/NEW Control of volunteer potato plants describes a procedure for the management of volunteer potato plants in the framework of official control of regulated pests.

The draft Standard PM 3/NEW Control of volunteer potato plants describes a procedure for the management of volunteer potato plants in the framework of official control of regulated pests. The Panel finalized the draft Standard, which will be sent for country consultation after additional national experience is collected from Panel members. The Panel discussed needs for revision of the Phytosanitary Procedure Export certification and import compliance checking for potato tubers (PM 3/70) , as well as the National Regulatory Control Systems for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp . sepedonicus [renamed Clavibacter sepedonicus ] (Standard PM 9/2), Ralstonia solanacearum (PM 9/3) and PSTVd (PM 9/13). PM 9/2 was considered as being the highest priority for revision. Discussion with the European Commission is necessary not to duplicate work. The Standard related to the testing of potato varieties to assess resistance to Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida (PM 3/68) will be revised next year based on outcomes of the EU PalAdapt project . The Panel also discussed the development of generic risk management measures for Meloidogyne species (e.g. conditions for establishing a pest free production site). The Panel agreed that the pest-free status of an area would be difficult to guarantee for most of the Meloidogyne species, including M. chitwoodi and M. fallax . Finally, the Panel was informed about the development of the true potato seed breeding technique in the EU, as well as about Euphresco projects related to potato. A technical visit was organized to discuss the situation of Tecia solanivora in Canary Islands.

23rd meeting of the Panel on Phytosanitary Measures for Potato Antalya, TR, 2017-02-20/22 The 23nd meeting of the Panel on Phytosanitary Measures for Potato took place at Antalya on 2017-02-20/22 at the kind invitation of the Turkish NPPO. It was held back to back with the Expert Working Group for the RNQP Project (seed potato sector) . Participants – more pictures The Panel carried on the development 2 draft regulatory control system Standards (in series PM9) on: Bactericera cockerelli and ' Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum'. Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida. The Panel discussed recent results obtained from the Euphresco project PHYLIB-II and the EU project POnTE on ' Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’ and its vectors in Europe. The Standard on Bactericera cockerelli and 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' was finalized and sent for country consultation with the objective that the Working Party on Phytosanitary Regulation and Council approve it in 2017. Comments received during country consultation of Standard PM 8/1 Commodity-specific phytosanitary measures for potato were reviewed and a final version will be presented to the Working Party on Phytosanitary Regulation and Council for approval. Following the revision of the EPPO Diagnostic Protocol on Synchytrium endobioticum , the Panel revised related standards on this fungus: PM 3/59 Synchytrium endobioticum : Soil tests and descheduling of previously infested plots, and PM 9/5 National regulatory control system for Synchytrium endobioticum . The need to to develop agreed guidance was identified, and a specification to develop a Standard will be presented to the Working Party.

The Panel had no time to work on the following drafts: Management of the phytosanitary risks of soil associated with potato tubers and potato waste Control of potato volunteers PM 3/21 Post-entry quarantine for potato (revision) It will carry on working on these topics for the next meeting. Finally, the Panel discussed emerging pests. In particular the situation of Tecia solanivora in Spain and the eradication measures were presented. The next Panel meeting is planned on 2018-02-20/22 in Paris.﻿
