Circaea alpina x lutetiana (C. x intermedia)Ehrh. - Upland Enchanter's-nightshade  -Onagraceae(Map updated: March 2008)A native herbaceous rhizomatous and stoloniferous perennial species, similar toCircaea lutetianabut less common, and found in the same habitats. It is distinguished fromC. lutetianaby not producing good fruit and by having more strongly-toothed leaves which are also generally more strongly heart-shaped.In origin a hybrid betweenC. lutetianaandC. alpina- the latter parent being extinct in Ireland - and exhibiting a combination of characters of both parent species. Like many hybrids it does not produce viable seed.All names:Circaea alpina x lutetiana (C. x intermedia)Ehrh.;Circaea x intermediaEhrh.;Circaea alpina x lutetiana;Circaea lutetiana x alpina;Circaea canadensisauct.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
