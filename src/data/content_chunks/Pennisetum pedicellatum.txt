 Invasion: P. pedicellatum is an annual tufted grass, rarely perennial in subsp. unispiculum. Grass culms are herbaceous; reaching a height of 30-150 cm; leaves hairy, 5-25 cm long and 4-15 mm wide, arranged in two rows. Inflorescence is a tight panicle, cylindrical, 5-15 cm long and 10-15 mm wide; inflorescence exerted from uppermost leaf-sheath; rachis angular, puberulous, and very rarely pubescent; branches ending in bristle-like appendages. Upper glume and lower lemma more or less 3-lobed, 2.5-6 mm long; upper lemma obtuse, thinly coriaceous, ciliolate at the apex, readily disarticulating from the rest of the spikelet. Spikelets 4-6 mm long solitary, falling entire at maturity with bristles. Spikelets in clusters of 1-5 within the involucre, at least one of the spikelets upon a pedicel 1-3 mm long; bristles densely woolly plumose, forming a fluffy ovate involucre 0.5-1 cm long. 2-flowered, lower floret of fertile spikelet male, upper bisexual or female, bisexual mixed in the same inflorescence, lower glume shorter than florets, completely surrounded by a ring of bristles.

 Reproduccion: GeneticsCytological studies of the perennial accession type Agros-4 of P. pedicellatum revealed it to be an octoploid (2n=72) with a base chromosome number of x=9. Detailed cytological analysis and the nature of chromosome pairing at microsporogenesis suggest a segmental allopolyploid origin of the taxon ( Zadoo et al., 1997 ). However, the annual form of the weed in Australia was shown to have a chromosome number of 2n=36 ( Harrison, 1983 ). Studies indicate that P. pedicellatum might hybridize with P. polystachion (Hepper, 1972).Physiology and PhenologySeedling growth varied considerably with temperature with the highest growth at a constant temperature of 32°C.

P. pedicellatum responds well to nitrogen fertilization, with maximum yields (13 t DM/ha) obtained at 145 kg N/ha ( Mukherjee et al., 1982 ). In Orissa, P. pedicellatum sown at the end of March gave fresh fodder yields of 55.7-81 t/ha and 82.1-128.5 t/ha when harvested 82 and 110 days after sowing, respectively ( Mandal and Vamadevan, 1978 ). P. pedicellatum tiller number per plant increased with row spacing and highest yields were obtained with a 15 cm inter-row spacing ( Ferris and Poudal, 1995 ). Cross-sowing of P. pedicellatum and Vigna unguiculata at 100% sowing rates of 12 and 40 kg seeds/ha, respectively, gave 53.30 t/ha fresh fodder and 11.50 t DM/ha ( Prasad et al., 1990 ). The chemical composition of P. pedicellatum plants varied with the phenology ( Banerjee and Mandal, 1974 ; Upadhyay et al., 1978 ; Jakhmola and Pathak; 1983).Dry matter content of P. pedicellatum is 17-44% ( Singh and Premchand Rahaman, 1972 ). Applied nitrogen increased below ground biomass, root length and root length density of P. pedicellatum ( Vinod et al., 1996 ). Moreover, root growth was greatest at a 75-day cutting frequency, with the presence of mycorrhiza provoking a change in protein profiles and enzymes in the roots of P. pedicellatum ( Ramesh et al., 2000 ).

Moreover, root growth was greatest at a 75-day cutting frequency, with the presence of mycorrhiza provoking a change in protein profiles and enzymes in the roots of P. pedicellatum ( Ramesh et al., 2000 ). P. pedicellatum inoculated with Glomus mosseae, G. aggregatum and Gigaspora margarita, showed that G. margarita induced increased protein content, and acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, superoxide dismutase and chitinase activities were highest at the beginning of infection, but declined as the infection advanced. G. margarita was an efficient fungus in enhancing enzyme activity and proteins in roots compared with Glomus mosseae and G. aggregatum. Reproductive BiologyEmbryogenesis has been studied ( Shobha and Sindhe, 2000 ) and P. pedicellatum has apomictic reproductive behaviour ( Chaix and Marchais, 1996 ). Seed yield in P. pedicellatum depends upon flowering period, flag-leaf area and number of panicles per plant ( Muralimohanreddy and Chatterji, 1975 ), increasing linearly with nitrogen rates from 0.80 to 1.21 t/ha (Ramamurthy et al., 1998). Uniform ability for germination of P. pedicellatum seed is obtained at temperatures of 25-35°C ( Afolayan and Olugbami, 1993 ). Hull-imposed dormancy was evident and removal of husks facilitated germination ( Parihar et al., 1997 ). To facilitate P. pedicellatum seed germination, Maiti et al.

(1981) proposed soaking for 24 h in 1% nitric acid or scarification with sandpaper. Seeds of P. pedicellatum showed 94% viability with maximum seedling emergence with seed sown on the soil surface and a progressive decrease in emergence at greater soil depths; with percentage germination of 45% and 19.2% at depths of 2 cm and 6 cm, respectively ( Ezeigwe and Olunuga, 1974 ), and no germination below 7 cm. Germination was reduced under continuous light or darkness as compared to under alternating light and dark conditions ( Afolayan and Olugbami, 1993 ). Storage length affects seed germination, with percentage germination of 8 week-old seed found to be 175% by Ramamurthy et al. (1998), or 12% germination at 10 weeks after harvest and 73-100% germination at 20-66 weeks, with maximum germination (95-100%) at 34-66 weeks after harvest ( Paramathma and Surendran, 1990 ). Environmental RequirementsP. pedicellatum is a tropical to sub-tropical species, tolerant to a range of rainfall regimes from semi-arid to humid. It is tolerant of salinity, though increased salinity affected growth ( Varshney and Baijal, 1977 ). The species controlled water loss effectively and has a very strong recovery ability after watering even under severe drought conditions ( Noitsakis et al., 1994 ).AssociationsOn cultivated areas, the species is often associated with other weeds such as Andropogon pseudapricus, A. gayanus, A. fastigiatus, Aristida kerstingii, Loudetia togoensis and Pennisetum polystachion, and is considered as a characteristic species of

There are a number of recorded natural enemies, though their effects on the growth of P. pedicellatum are not known. Cynodon mosaic virus is associated with P. pedicellatum, first reported on Cynodon dactylon from India ( Bhargava et al., 1971 ) and causing a systemic chlorotic mottling and is transmitted by mechanical inoculation and by aphids. It is also known to infect Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor. In Senegal, endomycorrhizal fungal (Glomus sp., Scutellospora verrucosa and S. gregaria) colonization by P. pedicellatum was poorly developed ( Duponnois et al., 2001 ). Moreover, fungi such as Glomus intaradices, Sclerocystis rubiformis, Scutellospora gregaria, Scutellospora verrucosa were obtained in the rhizospheric soil of P. pedicellatum in Senegal ( Ahmed et al., 1998 ). Also, Acaulospora sp., Glomus contrictum were obtained from the soil under P. pedicellatum using Lycopersicum esculentum and Lolium perenne as host plants. There are no reports on the mycorrhizal status of P. pedicellatum in semi arid soils, therefore the high spore density which can be obtained under this species may have come from other plants such as Acacia

There are no reports on the mycorrhizal status of P. pedicellatum in semi arid soils, therefore the high spore density which can be obtained under this species may have come from other plants such as Acacia senegal, Combretum glutinosum, Piliostigma reticulatum, etc., which are known to harbour mycorrhiza ( Cucousso, 1991 ). P. pedicellatum is usually associated with large nematode populations ( Cadet and Floret, 1995 ), with Longidorus brevis described from Senegal ( Swart et al., 1996 ) and Meloidogyne incognita in India (Vaishnav and Sethi, 1977). The contribution of termites to the breakdown of P. pedicellatum straw was estimated to be over 70% ( Mando and Brussaard, 1999 ), indicating that it is an important resource for termites.

 severe drought conditions ( Noitsakis et al., 1994 ).AssociationsOn cultivated areas, the species is often associated with other weeds such as Andropogon pseudapricus, A. gayanus, A. fastigiatus, Aristida kerstingii, Loudetia togoensis and Pennisetum polystachion, and is considered as a characteristic species of young fallow ( Poilecot, 1995 ). There are a number of recorded natural enemies, though their effects on the growth of P. pedicellatum are not known. Cynodon mosaic virus is associated with P. pedicellatum, first reported on Cynodon dactylon from India ( Bhargava et al., 1971 ) and causing a systemic chlorotic mottling and is transmitted by mechanical inoculation and by aphids. It is also known to infect Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor. In Senegal, endomycorrhizal fungal (Glomus sp., Scutellospora verrucosa and S. gregaria) colonization by P. pedicellatum was poorly developed ( Duponnois et al., 2001 ). Moreover, fungi such as Glomus intaradices, Sclerocystis rubiformis, Scutellospora gregaria, Scutellospora verrucosa were obtained in the rhizospheric soil of P. pedicellatum in Senegal ( Ahmed et al., 1998 ). Also, Acaulospora sp., Glomus contrictum were obtained from the soil under P. pedicellatum using Lycopersicum esculentum and Lolium perenne as host plants. There are no reports on the mycorrhizal status of P. pedicellatum in semi arid soils, therefore the high spore density which can be obtained under this species may have come from other plants such as Acacia

There are no reports on the mycorrhizal status of P. pedicellatum in semi arid soils, therefore the high spore density which can be obtained under this species may have come from other plants such as Acacia senegal, Combretum glutinosum, Piliostigma reticulatum, etc., which are known to harbour mycorrhiza ( Cucousso, 1991 ). P. pedicellatum is usually associated with large nematode populations ( Cadet and Floret, 1995 ), with Longidorus brevis described from Senegal ( Swart et al., 1996 ) and Meloidogyne incognita in India (Vaishnav and Sethi, 1977). The contribution of termites to the breakdown of P. pedicellatum straw was estimated to be over 70% ( Mando and Brussaard, 1999 ), indicating that it is an important resource for termites.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology GeneticsCytological studies of the perennial accession type Agros-4 of P. pedicellatum revealed it to be an octoploid (2n=72) with a base chromosome number of x=9. Detailed cytological analysis and the nature of chromosome pairing at microsporogenesis suggest a segmental allopolyploid origin of the taxon ( Zadoo et al., 1997 ). However, the annual form of the weed in Australia was shown to have a chromosome number of 2n=36 ( Harrison, 1983 ). Studies indicate that P. pedicellatum might hybridize with P. polystachion

 analysis and the nature of chromosome pairing at microsporogenesis suggest a segmental allopolyploid origin of the taxon ( Zadoo et al., 1997 ). However, the annual form of the weed in Australia was shown to have a chromosome number of 2n=36 ( Harrison, 1983 ). Studies indicate that P. pedicellatum might hybridize with P. polystachion (Hepper, 1972).Physiology and PhenologySeedling growth varied considerably with temperature with the highest growth at a constant temperature of 32°C. P. pedicellatum responds well to nitrogen fertilization, with maximum yields (13 t DM/ha) obtained at 145 kg N/ha ( Mukherjee et al., 1982 ). In Orissa, P. pedicellatum sown at the end of March gave fresh fodder yields of 55.7-81 t/ha and 82.1-128.5 t/ha when harvested 82 and 110 days after sowing, respectively ( Mandal and Vamadevan, 1978 ). P. pedicellatum tiller number per plant increased with row spacing and highest yields were obtained with a 15 cm inter-row spacing ( Ferris and Poudal, 1995 ). Cross-sowing of P. pedicellatum and Vigna unguiculata at 100% sowing rates of 12 and 40 kg seeds/ha, respectively, gave 53.30 t/ha fresh fodder and 11.50 t DM/ha ( Prasad et al., 1990 ). The chemical composition of P. pedicellatum plants varied with the phenology ( Banerjee and Mandal, 1974 ; Upadhyay et al., 1978 ; Jakhmola and Pathak; 1983).Dry matter content of P. pedicellatum is 17-44% ( Singh and Premchand Rahaman, 1972 ).

 pedicellatum plants varied with the phenology ( Banerjee and Mandal, 1974 ; Upadhyay et al., 1978 ; Jakhmola and Pathak; 1983).Dry matter content of P. pedicellatum is 17-44% ( Singh and Premchand Rahaman, 1972 ). Applied nitrogen increased below ground biomass, root length and root length density of P. pedicellatum ( Vinod et al., 1996 ). Moreover, root growth was greatest at a 75-day cutting frequency, with the presence of mycorrhiza provoking a change in protein profiles and enzymes in the roots of P. pedicellatum ( Ramesh et al., 2000 ). P. pedicellatum inoculated with Glomus mosseae, G. aggregatum and Gigaspora margarita, showed that G. margarita induced increased protein content, and acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, superoxide dismutase and chitinase activities were highest at the beginning of infection, but declined as the infection advanced. G. margarita was an efficient fungus in enhancing enzyme activity and proteins in roots compared with Glomus mosseae and G. aggregatum. Reproductive BiologyEmbryogenesis has been studied ( Shobha and Sindhe, 2000 ) and P. pedicellatum has apomictic reproductive behaviour ( Chaix and Marchais, 1996 ). Seed yield in P. pedicellatum depends upon flowering period, flag-leaf area and number of panicles per plant ( Muralimohanreddy and Chatterji, 1975 ), increasing linearly with nitrogen rates from 0.80 to 1.21 t/ha (Ramamurthy et al., 1998). Uniform ability for germination of P. pedicellatum seed is obtained at temperatures of 25-35°C ( Afolayan and Olugbami, 1993 ). Hull-imposed dormancy was

Uniform ability for germination of P. pedicellatum seed is obtained at temperatures of 25-35°C ( Afolayan and Olugbami, 1993 ). Hull-imposed dormancy was evident and removal of husks facilitated germination ( Parihar et al., 1997 ). To facilitate P. pedicellatum seed germination, Maiti et al. (1981) proposed soaking for 24 h in 1% nitric acid or scarification with sandpaper. Seeds of P. pedicellatum showed 94% viability with maximum seedling emergence with seed sown on the soil surface and a progressive decrease in emergence at greater soil depths; with percentage germination of 45% and 19.2% at depths of 2 cm and 6 cm, respectively ( Ezeigwe and Olunuga, 1974 ), and no germination below 7 cm. Germination was reduced under continuous light or darkness as compared to under alternating light and dark conditions ( Afolayan and Olugbami, 1993 ). Storage length affects seed germination, with percentage germination of 8 week-old seed found to be 175% by Ramamurthy et al. (1998), or 12% germination at 10 weeks after harvest and 73-100% germination at 20-66 weeks, with maximum germination (95-100%) at 34-66 weeks after harvest ( Paramathma and Surendran, 1990 ). Environmental RequirementsP. pedicellatum is a tropical to sub-tropical species, tolerant to a range of rainfall regimes from semi-arid to humid.
