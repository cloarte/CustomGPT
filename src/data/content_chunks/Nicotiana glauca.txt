 Reproduccion: Nicotiana glauca is a natural diploid with a chromosome number of 2 n = 24 ( Trojak-Goluch and Berbec, 2005 ). All non-native populations have only yellow flowers, which may reflect the introduction of a limited set of genotypes into the alien range ( Ollerton et al., 2012 ). DNA barcode data are available at the Barcode of Life Data Systems ( BOLDS, 2018 ). Germplasm collections are also available ( USDA-ARS, 2018 ).

In its native range,말t말s pollinated exclusively by hummingbirds ( Nattero et al., 2011 ; Ollerton et al., 2012 ). It is also reported as pollinated by Lepidoptera ( PFAF, 2018 ). In the parts of its alien range where specialized bird pollinators (such as hummingbirds in California and sunbirds in South Africa and Israel) exist, N. glauca sets seed by both out-crossing and selfing. Where no such pollinators exist in its alien range, seed is set by selfing, which is facilitated by the shorter stigma-anther distance compared to plants in its native range ( Ollerton et al., 2012 ). Nattero and Cocucci (2007) found that fruit quality is dependent on the degree of cross-pollination. Island populations of N. glauca show a higher capacity to self-pollinate compared to mainland plants ( Schueller, 2004 ). Nicotiana glauca exhibits geographical variation in corolla length and width between populations due to different hummingbird species pollinating plants in different regions ( Nattero and Cocucci, 2007 ). On the Californian Channel Islands, plants have longer corollas compared to mainland plants due to the specific hummingbird pollinator species present (Schueller, 2007). Climatic factors and altitude also affect flower traits between populations ( Nattero et al., 2011 ). A mature plant can produce 10,000-1,000,000 seeds each year ( Florentine and Westbrooke, 2005 ). The small size of seeds (0.6 mm long) suggests that they do not survive more than 1 or 2 years in the soil ( DiTomaso et al., 2013 ), but

The small size of seeds (0.6 mm long) suggests that they do not survive more than 1 or 2 years in the soil ( DiTomaso et al., 2013 ), but a soil seed bank can form nonetheless ( Florentine and Westbrooke, 2005 ). Seed germination has been seen to decline after 120 days ( Florentine et al., 2016 ). Seeds can germinate within 2-3 days under various light and temperature conditions ( Florentine et al., 2006 ) with around 90% viability ( Ollerton et al., 2012 ). N. glauca germination is best at 30춿/20춿C with 12 h of light and 12 h of dark; it withstands heat shocks up to 130춿C and a pH range of 4-10 ( Florentine et al., 2016 ). Germination is best at soil surface, decreasing as planting depth increases. Water stress reduces germination, being completely inhibited at water potentials of -0.4 to -0.6 MPa. Salinity also reduces seed germination. Nicotiana glauca is reported as flowering from August to October and in seed from September to October ( PFAF, 2018 ). Nicotiana glauca is a perennial shrub or small tree. Nicotiana glauca is a potential source of endophytic bacteria that have shown Fusarium wilt-suppressive properties and plant growth enhancing properties on tomatoes (Abdallah et al., 2016).

Within its native range, N. glauca is a scattered and rarely abundant plant of dry and disturbed areas such as riverbanks, road sides and quarries. It is found from 0 to 3700 m above sea level ( Gonz치lez et al., 2012 ) in semi-arid conditions, but never in wet areas ( Ollerton et al., 2012 ). The species is drought resistant and tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions ( Texas Invasives, 2018 ). It survives temperatures down to -5춿C ( PFAF, 2018 ). Partial tolerance of N. glauca to drought and salinity comes from a physiological adaptation to conserve water through closure of stomata and osmotic adjustment, as well as reducing absorption of excess radiation due to the presence of a waxy layer on leaves ( Gonz치lez et al., 2012 ). The species grows in moist, well-drained, light, medium to heavy soils ( PFAF, 2018 ). It is not shade tolerant ( PIER, 2018 ).

Seed germination has been seen to decline after 120 days ( Florentine et al., 2016 ). Seeds can germinate within 2-3 days under various light and temperature conditions ( Florentine et al., 2006 ) with around 90% viability ( Ollerton et al., 2012 ). N. glauca germination is best at 30춿/20춿C with 12 h of light and 12 h of dark; it withstands heat shocks up to 130춿C and a pH range of 4-10 ( Florentine et al., 2016 ). Germination is best at soil surface, decreasing as planting depth increases. Water stress reduces germination, being completely inhibited at water potentials of -0.4 to -0.6 MPa. Salinity also reduces seed germination. Phys

Physiology and Phenology Nicotiana glauca is reported as flowering from August to October and in seed from September to October ( PFAF, 2018 ). Longevity Nicotiana glauca is a perennial shrub or small tree. Associations Nicotiana glauca is a potential source of endophytic bacteria that have shown Fusarium wilt-suppressive properties and plant growth enhancing properties on tomatoes (Abdallah et al., 2016). Environmental Requirements Within its native range, N. glauca is a scattered and rarely abundant plant of dry and disturbed areas such as riverbanks, road sides and quarries. It is found from 0 to 3700 m above sea level ( Gonz치lez et al., 2012 ) in semi-arid conditions, but never in wet areas ( Ollerton et al., 2012 ). The species is drought resistant and tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions ( Texas Invasives, 2018 ). It survives temperatures down to -5춿C ( PFAF, 2018 ). Partial tolerance of N. glauca to drought and salinity comes from a physiological adaptation to conserve water through closure of stomata and osmotic adjustment, as well as reducing absorption of excess radiation due to the presence of a waxy layer on leaves ( Gonz치lez et al., 2012 ). The species grows in moist, well-drained, light, medium to heavy soils ( PFAF, 2018 ). It is not shade tolerant ( PIER, 2018 ).
