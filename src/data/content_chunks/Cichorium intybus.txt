Appearance
Cichorium intybus
is a biennial to perennial herbaceous plant that can grow from 1-5 ft. (0.3-1.5 m) tall. It has erect, round, hollow, nearly leafless, green to reddish brown stems that produce a milky sap when cut. Lower part of stems are hairy. It is native to Africa, both temperate and tropical Asia and Europe.
Foliage
Rosette leaves are 2-6 in. (5.1-15 cm) long, oblong with rough hairs on upper and lower surfaces. Margins may be shallowly toothed or deeply dissected. Lance-shaped stem leaves are small, sparse, alternate, and clasping with margins either smooth or slightly toothed.
Flowers
The flowers are in showy clusters on the upper branches. Each flower has bright blue petals with toothed squared off ends. Flowers usually bloom in the morning and close later in the day.
Fruit
Fruits are about 0.13 in. (0.3 cm) long, dark brown and wedge shaped. Fruits contains one seed. Each plant can produce as many as 3000 seeds.
Ecological Threat
C. intybus
prefers well-drained or moderately drained soils along roadsides, railroads, disturbed sites, waste ground, and cultivated fields. Although it is mostly limited to roadsides and waste places, it can encroach upon higher grade dry prairies habitats. It is listed as a noxious weed in some states.
C. intybus
resembles native Showy Blue Lettuce (Mulgedium pulchellum).
