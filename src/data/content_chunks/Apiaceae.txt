Umbelliferae E. NASIR Stewart Herbarium, Gordon College, Rawalpindi. Plants annual, biennial or perennial, erect, decumbent or prostrate, mostly herbaceous, glabrous, pubescent or spiny; branching alternate or dichotomous. Root adventitious or taproot; fibrous, short or elongated, tuberous, fusiform or globose. Stems often hollow. Leaves simple or compound, petiolate or sessile; leaf bases usually sheathing; leaf lamina variously shaped. Inflorescence poly¬gamous or bisexual; umbels compound or sometimes simple. Involucral bracts I to many or lacking. Rays I to many. Involucel of I to many bractlets or lacking. Calyx teeth evident or obsolete. Petals 5, usually 3-lobed, central lobe inflexed, sometimes outer petals larger. Stamens 5. Carpels 2, attached to a carpophore; carpophore sometimes lacking. Ovary inferior, 2-celled with 1 anatropous ovule in each cell; styles 2, often swollen at the base forming a stylopodium. Fruit schizocarpic, consisting of 2 mericarps, terete or compressed; mericarps usually with 5 primary ridges with furrows, valleculae, between them; occasionally secondary ridges present; ridges acute or obtuse, thick or thin, winged or not winged; resin canals, vittae, present between or within the ridges or obscure; vittae usually present on the commissural side. Inner seed face plane, concave or sulcate.The Umbelliferae is a cosmopolitan family but it attains its greatest develop¬ment in the temperate regions.

 resin canals, vittae, present between or within the ridges or obscure; vittae usually present on the commissural side. Inner seed face plane, concave or sulcate.The Umbelliferae is a cosmopolitan family but it attains its greatest develop¬ment in the temperate regions. Some are extremely xerophytic, the majority, however, are mesophytic; a few like Sium, Berula and Oenanthe grow in or near water but in spite of the ecological specialization, the basic structure is remarkably uniform. The family can be easily recognised by its inflorescence which is an umbel. In most genera it is a compound umbel but in some genera like Bowlesia, Centella, Hydrocotyle and Dorema it appears to be or is a simple umbel. According to Mittal* the inflorescence in Centella, which usually consists of 3 flowers, is a simple cyme with the oldest flowers in the centre and in Hydrocotyle it is an “umbellate raceme” where the flowers are arranged in a whorl with the oldest flowers at the lowest level and the youngest at the top, but since the internodes are very short, it appears to be an umbel.Primarily the family consists of small herbaceous plants though a few genera (e.g. Heteromorpha, Steganotaenia) are woody. Some species of Angelica, Anthriscus, Ferula, Dorema and Heracleum are quite tall. Resin canals occur in all parts of the plant. In the stem they may be present in the cortical region, the pericycle and the pith. In the leaves they accompany the veins and may lie above, below or on both sides of them. In the young root they may be present below the endo-dermis and opposite the x

ma and Heracleum are quite tall. Resin canals occur in all parts of the plant. In the stem they may be present in the cortical region, the pericycle and the pith. In the leaves they accompany the veins and may lie above, below or on both sides of them. In the young root they may be present below the endo-dermis and opposite the xylem and the phloem strands. In the older roots the resin canals are usually found in the secondary bast and sometimes the wood. In the fruit they are present in the fruit wall. Their number, arrangement and position are of diagnostic value. The family has about 3000 species. From W. Pakistan 56 genera and about 167 species have been reported.
