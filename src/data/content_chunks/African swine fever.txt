It poses significant economic, livelihood and biodiversity threats to the region's pig sector and hunting. As part of its work to combat African swine fever in the region, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated a Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) project on “Improved and protected livelihoods against ASF in Kosovo 1 ” that started in October 2024 and which concluded today. To support and safeguard rural Kosovan livelihoods, FAO has provided several groups with various activities. Among others, project implementation included training first responders (namely veterinarians and hunters) on the disease and for backyard pig holders to increase their knowledge of ASF and how to improve farm biosecurity, and as well as collecting feedback about the economic impediments to backyard pig keeping. At the closing event held today in Pristina, the outcomes of the activities conducted were presented and discussed with local veterinary services, with a particular focus how the results could be upscaled.

 Pristina, the outcomes of the activities conducted were presented and discussed with local veterinary services, with a particular focus how the results could be upscaled. Backyard pig keepers received assistance during the entire duration of the project involving three locations in Kosovo: Doblibare, Gjurakoc and Strpce. In total, 62 backyard farmers were enrolled in the activity “Community African swine fever (ASF) Biosecurity Interventions” (CABI) – an innovative approach originally piloted by FAO in the Philippines – to enhance local awareness of biosecurity measures. Smallholder farmers keeping pigs in their backyard were surveyed to assess their production system, knowledge of ASF and biosecurity measures applied of their farms. The assessment was followed by three trainings dedicated to topics such as feeding and breeding of pigs, pig diseases and ASF, and cleaning and disinfection and farm biosecurity. During the last training, participants received a biosecurity intervention kit, containing working boots, hand sprayers, brushes, detergent, a log template to track visitors to their farms and disinfectant to improve their farm biosecurity. To reinforce the training, an FAO expert visited the farms to address remaining questions from the farmers after the kits were delivered and the training completed. Additionally, FAO posters summarizing key information related to African swine fever are displayed in nearby public spaces and community areas. Finally, farmers were surveyed a second time to measure the change in ASF knowledge and farm biosecurity. 1 All references to Kosovo shall be understood to be in the context of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).

ASF is not a danger to human health, but it is devasting for the farming economy.Yo can take action to protect your pigs,and your neighbourn's pigs,from this disease. African swine fever The African swine fever (ASF) is a serious viral disease that affects domestic and wild pigs. It has been found in more than 50 countries of Africa, Europe and Asia since 2007, and has just reappeared in the Americas. Although it does not present a risk to human health, currently the ASF is the most serious threat to pig farming on the continent and in the world. Its rapid spread, high mortality and the lack of a vaccine puts at risk the livelihoods of small- and large-scale producers and impacts the market for pig products, thereby causing severe economic losses for the farms affected. First case in the Americas The first case of the African swine fever resurgence in the region was discovered in domestic pigs in the Dominican Republic on July 28, 2021. This is the first confirmed case in the Western Hemisphere since the 1980s. The disease is now found on every continent of the world.

Increase control of personal belongings from travellers returning from the Dominican Republic. These travellers should not be allowed to visit farms and forests. Strengthen biosecurity measures on pig farms. In the event of a suspected case, all pigs should be enclosed within their pens, or confined to other areas where it is possible to isolate them. Feeding with leftovers should be discouraged. Increase surveillance, specifically reporting and testing sick and dead pigs including those feral and free.

It does not affect human beings. There is no vaccine. There is no treatment. It is transmitted by direct contact between sick and healthy animals. It could lead to sudden death. It can show signs of haemorrhaging in the skin and internal organs, fever and decay. Pigs also contract the disease if they consume meat contaminated by the virus. Secretions from diseased animals can contaminate belongings, tools, footwear etc. Human beings can carry the disease on their footwear, belongings etc. Publications Carcass management for small and medium scale livestock farms 2018 Given the spread of different transboundary animal diseases (TADs) such as African Swine fever (ASF), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) and Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), it is pertinent that FAO will provide assistance to countries in a way of practical knowledge on how to deal with animal carcasses.
