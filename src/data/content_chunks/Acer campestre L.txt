It is scattered unevenly across Northern Ireland and may be found as large, mature trees in old parkland or as a component of hedgerows. Old trees are a very good habitat for lichens. It produces the typical maple fruits, equipped with wings for wind-dispersal, just like those of its commoner relative the sycamore.All names:Acer campestreL.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
