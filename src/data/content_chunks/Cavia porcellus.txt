Guinea Pigs Do Best When 
Housed at the Right Temperature
This Animal Care Aid is part of a series developed to promote optimal guinea pig care and health.
Guinea pigs are very sensitive to both heat 
and cold. Keep them in temperatures 
between 60 and 85 °F to avoid putting 
their health at risk.  
Young guinea pigs are especially vulnerable, as  
they cannot control their body temperatures like 
adults can.
COLD
Guinea pigs handle cold much better 
than heat, but being too cold still causes them 
significant discomfort and stress. They can 
become sick or even die if they are too cold  
for too long. 
Protect your guinea pigs from cold stress by:
l Keeping the room temperature closer to the 
middle of the 60-85 °F range. 
l Housing them away from cold air currents, 
such as drafty windows or doorways.
l Paying extra attention to their bedding to  
make sure it is dry.
Tips for Maintaining the Right Temperature for Your Guinea Pigs
l Place thermometers near guinea pig housing to be 
sure you are checking the temperature where they live.
l Record the temperature daily in a calendar or notebook 
to monitor trends and identify problems early.
l Consider monitoring temperature in more than one 
location if your guinea pigs are housed in a large room. 
Housing may be 
cooler closer to the

ometers near guinea pig housing to be

l Record the temperature daily in a calendar or notebook 
to monitor trends and identify problems early.
l Consider monitoring temperature in more than one 
location if your guinea pigs are housed in a large room. 
Housing may be 
cooler closer to the 
floor or windows 
compared to housing 
that is at a higher 
level or closer to a 
heat source.
HEAT
Guinea pigs are very susceptible to heat stroke. 
They overheat quickly when temperatures are too 
high and can die within minutes. 
To reduce this risk, house guinea pigs away from:
 
Signs of heat stroke include listlessness, laying in 
a stretched-out posture, panting, and drooling. If 
you find a guinea pig in this condition, relocate 
it to a cooler environment and contact your 
attending veterinarian right away.
l heat vents 
l direct sunlight 
l radiators 
l heat lamps  
l Be sure to provide ventilation in a way that 
maintains temperature control. Keeping 
windows or doors open for 
ventilation can make the 
temperature in your guinea pig 
room drop quickly when the 
weather is cold.  
l Temperatures below 60 °F  
or over 85 °F need to be 
addressed right away. These 
temperatures are outside the 
appropriate range for your guinea 
pigs’ health and comfort.
PRACTICAL TIP
Guinea pigs 
tend to drink more 
during the warmer 
months so check 
their water supply 
often to make sure 
they have plenty of 
fresh, clean water.
