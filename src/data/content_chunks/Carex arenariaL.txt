Carex arenariaL., - Sand Sedge  -Cyperaceae© Roy Anderson© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)A species which is characteristic of sand dunes all around Northern Ireland. Mostly occurring in fixed or semi-fixed dunes. Aerial shoots grow up to about 10 inches in height, and they arise from a horizontal rhizome which can spread over considerable distances below the sand surface, and which help bind loose sand. In "blow-outs" or "slacks" with bare sand the aerial shoots arise in dead straight rows, growing up from the horizontal rhizome which will grow perfectly straight unless it encounters obstacles.All names:Carex arenariaL.,NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
