1. Reagent Name: Clostridium novyi Type B Toxin 
2. Strain or Source: Not applicable 
3. Lot Number: IRP 698 
4. Fill Date: March 1, 2024 
5. Expiration Date: May 31, 2029 
Precautions: This reagent does not present a hazard to laboratory personnel who work with the 
toxin provided sound fundamental laboratory techniques are followed. 
6. Intended Use: IRP 698 serves as the standard toxin when conducting C. novyi alpha 
toxin-neutralization tests in mice. 
7. Instructions for Use: IRP 698 diluted 1:19 is considered the standard toxin dilution 
when conducting toxin-neutralization tests in mice as outlined in title 9, Code of Federal 
Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.108. The solution of test toxin is prepared by adding 0.5 mL of 
well mixed IRP 698 to 9.0 mL of sterile peptone diluent (1.0% peptone, 0.25% sodium chloride, 
(pH 7.2). A volume

 outlined in title 9, Code of Federal 
Regulations (9 CFR), section 113.108. The solution of test toxin is prepared by adding 0.5 mL of 
well mixed IRP 698 to 9.0 mL of sterile peptone diluent (1.0% peptone, 0.25% sodium chloride, 
(pH 7.2). A volume of 0.5 mL of the toxin diluted 1:19 and 0.5 mL of diluent is equivalent to 0.1 
Lo dose. A volume of 0.8 mL of toxin and 0.2 mL of diluent is equivalent to 
0.1 L+ dose. 
8. Test of Reagent: 
Determination of test dose of toxin – The 0.1 Lo and 0.l L+ doses were established by injecting 
mice intravenously with 0.2 ml of a mixture of varying amounts of IRP 698 combined with 0.1 
International Unit of antitoxin. The 0.1 Lo dose for the C. novyi type B toxin neutralization test is 
the largest amount of toxin which can be mixed with one-tenth unit of Standard Antitoxin and 
not cause death in injected mice within 72 hours. The 0.1 L+ dose for the C. novyi type B toxin 
neutralization test is the smallest amount of toxin which can be mixed with one-tenth unit of 
Standard Antitoxin and cause death in at least 80% of injected mice within 72 hours. 
Sterility test – The toxin was tested for sterility and found to be free of viable bacteria and fungi 
according to procedures outlined in 9 CFR 113.26. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: Freestanding micro tubes (1.5 mL) 
containing 0.7 mL of toxin.

12. Origin and Passage History: C. novyi type B strain CN 234.3 was obtained from 
Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham, England, on July 16, 1965. The number of 
passages is unknown. 
13. Method of Preparation: Culture CN 234.3 (IRP 190) was grown in dialysis membranes 
with a molecular weight cutoff range from 12,000 to 14,000 daltons. The membranes were filled 
with 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and suspended in 1-liter trypsinizing flasks 
containing media consisting of proteose peptone, trypticase, yeast extract, and liver powder. 
Actively growing culture was aseptically added to the inside of the dialysis membranes and 
incubated at 35oC for 120-140 hours in anaerobic workstations containing 85% nitrogen, 10% 
hydrogen, and 5% carbon dioxide. The harvested culture was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 45-60 
minutes. The culture supernatant was passed through a Nalgene™ RapidFlow™ 0.2 SFCA 
sterile filter and sterile glycerol added at a final concentration of 10% v/v.
