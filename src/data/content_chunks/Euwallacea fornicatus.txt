 Invasion: EggsThe eggs ofE. fornicatushave not been described. However, the eggs of the related genusXyleborusare very small (0.3 mm long), round and partly translucent, with a smooth surface. They are laid singly or in groups. Freshly laid eggs are pale, but they gradually darken before eclosion, hatching in 4 to 6 days.LarvaeThe larva ofE. fornicatus, a closely related species, was described byGardner (1934). The mature larva is about 3.5 mm long and 1.1 mm wide. Larvae are white, legless, C-shaped, with a reddish head, taking 16-18 days to pupate. The head is colourless, about 0.5 mm wide, with the anterior margin nearly straight. The anterior margin of the labrum is nearly straight in the middle, while the posterior margin has a strong median extension. The anterior margin of the epipharynx has a very distinct and regular row of large blade-shaped setae; the internal rods are slightly incurved and the two pairs of setae between the rods are very small and close together, with the anterior pair much more widely separated than the posterior pair. The apical segment of the maxillary palps is stout and distinctly longer than wide. The labial palps are widely separated, with a globular apical segment. Each abdominal segment has two folds on the dorsal surface. The body integument is smooth except for a few scattered minute spicules.PupaePupae are a similar

The labial palps are widely separated, with a globular apical segment. Each abdominal segment has two folds on the dorsal surface. The body integument is smooth except for a few scattered minute spicules.PupaePupae are a similar size to adults and are white. Adults emerge after 7-9 days.AdultsAdult females are dark brown to almost black, with a body length of 2.5-2.8 mm. This species has an elytral length of 1.55-1.67 mm (measured from base to apex in lateral view) and a pronotum length of 1.08-1.14 mm (measured from base to apex in lateral view) (Gomez et al., 2018). The pronotum is as long as wide, subcircular anteriorly with serrations. The antennal funicle is five-segmented, and the club has the second and third segment visible from the posterior face, matching a type 3 club (Hulcr et al., 2007). The protibia has 7 to 10 socketed denticles on the edge. The elytral declivity is convex and gradually sloped. Punctures in elytral striae and interstriae are in rows, large and not impressed in striae, and with large hair-like setae in interstriae. The posterolateral margin of the elytral declivity has a sharp edge or costa. The small wingless males are 1.5-1.67 mm long (Kalshoven, 1958). They occur in in low numbers (typically one or a few in a gallery) and rarely encountered. Males are occasionally seen walking on the surface of infested branches (﻿Cooperband et al., 2016

 Reproduccion: As E. fornicatus was synonymized with several other species until 2018, most of the older literature available on its biology and ecology is available under the latter name and may specifically refer to other related species in the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex. Nevertheless, because the species are closely related, most of the information on biology and ecology can be used for E. fornicatus . Browne (1961) reviewed the biology and ecology of E. fornicatus in South-East Asia, where several closely related species’ distribution overlaps. Wood and Bright (1992) gave several hundred references relating to the biology, habits, taxonomy and control of E. fornicatus . Adult females disperse during the day attacking hosts in a range 30-35 m, but they can travel 400 m ( Browne, 1961 , Owens et al., 2019a ). Females bore a bifurcated or simple tunnel in the twigs and small branches of the host, so that it encircles the stem. If the host is very small, one or two branch tunnels may be constructed. These may be straight or spiral and are often longer than 5 cm. Egg-laying begins as soon as the entrance tunnel is completed. Eggs are laid singly or in small clusters. Males are produced in much smaller numbers, but develop more rapidly than females. The males cannot fly and do not normally leave the parental gallery, although they sometimes emerge and crawl on

Eggs are laid singly or in small clusters. Males are produced in much smaller numbers, but develop more rapidly than females. The males cannot fly and do not normally leave the parental gallery, although they sometimes emerge and crawl on the surface of the bark. Occasionally, these males may enter a gallery made by another female and mate with the females in that gallery system; thus a very small amount of cross-breeding occurs. The larvae live in longitudinal tunnels in small twigs, and in the transverse branch galleries in larger branches. The female larvae pass through three instars ( Gadd, 1941 ; Browne, 1961 ). The larvae pupate together in the tunnels. After emergence from the pupal stage, the young females remain in the galleries for several days, during which time they are fertilized by their brothers. Mated females emerge through the original entrance tunnel and fly to new hosts. They fly during the day and are not attracted to light. Cooperband et al. (2016) found that adults of E. fornicatus develop in 22 days at 24°C, producing 57 female adults in 6 weeks, 7% of which are males. E. fornicatus feeds on symbiotic fungi that is cultivated in the xylem of woody plants ( Batra, 1967 ). The symbiotic fungi, introduced into the gallery by the female, serve as their source of nutrition for larvae, with severe pathogenic effects for some species. The spores of the ambrosia fungus are stored and carried in a specialized structure called mycangia ( Batra, 1963 ), located near the mandibles of the adult female ( Fernando, 1960 ).

The spores travel from the sacs through ducts to the buccal cavity and are then deposited in the gallery using the mandibles and maxillae. Early work on the ambrosia fungi (e.g. Speyer, 1923 ; Gadd and Loos, 1947 ) should not be relied on, because of problems with fungal taxonomy and contamination of fungal cultures. The symbiotic fungus invades the tree vascular tissue, causing cambial necrosis, sugar or gum exudates, branch dieback and mortality of a broad range of tree hosts ( Eskalen et al., 2013 ). The symbiotic fungus Fusarium euwallaceae is always associated with E. fornicatus , and causes branch dieback once introduced ( Eskalen et al., 2012 ; Freeman et al., 2013 ). Despite being closely related species, experiments show that E. fornicatus from Israel and California have high rates of mortality when fed only on the fungal symbiont carried by E. perbrevis ( Freeman et al., 2012 ). However, other members of Euwallacea share other symbiotic Fusarium spp. ( Kasson et al., 2013 ; O’Donnell et al., 2015; Dodge et al., 2017a ). Additional fungi ( Paracremonium spp. and Graphium spp.) are usually abundant in galleries, can act as a nutritional source and are mildly pathogenic, and may serve a critical role in the biology of the beetle-fungi symbiosis ( Lynch et al., 2016 ).

 Sintomas: E. fornicatus bores and tunnels into stems and branches of healthy trees and causes damage through mass accumulation. Females usually colonize the base of secondary branches, resulting in localized branch dieback. In tea, bushes become debilitated. In avocado, the initial infestation is characterized by white exudates from the beetle entrance holes ( Owens et al., 2019a ).

National Management Group Communiqué: Euwallacea fornicatus/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex - 21 October 2022
On 21 October 2022, the National Management Group (NMG) met to consider the response to the Emergency Plant Pest (EPP) Euwallacea fornicatus (Polyphagous shot-hole borer, PSHB)/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex in Western Australia.
Earlier, on 18 October 2022, E. fornicatus and the associated symbiotic Fusarium sp. were formally classified as category 1 EPPs.
The NMG endorsed a three-year Response Plan to eradicate E. fornicatus/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex from Western Australia, with an upper limit of expenditure set at $39.99 million.
The Response Plan is being nationally cost-shared under the Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed (EPPRD).
Euwallacea fornicatus/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex was formally notified under the EPPRD on 3 September 2021. The NMG recognised the extensive work that Western Australia has undertaken to date on emergency surveillance, tracing, containment, and eradication.
Based on international data, E. fornicatus/Fusarium sp. complex has over 680 known host species which it can potentially damage. These species comprise horticulture production, native, and amenity trees. The adult beetles and their larvae can be hard to spot as they spend most of their lives inside a tree. The signs that indicate the borer could be found include multiple entrance holes in the trunk or branches or wilting or dying branches. Further information about PSHB/Fusarium complex is available on the outbreak.gov.au website.
If you live in Western Australia and think you have a tree showing signs of infestation with PSHB, please contact the Exotic Plant Pest Hotline on 1800 0

The symbiotic fungi, introduced into the gallery by the female, serve as their source of nutrition for larvae, with severe pathogenic effects for some species. The spores of the ambrosia fungus are stored and carried in a specialized structure called mycangia ( Batra, 1963 ), located near the mandibles of the adult female ( Fernando, 1960 ). The spores travel from the sacs through ducts to the buccal cavity and are then deposited in the gallery using the mandibles and maxillae. Early work on the ambrosia fungi (e.g. Speyer, 1923 ; Gadd and Loos, 1947 ) should not be relied on, because of problems with fungal taxonomy and contamination of fungal cultures. The symbiotic fungus invades the tree vascular tissue, causing cambial necrosis, sugar or gum exudates, branch dieback and mortality of a broad range of tree hosts ( Eskalen et al., 2013 ). The symbiotic fungus Fusarium euwallaceae is always associated with E. fornicatus , and causes branch dieback once introduced ( Eskalen et al., 2012 ; Freeman et al., 2013 ). Despite being closely related species, experiments show that E. fornicatus from Israel and California have high rates of mortality when fed only on the fungal symbiont carried by E. perbrevis ( Freeman et al., 2012 ). However, other members of Euwallacea share other symbiotic Fusarium spp. ( Kasson et al., 2013 ; O’Donnell et al., 2015; Dodge et al., 2017a ). Additional fungi ( Paracremonium spp. and Graphium spp.) are usually abundant in galleries, can act as a nutritional source and are mildly pathogenic, and may serve a critical role

National Management Group Communiqué: Euwallacea fornicatus/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex - 21 October 2022
On 21 October 2022, the National Management Group (NMG) met to consider the response to the Emergency Plant Pest (EPP) Euwallacea fornicatus (Polyphagous shot-hole borer, PSHB)/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex in Western Australia.
Earlier, on 18 October 2022, E. fornicatus and the associated symbiotic Fusarium sp. were formally classified as category 1 EPPs.
The NMG endorsed a three-year Response Plan to eradicate E. fornicatus/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex from Western Australia, with an upper limit of expenditure set at $39.99 million.
The Response Plan is being nationally cost-shared under the Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed (EPPRD).
Euwallacea fornicatus/Fusarium sp. AF-18 complex was formally notified under the EPPRD on 3 September 2021. The NMG recognised the extensive work that Western Australia has undertaken to date on emergency surveillance, tracing, containment, and eradication.
Based on international data, E. fornicatus/Fusarium sp. complex has over 680 known host species which it can potentially damage. These species comprise horticulture production, native, and amenity trees. The adult beetles and their larvae can be hard to spot as they spend most of their lives inside a tree. The signs that indicate the borer could be found include multiple entrance holes in the trunk or branches or wilting or dying branches. Further information about PSHB/Fusarium complex is available on the outbreak.gov.au website.
If you live in Western Australia and think you have a tree showing signs of infestation with PSHB, please contact the Exotic Plant Pest Hotline on 1800 0
