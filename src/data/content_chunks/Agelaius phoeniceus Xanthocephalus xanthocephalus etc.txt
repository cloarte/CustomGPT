Red-winged blackbirds can cause 
considerable damage to ripening corn, 
sunflower, sorghum, wheat and oats in the 
milk and dough stages, and sprouting and 
ripening rice. The closely related tricolor 
blackbird does some damage to ripening 
rice in California. Damage by common 
grackles is similar, except that grackles will 
feed on mature field corn in the dent 
stage, removing entire kernels from the 
cob. Common grackles also will pull up 
sprouting corn.  
Great-tailed grackles damage various fruits 
and melons, although the loss generally is 
minor. In recent years, however, their 
damage to citrus crops in localized areas 
of the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas 
has been substantial. Great-tails peck the 
citrus fruit skin, creating blemishes or 
holes. Boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus 
major) is a species of the Gulf and 
southeastern and mid-Atlantic coasts that 
is very similar in size and appearance to 
great-tails. They do some damage to 
sprouting rice.

Figure 1. The red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) 
is one of the most abundant birds in North America;  the 
late summer population probably exceeds 300 million 
birds. The black male, with striking red and yellow shoul-
der patches, is about 40 percent larger than the female. 
The female resembles a large sparrow more than a black-
bird.

Brown-headed cowbirds can cause damage to ripening 
sorghum, rice, millet; and sprouting rice. Yellow-headed 
blackbirds cause localized but generally minor damage to 
ripening corn and oats, often in association with redwings. 
Damage to early ripening sunflower can be high near 
wetlands; however, most yellowheads leave the northern 
prairie regions by the time corn and sunflower reach

prairie regions by the time corn and sunflower reach 
physiological maturity in mid-September. Brewer’s 
blackbirds generally cause minor damage to oats and fruit 
crops, but consume large numbers of noxious insects 
during the summer months. Rusty blackbirds typically 
cause little damage to crops.  
Female cowbirds lay their eggs in the nests of other 
songbirds. Cowbird nest parasitism has had a negative 
impact on populations of certain songbirds such as the 
endangered Kirtland’s warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) and 
black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapillus). 
Livestock 
The increased use of feedlots and dairy farms by grackles 
in the northern areas of their expanding range may be a 
cause for concern in the future, due to the potential for 
disease transmission. Cowbirds consume some livestock 
feed, but often glean waste grain and seed from dung. 
Brewer’s blackbirds generally cause minor damage to 
livestock feed in feedlots. 
Human Health and Safety 
The close association of cowbirds and grackles with 
livestock at feedlots in winter (Figure 2) has the potential 
to amplify and spread disease to humans such as avian 
influenza although there is no evidence that this has 
happened.  
The accumulation of feces at winter roosts (Figure 3), 
especially sites used in multiple winters, provides an 
enrichment of the soil favorable for the growth of the 
histoplasma fungus that can infect humans.

histoplasma fungus that can infect humans. 
Flocks of blackbirds near airports (Figure 4) can cause a 
risk to flight safety because these birds can be ingested in 
large numbers into turbine-powered engines.  
Nuisance Problems  
Massive congregations of blackbirds and starlings in winter 
roost sites near human activity and habitations (Figure 4) 
can create nuisance concerns, as well as disease concerns 
as noted previously, because of the noise and 
accumulation of large amounts of feces and associated 
odors around the roost site.  
Figure 2. Flocks of blackbirds and starlings often concentrate in livestock 
feeding areas during winter where they compete with livestock for food and 
cause concerns regarding disease transmission to livestock and humans.

Blackbird damage to agricultural crops often is easy to 
identify because the flocks of birds and the visible signs of 
the damage are conspicuous. However, correct identifica-
tion of the species of birds in the agricultural field is im-
portant, along with evidence that the birds are actually 
feeding on the crop. For example, starlings superficially 
resemble blackbirds and sometimes feed in cornfields, yet

 flocks of birds and the visible signs of 
the damage are conspicuous. However, correct identifica-
tion of the species of birds in the agricultural field is im-
portant, along with evidence that the birds are actually 
feeding on the crop. For example, starlings superficially 
resemble blackbirds and sometimes feed in cornfields, yet 
they usually feed on concentrations of insects such as 
armyworms, doing little, if any damage to corn. Also, red-
winged blackbirds often are attracted to agricultural fields, 
such as corn and sunflower, initially to feed on rootworm 
beetles, sunflower weevils, and other insect pests. They 
will not damage the crop itself until the grain has reached 
the milk stage. Blackbirds often forage in newly planted 
grain fields such as winter wheat, feeding on previous crop 
residue, weed seeds, and insects without bothering the 
sprouting grain. Blackbirds can, however, cause serious 
damage to newly sprouted rice.  
Blackbird damage also can be confused with other forms 
of loss. Deer, raccoon, and squirrel damage to corn can be 
mistaken for blackbird damage (Figure 5). Also, seed shat-
ter in sunflower caused by wind may resemble bird dam-
age; however, the difference usually can be detected by 
examining sunflower heads (Figure 6) for the presence or 
absence of bird droppings and by looking on the ground for 
hulls or whole seeds. Careful observation of the birds in the 
field and a little detective work usually will result in the 
correct identification of the cause of damage.

hulls or whole seeds. Careful observation of the birds in the 
field and a little detective work usually will result in the 
correct identification of the cause of damage. 
To accurately estimate the amount of blackbird damage in 
an agricultural field, examine at least 10 locations widely 
spaced throughout the field. For example, if a field has 100 
rows and is 1,000 feet long, walk staggered distances of 
100 feet along every 10th row (for example, 0 to 100 feet 
in row 10, 101 to 200 feet in row 20, and so on). In each 
of the 100-foot lengths, randomly select 10 plants and 
visually estimate the damage on the head or ear of each 
plant to the nearest 1% (for instance, 2% destroyed, 20% 
destroyed). For corn, six kernels usually represent about 
1% of the corn on an ear; for sunflower, it may be easiest 
to visually divide the head into four quarters and then esti-
mate the percentage of seeds missing. When finished, 
simply determine the average damage for the 100 plants 
examined. This will give an approximation of the percent 
loss to the field. Multiply the percent loss by expected yield 
to get a rough estimate of yield loss. In small grains, such 
as rice, estimates of loss are more difficult to obtain. One 
possibility is to compare the yields from plots in damaged 
and undamaged sections of a field.

Figure 5. Damage to ripening corn by blackbirds (left) and mammals (e.g., 
deer [right], raccoons, or squirrels) can sometimes be confused. Blackbirds 
usually slit or shred the husk and peck out the soft contents of kernels, 
leaving the kernel coats, which turn black. Deer, raccoons, and squirrels 
chew through the husk and bite off the kernels. In addition, raccoons often 
pull stalks down to ground, leaving muddy paw prints on the corn plant.

A key to damage prevention is the integration of multiple 
methods that are complimentary; a single technique used 
in isolation is seldom successful. Habitat management 
(see below) is the foundation of integrated pest 
management because these techniques provide long-term 
protection and enhance the effectiveness of control 
techniques such as frightening devices.  
As discussed below, it also is important to monitor the crop 
or situation and apply reactive control methods before or 
as soon as damage begins and only if damage is likely to 
be substantial. Money is often wasted when (1) control 
techniques are directed at blackbirds in crop-damage 
situations after the birds have already inflicted substantial 
damage and

As discussed below, it also is important to monitor the crop 
or situation and apply reactive control methods before or 
as soon as damage begins and only if damage is likely to 
be substantial. Money is often wasted when (1) control 
techniques are directed at blackbirds in crop-damage 
situations after the birds have already inflicted substantial 
damage and are migrating or moving to other ripening 
fields, or (2) the overall damage inflicted is minor (e.g., less 
than 1% of crop) and the cost of control exceeds the 
losses. 
Habitat Modification 
Most economically severe blackbird damage to agricultural 
crops occurs in fields within 5 miles of roosts. Thus, one 
strategy is to plant non-attractive crops; such as soybeans, 
wheat, potatoes, or hay; in fields within a few miles of a 
roost. If crops vulnerable to damage, such as corn or 
sunflower, are planted near a roost, make alternative 
feeding sites available to reduce the feeding pressure on 
these cash crops. Delay the plowing or tilling of previously 
harvested cropland near roosts to provide alternative 
feeding sites to reduce damage to maturing crops. Fields 
near roosts should not be planted unusually early or late so 
that they mature in isolation from other fields in the area. 
In general, as alternative feeding sites decline, maturing 
grain or sunflower fields become more attractive to 
blackbirds, and keeping them out becomes more difficult. 
Damage to sprouting rice fields planted near blackbird 
roosts in Louisiana and Texas can be substantially reduced 
by delaying planting until April. By this time, the large flocks 
of migrant blackbirds will have left for their

 decline, maturing 
grain or sunflower fields become more attractive to 
blackbirds, and keeping them out becomes more difficult. 
Damage to sprouting rice fields planted near blackbird 
roosts in Louisiana and Texas can be substantially reduced 
by delaying planting until April. By this time, the large flocks 
of migrant blackbirds will have left for their northern 
nesting areas.  
The timing of harvest can be very important in reducing 
damage to fields from flocks of blackbirds. For example, 
redwings inflict most damage to sweet corn at the time of 
fresh-market harvest, when the corn enters the milk stage. 
Timely harvest of sweet corn can substantially reduce 
damage. Field corn generally becomes unattractive to birds 
when the kernels mature. Sunflower, sorghum, and rice 
continue to be attractive after they mature and thus should 
be harvested as soon as possible. In some cases, a pre-
harvest desiccant can be used on mature sunflower to 
advance dry down and harvest by 7-10 days.

sunflower head in North Dakota.

Hybrids of corn with long husk extension and thick husks 
are more resistant to damage than other hybrids (Figure 7). 
Sorghum that contains a high tannin content also is less 
preferred than low-tannin varieties. For sunflower, birds 
prefer oil seed cultivars over the confectionery cultivars. 
Using sunflower cultivars with heads that turn downward 
as they mature and seeds with thick hulls should also help 
reduce feeding by blackbirds. 
Studies of red-winged blackbird feeding habits in ripening 
corn fields revealed that they often are attracted to fields 
with high populations of insect pests such as rootworm 
beetles, corn borers, and Japanese beetles. Cultural prac-
tices or chemical applications to reduce these insects will 
make the fields less attractive to the birds. 
Sunflower growers in the northern plains can thin out 
dense stands of cattails in marshes where large numbers 
of blackbirds roost near sunflower fields. Apply an aquatic 
formulation of the herbicide glyphosate in swaths to about 
70% of a cattail marsh. Thinning the cattail stands usually 
decreases or eliminates blackbird roosts in a marsh and 
increases use by waterfowl for nesting and other activities. 
Exclusion 
Exclusion of blackbirds and other birds from agricultural 
crops is practical only for small gardens, experimental 
plots, and high-value fruit crops. Use lightweight nets to 
cover trees, bushes, or small plots.

cover trees, bushes, or small plots.  
Protect individual ears of sweet corn in garden plots by 
placing paper bags over them after the silk has turned 
brown. 
Frightening Devices 
The use of frightening devices can be quite effective in 
protecting crops from flocks of blackbirds. Their use also 
requires hard work and long hours for the farmer, who 
needs to be persistent and innovative to keep one step 
ahead of the birds. It is especially important for devices to 
be employed in the early morning and in late afternoon 
when the birds are feeding most actively. Crops such as 
sweet corn, which are vulnerable to blackbirds for only a 
few days before harvest, may not be too difficult to protect; 
however, the task becomes formidable for crops such as 
sunflower and sorghum, which may be vulnerable for up to 
6 weeks.  
The effectiveness of frightening devices is highly variable, 
depending on the persistence of the operator, the skill 
used in employing a device, the attractiveness of the crop, 
the number of birds, and the availability of alternate feed-
ing sites. Birds tend to adjust or adapt to frightening devic-
es. It is usually better to use two or more devices than to 
rely on a single device. 
Auditory 
Propane exploders are the most popular frightening devic-
es. Some have timers that automatically turn them on and 
off each day or have remote-controlled activators. In gen-

Auditory 
Propane exploders are the most popular frightening devic-
es. Some have timers that automatically turn them on and 
off each day or have remote-controlled activators. In gen-
eral, use at least one exploder for every 10 acres (4 ha) of 
crop to be protected. Elevate exploders on a barrel, stand, 
or truck bed to “shoot” over the crop, and move them 
around the field every few days. In addition, reinforce this 
technique occasionally with other frightening devices. By 
shooting a .22-caliber rifle just over the top of a crop, a 
person on a stand or truck bed can frighten birds from 
fields of 40 acres (16 ha) or more. Obviously, care must be 
taken when shooting in this manner, and the use of limited 
range cartridges is recommended.  
A variety of auditory bird-frightening devices, including elec-
tronic high-intensity acoustic systems  and tape-recorded 
distress calls for birds occasionally are used to rid fields of 
blackbirds. 
Visual 
A variety of visual bird-frightening devices, including helium
-filled balloons tethered in fields, radio-controlled model 
planes, reflecting tapes made of Mylar® (Figure 8), and 
various types of animated scarecrows, occasionally are 
used to rid fields of blackbirds.

Auditory-Visual 
Pyrotechnics fired from a 12-gauge shotgun (shell 
crackers) or other pistol-type launcher (e.g., bangers and 
screamers) can be effective at frightening blackbirds. 
Shooting birds with a shotgun, using standard non-toxic 
bird shot, can kill a few birds and often reinforce other 
scare devices such as pyrotechnics and propane cannons. 
This technique, however, usually is not as effective in 
moving birds as the other devices that have greater range. 
Thus, a shotgun patrol should not be used as the sole 
means of frightening birds. 
Chemical 
Avitrol® is an EPA-registered chemical frightening agent 
(active ingredient 4-aminopyridine) for blackbirds and other 
pest birds that previously had labels for use in ripening 
corn and sunflower fields from the 1970s to early 2000s. 
This product is no longer registered for field crops but can 
be used in non-crop areas. The ingestion of one or more 
treated corn particles by a blackbird causes erratic flight, 
distress calls, and usually death. This behavior often 
causes the remaining birds in the flock to leave the area.  
Repellents

to reduce bird damage to freshly planted and sprouting

and trademark names of these products often change; 
thus, check with county extension agents or USDA-APHIS-
Wildlife Services (WS) biologists for products currently 
registered. Always read the product label and refer to state, 
province, and local restrictions. 
Fertility Control 
No specific work is being done on fertility control in 
blackbirds. 
Toxicants 
Starlicide™ is a registered toxicant for blackbirds and 
starlings in feedlot situations. The active ingredient, 3-
chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride, is incorporated into 
pelletized bait at a concentration of 0.1% and sold 
commercially under the trade name Starlicide Complete®. 
Starlicide Technical® (DRC-1339, 98% active ingredient), 
which can be custom-mixed with livestock feed or other 
bait material, is also available through the USDA-APHIS 
Wildlife Services (WS) Program. Starlicide Technical® can 
be used only by or under supervision of WS employees.

Starlicide is a slow-acting toxicant; birds usually die 1 to 3

winter, especially with snow cover present, when alternate 
foods are scarce. A successful program generally requires 
a period of prebaiting with nontoxic bait to accustom the 
target blackbirds and starlings to feed at specific bait sites 
inaccessible to livestock in the feedlot. Monitoring to 
ensure that nontarget birds such as doves, song birds, and 
barnyard fowl do not feed at bait sites is essential. Check 
the product label for details on use, application, personal 
protection, factors affecting efficacy, and disposal. Always 
read product labels and refer to state, province, and local 
restrictions.

Trapping 
Certain species of blackbirds, particularly redwings, brown-
headed cowbirds, and common grackles, often can be 
readily trapped in decoy traps. These traps also are effec-
tive for starlings. Consult a state wildlife official, such as a 
conservation officer or game warden, before putting a de-
coy trap into operation. A decoy trap is a large (e.g., 20- x 
20- x 6-foot) poultry wire or net enclosure containing 10 to 
20 decoy birds, food, and water (Figure 9). Birds

. Consult a state wildlife official, such as a 
conservation officer or game warden, before putting a de-
coy trap into operation. A decoy trap is a large (e.g., 20- x 
20- x 6-foot) poultry wire or net enclosure containing 10 to 
20 decoy birds, food, and water (Figure 9). Birds enter the 
trap through an opening (often 2- x 4-foot) in the top of the 
cage that is covered with 2- x 4-inch welded wire mesh. The 
blackbirds can fold their wings and readily drop through 
the openings to the food below, generally cracked corn, 
millet, or sunflower seeds. A small (e.g., 2- x 2- x 3-foot) 
gathering cage with a sliding door attached to an opening 
at an upper corner of the trap can be used to collect 
trapped birds. A corralling baffle running about two-thirds 
the length of the trap can aid in driving the birds into the 
gathering cage. 
A decoy trap often catches 10 to 50 blackbirds and star-
lings per day and occasionally up to 300 when located 
near a large roost. Obviously, the decoy trap is of question-
able value when trying to reduce large roosting populations 
and damage to the surrounding agricultural fields. These 
traps, however, can be used to temporarily reduce local 
populations of blackbirds in special situations. For exam-
ple, decoy traps have been used successfully in an 11-
county area of Michigan since the 1970s to reduce cow-
bird populations during the nesting season. This control 
was initiated to increase the nesting success of the 
Kirtland’s warbler, an endangered species whose nests

ple, decoy traps have been used successfully in an 11-
county area of Michigan since the 1970s to reduce cow-
bird populations during the nesting season. This control 
was initiated to increase the nesting success of the 
Kirtland’s warbler, an endangered species whose nests 
often are used by cowbirds for laying their own eggs. Each 
year decoy traps in this area of Michigan have captured 
about 3,600 cowbirds. Decoy traps might also be success-
ful in reducing localized populations around feedlots or 
fruit crops.  
Immediately release any nontarget songbirds accidentally 
captured in a decoy trap. Blackbirds to be disposed of 
should be killed humanely. They can be transferred from 
the gathering cage to a cardboard box or canvas-covered 
cage and asphyxiated with carbon dioxide gas. Examine all 
dead birds for bands, and report any bands found to the 
USFWS.  
Shooting 
As discussed under Frightening Devices, shooting to kill 
with a shotgun is most effective when used occasionally to 
supplement or reinforce other scare devices. By itself, 
shooting with a shotgun is not cost-effective in frightening 
blackbirds from large agricultural fields, and is totally inef-
fective as a means of reducing populations. Examine any 
killed birds for bands. It also may be useful to examine the 
stomach contents to determine if the birds are feeding on 
insect pests and weed seeds.  
Blackbirds provide some benefits by feeding on harmful 
insects, such as rootworm beetles (Diabrotica spp.) and 
corn earworms (Helicoverpa zea), and

wings are a food source for a variety of avian and mamma-
lian predators.

Economics 
 
 
Superficial surveys of agricultural fields often overestimate 
blackbird damage and thus exaggerate the overall severity 
of the economic threat for one of four reasons: (1) the 
conspicuousness of blackbird flocks tends to heighten the 
awareness of bird damage compared with other more 
subtle forms of loss caused by weeds, insects, other pests, 
weather, and harvesting; (2) the eye naturally seeks out 
the conspicuously bird-damaged plants; (3) bird damage is 
often most severe along field edges where an observer is 
most likely to notice; and (4) damage by raccoons, other 
mammals, or wind sometimes is mistaken for bird damage 
(see the section Damage Identification). This is not to

 seeks out 
the conspicuously bird-damaged plants; (3) bird damage is 
often most severe along field edges where an observer is 
most likely to notice; and (4) damage by raccoons, other 
mammals, or wind sometimes is mistaken for bird damage 
(see the section Damage Identification). This is not to 
downgrade the problem of blackbird damage in agriculture; 
damage can be economically severe on occasion and quite 
frustrating to the farmer when relief is not readily available. 
It is important, however, to obtain objective estimates of 
damage levels likely to occur, for only then can someone 
make intelligent decisions regarding the amount of money 
and effort to be invested on control. The final decision on 
control measures must take into account the value of the 
crop, cost of control, and the degree of effectiveness of the 
control measure in relation to the probable levels of 
damage.  
Studies during the past four decades concerning blackbird 
damage to various crops such as corn and sunflower 
indicate that on statewide or regional bases, overall 
average damage is low, generally less than 1% of the crop. 
This may translate into national losses per year of $150 
million combined for corn, sunflower, and rice (at 2012 
prices) but overall, this is a minor loss to the macro 
agricultural economy. If all farmers received less than 1% 
damage, there would be little concern; however, the 
damage is not equally distributed. While most farmers 
escape economically serious damage, a few farmers

damage, there would be little concern; however, the 
damage is not equally distributed. While most farmers 
escape economically serious damage, a few farmers 
receive serious damage. For example, a bioenergetics 
study of blackbird damage to sunflowers in the northern 
Great Plains indicated an overall loss of sunflower to 
blackbirds was estimated to be only 1.7% of the crop. 
Other studies indicated that about 2% of the fields 
received more than 10% loss. Only in these relatively few 
fields that sustain high levels of damage can control 
measures generally be cost-effective.  
While accurate prediction of damage is often impossible to 
obtain, knowledge of the location of a field in relation to 
traditional roosting sites often provides the basis for a 
sound estimate of potential damage. For example, studies 
of blackbird damage to ripening corn in Ohio and North 
Dakota have revealed that almost all losses exceeding 5% 
of the crop have occurred in fields within 5 miles of 
marshes containing large blackbird roosts in late summer.  
Objective estimates of damage levels in previous years for 
the same or nearby fields are another means of predicting 
future damage levels, because bird damage is fairly 
consistent from year to year within a locality. This 
information also provides a good baseline for evaluating 
the effectiveness of management strategies. Of course, it 
is important that estimates be objective and apply to the 
entire field.

Physical Description 
The various species of blackbirds have several traits in 
common. Males are predominantly black or iridescent in 
color. The male red-winged blackbird is a little smaller than 
an American robin and is black with red and yellow shoul-
der patches (Figure 1). The smaller female is brownish, 
resembling a large sparrow. The common grackle is an 
iridescent blackbird slightly larger than a robin with a long 
keel-shaped tail. The male, slightly larger than the female, 
has more iridescence on the head and throat. The great-
tailed grackle is similar to the common grackle but with

resembling a large sparrow. The common grackle is an 
iridescent blackbird slightly larger than a robin with a long 
keel-shaped tail. The male, slightly larger than the female, 
has more iridescence on the head and throat. The great-
tailed grackle is similar to the common grackle but with a 
much larger tail. The male is slightly smaller than an Ameri-
can crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos); the female is smaller 
and browner than the male. The brown-headed cowbird is 
the smallest blackbird. The male is black with a brown 
head and the female is brown (Figure 10). Both sexes have 
finch-like bills.  
The yellow-headed blackbird is a robin-sized bird. The male 
has a striking appearance with a black body, conspicuous 
yellow head and breast, and a white wing patch in flight. 
The female is smaller and browner, with a yellowish throat 
and breast. The Brewer’s blackbird is a robin-sized bird. 
The male is all black with whitish eyes and the female is 
brownish gray with dark eyes. The rusty blackbird is similar 
to Brewer’s blackbird, but its fall and winter plumage has a 
rusty coloration. 
Range 
The red-winged blackbird is an abundant nester throughout 
much of North America and winters throughout the south-
ern United States. The common grackle is a common nest-
er throughout North America east of the Rockies and win-
ters in the southern U.S., often in association with other 
blackbird species and starlings. The great-tailed grackle is

much of North America and winters throughout the south-
ern United States. The common grackle is a common nest-
er throughout North America east of the Rockies and win-
ters in the southern U.S., often in association with other 
blackbird species and starlings. The great-tailed grackle is 
an abundant year-round resident in the southwestern U.S. 
(especially Texas) and Mexico. In recent years, great-tailed 
grackles have expanded their range northward into the 
central Great Plains where they gather in feedlots and dair-
ies in winter. Cowbirds originally were a species of the 
Great Plains associated with bison, but with the clearing of 
forests for agriculture, now occur in spring and summer 
throughout much of North America. Cowbirds spend win-
ters in the central to southern U.S., often roosting with oth-
er blackbird species and starlings. Yellow-headed black-
birds are locally abundant nesters in deep-water marshes 
of the northern Great Plains and western North America. 
They spend winter farther south than other blackbirds, pri-
marily in Mexico. Brewer’s blackbirds are common in the 
northern Great Plains and western North America. It is a 
winter migrant in the central and southern Plains states, 
sometimes roosting with other blackbird species. Rusty 
blackbirds occupy Canada, Alaska, and northern New Eng-
land and Michigan. They migrate in winter to the southern 
U.S. from the Atlantic coast to east Texas. (See Appendix 2 
for range maps)

Voice and Sounds 
Each blackbird species has distinctive vocalizations that 
are easily recognizable with a little practice. The sounds 
made when large numbers of blackbirds are entering 
nighttime roosts can be quite cacophonous.

Reproduction 
Blackbirds and grackles mature in 1 year. Nesting typically 
occurs from April to July. Females have 3 to 5 eggs in their 
open-cup nests made of grasses and other vegetation. 
Eggs hatch after about 12 days of incubation; the young 
grow rapidly and are ready to fledge about 10 days later. 
Females often will renest if their initial nest is destroyed. 
Their high mortality rate is offset by a reproductive rate of 2 
to 5 young fledged per female per year. 
Cowbirds do not build nests or incubate eggs; females lay 
their eggs in nests of other songbirds. They are the only 
North American songbird to do so. Females deposit 1 or 
sometimes 2 eggs per host nest, laying

Cowbirds do not build nests or incubate eggs; females lay 
their eggs in nests of other songbirds. They are the only 
North American songbird to do so. Females deposit 1 or 
sometimes 2 eggs per host nest, laying up to 25 or more 
eggs per nesting season. The cowbird nestlings usually out-
compete other nestlings for food, crowding them out of the 
nest.  
Mortality 
The annual survival rate of blackbirds and grackles is 
about 50-60% for adults (1 year or older) and even less for 
first-year birds.  
Because of their abundance, blackbirds are an important 
food source for a variety of mammalian and avian 
predators. Predation, exposure to inclement weather, and 
flying into wires and other structures are all important 
sources of mortality.  
Population Status 
The red-winged blackbird is one of the most abundant 
birds in North America. In July, after the young have 
fledged from nests, the continental population exceeds 
300 million birds. The common grackle is the second most 
abundant blackbird, with a population approaching 200 
million in mid-summer. Most of the other blackbird species, 
although not as common as the redwing or grackle, all 
have abundant healthy populations. Exceptions are the 
rusty blackbird and the tricolored blackbird (Agelaius 
tricolor), a species similar in appearance and behavior to 
red-winged blackbirds that has a restricted range in 
California.

have abundant healthy populations. Exceptions are the 
rusty blackbird and the tricolored blackbird (Agelaius 
tricolor), a species similar in appearance and behavior to 
red-winged blackbirds that has a restricted range in 
California. 
The population of rusty blackbirds has declined by as much 
as 90% from 1966 to 2013 (based on Breeding Bird 
Survey data). The reason for this decline is not clear but 
some authors suggest habitat degradation as the root 
cause. 
Habitat 
Red-winged blackbirds nest in diverse habitats of marshes, 
hayfields, ditches, and hedge rows. Large flocks feed in 
fields and bottomlands. Common grackles nest in small 
colonies in shelterbelts (especially evergreens such as 
spruces), farmyards, marshes, and towns. Flocks feed in 
fields, lawns, woodlots, and bottomlands. Common 
grackles often roost with redwings, but are partial to 
roosting sites in upland deciduous or pine trees. Great-
tailed grackles nest in colonies in shrubs and trees, 
sometimes in association with herons and egrets. The 
flocks feed around farms, pastures, and parks. In winter, 
great-tailed grackles gather in nighttime roosts in live oaks 
and other dense vegetation.  
Cowbirds deposit eggs in the nests of other birds. They 
feed as flocks in pastures, feedlots, and lawns, and often 
are associated with livestock. Yellow-headed blackbirds 
nest in emergent vegetation over marshes and other 
wetlands. They feed

and other dense vegetation.  
Cowbirds deposit eggs in the nests of other birds. They 
feed as flocks in pastures, feedlots, and lawns, and often 
are associated with livestock. Yellow-headed blackbirds 
nest in emergent vegetation over marshes and other 
wetlands. They feed in agricultural fields, meadows, and 
pastures during late summer and fall, sometimes in 
association with redwings or other blackbirds.  
Brewer’s blackbirds nest in in colonies in a variety of 
habitats. They feed in flocks on waste grain and weed 
seeds in agricultural lands, pastures, and lawns. Rusty 
blackbirds nest in northern swamps, bogs, and muskeg 
throughout Canada, Alaska, northern New England, and 
Michigan. They often feed on insects in a variety of 
habitats. During winter, rusty blackbirds prefer swampy 
areas and river bottoms in the southern U.S. They often 
roost with other species of blackbirds.  
Behavior 
Outside of the nesting season, blackbirds generally feed in 
flocks and roost at night in congregations varying from a 
few birds to several million birds (Figures 4, 11). These  
Page 10 WDM Technical Series—Blackbirds 
 
 
flocks and roosting congregations sometimes consist of a 
single species, but often several species intermingle. 
Sometimes non-blackbird species, notably European star-
lings and American robins, join them. The flocks will forage 
during the day up to 30 miles from the nighttime roost lo-
cation.

single species, but often several species intermingle. 
Sometimes non-blackbird species, notably European star-
lings and American robins, join them. The flocks will forage 
during the day up to 30 miles from the nighttime roost lo-
cation. 
Redwings, common grackles, and cowbirds generally mi-
grate from Canada and the northern U.S in October to No-
vember, spending the winter in the southern U.S. Yellow-
headed blackbirds are early migrants, departing the north-
ern Great Plains by September, although flocks numbering 
several hundred can be found feeding in North Dakota in 
late September. 
Food Habits 
All blackbirds have an omnivorous diet consisting primarily 
of grains, weed seeds, fruits, and insects. The relative pro-
portions of these food groups, however, vary considerably 
among species and even between sexes within a species.  
Red-winged blackbirds feed primarily on insects during the 
nesting season (May through July), with the diet shifting 
predominantly to grain and weed seeds in late summer 
through winter. Males and females often forage in sepa-
rate flocks, with females more insectivorous than males. 
The common grackle’s diet is similar to that of the redwing, 
but the grackle is more predatory. Its diet occasionally in-
cludes small fish, field mice, songbird nestlings, and eggs. 
Grackles have a larger, stronger bill than redwings, allow-
ing them to crack open and feed on acorns and other tree 
fruits in winter. Great-tailed grackles are omnivorous: their 
diet includes insects, aquatic organisms, eggs from nesting

Grackles have a larger, stronger bill than redwings, allow-
ing them to crack open and feed on acorns and other tree 
fruits in winter. Great-tailed grackles are omnivorous: their 
diet includes insects, aquatic organisms, eggs from nesting 
birds, fruits, and grains. The diet of cowbirds consists pre-
dominantly of weed seeds and grains, and less than 25% 
insects. The diet of yellow-headed blackbirds is similar to 
that of redwings; yellowheads primarily eat insects during 
the nesting season and grains and weed seeds at other 
times. Brewer’s blackbirds eat about two-thirds grain and 
weed seeds and one-third insects and other animal matter. 
The diet of rusty blackbirds contains more insects than 
that of other blackbirds. Over 50% of their food is animal 
matter. Grain (gleaned from harvested fields in fall and 
winter), weed seeds, and tree fruits also are eaten.  
 
Blackbirds are native migratory birds, and thus come under 
the jurisdiction of the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
(MBTA), a formal treaty with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and 
Russia. Blackbirds have federal protection in the U.S. Most 
species of blackbirds may be killed under the Depredation 
Order for Blackbirds, Cowbirds, Grackles, Crows, and Mag-
pies (50 CFR 21.43), but only when found “committing or 
about to commit depredations upon ornamental or shade 
trees, agricultural crops, livestock, or wildlife, or when con-

about to commit depredations upon ornamental or shade 
trees, agricultural crops, livestock, or wildlife, or when con-
centrated in such numbers and manner as to constitute a 
health hazard or other nuisance.” In 2010, rusty blackbirds 
were removed from the Depredation Order and given full 
protection by the MBTA as has always been the case for 
the tricolored blackbird. Other revisions include that non-
toxic shot must be used when taking birds by shotgun un-
der the authority of CFR 21.43. Also, at the end of each 
calendar year anyone taking blackbirds under CFR 21.43 
must provide the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) the 
following information: name and address of taker, species 
and number taken, month when birds were taken, state 
and county where birds were taken, and a general explana-
tion of why the birds were taken.

Red-winged blackbirds can cause 
considerable damage to ripening corn, 
sunflower, sorghum, wheat and oats in the 
milk and dough stages, and sprouting and 
ripening rice. The closely related tricolor 
blackbird does some damage to ripening 
rice in California. Damage by common 
grackles is similar, except that grackles will 
feed on mature field corn in the dent 
stage, removing entire kernels from the 
cob. Common grackles also will pull up 
sprouting corn.  
Great-tailed grackles damage various fruits 
and melons, although the loss generally is 
minor. In recent years, however, their 
damage to citrus crops in localized areas 
of the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas 
has been substantial. Great-tails peck the 
citrus fruit skin, creating blemishes or 
holes. Boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus 
major) is a species of the Gulf and 
southeastern and mid-Atlantic coasts that 
is very similar in size and appearance to 
great-tails. They do some damage to 
sprouting rice.

prairie regions by the time corn and sunflower reach 
physiological maturity in mid-September. Brewer’s 
blackbirds generally cause minor damage to oats and fruit 
crops, but consume large numbers of noxious insects 
during the summer months. Rusty blackbirds typically 
cause little damage to crops.  
Female cowbirds lay their eggs in the nests of other 
songbirds. Cowbird nest parasitism has had a negative 
impact on populations of certain songbirds such as the 
endangered Kirtland’s warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) and 
black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapillus). 
Livestock 
The increased use of feedlots and dairy farms by grackles 
in the northern areas of their expanding range may be a 
cause for concern in the future, due to the potential for 
disease transmission. Cowbirds consume some livestock 
feed, but often glean waste grain and seed from dung. 
Brewer’s blackbirds generally cause minor damage to 
livestock feed in feedlots. 
Human Health and Safety 
The close association of cowbirds and grackles with 
livestock at feedlots in winter (Figure 2) has the potential 
to amplify and spread disease to humans such as avian 
influenza although there is no evidence that this has 
happened.  
The accumulation of feces at winter roosts (Figure 3), 
especially sites used in multiple winters, provides an 
enrichment of the soil favorable for the growth of the

Flocks of blackbirds near airports (Figure 4) can cause a 
risk to flight safety because these birds can be ingested in 
large numbers into turbine-powered engines.  
Nuisance Problems  
Massive congregations of blackbirds and starlings in winter 
roost sites near human activity and habitations (Figure 4) 
can create nuisance concerns, as well as disease concerns 
as noted previously, because of the noise and 
accumulation of large amounts of feces and associated 
odors around the roost site.  
Figure 2. Flocks of blackbirds and starlings often concentrate in livestock 
feeding areas during winter where they compete with livestock for food and 
cause concerns regarding disease transmission to livestock and humans.

Blackbird damage to agricultural crops often is easy to 
identify because the flocks of birds and the visible signs of 
the damage are conspicuous. However, correct identifica-
tion of the species of birds in the agricultural field is im-
portant, along with evidence that the birds are actually 
feeding on the crop. For example, starlings superficially

 flocks of birds and the visible signs of 
the damage are conspicuous. However, correct identifica-
tion of the species of birds in the agricultural field is im-
portant, along with evidence that the birds are actually 
feeding on the crop. For example, starlings superficially 
resemble blackbirds and sometimes feed in cornfields, yet 
they usually feed on concentrations of insects such as 
armyworms, doing little, if any damage to corn. Also, red-
winged blackbirds often are attracted to agricultural fields, 
such as corn and sunflower, initially to feed on rootworm 
beetles, sunflower weevils, and other insect pests. They 
will not damage the crop itself until the grain has reached 
the milk stage. Blackbirds often forage in newly planted 
grain fields such as winter wheat, feeding on previous crop 
residue, weed seeds, and insects without bothering the 
sprouting grain. Blackbirds can, however, cause serious 
damage to newly sprouted rice.  
Blackbird damage also can be confused with other forms 
of loss. Deer, raccoon, and squirrel damage to corn can be 
mistaken for blackbird damage (Figure 5). Also, seed shat-
ter in sunflower caused by wind may resemble bird dam-
age; however, the difference usually can be detected by 
examining sunflower heads (Figure 6) for the presence or 
absence of bird droppings and by looking on the ground for 
hulls or whole seeds. Careful observation of the birds in the 
field and a little detective work usually will result in the 
correct identification of the cause of damage.

hulls or whole seeds. Careful observation of the birds in the 
field and a little detective work usually will result in the 
correct identification of the cause of damage. 
To accurately estimate the amount of blackbird damage in 
an agricultural field, examine at least 10 locations widely 
spaced throughout the field. For example, if a field has 100 
rows and is 1,000 feet long, walk staggered distances of 
100 feet along every 10th row (for example, 0 to 100 feet 
in row 10, 101 to 200 feet in row 20, and so on). In each 
of the 100-foot lengths, randomly select 10 plants and 
visually estimate the damage on the head or ear of each 
plant to the nearest 1% (for instance, 2% destroyed, 20% 
destroyed). For corn, six kernels usually represent about 
1% of the corn on an ear; for sunflower, it may be easiest 
to visually divide the head into four quarters and then esti-
mate the percentage of seeds missing. When finished, 
simply determine the average damage for the 100 plants 
examined. This will give an approximation of the percent 
loss to the field. Multiply the percent loss by expected yield 
to get a rough estimate of yield loss. In small grains, such 
as rice, estimates of loss are more difficult to obtain. One 
possibility is to compare the yields from plots in damaged 
and undamaged sections of a field.

Figure 5. Damage to ripening corn by blackbirds (left) and mammals (e.g., 
deer [right], raccoons, or squirrels) can sometimes be confused. Blackbirds 
usually slit or shred the husk and peck out the soft contents of kernels, 
leaving the kernel coats, which turn black. Deer, raccoons, and squirrels 
chew through the husk and bite off the kernels. In addition, raccoons often 
pull stalks down to ground, leaving muddy paw prints on the corn plant.

A key to damage prevention is the integration of multiple 
methods that are complimentary; a single technique used 
in isolation is seldom successful. Habitat management 
(see below) is the foundation of integrated pest 
management because these techniques provide long-term 
protection and enhance the effectiveness of control 
techniques such as frightening devices.  
As discussed below, it also is important to monitor the crop 
or situation and apply reactive control methods before or 
as soon as damage begins and only if damage is likely to 
be substantial. Money is often wasted when (1) control 
techniques are directed at blackbirds in crop-damage 
situations after the birds have already inflicted substantial 
damage and

As discussed below, it also is important to monitor the crop 
or situation and apply reactive control methods before or 
as soon as damage begins and only if damage is likely to 
be substantial. Money is often wasted when (1) control 
techniques are directed at blackbirds in crop-damage 
situations after the birds have already inflicted substantial 
damage and are migrating or moving to other ripening 
fields, or (2) the overall damage inflicted is minor (e.g., less 
than 1% of crop) and the cost of control exceeds the 
losses. 
Habitat Modification 
Most economically severe blackbird damage to agricultural 
crops occurs in fields within 5 miles of roosts. Thus, one 
strategy is to plant non-attractive crops; such as soybeans, 
wheat, potatoes, or hay; in fields within a few miles of a 
roost. If crops vulnerable to damage, such as corn or 
sunflower, are planted near a roost, make alternative 
feeding sites available to reduce the feeding pressure on 
these cash crops. Delay the plowing or tilling of previously 
harvested cropland near roosts to provide alternative 
feeding sites to reduce damage to maturing crops. Fields 
near roosts should not be planted unusually early or late so 
that they mature in isolation from other fields in the area. 
In general, as alternative feeding sites decline, maturing 
grain or sunflower fields become more attractive to 
blackbirds, and keeping them out becomes more difficult. 
Damage to sprouting rice fields planted near blackbird 
roosts in Louisiana and Texas can be substantially reduced 
by delaying planting until April. By this time, the large flocks 
of migrant blackbirds will have left for their

grain or sunflower fields become more attractive to 
blackbirds, and keeping them out becomes more difficult. 
Damage to sprouting rice fields planted near blackbird 
roosts in Louisiana and Texas can be substantially reduced 
by delaying planting until April. By this time, the large flocks 
of migrant blackbirds will have left for their northern 
nesting areas.  
The timing of harvest can be very important in reducing 
damage to fields from flocks of blackbirds. For example, 
redwings inflict most damage to sweet corn at the time of 
fresh-market harvest, when the corn enters the milk stage. 
Timely harvest of sweet corn can substantially reduce 
damage. Field corn generally becomes unattractive to birds 
when the kernels mature. Sunflower, sorghum, and rice 
continue to be attractive after they mature and thus should 
be harvested as soon as possible. In some cases, a pre-
harvest desiccant can be used on mature sunflower to 
advance dry down and harvest by 7-10 days.

Hybrids of corn with long husk extension and thick husks 
are more resistant to damage than other hybrids (Figure 7). 
Sorghum that contains a high tannin content also is less 
preferred than low-tannin varieties. For sunflower, birds 
prefer oil seed cultivars over the confectionery cultivars. 
Using sunflower cultivars with heads that turn downward 
as they mature and seeds with thick hulls should also help 
reduce feeding by blackbirds. 
Studies of red-winged blackbird feeding habits in ripening 
corn fields revealed that they often are attracted to fields 
with high populations of insect pests such as rootworm 
beetles, corn borers, and Japanese beetles. Cultural prac-
tices or chemical applications to reduce these insects will 
make the fields less attractive to the birds. 
Sunflower growers in the northern plains can thin out 
dense stands of cattails in marshes where large numbers 
of blackbirds roost near sunflower fields. Apply an aquatic 
formulation of the herbicide glyphosate in swaths to about 
70% of a cattail marsh. Thinning the cattail stands usually 
decreases or eliminates blackbird roosts in a marsh and 
increases use by waterfowl for nesting and other activities. 
Exclusion 
Exclusion of blackbirds and other birds from agricultural 
crops is practical only for small gardens, experimental 
plots, and high-value fruit crops. Use lightweight nets to 
cover trees, bushes, or small plots.

Protect individual ears of sweet corn in garden plots by 
placing paper bags over them after the silk has turned 
brown. 
Frightening Devices 
The use of frightening devices can be quite effective in 
protecting crops from flocks of blackbirds. Their use also 
requires hard work and long hours for the farmer, who 
needs to be persistent and innovative to keep one step 
ahead of the birds. It is especially important for devices to 
be employed in the early morning and in late afternoon 
when the birds are feeding most actively. Crops such as 
sweet corn, which are vulnerable to blackbirds for only a 
few days before harvest, may not be too difficult to protect; 
however, the task becomes formidable for crops such as 
sunflower and sorghum, which may be vulnerable for up to 
6 weeks.  
The effectiveness of frightening devices is highly variable, 
depending on the persistence of the operator, the skill 
used in employing a device, the attractiveness of the crop, 
the number of birds, and the availability of alternate feed-
ing sites. Birds tend to adjust or adapt to frightening devic-
es. It is usually better to use two or more devices than to 
rely on a single device. 
Auditory 
Propane exploders are the most popular frightening devic-
es. Some have timers that automatically turn them on and

Auditory 
Propane exploders are the most popular frightening devic-
es. Some have timers that automatically turn them on and 
off each day or have remote-controlled activators. In gen-
eral, use at least one exploder for every 10 acres (4 ha) of 
crop to be protected. Elevate exploders on a barrel, stand, 
or truck bed to “shoot” over the crop, and move them 
around the field every few days. In addition, reinforce this 
technique occasionally with other frightening devices. By 
shooting a .22-caliber rifle just over the top of a crop, a 
person on a stand or truck bed can frighten birds from 
fields of 40 acres (16 ha) or more. Obviously, care must be 
taken when shooting in this manner, and the use of limited 
range cartridges is recommended.  
A variety of auditory bird-frightening devices, including elec-
tronic high-intensity acoustic systems  and tape-recorded 
distress calls for birds occasionally are used to rid fields of 
blackbirds. 
Visual 
A variety of visual bird-frightening devices, including helium
-filled balloons tethered in fields, radio-controlled model 
planes, reflecting tapes made of Mylar® (Figure 8), and 
various types of animated scarecrows, occasionally are 
used to rid fields of blackbirds.

Auditory-Visual 
Pyrotechnics fired from a 12-gauge shotgun (shell 
crackers) or other pistol-type launcher (e.g., bangers and 
screamers) can be effective at frightening blackbirds. 
Shooting birds with a shotgun, using standard non-toxic 
bird shot, can kill a few birds and often reinforce other 
scare devices such as pyrotechnics and propane cannons. 
This technique, however, usually is not as effective in 
moving birds as the other devices that have greater range. 
Thus, a shotgun patrol should not be used as the sole 
means of frightening birds. 
Chemical 
Avitrol® is an EPA-registered chemical frightening agent 
(active ingredient 4-aminopyridine) for blackbirds and other 
pest birds that previously had labels for use in ripening 
corn and sunflower fields from the 1970s to early 2000s. 
This product is no longer registered for field crops but can 
be used in non-crop areas. The ingestion of one or more 
treated corn particles by a blackbird causes erratic flight, 
distress calls, and usually death. This behavior often 
causes the remaining birds in the flock to leave the area.  
Repellents

Fertility Control 
No specific work is being done on fertility control in 
blackbirds. 
Toxicants 
Starlicide™ is a registered toxicant for blackbirds and 
starlings in feedlot situations. The active ingredient, 3-
chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride, is incorporated into 
pelletized bait at a concentration of 0.1% and sold 
commercially under the trade name Starlicide Complete®. 
Starlicide Technical® (DRC-1339, 98% active ingredient), 
which can be custom-mixed with livestock feed or other 
bait material, is also available through the USDA-APHIS

Starlicide is a slow-acting toxicant; birds usually die 1 to 3

winter, especially with snow cover present, when alternate 
foods are scarce. A successful program generally requires 
a period of prebaiting with nontoxic bait to accustom the 
target blackbirds and starlings to feed at specific bait sites 
inaccessible to livestock in the feedlot. Monitoring to 
ensure that nontarget birds such as doves, song birds, and 
barnyard fowl do not feed at bait sites is essential. Check 
the product label for details on use, application, personal 
protection, factors affecting efficacy, and disposal. Always 
read product labels and refer to state, province, and local 
restrictions.

Trapping 
Certain species of blackbirds, particularly redwings, brown-
headed cowbirds, and common grackles, often can be 
readily trapped in decoy traps. These traps also are effec-
tive for starlings. Consult a state wildlife official, such as a 
conservation officer or game warden, before putting a de-
coy trap into operation. A decoy trap is a large (e.g., 20- x 
20- x 6-foot) poultry wire or net enclosure containing 10 to 
20 decoy birds, food, and water (Figure 9). Birds

. Consult a state wildlife official, such as a 
conservation officer or game warden, before putting a de-
coy trap into operation. A decoy trap is a large (e.g., 20- x 
20- x 6-foot) poultry wire or net enclosure containing 10 to 
20 decoy birds, food, and water (Figure 9). Birds enter the 
trap through an opening (often 2- x 4-foot) in the top of the 
cage that is covered with 2- x 4-inch welded wire mesh. The 
blackbirds can fold their wings and readily drop through 
the openings to the food below, generally cracked corn, 
millet, or sunflower seeds. A small (e.g., 2- x 2- x 3-foot) 
gathering cage with a sliding door attached to an opening 
at an upper corner of the trap can be used to collect 
trapped birds. A corralling baffle running about two-thirds 
the length of the trap can aid in driving the birds into the 
gathering cage. 
A decoy trap often catches 10 to 50 blackbirds and star-
lings per day and occasionally up to 300 when located 
near a large roost. Obviously, the decoy trap is of question-
able value when trying to reduce large roosting populations 
and damage to the surrounding agricultural fields. These 
traps, however, can be used to temporarily reduce local 
populations of blackbirds in special situations. For exam-
ple, decoy traps have been used successfully in an 11-
county area of Michigan since the 1970s to reduce cow-
bird populations during the nesting season. This control 
was initiated to increase the nesting success of the

was initiated to increase the nesting success of the 
Kirtland’s warbler, an endangered species whose nests 
often are used by cowbirds for laying their own eggs. Each 
year decoy traps in this area of Michigan have captured 
about 3,600 cowbirds. Decoy traps might also be success-
ful in reducing localized populations around feedlots or 
fruit crops.  
Immediately release any nontarget songbirds accidentally 
captured in a decoy trap. Blackbirds to be disposed of 
should be killed humanely. They can be transferred from 
the gathering cage to a cardboard box or canvas-covered 
cage and asphyxiated with carbon dioxide gas. Examine all 
dead birds for bands, and report any bands found to the 
USFWS.  
Shooting 
As discussed under Frightening Devices, shooting to kill 
with a shotgun is most effective when used occasionally to 
supplement or reinforce other scare devices. By itself, 
shooting with a shotgun is not cost-effective in frightening 
blackbirds from large agricultural fields, and is totally inef-
fective as a means of reducing populations. Examine any 
killed birds for bands. It also may be useful to examine the 
stomach contents to determine if the birds are feeding on 
insect pests and weed seeds.  
Blackbirds provide some benefits by feeding on harmful 
insects, such as rootworm beetles (Diabrotica spp.) and 
corn earworms (Helicoverpa zea), and

Blackbirds provide some benefits by feeding on harmful 
insects, such as rootworm beetles (Diabrotica spp.) and 
corn earworms (Helicoverpa zea), and on weed seeds, 
such as Johnson grass. Because of their abundance, red-
wings are a food source for a variety of avian and mamma-
lian predators.

Economics 
 
 
Superficial surveys of agricultural fields often overestimate 
blackbird damage and thus exaggerate the overall severity 
of the economic threat for one of four reasons: (1) the 
conspicuousness of blackbird flocks tends to heighten the 
awareness of bird damage compared with other more 
subtle forms of loss caused by weeds, insects, other pests, 
weather, and harvesting; (2) the eye naturally seeks out 
the conspicuously bird-damaged plants; (3) bird damage is 
often most severe along field edges where an observer is 
most likely to notice; and (4) damage by raccoons, other 
mammals, or wind sometimes is mistaken for bird damage 
(see the section Damage Identification). This is not to 
downgrade

 seeks out 
the conspicuously bird-damaged plants; (3) bird damage is 
often most severe along field edges where an observer is 
most likely to notice; and (4) damage by raccoons, other 
mammals, or wind sometimes is mistaken for bird damage 
(see the section Damage Identification). This is not to 
downgrade the problem of blackbird damage in agriculture; 
damage can be economically severe on occasion and quite 
frustrating to the farmer when relief is not readily available. 
It is important, however, to obtain objective estimates of 
damage levels likely to occur, for only then can someone 
make intelligent decisions regarding the amount of money 
and effort to be invested on control. The final decision on 
control measures must take into account the value of the 
crop, cost of control, and the degree of effectiveness of the 
control measure in relation to the probable levels of 
damage.  
Studies during the past four decades concerning blackbird 
damage to various crops such as corn and sunflower 
indicate that on statewide or regional bases, overall 
average damage is low, generally less than 1% of the crop. 
This may translate into national losses per year of $150 
million combined for corn, sunflower, and rice (at 2012 
prices) but overall, this is a minor loss to the macro 
agricultural economy. If all farmers received less than 1% 
damage, there would be little concern; however, the 
damage is not equally distributed. While most farmers 
escape economically serious damage, a few farmers 
receive serious damage. For example, a bioenergetics 
study of blackbird damage to sunflowers in the northern 
Great Plains indicated an overall loss of sunflower to 
blackbirds was estimated to

damage, there would be little concern; however, the 
damage is not equally distributed. While most farmers 
escape economically serious damage, a few farmers 
receive serious damage. For example, a bioenergetics 
study of blackbird damage to sunflowers in the northern 
Great Plains indicated an overall loss of sunflower to 
blackbirds was estimated to be only 1.7% of the crop. 
Other studies indicated that about 2% of the fields 
received more than 10% loss. Only in these relatively few 
fields that sustain high levels of damage can control 
measures generally be cost-effective.  
While accurate prediction of damage is often impossible to 
obtain, knowledge of the location of a field in relation to 
traditional roosting sites often provides the basis for a 
sound estimate of potential damage. For example, studies 
of blackbird damage to ripening corn in Ohio and North 
Dakota have revealed that almost all losses exceeding 5% 
of the crop have occurred in fields within 5 miles of 
marshes containing large blackbird roosts in late summer.  
Objective estimates of damage levels in previous years for 
the same or nearby fields are another means of predicting 
future damage levels, because bird damage is fairly 
consistent from year to year within a locality. This 
information also provides a good baseline for evaluating 
the effectiveness of management strategies. Of course, it 
is important that estimates be objective and apply to the 
entire field.

Physical Description 
The various species of blackbirds have several traits in 
common. Males are predominantly black or iridescent in 
color. The male red-winged blackbird is a little smaller than 
an American robin and is black with red and yellow shoul-
der patches (Figure 1). The smaller female is brownish, 
resembling a large sparrow. The common grackle is an 
iridescent blackbird slightly larger than a robin with a long 
keel-shaped tail. The male, slightly larger than the female, 
has more iridescence on the head and throat. The great-
tailed grackle is similar to the common grackle but with

resembling a large sparrow. The common grackle is an 
iridescent blackbird slightly larger than a robin with a long 
keel-shaped tail. The male, slightly larger than the female, 
has more iridescence on the head and throat. The great-
tailed grackle is similar to the common grackle but with a 
much larger tail. The male is slightly smaller than an Ameri-
can crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos); the female is smaller 
and browner than the male. The brown-headed cowbird is 
the smallest blackbird. The male is black with a brown 
head and the female is brown (Figure 10). Both sexes have 
finch-like bills.  
The yellow-headed blackbird is a robin-sized bird. The male 
has a striking appearance with a black body, conspicuous 
yellow head and breast, and a white wing patch in flight. 
The female is smaller and browner, with a yellowish throat 
and breast. The Brewer’s blackbird is a robin-sized bird. 
The male is all black with whitish eyes and the female is 
brownish gray with dark eyes. The rusty blackbird is similar 
to Brewer’s blackbird, but its fall and winter plumage has a 
rusty coloration. 
Range 
The red-winged blackbird is an abundant nester throughout 
much of North America and winters throughout the south-
ern United States. The common grackle is a common nest-
er throughout North America east of the Rockies and win-
ters in the southern U.S., often in association with other 
blackbird species and starlings. The great-tailed grackle is

much of North America and winters throughout the south-
ern United States. The common grackle is a common nest-
er throughout North America east of the Rockies and win-
ters in the southern U.S., often in association with other 
blackbird species and starlings. The great-tailed grackle is 
an abundant year-round resident in the southwestern U.S. 
(especially Texas) and Mexico. In recent years, great-tailed 
grackles have expanded their range northward into the 
central Great Plains where they gather in feedlots and dair-
ies in winter. Cowbirds originally were a species of the 
Great Plains associated with bison, but with the clearing of 
forests for agriculture, now occur in spring and summer 
throughout much of North America. Cowbirds spend win-
ters in the central to southern U.S., often roosting with oth-
er blackbird species and starlings. Yellow-headed black-
birds are locally abundant nesters in deep-water marshes 
of the northern Great Plains and western North America. 
They spend winter farther south than other blackbirds, pri-
marily in Mexico. Brewer’s blackbirds are common in the 
northern Great Plains and western North America. It is a 
winter migrant in the central and southern Plains states, 
sometimes roosting with other blackbird species. Rusty 
blackbirds occupy Canada, Alaska, and northern New Eng-
land and Michigan. They migrate in winter to the southern 
U.S. from the Atlantic coast to east Texas. (See Appendix 2 
for range maps)

Voice and Sounds 
Each blackbird species has distinctive vocalizations that 
are easily recognizable with a little practice. The sounds 
made when large numbers of blackbirds are entering 
nighttime roosts can be quite cacophonous.

Reproduction 
Blackbirds and grackles mature in 1 year. Nesting typically 
occurs from April to July. Females have 3 to 5 eggs in their 
open-cup nests made of grasses and other vegetation. 
Eggs hatch after about 12 days of incubation; the young 
grow rapidly and are ready to fledge about 10 days later. 
Females often will renest if their initial nest is destroyed. 
Their high mortality rate is offset by a reproductive rate of 2 
to 5 young fledged per female per year. 
Cowbirds do not build nests or incubate eggs; females lay 
their eggs in nests of other songbirds. They are the only 
North American songbird to do so. Females deposit 1 or 
sometimes 2 eggs per host nest, laying

Their high mortality rate is offset by a reproductive rate of 2

Cowbirds do not build nests or incubate eggs; females lay 
their eggs in nests of other songbirds. They are the only 
North American songbird to do so. Females deposit 1 or 
sometimes 2 eggs per host nest, laying up to 25 or more 
eggs per nesting season. The cowbird nestlings usually out-
compete other nestlings for food, crowding them out of the 
nest.  
Mortality 
The annual survival rate of blackbirds and grackles is 
about 50-60% for adults (1 year or older) and even less for 
first-year birds.  
Because of their abundance, blackbirds are an important 
food source for a variety of mammalian and avian 
predators. Predation, exposure to inclement weather, and 
flying into wires and other structures are all important 
sources of mortality.  
Population Status 
The red-winged blackbird is one of the most abundant 
birds in North America. In July, after the young have 
fledged from nests, the continental population exceeds 
300 million birds. The common grackle is the second most 
abundant blackbird, with a population approaching 200 
million in mid-summer. Most of the other blackbird species, 
although not as common as the redwing or grackle, all 
have abundant healthy populations. Exceptions are the 
rusty blackbird and the tricolored blackbird (Agelaius 
tricolor), a species similar in appearance and behavior to 
red-winged blackbirds that has a restricted range in 
California.

have abundant healthy populations. Exceptions are the 
rusty blackbird and the tricolored blackbird (Agelaius 
tricolor), a species similar in appearance and behavior to 
red-winged blackbirds that has a restricted range in 
California. 
The population of rusty blackbirds has declined by as much 
as 90% from 1966 to 2013 (based on Breeding Bird 
Survey data). The reason for this decline is not clear but 
some authors suggest habitat degradation as the root 
cause. 
Habitat 
Red-winged blackbirds nest in diverse habitats of marshes, 
hayfields, ditches, and hedge rows. Large flocks feed in 
fields and bottomlands. Common grackles nest in small 
colonies in shelterbelts (especially evergreens such as 
spruces), farmyards, marshes, and towns. Flocks feed in 
fields, lawns, woodlots, and bottomlands. Common 
grackles often roost with redwings, but are partial to 
roosting sites in upland deciduous or pine trees. Great-
tailed grackles nest in colonies in shrubs and trees, 
sometimes in association with herons and egrets. The 
flocks feed around farms, pastures, and parks. In winter, 
great-tailed grackles gather in nighttime roosts in live oaks 
and other dense vegetation.  
Cowbirds deposit eggs in the nests of other birds. They 
feed as flocks in pastures, feedlots, and lawns, and often 
are associated with livestock. Yellow-headed blackbirds 
nest in emergent vegetation over marshes and other 
wetlands. They feed

and other dense vegetation.  
Cowbirds deposit eggs in the nests of other birds. They 
feed as flocks in pastures, feedlots, and lawns, and often 
are associated with livestock. Yellow-headed blackbirds 
nest in emergent vegetation over marshes and other 
wetlands. They feed in agricultural fields, meadows, and 
pastures during late summer and fall, sometimes in 
association with redwings or other blackbirds.  
Brewer’s blackbirds nest in in colonies in a variety of 
habitats. They feed in flocks on waste grain and weed 
seeds in agricultural lands, pastures, and lawns. Rusty 
blackbirds nest in northern swamps, bogs, and muskeg 
throughout Canada, Alaska, northern New England, and 
Michigan. They often feed on insects in a variety of 
habitats. During winter, rusty blackbirds prefer swampy 
areas and river bottoms in the southern U.S. They often 
roost with other species of blackbirds.  
Behavior 
Outside of the nesting season, blackbirds generally feed in 
flocks and roost at night in congregations varying from a 
few birds to several million birds (Figures 4, 11). These  
Page 10 WDM Technical Series—Blackbirds 
 
 
flocks and roosting congregations sometimes consist of a 
single species, but often several species intermingle. 
Sometimes non-blackbird species, notably European star-
lings and American robins, join them. The flocks will forage 
during the day up to 30 miles from the nighttime roost lo-
cation.

Sometimes non-blackbird species, notably European star-
lings and American robins, join them. The flocks will forage 
during the day up to 30 miles from the nighttime roost lo-
cation. 
Redwings, common grackles, and cowbirds generally mi-
grate from Canada and the northern U.S in October to No-
vember, spending the winter in the southern U.S. Yellow-
headed blackbirds are early migrants, departing the north-
ern Great Plains by September, although flocks numbering 
several hundred can be found feeding in North Dakota in 
late September. 
Food Habits 
All blackbirds have an omnivorous diet consisting primarily 
of grains, weed seeds, fruits, and insects. The relative pro-
portions of these food groups, however, vary considerably 
among species and even between sexes within a species.  
Red-winged blackbirds feed primarily on insects during the 
nesting season (May through July), with the diet shifting 
predominantly to grain and weed seeds in late summer 
through winter. Males and females often forage in sepa-
rate flocks, with females more insectivorous than males. 
The common grackle’s diet is similar to that of the redwing, 
but the grackle is more predatory. Its diet occasionally in-
cludes small fish, field mice, songbird nestlings, and eggs. 
Grackles have a larger, stronger bill than redwings, allow-
ing them to crack open and feed on acorns and other tree 
fruits in winter. Great-tailed grackles are omnivorous: their 
diet includes insects, aquatic organisms, eggs from nesting

Grackles have a larger, stronger bill than redwings, allow-
ing them to crack open and feed on acorns and other tree 
fruits in winter. Great-tailed grackles are omnivorous: their 
diet includes insects, aquatic organisms, eggs from nesting 
birds, fruits, and grains. The diet of cowbirds consists pre-
dominantly of weed seeds and grains, and less than 25% 
insects. The diet of yellow-headed blackbirds is similar to 
that of redwings; yellowheads primarily eat insects during 
the nesting season and grains and weed seeds at other 
times. Brewer’s blackbirds eat about two-thirds grain and 
weed seeds and one-third insects and other animal matter. 
The diet of rusty blackbirds contains more insects than 
that of other blackbirds. Over 50% of their food is animal 
matter. Grain (gleaned from harvested fields in fall and 
winter), weed seeds, and tree fruits also are eaten.  
 
Blackbirds are native migratory birds, and thus come under 
the jurisdiction of the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
(MBTA), a formal treaty with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and 
Russia. Blackbirds have federal protection in the U.S. Most 
species of blackbirds may be killed under the Depredation 
Order for Blackbirds, Cowbirds, Grackles, Crows, and Mag-
pies (50 CFR 21.43), but only when found “committing or 
about to commit depredations upon ornamental or shade 
trees, agricultural crops, livestock, or wildlife, or when con-

about to commit depredations upon ornamental or shade 
trees, agricultural crops, livestock, or wildlife, or when con-
centrated in such numbers and manner as to constitute a 
health hazard or other nuisance.” In 2010, rusty blackbirds 
were removed from the Depredation Order and given full 
protection by the MBTA as has always been the case for 
the tricolored blackbird. Other revisions include that non-
toxic shot must be used when taking birds by shotgun un-
der the authority of CFR 21.43. Also, at the end of each 
calendar year anyone taking blackbirds under CFR 21.43 
must provide the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) the 
following information: name and address of taker, species 
and number taken, month when birds were taken, state 
and county where birds were taken, and a general explana-
tion of why the birds were taken.

Conflicts with humans 
 Brewer’s 
blackbird 
(Euphagus 
cyanocephalus)  
Male = 67 grams 
Female = 58 grams 
Consumes large numbers of 
harmful insects during the 
summer months. Flocks feed in 
pastures and feedlots, and often 
are associated with livestock. 
  
Causes generally minor damage to 
oats, fruit crops, and livestock 
feed.    
 Brown-headed 
cowbird 
(Molothrus ater) 
Male = 49 grams 
Female = 38 grams 
Eats weed seeds and grains.

are associated with livestock. 
  
Causes generally minor damage to 
oats, fruit crops, and livestock 
feed.    
 Brown-headed 
cowbird 
(Molothrus ater) 
Male = 49 grams 
Female = 38 grams 
Eats weed seeds and grains. 
Insects are < 25% of diet. Female 
lays eggs in nests of other 
songbirds, the only North 
American songbird to do so. Often 
roosts with red-winged blackbirds, 
grackles, and European starlings. 
 
Damages sprouting rice; ripening 
sorghum, sunflower, and millet. 
Eats some livestock feed; gleans 
waste grain and seed from dung. 
Parasitizes nests of some 
endangered species. Winter roosts 
in urban areas cause disease and 
nuisance concerns.  
 Common grackle 
(Quiscalus 
quiscula)  
Male = 120 grams 
Female = 92 grams 
Omnivorous; feeds on acorns, 
insects, frogs, fish, and seeds. 
Prefers fields, lawns, woodlots, 
and bottomlands. Often roosts 
with red-winged blackbirds, 
brown-headed cowbirds, and 
European starlings.  
Similar to damage by red-winged 
blackbirds, but will feed on corn in 
the dent stage, removing entire 
kernels. Also, grackles will pull up 
sprouting corn. Winter roosts in 
urban areas cause disease and 
nuisance concerns.

blackbirds, but will feed on corn in

kernels. Also, grackles will pull up 
sprouting corn. Winter roosts in 
urban areas cause disease and

 Great-tailed 
grackle 
(Quiscalus 
mexicanus)  
Male = 222 grams 
Female = 116 grams 
Omnivorous; feeds on insects, 
aquatic organisms, eggs from 
nesting birds, fruits, and grains on 
farms, pastures, and parks. Nests 
in colonies in shrubs or trees, 
sometimes in association with 
herons and egrets.  
Damages fruits and melons, 
although the loss is generally 
minor. They will peck citrus fruit 
skin, creating blemishes or holes. 
 Rusty blackbird 
(Euphagus 
carolinus)  
Male = 64 grams 
Female = 55 grams 
More insectivorous than other 
blackbirds. Over 50% of their food 
is animal matter. Grain (gleaned 
from harvested fields), weed 
seeds, and tree fruits also are 
eaten. They prefer swampy areas 
and river bottoms.  
This species does little damage to 
crops.. Population is declining and 
a specific depredation permit is 
required to take Rusty blackbirds. 
Roosts in small numbers with other 
blackbirds and European starlings 
in winter.  
 Red-winged 
blackbird 
(Agelaius 
phoeniceus) 
Male = 65 grams 
Female = 40

 Red-winged 
blackbird 
(Agelaius 
phoeniceus) 
Male = 65 grams 
Female = 40 grams 
Eats primarily weed seeds and 
grains. Females feed on more 
insects than males. Nests in 
cattails in marshes and ditches, 
but also in upland hay fields and 
brush. Often roosts with cowbirds, 
grackles, and European starlings.  
Damages sprouting rice; ripening 
corn, sunflower, rice, and other 
grain crops. Winter roosts in urban 
areas cause disease and nuisance 
concerns.  
 Yellow-headed 
blackbird 
(Xanthocephalus 
xanthocephalus)  
Male = 80 grams 
Female = 50 grams 
Feeds in agricultural fields, 
meadows, and pastures during 
late summer and fall, sometimes 
with red-winged blackbirds or 
other blackbirds. Nests in deep-
water marshes.  
Causes generally minor damage to 
ripening corn, sunflower, and oats, 
often in association with red-
winged blackbirds.
