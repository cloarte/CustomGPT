SciadopityaceaeLuerssen金松科 jin song keAuthors:Liguo Fu,Yong-fu Yu&Aljos FarjonTrees evergreen, monoecious; branches short, spreading. Leaves dimorphic: scalelike leaves scattered on branchlets or clustered at apex of branchlets, small; connate leaves formed by the complete fusion of two leaves, arising from the axils of scalelike leaves and spreading radially at apex of branchlets, linear, flat, leathery, with a deep furrow both adaxially and abaxially. Pollen cones clustered at apex of branches; microsporophylls numerous, spirally arranged. Seed cones ripening in 2nd year, terminal, shortly pedunculate, with numerous, spirally arranged cone scales; bracts nearly enclosed by cone scales. Seeds 5-9 per scale, ovoid, with a narrow wing. Cotyledons 2. 2n= 20.One genus and one species: Japan; introduced in China.Chen Chia-jui & Tsui Hung-pin. 1978.Sciadopitys. In:Cheng Wan-chün & Fu Li-kuo, eds., Fl. Reipubl.
