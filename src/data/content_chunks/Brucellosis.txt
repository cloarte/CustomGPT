Brucellosis and  
Dog Kennels: 
What Breeders  
Need To Know
USDA, Mike Tuck
USDA, R. Anson Eaglin
Remember: it’s up to you  
to protect your dogs from 
brucellosis.
n Know the facts about the disease. 
n Watch for signs—but know that many dogs never 
show signs.
n Work with your veterinarian to test your dogs.
n Maintain good biosecurity and use safe cleaning 
techniques.
Work With Your Veterinarian
Your veterinarian can help you navigate the many challenges 
with preventing, testing for, and controlling brucellosis, including 
biosecurity measures that can protect against the disease. 
In general, if you have never tested for brucellosis at your kennel, 
it’s best to test all dogs and then repeat testing every 4 weeks 
until all of them have had two consecutive negative tests. Also, 
continue to test all new dogs before they enter your kennel. 
This is the most important thing you can do to keep brucellosis out.
Testing Process
Typically, your veterinarian will first perform a screening test such 
as the “rapid slide agglutination” or “tube agglutination” test. A 
negative result on a screening test is usually very reliable. A posi -
tive result on a screening test needs to be confirmed with further 
testing, such as AGID (agar gel immunodiffusion), ELISA (enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay), IFA (immunoflorescent assay

tube agglutination” test. A 
negative result on a screening test is usually very reliable. A posi -
tive result on a screening test needs to be confirmed with further 
testing, such as AGID (agar gel immunodiffusion), ELISA (enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay), IFA (immunoflorescent assay), PCR 
(polymerase chain reaction), or blood culture, to determine if your 
dog is truly positive. 
If a truly positive dog is found, you need to test the entire kennel.  
Infected Kennels
If you find out one of your dogs is infected, work closely with your 
veterinarian to achieve a disease-free kennel. The best way to 
clear a kennel of brucellosis is to test all dogs in the kennel every 
4 weeks until all of them have had two consecutive negative tests.
Dogs that are positive for brucellosis should be removed from 
the kennel as soon as possible. There is no cure. Your State 
veterinarian or local and State public health officials can also give 
further guidance on handling brucellosis-positive dogs. Also, if you 
rehome a positive dog, spay or neuter the animal and inform the 
new owners of the risk. Throughout the process, keep practicing 
good biosecurity techniques.

disease in dogs.

How It Spreads 
Canine brucellosis can spread by direct contact with tissues or 
fluids from infected dogs. These include, among others: saliva, 
blood, urine, feces, vaginal discharge, semen, milk, or an aborted 
fetus. The disease can also spread in aerosolized form, such as 
when high-pressure sprayers are used to clean kennels or when 
contaminated dust and dirt is inhaled.  
fatigue, and swollen testicles. If you see any of these symptoms in 
yourself or others, contact a medical doctor.

What You Can Do:  
Prevention and Control
Unfortunately, there are no vaccines available for brucellosis. The 
best way to keep the disease out of your kennel is to make sure 
you test all new dogs before they enter your property. If a new dog 
cannot be tested before coming onto your property, quarantine the 
dog in another building furthest away from your kennel until proper 
testing is done. Never use untested dogs for breeding, and always 
practice good biosecurity at your facility.

Brucellosis and Your Dogs
USDA, Mike Tuck
Biosecurity Tips 
n Take care of brucellosis-negative dogs first, before 
attending to quarantined or brucellosis-suspect dogs. 
Wash your hands, and change clothing and footwear 
before attending to brucellosis-negative dogs.
n Use gloves, wear a face mask, and change boots when 
entering an area with infected dogs.
n Take special precautions when handling and removing 
fetuses, placenta, and fetal fluids, especially after an 
abortion or stillbirth.
n Clean and disinfect the kennel regularly. Avoid direct 
contact with urine or feces—consider using a degreaser 
or detergent to break down the organic film before using 
your disinfectant.
n Keep other dogs, people who own dogs, and wildlife 
(including pests) from entering your kennel.
Know the Facts
n Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria (Brucella) 
that live mainly inside the cells of reproductive organs. 
n There are various types of Brucella—found throughout the 
United States—that can infect dogs, pigs, cattle, deer, elk, 
sheep, goats, and other mammals. 
n People can become infected by all of these types, including 
the one associated with dogs (called Brucella canis). 
n Puppies born from infected mothers are often infected. This 
is a serious problem, since these animals may go into

 can infect dogs, pigs, cattle, deer, elk,

n People can become infected by all of these types, including 
the one associated with dogs (called Brucella canis). 
n Puppies born from infected mothers are often infected. This 
is a serious problem, since these animals may go into homes 
with children and others vulnerable to disease. 
Test all of your dogs for 
brucellosis. Many infected 
dogs show no signs— 
so testing may be  
the only way  
you’ll know.
Puppies born from infected mothers 
are often infected. This poses a 
health threat for the families they go 
to, especially those with children.
As a dog breeder, you are responsible for the 
welfare of your dogs. This includes protecting their 
health and making sure they are free of contagious 
diseases like brucellosis. 
Canine brucellosis can devastate your dogs’ 
health and your kennel business. It causes major 
reproductive problems in dogs, including infertility, 
stillbirths, and early abortions. The disease can also 
lead to a host of other damaging health issues. If 
your dogs are infected with brucellosis, the earlier 
you find out and the quicker you act, the sooner 
you’ll have a brucellosis-free kennel again.
Your efforts not only keep your animals safe, but 
also protect the families they will go to—and your 
reputation as a breeder.
n Because the bacteria live inside cells, there is  
no cure for brucellosis in dogs. Even after months of 
antibiotic treatment, dogs can still remain infected and

all dogs in your kennel for brucellosis.  
n Infected dogs should be removed from your kennel.
n Many dogs never show signs of the disease.  
Testing is often the only way to detect it.
What To Watch For
Dogs with brucellosis may show any of the following signs:
n Abortions (most at 45–55 days of pregnancy)
n Puppies born dead or very weak
n Male infertility
n Swollen testicles and/or epididymitis
n Enlarged lymph nodes
n Lameness and lethargy
Be aware that these signs can mimic other diseases, and many 
infected dogs show no signs. As a result, it can be difficult to tell if 
a dog has brucellosis based on outward appearance alone. Testing done 
by a veterinarian is the best way to know if your animals are infected. 
Human Health Risks
People can get brucellosis from dogs, but because the disease is 
hard to diagnose in humans, the true number of these cases is 
unknown. Those who work in close contact with dogs are most at 
risk for infection. Children, pregnant women, and those with compro-
mised immune systems are also vulnerable. Symptoms may include 
flu-like signs (fever, headache, night sweats, chills,
