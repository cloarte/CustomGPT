1. Reagent Name: Fowl Laryngotracheitis Challenge Virus 
2. Strain or Source: N/A 
3. Lot Number: 07-3 
4. Fill Date: May 2007 
5. Expiration Date: Not applicable. Challenge control birds with each application to verify 
challenge. 
Precautions: Fowl Laryngotracheitis virus is infectious for chickens and certain other avian 
species. Consult with your institutional biosafety committee regarding the proper 
biocontainment requirements for handling and disposing of this virus at your facility. 
6. Intended Use: This agent is intended for use in chickens only, as a challenge virus for 
the evaluation of laryngotracheitis virus biologicals, as per title 9, Code of Federal Regulations 
(9 CFR), section 113.328(c), or other Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service approved 
protocols for the evaluation of fowl laryngotracheitis biologicals. 
7. Instructions for Use: Dilute 1:4 in tryptose phosphate broth and inoculate 0.5 mL into 
the trachea. Observe daily for 10 days for clinical signs of laryngotracheitis or death. 
8. Test of Reagent: The

7. Instructions for Use: Dilute 1:4 in tryptose phosphate broth and inoculate 0.5 mL into 
the trachea. Observe daily for 10 days for clinical signs of laryngotracheitis or death. 
8. Test of Reagent: The average titer of the challenge virus was determined by 
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) titration in specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs and 
calculated by evaluating the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50). The resulting average titer is 104.1 
EID50 per mL. The challenge virus is negative for bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma after being 
tested by 9 CFR 113.27 and 9 CFR 113.28, respectively. The challenge virus was tested and 
shown to be free of avian lymphoid leukosis by 9 CFR 113.31, hemagglutinating viruses by 
9 CFR 113.34, and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV) by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as per Veterinary Services Memorandum No. 800.88 and 
800.89. 
Bird challenge: 90% (27/30) developed clinical signs when inoculated by intratracheal route with 
0.5 mL of challenge virus diluted 1:10.
