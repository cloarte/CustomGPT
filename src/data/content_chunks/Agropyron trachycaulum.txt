This is a native bunchgrass, generally distributed throughout theUnited States, except in the southeastern and southcentral regions. It isprevalent in the Northern Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain States. It grows to 3 feet, in dense leafy clumps or bunches, a foot or more in diameter. The flowering stems are erect and rather coarse. Most of the leaves are basal. They are up to a foot long and 0.5 inch wide. This grass furnishes abundant pasture, and a nutritious hay if harvested early. The forage also matures well on the ground, so furnishes winter grazing. Stands may easily be overgrazed, and are not as persistent as the sod-forming wheatgrasses. Propagation is by seeds.
