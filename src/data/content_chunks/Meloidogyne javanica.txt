 Invasion: Description (after Orton Williams, 1972)FemaleEndoparasitic; body nearly spherical in adult with projecting neck tapering to head; posterior end rounded, or with slightly protruding perineal region. Head with one annule behind head cap, slightly wider than first body annule. Stylet slender, dorsally curved, knobs rounded. Excretory pore located about 3 stylet lengths posterior to head. Posterior cuticular pattern (= perineal pattern) round or oval to pear-shaped, dorsal arch varying from rounded, to moderate height, sometimes flattened dorsally. Striae smooth to wavy, tail tip often marked by an irregular whorl. Typically lateral fields well defined by a double incisure bordering a definite break in the striae clearly dividing pattern into dorsal and ventral sectors. Lateral fields may

 pattern (= perineal pattern) round or oval to pear-shaped, dorsal arch varying from rounded, to moderate height, sometimes flattened dorsally. Striae smooth to wavy, tail tip often marked by an irregular whorl. Typically lateral fields well defined by a double incisure bordering a definite break in the striae clearly dividing pattern into dorsal and ventral sectors. Lateral fields may be visible for some distance from tail but do not extend into the neck region, or may be poorly marked. Phasmids usually distinct.MaleHead not offset; outline in lateral view characteristic with first annule projecting antero-laterally, well separated by constriction from a wider basal annule which may be subdivided into two annules either completely or partially (giving the appearance of one annule on one side of the body and two on the other). In dorsal or ventral view head outline rounded, amphidial apertures distinct. Stylet knobs rounded, not prominent. Valves of oesophageal bulb large. Oesophageal gland overlaps intestine for some distance ventrally. Excretory pore distinct, duct visible for some way along body. Hemizonid 0-4 annules anterior to pore. One testis or two. Intersexes common, displaying female characters to varying degrees ranging from a slight swelling anterior to cloaca to possession of a well developed vulva. Lateral field usually with 4 incisures ending at terminus or just anterior. Bands between incisures plain or outer ones sometimes areolated to some degree. Torsion of the posterior region of the body occurs to some extent making true lateral views of the tail hard to obtain. Tail shape somewhat variable, digitate in lateral view, bluntly rounded in ventral. Terminus not clearly striated. Phasmids located in lateral field at cloacal level or slightly anterior. Spicules slightly curved, with ventral fl

Tail shape somewhat variable, digitate in lateral view, bluntly rounded in ventral. Terminus not clearly striated. Phasmids located in lateral field at cloacal level or slightly anterior. Spicules slightly curved, with ventral flange distally, tips pointed. Gubernaculum thin, crescentic.JuvenileHead not offset, in lateral view truncate cone shape with 3 annules behind head cap; more rounded in dorsal and ventral view with one annule behind head cap. Stylet knobs rounded, not prominent. Hemizonid usually three annules long immediately anterior to excretory pore. Lateral field with four incisures, outer bands not clearly cross-striated. Rectum inflated; tail tapering to sub-acute or finely rounded terminus, annules coarsening posteriorly.

 Reproduccion: In most essentials the life cycle of M. javanica is very similar to those of other species of Meloidogyne. Mature females in roots produce eggs into a gelatinous egg sac, which may or may not protrude from the root and which completely envelops the eggs and acts as a barrier to water loss. Reproduction is probably always parthenogenetic. Under stress conditions such as overcrowding, food shortage, high temperature, or unsuitable host plant, a high percentage of males and intersexes is produced ( Triantaphyllou, 1973 ). On hatching, infective second-stage juveniles move towards roots and accumulate at root tips, minor wounds or regions of previous penetration. Within a day of penetration of the host there is a rapid loss of mobility and infectivity. Growth of M. javanica larvae in tomatoes ( Bird, 1959 ) was slow at first, but after about 14 days (the time of the second moult), juveniles had thickened and possessed the spiked tail characteristic of Meloidogyne. The third and fourth moults followed rapidly within the moulted cuticle of the second-stage juvenile. Under Bird&apos;

. Growth of M. javanica larvae in tomatoes ( Bird, 1959 ) was slow at first, but after about 14 days (the time of the second moult), juveniles had thickened and possessed the spiked tail characteristic of Meloidogyne. The third and fourth moults followed rapidly within the moulted cuticle of the second-stage juvenile. Under Bird&apos;s optimum conditions, by the 19th day all specimens were in the final moult or were adults. Egg sac formation began between the 20th and 27th days, followed 2 days later by egg laying. Egg sac growth and rate of egg laying increased rapidly from the 30th to 40th day: the egg sac usually became bigger than the female which produced it. (See also Bird, 1971.) M. javanica and one or even two other Meloidogyne spp. may sometimes be found in the same host. In mixed inoculations of M. javanica and M. hapla on tomatoes, Kinloch and Allen (1971) found that M. javanica predominated. M. javanica has been shown to interact with other pathogens, causing a disease complex where symptoms are worse than those produced by either pathogen alone. It interacts with the wilt-causing fungus Fusarium oxysporum and its various forms on: cowpeas ( Thomason et al., 1959 ), tobacco ( Porter and Powell, 1967 ) and tomatoes ( Oteifa and Ragab, 1958 ). It also interacts with Thanatephorus cucumeris on soyabeans ( Taylor and Wyllie, 1959 ). See Bird (1971) for a review of work with special reference to M. javanica. See Taylor (1979) for work on interactions between Meloidogyne and diseases.

 Invasion: Description (after Orton Williams, 1972)FemaleEndoparasitic; body nearly spherical in adult with projecting neck tapering to head; posterior end rounded, or with slightly protruding perineal region. Head with one annule behind head cap, slightly wider than first body annule. Stylet slender, dorsally curved, knobs rounded. Excretory pore located about 3 stylet lengths posterior to head. Posterior cuticular pattern (= perineal pattern) round or oval to pear-shaped, dorsal arch varying from rounded, to moderate height, sometimes flattened dorsally. Striae smooth to wavy, tail tip often marked by an irregular whorl. Typically lateral fields well defined by a double incisure bordering a definite break in the striae clearly dividing pattern into dorsal and ventral sectors. Lateral fields may

 pattern (= perineal pattern) round or oval to pear-shaped, dorsal arch varying from rounded, to moderate height, sometimes flattened dorsally. Striae smooth to wavy, tail tip often marked by an irregular whorl. Typically lateral fields well defined by a double incisure bordering a definite break in the striae clearly dividing pattern into dorsal and ventral sectors. Lateral fields may be visible for some distance from tail but do not extend into the neck region, or may be poorly marked. Phasmids usually distinct.MaleHead not offset; outline in lateral view characteristic with first annule projecting antero-laterally, well separated by constriction from a wider basal annule which may be subdivided into two annules either completely or partially (giving the appearance of one annule on one side of the body and two on the other). In dorsal or ventral view head outline rounded, amphidial apertures distinct. Stylet knobs rounded, not prominent. Valves of oesophageal bulb large. Oesophageal gland overlaps intestine for some distance ventrally. Excretory pore distinct, duct visible for some way along body. Hemizonid 0-4 annules anterior to pore. One testis or two. Intersexes common, displaying female characters to varying degrees ranging from a slight swelling anterior to cloaca to possession of a well developed vulva. Lateral field usually with 4 incisures ending at terminus or just anterior. Bands between incisures plain or outer ones sometimes areolated to some degree. Torsion of the posterior region of the body occurs to some extent making true lateral views of the tail hard to obtain. Tail shape somewhat variable, digitate in lateral view, bluntly rounded in ventral. Terminus not clearly striated. Phasmids located in lateral field at cloacal level or slightly anterior. Spicules slightly curved, with ventral fl

Tail shape somewhat variable, digitate in lateral view, bluntly rounded in ventral. Terminus not clearly striated. Phasmids located in lateral field at cloacal level or slightly anterior. Spicules slightly curved, with ventral flange distally, tips pointed. Gubernaculum thin, crescentic.JuvenileHead not offset, in lateral view truncate cone shape with 3 annules behind head cap; more rounded in dorsal and ventral view with one annule behind head cap. Stylet knobs rounded, not prominent. Hemizonid usually three annules long immediately anterior to excretory pore. Lateral field with four incisures, outer bands not clearly cross-striated. Rectum inflated; tail tapering to sub-acute or finely rounded terminus, annules coarsening posteriorly.

 Reproduccion: In most essentials the life cycle of M. javanica is very similar to those of other species of Meloidogyne. Mature females in roots produce eggs into a gelatinous egg sac, which may or may not protrude from the root and which completely envelops the eggs and acts as a barrier to water loss. Reproduction is probably always parthenogenetic. Under stress conditions such as overcrowding, food shortage, high temperature, or unsuitable host plant, a high percentage of males and intersexes is produced ( Triantaphyllou, 1973 ). On hatching, infective second-stage juveniles move towards roots and accumulate at root tips, minor wounds or regions of previous penetration. Within a day of penetration of the host there is a rapid loss of mobility and infectivity. Growth of M. javanica larvae in tomatoes ( Bird, 1959 ) was slow at first, but after about 14 days (the time of the second moult), juveniles had thickened and possessed the spiked tail characteristic of Meloidogyne. The third and fourth moults followed rapidly within the moulted cuticle of the second-stage juvenile. Under Bird&apos;

. Growth of M. javanica larvae in tomatoes ( Bird, 1959 ) was slow at first, but after about 14 days (the time of the second moult), juveniles had thickened and possessed the spiked tail characteristic of Meloidogyne. The third and fourth moults followed rapidly within the moulted cuticle of the second-stage juvenile. Under Bird&apos;s optimum conditions, by the 19th day all specimens were in the final moult or were adults. Egg sac formation began between the 20th and 27th days, followed 2 days later by egg laying. Egg sac growth and rate of egg laying increased rapidly from the 30th to 40th day: the egg sac usually became bigger than the female which produced it. (See also Bird, 1971.) M. javanica and one or even two other Meloidogyne spp. may sometimes be found in the same host. In mixed inoculations of M. javanica and M. hapla on tomatoes, Kinloch and Allen (1971) found that M. javanica predominated. M. javanica has been shown to interact with other pathogens, causing a disease complex where symptoms are worse than those produced by either pathogen alone. It interacts with the wilt-causing fungus Fusarium oxysporum and its various forms on: cowpeas ( Thomason et al., 1959 ), tobacco ( Porter and Powell, 1967 ) and tomatoes ( Oteifa and Ragab, 1958 ). It also interacts with Thanatephorus cucumeris on soyabeans ( Taylor and Wyllie, 1959 ). See Bird (1971) for a review of work with special reference to M. javanica. See Taylor (1979) for work on interactions between Meloidogyne and diseases.
