EPPO Workshop on Azole fungicides and Septoria leaf blotch control Harpenden (GB), 2010-12-07/09 Introduction and Background Septoria leaf blotch ( Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici )) is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat in many EPPO countries. It has built up resistance to different triazoles and other DeMethylation-Inhibitors (DMIs) which have been widely used in cereals since the early 1980s. Despite intensive use for more than 30 years, azoles (triazoles and imidazoles) still provide broad effective control in many areas. However, a clear reduction in field efficacy has been seen in several cases and recent developments, particularly in the area of molecular techniques, have shown a significant complexity in the triazoles resistance mechanisms. The implication of these findings could have a major impact on future recommendations and due to the significance of the problem an EPPO Workshop on azole fungicides and Septoria leaf blotch control, was held on 2010-12-07/09 at Rothamsted Research (Harpenden, GB). The aim of the workshop was to bring together the latest scientific knowledge, agronomic practices and regulatory information to enable the development of best practice advice for management of Septoria resistance across the EPPO region. Because of the importance of triazoles in disease management, it provided a forum for obtaining a comprehensive overview of the triazoles resistance situation and for discussing the consequences for recommendations given by national authorities and the labelling of the products. There were 70 participants from 12 EPPO countries (including delegates from research institutions, universities, national regulatory bodies, agricultural advisory organizations) and 9 agrochemical companies. The Workshop was organized as a series of lectures with plenty of time for discussion. An overview of the workshop including all the workshop materials is presented below.
