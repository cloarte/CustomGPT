A fast growings nitrogen-fixing, heavy shade tree, recommended for
reforestation and firewood plantations.  Often planted as an avenue tree or as
shade for coffee and tea.  The wood is hard and strong, resembling walnut, and
non siliceous.  It produces a sawdust that may cause sneezing.  Specific
gravity 0.61; Air Dry Weight 39 lb/cu ft (ca 630 kg/cu m).  The heartwood
calorific value is 5,166 cals.  Strong and elastic, the wood is used for
cabinet wood, furniture and veneer, and serves well as firewood.  The burr wood
is prized for veneer.  Bark has served for tanning.  Foliage can be used as
fodder.  In the Sudan, goats eat fallen leaves and flowers.  Bark containing
saponin can be used in making soap, and containing tannin, can be used for
tanning; used e.g. in Madras to tan fishing nets.  It produces a gum which can
be sold deceitfully as gum arabic.  Host of the lac insect.

Folk Medicine
According to Hartwell (1967–1971), the tree is used in folk remedies for
abdominal tumors, in bolmes, enemas, ghees or powders.  Reported to be
astringent, pectoral, rejuvenant, and tonic, the siris tree is a folk remedy
for boils, cough, eye ailments, flu, and lung ailments.  The seed oil is used
for leprosy, the powdered seed to scrofulous swellings.  Indians use the
flowers for spermatorrhea.
Chemistry
According to Roskoski et al (1980), studying Mexican material, the seeds
contain 9.47% humidity, 3.57% ash, 33.60% crude protein, 3.13% crude fat,
13.17% crude fiber, 35.30% carbohydrates with a 78.25% in vitro digestibility.
The pods contain 6.99% humidity, 5.47% ash, 17.86% crude protein, 2.6% crude
fat, 45.08% crude fiber, and 22.00% carbohydrates with a 76.56% in vitro
digestibility.  The foliage contains 3.57% humidity, 7.06% ash, 28.87% crtide
protein, 5.42% crude fat, 31.75% crude fiber, 23.33% carbohydrates, and 83.55%

Seeds have yielded 5.3–6.8% fixed oil or fat, the endosperm 11%.  The
oil contains 9.6% stearic, 10.9% arachidic, 39.3% oleic, and 32.9% linoleic
acid (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962).  Bark contains 5–15% tannin (leaves

and albizziagenin.  Wood workers have reported upper respiratory problems
following involvement with this species (Mitchell and Rook, 1979).
Description
Deciduous tree to 30 m tall, with a dense shade-producing crown.  Bark
smoothish, light whitish or greenish gray.  Leaves alternate, twice compound,
with 2–4 pairs of pinnate pinnae, each with 4–10 pairs of leaflets, the
ultimate leaflets entire, arcuate, oblong.  Flowers white, with greenish
stamens, in clusters resembling a white powder puff.  Pods flat, reddish brown,
several seeds, often rattling in the breeze.  In Puerto Rico, flowers April to
September, fruiting year-round, the fruits more prominent probably in the dry
season.
Germplasm
Siris tree, or cvs thereof, is reported to tolerate alkalinity, some
drought, laterite, very light frost, saltspray, and sand (2
n
= 26).
Distribution
According to the NAS (1980) this is native to tropical Africa, Asia, and
northern Australia, widely planted and naturalized throughout the tropics.
Ecology
Ranging from Tropical Thorn to Tropical Wet through Subtropical Thorn to
Wet Forest Life Zones, siris tree is reported to tolerate annual precipitation
of 4.8 to 23.4 dm (mean of 17 cases = 14.

of 4.8 to 23.4 dm (mean of 17 cases = 14.6) and annual temperature of 23.3 to
26.6°C (mean of 12 cases = 25.5) (EBL computer printout).
Cultivation
Immerse seed in boiling water, cool; soak for 24 hours, sowing in loam
in wrapped pots 10 x 15 mm.  Move seedlings to partial shade, watering and
spraying as needed.  Harden off for 2–3 months.  Outplant at 3 x 3 or 4 x 4 m
when at least 30 cm tall, at beginning of rainy season (Fabian, 1981).
Harvesting
Trees coppice well.
Yields and Economics
Studying Mexican material, Roskoski et al (1980) concluded that there
were 8.60 (+/- 3.5) moles N
2
fixed per gram of nodule per hour, about 1/3 the
hourly rate of

.  Krishnamurti (1974), suggesting the tree as

moisture, 17% reducing sugar, and 38% total reducing sugar as glucose.  One
hundred grams fruit crushed and fermented whole with addition of water and a
pure culture of distillery yeast, gave a net yield of 20.5 cc of absolute
alcohol, 82% of the theoretical yield, corresponding to about 170 liters
alcohol per MT.  With fruit yields of 10 MT possible, that suggests a renewable
yield of 1,700 liters per hectare, or more than 10 barrels from the fruits
alone.
Biotic Factors
Left standing or as logs, the timber is subject to borer and fungal
attack (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  Sapwood is liable to borer and termite attack,
but is immune to dry rot (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962).  Browne (1968)
