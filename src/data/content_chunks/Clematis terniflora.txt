Overview
Appearance
Clematis terniflora
is a climbing, semi-evergreen, ornamental vine.
Foliage
The leaves are opposite, compound (with 3-5 leaflets), and the margins are entire. Leaflets are each 2-3 in. (5-7.6 cm) long.
Flowers
White, fragrant, four-petaled flowers appear in the late summer through the fall.
Fruit
Seeds are also showy and production is prolific. Seed heads have long, silvery-gray, feather-like hairs attached.
Ecological Threat
The native species (
C. virginiana
) is very similar (margins of leaves of the native tend to be toothed), but not as prone to self-seeding and spreading.
Clematis terniflora
prefers sun to partial shade and is found invading forest edges, rights of ways and urban green space especially near creeks. It is native to Japan and China and was introduced into the United States as an ornamental plant.
