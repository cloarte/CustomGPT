Plant health: How diagnostic networks and interagency 
partnerships protect plant systems from pests and pathogens
by Richard M. Bostock, Carla S. Thomas, Richard W. Hoenisch, Deborah A. Golino and Georgios Vidalakis
Early detection and rapid response are crucial in any effort to reduce the risk of new and 
emerging biological threats to crops and other plant resources. This underscores the 
importance of having the necessary diagnostic expertise, infrastructure and resources 
in place. Three programs — the National Plant Diagnostic Network, the National Clean 
Plant Network and the Citrus Clonal Protection Program — illustrate how accurate 
and rapid diagnosis plays a critical role in providing healthy plants for growers and in 
securing production systems for food and fiber. These three programs depend on state-
wide, regional and national networking among university, state and federal scientists, 
regulatory officials and industry members to help mitigate the impacts of plant pests 
and diseases.
P
lant pathogens and pests present 
continual challenges to the produc -
tion and security of food, fiber and 
forest resources. Introduced biological 
agents threaten crops and forests locally 
and regionally with their direct damage 
to host plants, and their presence has 
national and international consequences 
for trade and regulatory policy. Contami-
nated seed and nursery plants provide 
efficient introduction pathways for pests, 
highlighting the critical importance of 
clean seed and nursery programs for 
protection of both domestic and export 
markets. Introduced biological agents, 
whether they arrive via natural dispersal 
mechanisms or through human activ -
ity, may remain present but below our 
threshold for detection and perception for 
years

efficient introduction pathways for pests, 
highlighting the critical importance of 
clean seed and nursery programs for 
protection of both domestic and export 
markets. Introduced biological agents, 
whether they arrive via natural dispersal 
mechanisms or through human activ -
ity, may remain present but below our 
threshold for detection and perception for 
years, only to emerge later with seeming 
suddenness and dramatic destructive in-
tensity (Crooks 2005). 
 As is the case in human and animal 
medicine, early detection, accurate di-
agnosis and rapid response are critical 
for achievement of successful outcomes 
when dealing with outbreaks of endemic 
and newly introduced plant diseases and 
insect or weed pests. The United States 
has a long history of pathogen and pest 
introductions for which containment and 
eradication have been unsuccessful, often 
with devastating consequences to agri-
culture and natural ecosystems (Pimentel 
et al. 2005; Rossman 2009). In California, 
the past two decades have seen the emer-
gence of a number of high-consequence 
plant pests, including the sudden oak 
death pathogen, the Pierce’s disease 
pathogen (carried by the glassy-winged 
sharpshooter) and more recently the 
Asian citrus psyllid, vector of the citrus 
greening disease (huanglongbing), and 
the European grapevine moth. California 
is the leading U.S. state for agricultural 
products, with gross cash receipts in 2011 
in excess of $43 billion (CDFA 2013) for 
more than 400 commodities, including 
numerous specialty crops. In fact, seven

the European grapevine moth. California 
is the leading U.S. state for agricultural 
products, with gross cash receipts in 2011 
in excess of $43 billion (CDFA 2013) for 
more than 400 commodities, including 
numerous specialty crops. In fact, seven 
of the top 10 commodities in terms of cash 
value in California are specialty crops. 
All of this presents great opportunities, as 
well as risks and challenges, for diagnos -
tic, pest management and clean stock and 
seed programs. 
During the past decade, awareness and 
concern have increased in regard to the 
threat of economic harm to U.S. crop ag-
riculture, nurseries and forests posed by 
introduced biological agents, and society 
has responded with greater investments 
in biosecurity programs to enhance sur -
veillance and detection. Understandably, 
exotic and high-consequence agents re-
ceive the greatest focus in such programs, 
but it is important to note that sufficient 
diagnostic infrastructure and expertise 
must be continually maintained so we can 
accurately identify both routine and un-
usual conditions.

Even with recent investments in plant 
biosecurity programs, the immensity 
of the task exceeds the resources cur -
rently available to adequately address it. 
For example, the most significant path-
way for introduction of unwanted plant 
pathogens and pests is through live plant 
imports, which have increased, on aver-
age, by 51 million plants per year for the 
past 43 years (Liebhold et al. 2012; Palm 
and Rossman 2003). In 2010, more than 
2.8 billion plants intended for planting 
within the United States passed through 
federal plant inspection stations at U.S. 
ports of entry. This sheer volume of plants 
by itself reduces the likelihood that all of 
the potentially invasive pests and patho -
gens will be intercepted, and that in turn 
makes downstream programs for detec -
tion, diagnosis and containment all the 
more important.
The National Plant Diagnostic Network
The National Plant Diagnostic 
Network (NPDN) was established in 2002 
to provide greater support for and inte-
gration of plant diagnostic laboratories 
in the United States and help thwart the 
establishment and dispersal of introduced 
insect and weed pests and pathogens 
(npdn.org/). The NPDN works with 
state and federal agencies to ensure the

of information and expertise about new

ration of plant diagnostic laboratories 
in the United States and help thwart the 
establishment and dispersal of introduced 
insect and weed pests and pathogens 
(npdn.org/). The NPDN works with 
state and federal agencies to ensure the 
quick, accurate and secure conveyance 
of information and expertise about new 
detections in order to minimize their eco-
nomic and ecological impacts (Stack et al. 
2006; Stack et al. 2014). 
Federal funding for the establishment 
of the NPDN and a parallel program for 
animal agriculture, the National Animal 
Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), 
was largely a response to biosecurity 
risks to plant and animal agriculture in 
the United States. Also compelling for 
decision-makers at the time was a grow-
ing awareness that many publicly funded 
plant diagnostic labs associated with 
land-grant universities (LGUs) and state 
departments of agriculture were in fact 
underfunded and were, in some cases, 
at risk of closure as a result. In addition, 
it appeared that a lack of coordination 
among diagnosticians and experts at 
university, state and federal laboratories 
could create bottlenecks in the processing 
of critical samples and delays in commu-
nication of diagnostic results. 
The NPDN is supported in part 
by the USDA’s Food and Agriculture 
Defense Initiative (FADI), a program 
within the National Institute of Food 
and Agriculture (NIFA). To further its 
core missions of diagnostics, training 
and education, and communication, the

and Agriculture (NIFA). To further its 
core missions of diagnostics, training 
and education, and communication, the 
NPDN provides resources for diagnostic 
laboratory infrastructure and supplies, 
delivers advanced training for diagnosti -
cians and educational programs for “first

among plant diagnosticians at LGUs, state 
departments of agriculture and national 
expert laboratories, and seeks to provide 
accurate and timely information to state 
and federal authorities to guide an ap-
propriate response. For greater efficiency 
in program delivery, the NPDN is divided 
into five geographic regions, each with a 
regional center located in the plant pathol-
ogy department of an LGU (fig. 1), where 
its directors help identify and coordinate 
local and regional scientific expertise in 
plant pathology, entomology and weed/
plant science as needed. The NPDN does 
not have any formal regulatory authority 
of its own; rather, the network’s principal 
role is to provide a framework that facili-
tates access to additional expertise in the 
event of a plant health emergency. 
Given the agricultural diversity of 
the United States, the regionally dis -
tributed structure of the NPDN enables 
each region to tailor the resources and 
programs it provides to best meet the 
needs of that particular region. For ex -

The scope and size of agricultural, 
nursery and forest production systems, 
as well as infrastructure and expertise in 
support of plant health programs, vary 
considerably throughout the WPDN, with 
three subregional expert laboratories that 
work together with the various triage 
laboratories in individual states and ter-
ritories. The three expert laboratories — 
the CDFA laboratory in Sacramento and 
diagnostic laboratories at Oregon State 
University (Corvallis) and the University 
of Hawaii (Manoa), working in partner-
ship with the Hawaii Department of 
Agriculture — can handle most or all 
types of samples and conduct collabora-
tive diagnostics with other member labo -
ratories in the region or the nation. The 
CDFA laboratory is the largest and most 
comprehensive state plant diagnostic 
laboratory in the United States, with more 
than 70 scientists and support staff spe -
cializing in pests, diseases, weeds, nema -
todes and seed certification. It receives 
little funding from the NPDN, relative to 
the scope and size of the laboratory’s ac-
tivities, drawing its primary support from 
state funds and other grants.

from NPDN member laboratories in

writing (September 2014), the repository 
houses more than 930,000 diagnostic 
sample records in a database that is up -
dated daily; it receives about 100,000 new 
records each year from as many as 150 
laboratories throughout the nation. Such a 
comprehensive national database of diag-
nostic records is unprecedented in plant 
agriculture. It is available for search and 
analysis by authorized scientists, regula-
tory officials and diagnosticians who use 
it to rapidly identify novel detections and 
discern patterns of new outbreaks at vari -

mitting samples to diagnostic labs (fig. 
2). In California, a first detector may be 
a grower, crop consultant, pest control 
adviser, UC researcher, UC Cooperative 
Extension (UCCE) farm advisor, biolo-
gist within a county agriculture com -
missioner’s office, UC-trained master 
gardener, employee of a city or county 
parks department or homeowner — re-
ally, any person who has been trained to 
recognize potential threats to plant health 
and understands the importance of plant 
biosecurity, and who knows how 
to collect and submit a sample 
securely. 
Typically, the first detector re-
trieves a suspect sample from the 
field, packages it properly and de-
livers or mails it to the county ag-
ricultural commissioner or 
UCCE county office. There, 
it is identified or sent to 
the CDFA laboratory in 
Sacramento for further 
analysis and diagnosis by 
a specialist. Some samples 
that require specialized 
diagnostics are often sent directly to UC 
laboratories that have the appropriate 
expertise. If the pest or pathogen is sus-
pected to be new to California or to the 
county where it was found, a confirma-
tory diagnosis must be made by CDFA 
scientists, and may require further sam-
pling. When a pest or pathogen is sus-
pected to be new to the United States or 
to North America, samples are sent to the

and communication among the nation’s 
diagnostic laboratories. For example, in 
the event of a regional or national plant 
health emergency, instead of overwhelm-
ing one laboratory with samples, the 
distributed network structure provides 
a more flexible surge capacity, eliminat-
ing bottlenecks that could hamper the 
diagnostic and reporting process (see 
sidebar, page 121). In addition, through 
its regional networks and in partnership 
with USDA APHIS, the NPDN has made 
significant investments in laboratory 
infrastructure, equipment, supplies and 
distance diagnosis capabilities, and it 
has provided partial salary support and 
advanced training for scientific and tech-
nical staff. 
Another important accomplishment 
of the NPDN is the development and 
delivery of training and education pro-
grams for first detectors and diagnosti -
cians. The NPDN’s national registry now 
includes more than 16,000 first detectors 
who can be alerted quickly to new out-
breaks and who receive regular updates 
via national and regional e-newsletters 
with useful information about new pests 
and pathogens of regulatory concern. 
In California, currently boasting more 
than 2,500 registered first detectors, 
the WPDN training coordinator and 
UCCE specialists and farm advisors and 
other UC Division of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources (ANR) personnel

The National Clean Plant Network
Healthy planting stock is key to the 
cost-effective production of horticultural 
crops such as fruit trees, nut trees and 
grapevines. Healthy stock is easier to 
propagate, requires fewer chemical inputs 
and produces higher crop yields and 
better crop quality. The U.S. agricultural 
sector needs healthy planting stock to 
keep it internationally competitive and 
economically viable. The most efficient 
approach to producing healthy planting 
stock is through programs that screen 
valuable plant selections for viruses and 
other diseases that have the potential to 
be spread through contaminated plant 
stock. Quarantine services provided by 
clean stock programs reduce the chances 
of introduction of exotic pests that, once 
introduced, can be difficult and costly 
to control. 
The original impetus for the organiza -
tion of networks with a focus on clean 
stock came from the U.S. grape and fruit 
tree industries, which in 2005 began to 
explore the formation of a national group 
devoted to foundation materials that have 
been tested, treated and maintained as 
a healthy source of plant materials for 
growers to use. In 2008, these grape and 
fruit tree networks were developed by

been tested, treated and maintained as 
a healthy source of plant materials for 
growers to use. In 2008, these grape and 
fruit tree networks were developed by 
stakeholders, industry members, scien -
tists and other interested parties. The new 
National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) 
was included in the 2008 and 2014 Farm 
Bills, with funding of $5 million per year 
to provide reliable sources of propagative 
material that are free of graft-transmitted 
pathogens. Congress stipulated that fund-
ing go exclusively to existing clean plant 
centers that were already supported by 
their home institutions. 
The NCPN is a voluntary associa-
tion made up of specialty crop networks 
that promote the use of pathogen-tested, 
healthy plant material for U.S. growers 
of grapes, fruit trees, hops, berries and 
citrus. Its formal mission is to “provide 
high quality asexually propagated plant 
material free of targeted plant pathogens 
and pests that cause economic loss to

the Citrus Variety Improvement Program.

 In 2004, P. ramorum was unexpectedly detected in several Southern Califor-
nia production and wholesale nurseries that had already shipped 2.3 million potentially 
infected plants to retail nurseries and other wholesale nurseries in 49 states and the 
District of Columbia. This triggered a national regulatory response to determine where 
plants had been shipped and then, once found, to test the plants for P. ramorum. 
Over the next year, federal and NPDN labs processed more than 100,000 samples. 
Because of the NPDN laboratories’ advanced coordination and training, they were able 
to rapidly implement the standardized APHIS diagnostic protocol with little advance 
notice. One critical element of this protocol is a molecular diagnostic based on the PCR 
assay, which at the time was newly developed by APHIS and UC scientists. In addition, 
the NPDN provided support for the purchase of PCR machines and supplies and re-
agents that enabled many network labs to participate. In total, 171 nurseries in 20 states 
tested positive for P. ramorum, triggering implementation of containment and eradica-
tion measures at those sites. 
Prior to establishment of the network, it could take 6 weeks or more for samples to 
go through the system, and nursery plants were quarantined until diagnosis could be 
completed. With the NPDN labs and the new diagnostic assay, turnaround times from 
field collection to diagnosis were reduced to as few as 4 days, enabling many nurseries 
around the country to quickly resume operations once they had been cleared as free 
from P. ramorum.  c

objectives include avoiding or restricting 
the spread of bud- and graft-transmitted 
pathogens of citrus in support of a profit-
able, competitive and sustainable citrus 
industry. As such, the CCPP provides a 
safe mechanism for the introduction of 
citrus varieties into California from any 
area around the world. The process for 
varietal introduction includes disease 
diagnosis and pathogen elimination fol -
lowed by maintenance, pathogen retest-
ing and distribution of true-to-type citrus 
propagative material (fig. 4). 
The CCPP program of importation, 
production and distribution of pathogen-
tested propagative materials is based 
on a comprehensive indexing (testing) 
program to detect graft-transmissible 
diseases and pathogens that may arrive 
in imported budlines. Graft-transmissible 
diseases may be caused by viruses, vi-
roids or other pathogens (e.g., bacteria, 
phytoplasmas) and are vegetatively trans-
mitted with an infected budline. Graft-
transmissible diseases can seriously harm 
fruit quality, production and tree health 
and longevity. In addition, diseases from 
infected field propagation may spread to 
neighboring orchards via insects or con-
taminated farm equipment (Timmer

phytoplasmas) and are vegetatively trans-
mitted with an infected budline. Graft-
transmissible diseases can seriously harm 
fruit quality, production and tree health 
and longevity. In addition, diseases from 
infected field propagation may spread to 
neighboring orchards via insects or con-
taminated farm equipment (Timmer et al. 
2000; Wallace 1978). 
Disease diagnosis and pathogen detec -
tion take place in the insect-proof green-
house and the Delfino Plant Laboratory at 
the Rubidoux Quarantine Facility as well 
as in the Citrus Diagnostic Laboratory at 
UC Riverside. Detection of graft-transmis-
sible citrus diseases is based on a com -
prehensive indexing scheme that involves 
biological and laboratory diagnostics. 
For biological indexing, technicians graft 
tissue from the imported budline onto 
citrus indicator plants, with a specific 
citrus indicator for each specific disease. 
Indicator varieties have been selected for 
their sensitivity to diseases and their abil-
ity to express symptoms. For each index, 
technicians maintain adequate positive 
control plants under the same environ-
mental conditions as the test indicators. 
The controls serve dual purposes: They 
provide a comparison for the test plant 
and also demonstrate that environmental 
conditions in the greenhouse are optimal 
for plant growth and symptom expression 
(Childs 1978; Roistacher 1991; Vidalakis et 
al. 2004).

Citrus propagative material (i.e., bud-
wood) distributed to homeowners, hobby-
ists, citrus growers and nurseries draws 
from tree sources of the CCPP foundation 
block. All CCPP- and nursery-owned 
citrus budwood tree sources must be 
established and propagated from citrus 
material that has been through the CCPP 
introductory, therapy and diagnostic pro-
tocols, regularly and routinely tested for 
several citrus pathogens, and registered 
as a budwood source with the CDFA. In 
May 2010, CDFA filed regulations for a 
mandatory Citrus Nursery Stock Pest 
Cleanliness Program as an emergency ac-
tion. Under this new mandatory program, 
more than 8,000 registered budwood 
source trees were tested for several citrus 
pathogens in the first 2 years. The CCPP 
and UC Riverside researchers have been 
instrumental in the development of a

high-throughput nucleic acid extraction

for citrus budwood tissues as well as 
molecular diagnostic methods for detec -

have enabled the successful implemen-
tation of the new § 3701 CDFA Citrus 
Nursery Stock Pest Cleanliness Program 
(Vidalakis and Wang 2013; CDFA permits

Since 2009, CCPP has supplied 154,000 
buds from 301 different citrus varieties. 
A citrus nursery can produce as many as 
300 trees within a year to 18 months from 
each CCPP bud. That means that an esti-
mated 231 million citrus trees have been 
produced from pathogen-tested CCPP 
material in the past 5 years alone. If a sin-
gle pathogen had been present in any of 
the buds used for this tree propagation, it 
would have been transmitted to millions 
of trees, with unknown horticultural, pro -
duction and economic effects.

would have been transmitted to millions

duction and economic effects. 
Diseases can sometimes become so 
important in citrus production that it may 
be necessary, for example, to change from 
a long-used rootstock to one that is more 
tolerant or resistant to a disease agent. 
Such was the case when citrus tristeza 
disease became a limiting factor for citrus 
production in California. Millions of trees 
growing on sour orange rootstock, which 
was susceptible to tristeza quick decline, 
had to be replaced with trees grown on 
tristeza-tolerant rootstocks of trifoliate 
and trifoliate hybrids. The availability 
of pathogen-tested tristeza-tolerant root-
stocks and scions (e.g., mandarins) from 
the CCPP was critical to the industry’s 
transition and subsequent economic suc -
cess (Barnier et al. 2010; Calavan et al. 
1978). The availability of a wide selection 
of citrus species, varieties and selections 
for evaluation and experimental use is 
essential to our ability to address new 
and emerging problems such as citrus 
greening. 
Another important factor for the health 
and sustainability of the commercial 
citrus industry is maintenance of our 
capacity to import new varieties having 
different or improved fruit qualities or 
different maturity dates and organoleptic 
characters to satisfy ever-changing con-
sumer demands. A capacity to import and

sumer demands. A capacity to import and 
maintain new pathogen-free citrus germ-

the industry at a minimum and enabling 
research to move forward. The only way 
we can meet these goals is through a 
program like the CCPP that works col-
laboratively with state and federal regula-
tors, the citrus industry and UC to release 
pathogen-tested citrus varieties.
Partnerships for plant health
The three programs described here 
demonstrate how investments in diagnos -
tics, germplasm screening and develop -
ment, and related training and education 
are helping to safeguard agriculture and 
plant resources at statewide, regional and 
national levels. These programs provide 
the agricultural industry with healthy 
planting stock as well as highly coor -
dinated systems to deal efficiently with 
disease and pest outbreaks. Their success 
is due to the commitment of resources by 
the USDA, state agencies, industry and 
LGUs. 
Especially critical to the success of 
these programs in California are the con-
tributions of ANR and CDFA scientists 
and support staff. Yet recent limitations in 
state and federal funding for agricultural 
science have put the continuation of these 
programs in serious jeopardy. Reduced 
funding will weaken interagency col-
laboration and sharing of expertise, limit 
training and education programs, reduce 
the speed with which samples can be 
processed and put our general prepared-
ness to address plant health emergencies 
at risk. Increases

Plant health: How diagnostic networks and interagency 
partnerships protect plant systems from pests and pathogens
by Richard M. Bostock, Carla S. Thomas, Richard W. Hoenisch, Deborah A. Golino and Georgios Vidalakis
Early detection and rapid response are crucial in any effort to reduce the risk of new and 
emerging biological threats to crops and other plant resources. This underscores the 
importance of having the necessary diagnostic expertise, infrastructure and resources 
in place. Three programs — the National Plant Diagnostic Network, the National Clean 
Plant Network and the Citrus Clonal Protection Program — illustrate how accurate 
and rapid diagnosis plays a critical role in providing healthy plants for growers and in 
securing production systems for food and fiber. These three programs depend on state-
wide, regional and national networking among university, state and federal scientists, 
regulatory officials and industry members to help mitigate the impacts of plant pests 
and diseases.
P
lant pathogens and pests present 
continual challenges to the produc -
tion and security of food, fiber and 
forest resources. Introduced biological 
agents threaten crops and forests locally 
and regionally with their direct damage 
to host plants, and their presence has 
national and international consequences 
for trade and regulatory policy. Contami-
nated seed and nursery plants provide 
efficient introduction pathways for pests, 
highlighting the critical importance of 
clean seed and nursery programs for 
protection of both domestic and export 
markets. Introduced biological agents, 
whether they arrive via natural dispersal 
mechanisms or through human activ -
ity, may remain present but below our 
threshold for detection and perception for 
years

efficient introduction pathways for pests, 
highlighting the critical importance of 
clean seed and nursery programs for 
protection of both domestic and export 
markets. Introduced biological agents, 
whether they arrive via natural dispersal 
mechanisms or through human activ -
ity, may remain present but below our 
threshold for detection and perception for 
years, only to emerge later with seeming 
suddenness and dramatic destructive in-
tensity (Crooks 2005). 
 As is the case in human and animal 
medicine, early detection, accurate di-
agnosis and rapid response are critical 
for achievement of successful outcomes 
when dealing with outbreaks of endemic 
and newly introduced plant diseases and 
insect or weed pests. The United States 
has a long history of pathogen and pest 
introductions for which containment and 
eradication have been unsuccessful, often 
with devastating consequences to agri-
culture and natural ecosystems (Pimentel 
et al. 2005; Rossman 2009). In California, 
the past two decades have seen the emer-
gence of a number of high-consequence 
plant pests, including the sudden oak 
death pathogen, the Pierce’s disease 
pathogen (carried by the glassy-winged 
sharpshooter) and more recently the 
Asian citrus psyllid, vector of the citrus 
greening disease (huanglongbing), and 
the European grapevine moth. California 
is the leading U.S. state for agricultural 
products, with gross cash receipts in 2011 
in excess of $43 billion (CDFA 2013) for 
more than 400 commodities, including 
numerous specialty crops. In fact, seven

the European grapevine moth. California 
is the leading U.S. state for agricultural 
products, with gross cash receipts in 2011 
in excess of $43 billion (CDFA 2013) for 
more than 400 commodities, including 
numerous specialty crops. In fact, seven 
of the top 10 commodities in terms of cash 
value in California are specialty crops. 
All of this presents great opportunities, as 
well as risks and challenges, for diagnos -
tic, pest management and clean stock and 
seed programs. 
During the past decade, awareness and 
concern have increased in regard to the 
threat of economic harm to U.S. crop ag-
riculture, nurseries and forests posed by 
introduced biological agents, and society 
has responded with greater investments 
in biosecurity programs to enhance sur -
veillance and detection. Understandably, 
exotic and high-consequence agents re-
ceive the greatest focus in such programs, 
but it is important to note that sufficient 
diagnostic infrastructure and expertise 
must be continually maintained so we can 
accurately identify both routine and un-
usual conditions.

118 CALIFORNIA  AGRICULTURE • VOLUME 68, NUMBER 4
Even with recent investments in plant 
biosecurity programs, the immensity 
of the task exceeds the resources cur -
rently available to adequately address it. 
For example, the most significant path-
way for introduction of unwanted plant 
pathogens and pests is through live plant 
imports, which have increased, on aver-
age, by 51 million plants per year for the 
past 43 years (Liebhold et al. 2012; Palm 
and Rossman 2003). In 2010, more than 
2.8 billion plants intended for planting 
within the United States passed through 
federal plant inspection stations at U.S. 
ports of entry. This sheer volume of plants 
by itself reduces the likelihood that all of 
the potentially invasive pests and patho -
gens will be intercepted, and that in turn 
makes downstream programs for detec -
tion, diagnosis and containment all the 
more important.
The National Plant Diagnostic Network
The National Plant Diagnostic 
Network (NPDN) was established in 2002 
to provide greater support for and inte-
gration of plant diagnostic laboratories 
in the United States and help thwart the 
establishment and dispersal of introduced 
insect and weed pests and pathogens 
(npdn.org/). The NPDN works with 
state and federal agencies to ensure the 
quick, accurate and secure conveyance 
of information and expertise about new

ration of plant diagnostic laboratories 
in the United States and help thwart the 
establishment and dispersal of introduced 
insect and weed pests and pathogens 
(npdn.org/). The NPDN works with 
state and federal agencies to ensure the 
quick, accurate and secure conveyance 
of information and expertise about new 
detections in order to minimize their eco-
nomic and ecological impacts (Stack et al. 
2006; Stack et al. 2014). 
Federal funding for the establishment 
of the NPDN and a parallel program for 
animal agriculture, the National Animal 
Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), 
was largely a response to biosecurity 
risks to plant and animal agriculture in 
the United States. Also compelling for 
decision-makers at the time was a grow-
ing awareness that many publicly funded 
plant diagnostic labs associated with 
land-grant universities (LGUs) and state 
departments of agriculture were in fact 
underfunded and were, in some cases, 
at risk of closure as a result. In addition, 
it appeared that a lack of coordination 
among diagnosticians and experts at 
university, state and federal laboratories 
could create bottlenecks in the processing 
of critical samples and delays in commu-
nication of diagnostic results. 
The NPDN is supported in part 
by the USDA’s Food and Agriculture 
Defense Initiative (FADI), a program 
within the National Institute of Food 
and Agriculture (NIFA). To further its

and education, and communication, the

s Food and Agriculture 
Defense Initiative (FADI), a program 
within the National Institute of Food 
and Agriculture (NIFA). To further its 
core missions of diagnostics, training 
and education, and communication, the 
NPDN provides resources for diagnostic 
laboratory infrastructure and supplies, 
delivers advanced training for diagnosti -
cians and educational programs for “first 
detectors,” facilitates communication 
among plant diagnosticians at LGUs, state 
departments of agriculture and national 
expert laboratories, and seeks to provide 
accurate and timely information to state 
and federal authorities to guide an ap-
propriate response. For greater efficiency 
in program delivery, the NPDN is divided 
into five geographic regions, each with a 
regional center located in the plant pathol-
ogy department of an LGU (fig. 1), where 
its directors help identify and coordinate 
local and regional scientific expertise in 
plant pathology, entomology and weed/
plant science as needed. The NPDN does 
not have any formal regulatory authority 
of its own; rather, the network’s principal 
role is to provide a framework that facili-
tates access to additional expertise in the 
event of a plant health emergency. 
Given the agricultural diversity of 
the United States, the regionally dis -
tributed structure of the NPDN enables 
each region to tailor the resources and 
programs it provides to best meet the 
needs of that particular region. For ex -

which is the formal diagnostic report -
ing authority for California (cdfa.ca.gov/
plant/PPD/). 
The scope and size of agricultural, 
nursery and forest production systems, 
as well as infrastructure and expertise in 
support of plant health programs, vary 
considerably throughout the WPDN, with 
three subregional expert laboratories that 
work together with the various triage 
laboratories in individual states and ter-
ritories. The three expert laboratories — 
the CDFA laboratory in Sacramento and 
diagnostic laboratories at Oregon State 
University (Corvallis) and the University 
of Hawaii (Manoa), working in partner-
ship with the Hawaii Department of 
Agriculture — can handle most or all 
types of samples and conduct collabora-
tive diagnostics with other member labo -
ratories in the region or the nation. The 
CDFA laboratory is the largest and most 
comprehensive state plant diagnostic 
laboratory in the United States, with more 
than 70 scientists and support staff spe -
cializing in pests, diseases, weeds, nema -
todes and seed certification. It receives 
little funding from the NPDN, relative to 
the scope and size of the laboratory’s ac-
tivities, drawing its primary support from 
state funds and other grants. 
Similar to the WPDN, the other four 
regional networks in the NPDN are con-
sortia of LGUs and state departments of

Similar to the WPDN, the other four 
regional networks in the NPDN are con-
sortia of LGUs and state departments of 
agriculture working together to support 
mission-related activities and provide 
diagnostic services. Diagnostic results 
from NPDN member laboratories in 
all 50 states and three U.S. territories 
are submitted to the NPDN National 
Repository at Purdue University’s Center 
for Environmental and Regulatory 
Information Systems (CERIS; ceris.
purdue.edu/npdn/). At the time of this 
writing (September 2014), the repository 
houses more than 930,000 diagnostic 
sample records in a database that is up -
dated daily; it receives about 100,000 new 
records each year from as many as 150 
laboratories throughout the nation. Such a 
comprehensive national database of diag-
nostic records is unprecedented in plant 
agriculture. It is available for search and 
analysis by authorized scientists, regula-
tory officials and diagnosticians who use 
it to rapidly identify novel detections and 
discern patterns of new outbreaks at vari -
ous scales of resolution and in relation 
to GIS-based platforms for weather and 
land use.

the education of first detectors in the 
proper procedure to follow when sub-

proper procedure to follow when sub-
mitting samples to diagnostic labs (fig. 
2). In California, a first detector may be 
a grower, crop consultant, pest control 
adviser, UC researcher, UC Cooperative 
Extension (UCCE) farm advisor, biolo-
gist within a county agriculture com -
missioner’s office, UC-trained master 
gardener, employee of a city or county 
parks department or homeowner — re-
ally, any person who has been trained to 
recognize potential threats to plant health 
and understands the importance of plant 
biosecurity, and who knows how 
to collect and submit a sample 
securely. 
Typically, the first detector re-
trieves a suspect sample from the 
field, packages it properly and de-
livers or mails it to the county ag-
ricultural commissioner or 
UCCE county office. There, 
it is identified or sent to 
the CDFA laboratory in 
Sacramento for further 
analysis and diagnosis by 
a specialist. Some samples 
that require specialized 
diagnostics are often sent directly to UC 
laboratories that have the appropriate 
expertise. If the pest or pathogen is sus-
pected to be new to California or to the 
county where it was found, a confirma-
tory diagnosis must be made by CDFA 
scientists, and may require further sam-
pling. When a pest or pathogen is sus-
pected to be new to the United States or 
to North America, samples are sent to the 
USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) National Identification

consulted for a confirmatory diagnosis. 
How the NPDN has made a difference. 
Perhaps the most important contribu-
tion of the NPDN has been to foster an 
unprecedented level of coordination

and communication among the nation’s 
diagnostic laboratories. For example, in 
the event of a regional or national plant 
health emergency, instead of overwhelm-
ing one laboratory with samples, the 
distributed network structure provides 
a more flexible surge capacity, eliminat-
ing bottlenecks that could hamper the 
diagnostic and reporting process (see 
sidebar, page 121). In addition, through 
its regional networks and in partnership 
with USDA APHIS, the NPDN has made 
significant investments in laboratory 
infrastructure, equipment, supplies and 
distance diagnosis capabilities, and it 
has provided partial salary support and 
advanced training for scientific and tech-
nical staff. 
Another important accomplishment 
of the NPDN is the development and 
delivery of training and education pro-
grams for first detectors and diagnosti -
cians. The NPDN’s national registry now 
includes more than 16,000 first detectors 
who can be alerted quickly to new out-
breaks and who receive regular updates 
via national and regional e-newsletters 
with useful information about new pests 
and pathogens of regulatory concern. 
In California, currently boasting more 
than 2,500 registered first detectors, 
the WPDN training coordinator and 
UCCE specialists and farm advisors and

The National Clean Plant Network
Healthy planting stock is key to the 
cost-effective production of horticultural 
crops such as fruit trees, nut trees and 
grapevines. Healthy stock is easier to 
propagate, requires fewer chemical inputs 
and produces higher crop yields and 
better crop quality. The U.S. agricultural 
sector needs healthy planting stock to 
keep it internationally competitive and 
economically viable. The most efficient 
approach to producing healthy planting 
stock is through programs that screen 
valuable plant selections for viruses and 
other diseases that have the potential to 
be spread through contaminated plant 
stock. Quarantine services provided by 
clean stock programs reduce the chances 
of introduction of exotic pests that, once 
introduced, can be difficult and costly 
to control. 
The original impetus for the organiza -
tion of networks with a focus on clean 
stock came from the U.S. grape and fruit 
tree industries, which in 2005 began to 
explore the formation of a national group 
devoted to foundation materials that have 
been tested, treated and maintained as 
a healthy source of plant materials for 
growers to use. In 2008, these grape and 
fruit tree networks were developed by

tree industries, which in 2005 began to 
explore the formation of a national group 
devoted to foundation materials that have 
been tested, treated and maintained as 
a healthy source of plant materials for 
growers to use. In 2008, these grape and 
fruit tree networks were developed by 
stakeholders, industry members, scien -
tists and other interested parties. The new 
National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) 
was included in the 2008 and 2014 Farm 
Bills, with funding of $5 million per year 
to provide reliable sources of propagative 
material that are free of graft-transmitted 
pathogens. Congress stipulated that fund-
ing go exclusively to existing clean plant 
centers that were already supported by 
their home institutions. 
The NCPN is a voluntary associa-
tion made up of specialty crop networks 
that promote the use of pathogen-tested, 
healthy plant material for U.S. growers 
of grapes, fruit trees, hops, berries and 
citrus. Its formal mission is to “provide 
high quality asexually propagated plant 
material free of targeted plant pathogens 
and pests that cause economic loss to

The CCPP has its roots in the 1930s, 
when Professor Howard Fawcett of 
the UC Citrus Experiment Station in 
Riverside discovered the viral nature 
of the graft-transmissible disease citrus 
psorosis — the discovery that triggered 
the establishment of the Psorosis Free 
Program. Following a request from the 
citrus industry, UC established what is 
now the CCPP in 1956, initially calling it 
the Citrus Variety Improvement Program. 
Today the CCPP stands as a cooperative 
program of UC Riverside’s Department of 
Plant Pathology and Microbiology, CDFA, 
USDA APHIS and the NCPN, as well as 
the state’s citrus industry as represented

T

mental in providing support for several investigations of Phytophthora ramorum, the 
cause of sudden oak death in coastal forests and ramorum blight of ornamentals (Rizzo 
et al. 2005). In 2004, P. ramorum was unexpectedly detected in several Southern Califor-
nia production and wholesale nurseries that had already shipped 2.3 million potentially 
infected plants to retail nurseries and other wholesale nurseries in 49 states and the

 In 2004, P. ramorum was unexpectedly detected in several Southern Califor-
nia production and wholesale nurseries that had already shipped 2.3 million potentially 
infected plants to retail nurseries and other wholesale nurseries in 49 states and the 
District of Columbia. This triggered a national regulatory response to determine where 
plants had been shipped and then, once found, to test the plants for P. ramorum. 
Over the next year, federal and NPDN labs processed more than 100,000 samples. 
Because of the NPDN laboratories’ advanced coordination and training, they were able 
to rapidly implement the standardized APHIS diagnostic protocol with little advance 
notice. One critical element of this protocol is a molecular diagnostic based on the PCR 
assay, which at the time was newly developed by APHIS and UC scientists. In addition, 
the NPDN provided support for the purchase of PCR machines and supplies and re-
agents that enabled many network labs to participate. In total, 171 nurseries in 20 states 
tested positive for P. ramorum, triggering implementation of containment and eradica-
tion measures at those sites. 
Prior to establishment of the network, it could take 6 weeks or more for samples to 
go through the system, and nursery plants were quarantined until diagnosis could be 
completed. With the NPDN labs and the new diagnostic assay, turnaround times from 
field collection to diagnosis were reduced to as few as 4 days, enabling many nurseries 
around the country to quickly resume operations once they had been cleared as free 
from P. ramorum.  c

objectives include avoiding or restricting 
the spread of bud- and graft-transmitted 
pathogens of citrus in support of a profit-
able, competitive and sustainable citrus 
industry. As such, the CCPP provides a 
safe mechanism for the introduction of 
citrus varieties into California from any 
area around the world. The process for 
varietal introduction includes disease 
diagnosis and pathogen elimination fol -
lowed by maintenance, pathogen retest-
ing and distribution of true-to-type citrus 
propagative material (fig. 4). 
The CCPP program of importation, 
production and distribution of pathogen-
tested propagative materials is based 
on a comprehensive indexing (testing) 
program to detect graft-transmissible 
diseases and pathogens that may arrive 
in imported budlines. Graft-transmissible 
diseases may be caused by viruses, vi-
roids or other pathogens (e.g., bacteria, 
phytoplasmas) and are vegetatively trans-
mitted with an infected budline. Graft-
transmissible diseases can seriously harm 
fruit quality, production and tree health 
and longevity. In addition, diseases from 
infected field propagation may spread to 
neighboring orchards via insects or con-
taminated farm equipment (Timmer

phytoplasmas) and are vegetatively trans-
mitted with an infected budline. Graft-
transmissible diseases can seriously harm 
fruit quality, production and tree health 
and longevity. In addition, diseases from 
infected field propagation may spread to 
neighboring orchards via insects or con-
taminated farm equipment (Timmer et al. 
2000; Wallace 1978). 
Disease diagnosis and pathogen detec -
tion take place in the insect-proof green-
house and the Delfino Plant Laboratory at 
the Rubidoux Quarantine Facility as well 
as in the Citrus Diagnostic Laboratory at 
UC Riverside. Detection of graft-transmis-
sible citrus diseases is based on a com -
prehensive indexing scheme that involves 
biological and laboratory diagnostics. 
For biological indexing, technicians graft 
tissue from the imported budline onto 
citrus indicator plants, with a specific 
citrus indicator for each specific disease. 
Indicator varieties have been selected for 
their sensitivity to diseases and their abil-
ity to express symptoms. For each index, 
technicians maintain adequate positive 
control plants under the same environ-
mental conditions as the test indicators. 
The controls serve dual purposes: They 
provide a comparison for the test plant 
and also demonstrate that environmental 
conditions in the greenhouse are optimal 
for plant growth and symptom expression 
(Childs 1978; Roistacher 1991; Vidalakis et 
al. 2004).

Citrus propagative material (i.e., bud-

from tree sources of the CCPP foundation

citrus budwood tree sources must be 
established and propagated from citrus 
material that has been through the CCPP 
introductory, therapy and diagnostic pro-
tocols, regularly and routinely tested for 
several citrus pathogens, and registered 
as a budwood source with the CDFA. In 
May 2010, CDFA filed regulations for a 
mandatory Citrus Nursery Stock Pest 
Cleanliness Program as an emergency ac-
tion. Under this new mandatory program, 
more than 8,000 registered budwood 
source trees were tested for several citrus 
pathogens in the first 2 years. The CCPP 
and UC Riverside researchers have been 
instrumental in the development of a

have enabled the successful implemen-
tation of the new § 3701 CDFA Citrus

Since 2009, CCPP has supplied 154,000 
buds from 301 different citrus varieties. 
A citrus nursery can produce as many as 
300 trees within a year to 18 months from 
each CCPP bud. That means that an esti-
mated 231 million citrus trees have been 
produced from pathogen-tested CCPP 
material in the past 5 years alone. If a sin-
gle pathogen had been present in any of 
the buds used for this tree propagation, it 
would have been transmitted to millions 
of trees, with unknown horticultural, pro -

 had been present in any of

would have been transmitted to millions 
of trees, with unknown horticultural, pro -
duction and economic effects. 
Diseases can sometimes become so 
important in citrus production that it may 
be necessary, for example, to change from 
a long-used rootstock to one that is more 
tolerant or resistant to a disease agent. 
Such was the case when citrus tristeza 
disease became a limiting factor for citrus 
production in California. Millions of trees 
growing on sour orange rootstock, which 
was susceptible to tristeza quick decline, 
had to be replaced with trees grown on 
tristeza-tolerant rootstocks of trifoliate 
and trifoliate hybrids. The availability 
of pathogen-tested tristeza-tolerant root-
stocks and scions (e.g., mandarins) from 
the CCPP was critical to the industry’s 
transition and subsequent economic suc -
cess (Barnier et al. 2010; Calavan et al. 
1978). The availability of a wide selection 
of citrus species, varieties and selections 
for evaluation and experimental use is 
essential to our ability to address new 
and emerging problems such as citrus 
greening. 
Another important factor for the health 
and sustainability of the commercial 
citrus industry is maintenance of our 
capacity to import new varieties having 
different or improved fruit qualities or 
different maturity dates and organoleptic 
characters to satisfy ever-changing con-
sumer demands. A capacity to import and 
maintain new pathogen-free citrus germ-
plasm is imperative to keeping risk to

sumer demands. A capacity to import and 
maintain new pathogen-free citrus germ-
plasm is imperative to keeping risk to 
the industry at a minimum and enabling 
research to move forward. The only way 
we can meet these goals is through a 
program like the CCPP that works col-
laboratively with state and federal regula-
tors, the citrus industry and UC to release 
pathogen-tested citrus varieties.
Partnerships for plant health
The three programs described here 
demonstrate how investments in diagnos -
tics, germplasm screening and develop -
ment, and related training and education 
are helping to safeguard agriculture and 
plant resources at statewide, regional and 
national levels. These programs provide 
the agricultural industry with healthy 
planting stock as well as highly coor -
dinated systems to deal efficiently with 
disease and pest outbreaks. Their success 
is due to the commitment of resources by 
the USDA, state agencies, industry and 
LGUs. 
Especially critical to the success of 
these programs in California are the con-
tributions of ANR and CDFA scientists 
and support staff. Yet recent limitations in 
state and federal funding for agricultural 
science have put the continuation of these 
programs in serious jeopardy. Reduced 
funding will weaken interagency col-
laboration and sharing of expertise, limit 
training and education programs, reduce 
the speed with which samples can be 
processed and put our general prepared-
ness to address plant health emergencies 
at risk. Increases

and plant importation, together with the 
importance of sustainable production sys-

mand for integrated programs to provide 
accurate, rapid diagnoses in support of 
plant health has never been greater.  c
