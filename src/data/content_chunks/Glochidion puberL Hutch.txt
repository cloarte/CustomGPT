It forms thickets from root sprouts. The bark on larger stems and the trunk is dark brown with narrow furrows. The younger stems are green and pubescent. There are two types of leaves produced-small scale-like leaves arranged spirally on the main branches and well-developed leaves on short, deciduous phyllanthoid branchs that appear like pinnately compound leaves. These leaves are alternate, distichous, petiolate, oblong to lanceolate in outline, glabrous above and densely pubescent below, with entire margins. Flowers are produced in axillary unisexual or bisexual fascicles of 2-5 flowers. The individual flowers have 6 greenish sepals and no petals. Male flowers have 3 stamens that are fused into a cylindric column. Female flowers have a 5-10-locular ovary.
