Bleeding gums 
Tooth loss 
Pain
WHAT IS PD?
Inflammation of 
tissues and bone 
that surround 
and support the 
teeth due to a 
bacterial infection. 
PD is sometimes 
referred to as 
dental disease.
Canine Periodontal Disease (PD)
HOW DOES PD DEVELOP?
When food and bacteria collect along the gumline, plaque forms 
that eventually hardens into tartar. Tartar irritates the gums, 
causing inflammation called gingivitis. If left untreated, the 
tartar builds up under the gum line, resulting in PD. Dogs may 
experience pain, infection, abscesses, and tooth loss as the 
disease becomes more severe. 
Gingivitis
Note the redness and 
inflammation at the gumline
Tartar
 Note the large amount of 
yellowish material on the teeth
Severe PD
Note the missing teeth,  
tartar, and gingivitis
RISK FACTORS:
Certain characteristics of the dog  
increase the risk of PD.
BREED SIZE  
In general, the smaller the 
dog, the higher the risk.
AGE 
The older the dog, the 
more likely it is to have 
some degree of PD.
MUZZLE LENGTH 
Short-muzzled breeds may 
be at increased risk due to 
overcrowding of the teeth.
BREED 
Certain breeds, such as 
Greyhounds, are known to 
be at increased risk.
DOES YOUR DOG HAVE PD?
The earliest and most common sign is bad breath. The following signs may 
indicate your dog has advanced PD

PD Causes Significant  
Health and Welfare Problems
More than 80% of dogs  
over 2 years of age  
have PD
Increased risk of: 
Kidney disease  
Liver disease  
Heart disease
This Animal Care Aid is part of a series developed to provide information about PD in dogs.  
For more information, refer to the other topics covered in the series (“Monitoring PD in Dogs” and “Preventive Care for PD in Dogs”).
May increase the risk of premature birth, low birth  
weight, increased infant mortality, small litters
