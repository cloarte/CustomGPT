Serial Release – Rebottling/Reprocessing – Process 
CONTROLLED//PROPIN//BASIC 
Source Document: Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, section114.17; Veterinary Services Memorandum 
No. 800.62; and CVB-SOP-0032, Processing Serial Records 
Background: 
These requests must be submitted on an APHIS Form 2008, not via a Mail Log 
Submission. Each request should have a Form 2008 for the product/serial being 
rebottled/reprocessed and a letter providing details concerning the reprocessing/rebottling 
process. 
Rebottling of biological products is allowed for in accordance with title 9, Code of 
Federal Regulations (9 CFR), section114.17. This is part of the regulatory flexibility 
built into the 9 CFR regulations. Additional guidance is found in Veterinary Services 
Memorandum No. 800.62 (VSM 800.62), “Relabeling, Rebottling, and Reprocessing 
Veterinary Biological Products, Section V.” The firm disposition on the Form 2008 
request should be marked as Other - Rebottling.

request should be marked as Other - Rebottling. 
Reprocessing of biological products is allowed for in accordance with 9 CFR 114.18. 
This is part of the regulatory flexibility built into the 9 CFR regulations. Additional 
guidance is found in VSM 800.62, “Relabeling, Rebottling, and Reprocessing Veterinary 
Biological Products, Section VI. A-C.” The firm disposition on the Form 2008 request 
should be marked as “Reprocess & Retest.” 
VSM 800.62, Section VI.D, authorizes the reprocessing of product by adding two serials 
(both prepared in accordance with the filed Outline of Production (OP)) together to adjust 
antigen content. This is not meant to include a serial of completed product already in 
final containers. If this is requested, contact an Inspection and Compliance Section 
Leader. 
Most steps follow the outline as listed in CVB-SOP-0032, “Processing Serial Records,” 
with the following additions. 
A. Biologics Compliance Assistant (BCA) Initial Review: Requests are shown in the 
Reprocess & Retest section in BCA initial review.

2. The BCA may audit the submission back in accordance with the current version 
of CVB-WI-0104, “Serial Release – Audits and Reference Slips for IC Documents,” 
if the information required is incomplete. 
3. If the submission is not audited back, route it to the Specialist for review.

a. Request should only be considered for product that has not left licensed 
premises. This is a regulatory requirement for rebottling and common sense for

b. A letter regarding the rebottling/reprocessing procedures should include all 
steps and locations where the rebottling/reprocessing will take place. Identity of 
materials to be used in the reprocessing event is also beneficial. 
c. The rebottled/reprocessed serial(s) must have a unique identification. This is 
entered when the request is logged into LSRTIS through the NCAH portal. 
2. Review the supporting documents submitted. 
a. This may require reviewing the OP and/or the Facility Documents. 
b. Determine if the process described is detrimental to the purity of the product 
or would impact product stability. 
3. Rebottling or Reprocessing IS NOT GRANTED for the following: 
a. Products containing a rabies fraction. 
b. In response to a contamination issue. 
4. Determine if you will require a “Special Test” of the NEW/rebottled serial or 
NEW/reprocessed serial. See CVB-WI-0116, “Special Test Requests Initiated by 
Inspection and Compliance Staff,” for complete directions. 
Sterility tests would be appropriate for rebottled serials. Sterility and/or potency tests 
can be considered for reprocessed serials. If the potency test uses animals, requesting 
potency testing is discouraged but not prohibited.

5. Autogenous product - If the serial to be reprocessed is from an original first serial 
autogenous product, the reprocessed serial is no longer considered a first serial. 
If the firm marks an autogenous serial with “Yes” for first serial and it is requesting to 
be reprocessed – this should be audited back to the firm with the comments that a 
reprocessed serial is not considered a first serial any longer.
