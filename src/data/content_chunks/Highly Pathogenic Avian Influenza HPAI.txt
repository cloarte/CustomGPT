Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 
Personal Protective Equipment Recommendations 
May 29, 2024 
Purpose and Scope 
The purpose of this document is to provide the minimum recommendations for appropriate personal 
protective equipment (PPE) to wear and biosecurity procedures to follow when visiting an HPAI (H5N1) 
affected herd. 
Ultimately the final decision on whether additional clothing is required, or additional procedures are 
necessary, is at the discretion of the local Incident Commander and Safety Officer based on perceived risk 
level and the activities being conducted. 
Note: It is highly recommended to conduct as many activities as possible off-site. USDA is entrusted to identify 
and prevent disease; we need to be vigilant and avoid spreading disease to other premises while conducting 
on-site work. 
Pre-visit Coordination 
Prior to visiting an affected farm, contact the appropriate APHIS Area Veterinarian In Charge (AVIC) and State 
Animal Health Official (SAHO) to coordinate the visit. This pre-visit

and prevent disease; we need to be vigilant and avoid spreading disease to other premises while conducting 
on-site work. 
Pre-visit Coordination 
Prior to visiting an affected farm, contact the appropriate APHIS Area Veterinarian In Charge (AVIC) and State 
Animal Health Official (SAHO) to coordinate the visit. This pre-visit communication and coordination will 
ensure all parties are aware of the planned visit, have information about the status of the farm, and can 
create a plan regarding the on-farm biosecurity procedures in accordance with the farm, state, and other 
agency procedures. Do not enter livestock or poultry premises if you are exhibiting any symptoms of 
influenza-like illness. 
Arrival 
When arriving at an HPAI (H5N1) affected premises, personnel should perform standard donning procedures 
at their vehicle. Personnel should also plan ahead for their doffing procedures by establishing a clean/dirty 
line and setting up a Virkon® bath to wash boots when returning to the vehicle. 
On-Site Personnel 
Persons working with or around cattle, including those working with or disposing of milk waste, that are 
suspected or confirmed with HPAI (H5N1) virus infection should wear PPE when in direct or close contact 
(within about 6 feet) with animals, animal feces, litter, milk, or materials known to be or potentially 
contaminated with HPAI (H5N1) viruses. 
Recommended PPE includes: 
• Properly fitted unvented or indirectly vented safety goggles or a face shield (if there is risk of liquid 
splash onto the respirator) 
• Disposable gloves 
• Boots or boot covers

Departure 
When leaving an HPAI (H5N1) affected premises, personnel should perform standard doffing of PPE upon 
returning to their vehicle. This includes: 
• Thoroughly cleaning boots in a Virkon® bath and 
• Spraying shoes with Lysol spray prior to entering the vehicle. 
• Wash hands thoroughly if washing facilities are available; use hand sanitizer when facilities are not 
available. 
Truck Wash and Return to Hotel 
After leaving an HPAI (H5N1) affected premises, personnel should wash their vehicle at the nearest car/truck 
wash, ensuring the wash includes cleaning of the vehicle undercarriage and tires. 
Personnel should then travel directly to their residence or hotel to shower and change clothes. 
Downtime 
Wait 72 hours between visiting affected premises and any other premises. 
Influenza-like Illness 
Employees who worked on an affected farm should monitor their health carefully during mobilization and 
for 10 days from the end of their mobilization. New onset or worsening of any of the following signs and 
symptoms should be reported to the supervisor or Safety Officer: 
• Fever (Temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) or feeling feverish/chills 
• Cough

Influenza and Biosecurity: 
Not Just for the Birds        
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a very 
contagious and often deadly respiratory disease of 
poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, and geese. It 
is often spread by wild birds and can make other 
animals sick too.
You can protect your birds and other animals from 
HPAI with good biosecurity. Simply put, biosecurity 
refers to everything people do to keep diseases away 
from animals, property, and people. 
Limit visitors
• Only allow people on farm who need to be there. 
• Use only one entrance and exit for the farm.
• Keep a record of all farm visitors.
Ke
ep germs away 
• Give visitors disposable shoe covers to wear on 
the farm.
• Keep a separate pair of boots for use on the farm 
around your animals.
• Use a footbath with a disinfectant solution  
(4 ounces of bleach in 1 gallon of water) 
to clean footwear before entering the farm.
• Spray disinfectant on all vehicle and trailer tires 
before returning to the farm. 
• Don’t borrow tools or equipment from  
other farms.
• Don’t use untreated water from ponds or streams.
Av
oid mixing species
• Keep other animals and strangers off the property.
• Keep livestock and pets away from birds, including 
bird feed, litter, or equipment. 
• Keep birds out of animal pens and barns.  
• Keep all wild animals (including rats and mice) away 
from bird and livestock areas.

• Severe illness in multiple animals 
• Sudden or unexplained deaths
If your animals look sick, 
take action! 
Isolate sick animals and report them to your 
veterinarian and/or State and Federal animal 
health officials.
Your veterinarian will determine if your animals 
might have HPAI. They may contact the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture or your State Animal 
Health Official to test your animals.
