Page 1 Flow Chart Description
The ﬂow chart on Page 1 shows a series of questions and answers to determine what requirements 
cattle must meet for in terstate movement. Th e ﬁrst question is, “Are the cattle moving interstate?” If the 
answer is, “No,” the rule does not apply. If the answer is, “Yes,” one then must determine what type of 
cattle are moving. 
If the cattle moving interstate are dairy cattle, which are deﬁned as, “All cattle, regardless of age or sex or 
current use, that are of a breed(s) or oﬀspring of a breed used to produce milk or other dairy products 
for human consumption, including, but not limited to, Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Holstein, Jersey, Guernsey, 
Milking Shorthorn, and Red and Whites,” three requirements must be met: 
1. An
 ICVI is required.
2. Cattle moving interstate require oﬃcial identiﬁcation.
3. Recording IDs on movement documentation is REQUIRED.
If
 the cattle or bison moving interstate are used for rodeo, shows, exhibitions, or recreational events, no 
matter their age, sex, or breed, they must meet those same requirements as dairy cattle. Those 
requirements are:  
1. An ICVI is required.
2. Cattle and bison moving interstate require oﬃcial identiﬁcation.
3. Recording IDs on movement documentation is REQUIRED.

. Those 
requirements are:  
1. An ICVI is required.
2. Cattle and bison moving interstate require oﬃcial identiﬁcation.
3. Recording IDs on movement documentation is REQUIRED.
If
 the animals moving interstate are beef animals, one must determine what kind of beef cattle or bison 
are moving. If the beef cattle or bison are sexually intact and 18 months of age or older, they must meet 
the same requirements as dairy cattle for interstate movement. Those requirements are:  
1. An ICVI is required.
2. Cattle and bison moving interstate require oﬃcial identiﬁcation.
3. Recording IDs on movement documentation is REQUIRED.
If
 the beef cattle or bison moving interstate are not sexually intact or are under 18 months of age, oﬃcial 
ID is not required. However, an ICVI is required. The ICVI need not list oﬃcial ID numbers, but when 
animals are not required by the regulations to be oﬃcially identiﬁed, the ICVI must state the exemption 
that applies (e.g., the cattle and bison do not belong to one of the classes of cattle and bison to which 
the oﬃcial identiﬁcation requirements of this part apply).
