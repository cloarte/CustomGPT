Emerging Risk Notice   
August 2020  
Infectious hypodermal and 
hematopoietic necrosis virus 
(IHHNV) 
Key Points  
 In 2019, shrimp farms in Texas, Florida and 
New Mexico were quarantined with all affected 
tanks depopulated after the detection of 
IHHNV in shrimp. A research facility in 
California was also quarantined and 
depopulated after receiving shrimp from a 
previously infected farm.1    
 IHHNV is a DNA virus of the family 
Parvoviridae which affects farmed and wild 
penaeid shrimp (of the Penaeidae family).2 It 
has been reported in many regions of the 
world including Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, 
and the Americas.

 IHHNV is a DNA virus of the family 
Parvoviridae which affects farmed and wild 
penaeid shrimp (of the Penaeidae family).2 It 
has been reported in many regions of the 
world including Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, 
and the Americas.1    
 IHHNV is reportable to the OIE (World 
Organisation for Animal Health). It is not 
known to pose a human health risk. 
 
Concerns for U.S. Animal Health  
 IHHNV is an emerging global disease first 
described in association with outbreaks of 
penaeid shrimp mortality in 1981 in Hawaiian 
shrimp culture facilities.3   
 The U.S. is the only country in the Americas 
since 2006 considered by the OIE to have 
IHHNV-free zones.1  
 The mortality rate associated with IHHNV 
varies, but may be as high as 80-90%.3 Low 
mortality with high morbidity entailing 
deformities and growth suppression, resulting 
in high commercial losses, has also been 
reported.4  
 Commercial U.S. shrimp production in 2017 
was valued at $531 million.5  
 
Epidemiology  
 USDA-APHIS-VS is working to complete 
epidemiologic investigations.  
 IHHNV has been identified globally in farmed 
and wild shrimp; mortality and morbidity varies 
depending on species.6  
 Species which meet the OIE criteria for listing 
as susceptible to IHHNV include

 USDA-APHIS-VS is working to complete 
epidemiologic investigations.  
 IHHNV has been identified globally in farmed 
and wild shrimp; mortality and morbidity varies 
depending on species.6  
 Species which meet the OIE criteria for listing 
as susceptible to IHHNV include: yellowleg 
shrimp (Penaeus californiensis), giant tiger 
prawn (P. monodon), northern white shrimp 
(P. setiferus), blue shrimp (P. stylirostris), and 
white leg shrimp (P. vannamei). Research 
suggests other potential host species may 
exist, but these have not yet met the OIE 
criteria for listing as susceptible to IHHNV.6  
 Signs of acute IHHNV infection are most 
prominent in juveniles of P. stylirostris and 
include lethargic surface swimming, 
motionlessness or sinking shrimp, muscle 
opacity, and high mortality rates.7  
 Chronic IHHNV infection causes runt deformity 
syndrome (RDS) in some species, most 
notably in P. vannamei, selected lines of P. 
stylirostris, and some populations of P. 
monodon. Clinical signs include cuticle 
deformities, deformed rostra, and variable and 
reduced growth rates.8  
 Resistance may vary between penaeid 
species and also within different genetic lines 
of pinaeid species. P. vannamei is the 
principal global farmed shrimp species, largely 
due to its relative resistance to IHHNV 
infection.9

 IHHNV is transmitted horizontally and 
vertically through cannibalization, 
contaminated water, and infected eggs.3,10

Diagnostic Testing  
 IHHNV primarily targets connective tissue cells, 
gills, haematopoietic nodules and haemocytes, 
ventral nerve cord and ganglia, antennal gland 
tubule epithelial cells, and lymphoid organ 
parenchymal cells. Any of the tissues listed 
above, pleopods, hemolymph, or whole shrimp 
or prawns may be used for testing.6 
 
 Diagnostic testing methods include polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR), dot-blot hybridization, in-
situ hybridization, histopathology, and genetic 
sequencing.6

 Diagnostic testing methods include polymerase

 Histopathological lesions include Cowdry type 
A intranuclear inclusions in gills, nerve cord, 
gastric mucosa, antennal gland, cuticular 
hypodermis, and hematopoietic and connective 
tissue.3  
 
 Certain cuticular deformities are 
pathognomonic for infection with IHHNV, 
specifically, a deformed rostrum bent to the left 
or right which may be presented by P. 
vannamei and P. stylirostris with RDS.6 
 
Treatment 
 
 No treatments or vaccines are currently 
available for IHHNV.6 
 
Prevention   
 Appropriate aquaculture biosecurity practices 
and husbandry are recommended to prevent 
disease introduction and spread.  
 
 Proper biosecurity practices include: 
 
o Purchasing live shrimp and germplasm from 
sources known to be free of IHHNV. 
 
o Quarantining and monitoring all new shrimp 
stocks upon arrival to a farm, disinfecting and 
properly disposing of water used to transport live 
shrimp, noting increased mortality rates and 
using appropriate diagnostic testing. 
 
o Pretreating all water sources and minimizing or 
eliminating water exchange between
