 Invasion: The following description is adapted fromKuschel (2008)andMiller (1923):
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: Cultivated / agricultural land, Managed forests, plantations and orchards, Natural forests
 Reproduccion: The adult female lays a single egg in the corms, tubers, fruits or soft stems of a range of plants. The larva bores through the plant tissues, completing its entire development inside the host ( Fakalata, 1981 ; Miller, 1923 ). In the case of kava, the adult female oviposits into the stem after boring a hole ( Fakalata, 1981 ). The larvae hatch in the tunnel inside the kava’s stem ( Davis and Brown, 1999 ). In begonias, the larvae are found in the main stems usually near the base ( Simmonds, 1928 ). Oviposition in lemons takes place in the fruit stalks near the base and pupation occurs in the fruits ( Miller, 1923 ). In ginger, larvae burrow into the stems and rhizomes ( Stout, 1982 ), and in yam they occur in the tuber as well in the pupation stage ( Asiedu et al., 2014 ). There was one case in which the larvae

In ginger, larvae burrow into the stems and rhizomes ( Stout, 1982 ), and in yam they occur in the tuber as well in the pupation stage ( Asiedu et al., 2014 ). There was one case in which the larvae used the plant’s fibers to spin a cocoon for pupation on Crinum sp. ( Whitehouse and Chamorro, 2019 ). In passion fruit, the eggs are laid in the stem at the collar region; and it was found that cracking on passion fruit bark produced by Pseudaulacaspis pentagona provided a stimulus for oviposition ( Gerlach et al., 1985 ). They hatch after a few days, produce larvae that moult 5-6 times and then pupate. One-to-two weeks later, adults emerge by making small holes in the stem ( Gerlach et al., 1985 ). E. geophilus is noted as a long-term storage pest in other root crops such as yams ( Dioscorea spp.) ( Wilson, 1987 ). They are found up to an elevation of 150 m ( Zimmerman, 1936 ).
 Sintomas: The larval stage of E. geophilus burrows into the root, corm, stems, or tuber of the growing host plant. The subsequent feeding results in stem dieback, leaf wilting, loss of vigour and rotting of the host ( Rosa, 1959 ; Fakalata, 1981 ; Mau and Kessing, 1992 ). In kava, the larvae fill the tunnels with frass, causing stem dieback, leaf wilt and rotting by fungi and bacteria ( Fakalata, 1981 ; Davis and Brown, 1999 ).
