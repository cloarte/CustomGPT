The draft version of the Newcastle Disease Response 
Plan: The Red Book (2014) incorporates comments 
received on the Exotic ND Response Plan: The Red Book 
(2013) and reflects updates to Foreign Animal Disease 
Preparedness and Response Plan (FAD PReP) materials.
This plan does not replace existing regional, State, 
Tribal, local, or industry preparedness and response 
plans relating to ND. Regional, State, Tribal, local, and 
industry plans should be aimed at more specific issues 
in ND response.
States should develop response plans focused on the 
specific characteristics of the State and its poultry 
industry.

ND RESPONSE PLAN

Objectives of this Plan
Identify the capabilities needed to respond to an ND 
outbreak. 
Identify critical activities that are involved in 
responding to that outbreak and associated time-
frames.
In an outbreak situation, critical activities are under the 
authority of an Incident Command (IC).

6Introduction and Information
Definitions
Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1(APMV-1) is the 
etiologic agent of Newcastle disease (ND) in birds.
APMV-1 viruses that cause ND are either virulent 
(vNDV) or low virulence (loNDV).
In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Newcastle 
Disease (ND) refers to an infection of poultry with 
vNDV.
NDV refers to the virus in general, for example, when 
discussing environmental persistence.
7Introduction and Information
Etiology
8Introduction and Information
 ND is an infection of birds caused by vNDV, an avian 
paramyxovirus serotype-1 (APMV-1). 
 Nine serotypes of avian paramyxovirus have been 
identified. 
– There is one serotype of APMV-1 and six phylogenetic lineages.
 There are three major pathotypes based on virulence: 
– Lentogenic (low virulence viruses), 
– Mesogenic, and 
– Velogenic (virulent viruses). 
o The velogenic viruses are further classified as either neurotropic or 
viscerotropic.
History

History
9Introduction and Information
 ND was first identified in England in 1927. 
 The first major outbreak of ND in the United States was 
identified in the early 1970s; this outbreak was 
epidemiologically linked to the transmission of ND from 
infected parrots to commercial poultry.
– The last ND outbreaks in the United States included the States 
of California (2002–2003), Nevada (2003), Arizona (2003), and 
Texas (2003).
– Virulent NDV is endemic in wild cormorants in the United States 
and Canada, but commercial poultry are currently free of 
velogenic isolates.
 Virulent NDV remains endemic in many parts of the 
world, including Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. 
Economic Impact
In 1971, the ND outbreak in the United States 
resulted in the destruction of 12 million birds at a 
cost of $56 million to eradicate the virus in 3 years. 
The 2002–2003 epidemic in the western United 
States resulted in industry losses estimated at $5 
billion, and a direct cost of $160 million to control 
the outbreak.
An ND outbreak in the United States today could 
exceed these economic costs and also result in 
significant disruptions to the U.S. food supply.
10Introduction and Information
Zoonotic Potential
 Virulent NDV can cause infection in humans. 
 This infection is mild and self-limiting.
– It usually causes conjunctivitis but can also result in mild 
influenza-like symptoms. 
 Direct contact with infected birds is the most common 
transmission pathway; it is not transmitted through the 
consumption of poultry products.

– It usually causes conjunctivitis but can also result in mild 
influenza-like symptoms. 
 Direct contact with infected birds is the most common 
transmission pathway; it is not transmitted through the 
consumption of poultry products. 
 Responders—particularly poultry workers and 
vaccination crews—should be protected from the virus 
through appropriate health and safety measures and 
personal protective equipment (PPE).
11Introduction and Information
Susceptible Species
More than 250 avian species can be infected with 
NDV. The most severely affected avian species are 
typically Galliformes, an order that includes:
– chickens,
– guinea fowl,
– peafowl,
– pheasant, and
– quail.
Turkeys can be infected, but usually present less 
severe clinical signs than chickens.
12Introduction and Information

Reservoirs
Wild birds and waterfowl can be reservoirs for NDV.
Upon transmission to domestic poultry, these strains 
may mutate into more virulent viruses. 
In addition, some psittacine species may shed virus 
for extended periods of time (several months to a 
year) but may not show clinical signs.

 Velogenic strains cause severe disease, particularly in 
chickens.
Gross Pathological Lesions
 Only velogenic strains will result in significant gross 
lesions.
 Lesions can be variable within neurotropic and 
viscerotropic forms. In general, velogenic gross lesions 
may include the following:
– Swelling of the periorbital area or head,
– Edema of the interstitial or peritracheal neck tissue,
– Petechiae and small ecchymoses on the mucosa of the 
proventriculus,
– Necrosis, ulcerations, or hemorrhages of respiratory, digestive, 
or lymphoid tissue, and
– Enlarged spleen.
19Introduction and Information
Differential Diagnosis
Virulent NDV can resemble 
– highly pathogenic avian influenza (caused by 
influenzavirus A), 
– laryngotracheitis (caused by infectious 
laryngotracheitis virus), 
– psittacosis (caused by Chlamydophila psittaci), 
mycoplasmosis (caused by mycoplasma 
gallisepticum), 
– and fowl cholera (caused by Pasturella spp.).

Response Goals
The goals of an ND response are to:
– detect, control, and contain ND in domestic poultry as 
quickly as possible;
– eradicate ND using strategies that seek to protect public 
health and the environment, and stabilize animal 
agriculture, the food supply, and the economy; and
– provide science- and risk-based approaches and systems to 
facilitate continuity of business for non-infected animals 
and non-contaminated animal products.

Epidemiological Principles
Three basic epidemiological principles form the 
foundation to contain, control, and eradicate ND in 
the U.S. domestic poultry population:
– Prevent contact between the ND virus and susceptible 
poultry.
– Stop the production of ND virus by infected or exposed 
poultry.
– Increase the disease resistance of susceptible poultry to 
the ND virus.

Response Strategy for Control 
and Eradication of ND in Poultry
The United States’ primary control and eradication 
strategy for ND in poultry is stamping-out.
If the spread of ND outpaces the resources for 
stamping-out, or if other factors direct the response 
away from a stamping-out 
strategy alone, emergency 
vaccination strategies 
may be considered.

Definition
“Stamping-out” is defined in the OIE Terrestrial Animal 
Health Code as the “killing of animals which are 
affected and those suspected of being affected in the 
herd and, where appropriate, those in other herds 
which have been exposed to infection by direct animal 
to animal contact, or by indirect contact with the causal 
pathogen; this includes all susceptible animals, 
vaccinated or unvaccinated, on infected 
establishments.”
53Response Goals and Strategy
Stamping-Out
Critical Goals
 Within 24 hours of (or as soon as possible after) a premises 
being classified as an Infected Premises (IP), infected poultry 
will be depopulated in the quickest, safest, and most humane 
way possible. In many cases, poultry on Contact Premises (CP) 
may also be depopulated as soon as possible.
 Where resources are limited, premises will be prioritized so 
that those with the highest potential for active ND spread are 
‘stamped-out’ first.
 Based on the epidemiology of the outbreak, prioritizing the 
poultry to depopulate first may be necessary.
 Public concerns about stamping-out require a well-planned 
and proactive public relations and liaison campaign. 
Stakeholders, the public, and the international community 
must be involved.

Assessing a Possible Outbreak
 During the investigation of premises suspected of having 
ND, animal health responders use clinical signs, history, 
and professional judgment to determine the likelihood 
that ND exists on the premises. This assessment includes
– a history of clinical and epidemiological findings,
– results of physical examinations,
– necropsy findings,
– specimen collection and submission to an approved laboratory,
– reporting, and
– initiating appropriate control measures.
56Response Goals and Strategy
Authorization for Response 
and Associated Activities
When the criteria for a presumptive ND case have been 
met, the APHIS Administrator or VS Deputy 
Administrator (Chief Veterinary Officer [CVO] of the 
United States) can authorize APHIS personnel—in 
conjunction with State, Tribal, and IC personnel—to 
initiate depopulation, cleaning and disinfection 
procedures of the index case and investigation of 
Contact Premises (CP).
57Response Goals and Strategy
Management of Incident
 The outbreak response effort should be implemented 
through ICS with an appropriate span of control and 
delegation of authority.
 An Incident Commander should be identified and an ICP 
established.
 In-State resources (whether Federal, State, Tribal, local, 
or privately owned) should be used to manage a local

ND-Free Status
 The criteria needed for ND-free status as described in 
Article 10.9.2 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code 
(2013). :
 It has been shown that NDV infection in poultry has not 
been present in the country, zone or compartment for 
the past 12 months, based on surveillance in accordance 
with Articles 10.9.22. to 10.9.26 
 If infection has occurred in poultry in a previously free 
country, zone, or compartment, ND free status can be 
regained three months after a stamping-out policy 
(including disinfection of all affected establishments) is 
applied, providing that surveillance in accordance with 
Articles 10.9.22. to 10.9.26. has been carried out during

 To have the surveillance plan consider the susceptible wild bird 
population in the area, to coordinate with APHIS, U.S. Department 
of the Interior, State wildlife agencies, and State agriculture 
departments to perform appropriate ND surveillance in these 
populations.
 To provide complete surveillance data summaries and analysis at 
intervals as specified by IC.
 To develop effective surveillance plans that can achieve desired 
outcomes by leveraging available resources, satisfying jurisdictional 
requirements, and implementing continuity of business measures

Surveillance
The following are goals in an ND outbreak:
 Detect ND infected premises during an outbreak.
 Determine the size and extent of an ND outbreak.
 Supply information to evaluate outbreak control 
activities.
 Provide information for poultry and product movement 
within the CA.
 Provide information for poultry and product movement 
out of the CA.
 Prove disease freedom (DF) and regain disease-free 
status after eradication of the outbreak.

Surveillance Planning for ND Outbreak
• A surveillance plan indicates the frequency, number, 
and distribution of poultry and premises to be 
sampled. This requires tradeoffs be made among six 
surveillance parameters:
– design (threshold) prevalence,
– confidence level,
– types of tests,
– sampling frequency,
– risk-based sampling, and
– sampling scheme.
67
Critical Activities and Tools
Surveillance Objectives by Time Period
 The initial 72 hours post-ND outbreak declaration. 
Detect existing infected flocks and premises as quickly as possible.
 The control and eradication period (from initial 72-hour period until 
last case is detected and eradicated).
Detect infected premises so that control measures can be put in 
place.
Provide evidence that premises are free of ND, thereby permitting 
poultry and poultry product movements in the CA.
Evaluate outbreak management control activities.
Provide evidence that disease is absent from the free area to 
enable unrestricted poultry and poultry product movement.
 Post eradication.
68Critical Activities and Tools
Diagnostics
During a suspected or actual ND outbreak, the key 
goals of response are to:
– meet the surge requirements for diagnostic testing at 
specific intervals, starting at time zero and at 24-hour 
intervals as the response escalates, and 
– report all diagnostic test results to appropriate personnel 
and information management systems within 12 hours of

Surge Capacity
 Surge capacity may be needed in an ND outbreak. 
Additional resources, such as personnel and materials, 
will be needed for sample collection. 
– Additional capacity may also be required for laboratory sample 
testing. 
 Surge capacity can help facilitate a rapid response and 
continuity of business for non-infected premises. 
 In the event that the State NAHLN laboratory and NVSL-
Ames are overwhelmed by the diagnostic testing 
requirements, NAHLN labs from across the country will 
provide surge capacity for diagnostic testing.

Epidemiological Investigation
Epidemiological investigation and movement tracing 
during an outbreak are critical in controlling and 
eradicating ND. 
In an ND outbreak, the goals are to:
– within 6 hours of identifying potential IP or CP through 
tracing activities, assign a premises classification and a 
priority of investigation; 
– within 24 hours of identifying the IP or initial CP , identify all 
additional CP; and
– within 96 hours of identifying the index case, characterize 
the nature of the ND outbreak, identify the risk factors for 
transmission, and develop mitigation strategies.
75Critical Activities and Tools
Tracing
 One of the single most important and urgent veterinary 
activities during an ND outbreak is to rapidly and 
diligently trace-back and trace-forward movements from 
an IP .
 This tracing will aid in the control of the spread of ND

 Tracing should cover all movements from the premises, 
including susceptible poultry, non-susceptible species, 
animal products, vehicles, crops and grains, and people.
 Tracing also includes consideration of all potential modes 
of transmission and possible contact with wild birds.
76Critical Activities and Tools
Communication
 Establish a network of stakeholders and systems for 
communication prior to an incident or outbreak.
 Brief the media, public, industry, Congress, trading partners, 
and others on the ND outbreak status and the actions being 
taken to control and eradicate the disease.
 Coordinate with Federal, State, and local agencies, Tribal 
entities, producer groups, and Land Grant University-based 
Cooperative Extension Services to ensure consistent 
messaging regarding animal health, public health, and food 
safety.
 Assure consumers that USDA is working on animal health 
issues, in an informed and timely manner, along with HHS, 
which is working on human health issues.
77Critical Activities and Tools
Communication Objectives
All ND communications must:
– furnish accurate, timely, and consistent information;
– maintain credibility and instill public confidence in the 
government’s ability to respond to an outbreak;
– minimize public panic and fear; and
– address rumors, inaccuracies, 
and misperceptions as quickly 
as possible.

– Protect your flocks with good biosecurity practices.
– Know the signs of ND, and be vigilant in reporting signs of 
illness.
79Critical Activities and Tools
Health and Safety and 
Personal Protective Equipment
During an ND outbreak, responders 
are exposed to many hazards.
In an ND response, personal 
protection and safety is particularly 
essential to protect individuals from 
ND infection.
Those at increased risk for ND 
infection are personnel in prolonged 
and direct contact with infected 
birds in an enclosed setting.
80
Critical Activities and Tools
Biosecurity
An ND outbreak will have a serious impact on the 
agricultural industry.
Strict biosecurity measures need to be implemented 
immediately to prevent or slow the spread of ND. 
Biosecurity procedures should be implemented 
within 24 hours of the identification of an index ND 
case.
Because some people in contact with ND virus may

Closed Flocks
To the fullest extent possible, close the flock to the 
introduction of new poultry (with population 
increases occurring only from offspring).
If closing a flock is not possible, isolate newly 
purchased poultry (from the 
healthiest possible sources) and those returning 
from existing flocks for 30 days or more.
Vaccination status of introduced poultry should be
known.
83Critical Activities and Tools
Quarantine and Movement Control
 By restricting the movement of infected animals, animal 
products, and contaminated fomites, quarantine and 
movement control can be a powerful tool in controlling 
and eradicating an ND outbreak.
 Movement control is accomplished through a permit 
system that allows entities to 
make necessary movements 
without creating an 
unacceptable risk of disease 
spread. 
– EMRS  2.0 is the system of
record for these movements.

Continuity of Business
 Continuity of business is the management of non-IP and non-
contaminated animal products in the event of an ND 
outbreak.
 This helps agriculture and food industries facilitate routine 
business, or a return to business, during a disease response, 
while the risk of disease spread and threat to public health is 
effectively managed.
86
Critical Activities and Tools
Mass Depopulation and Euthanasia
Poultry on an IP will be depopulated as soon as 
possible after declaration of an ND outbreak.
Poultry on CP may also be depopulated as soon as 
possible after the premises are classified as CP.
The NAHEMS Guidelines: Mass Depopulation and 
Euthanasia contains additional information on 
euthanasia and mass depopulation.
87Critical Activities and Tools
Disposal
 Appropriate disposal of animal carcasses and materials is a critical 
component of a successful ND response.
 The Disposal SOP discusses how to dispose of thousands of bird 
carcasses, contaminated and potentially contaminated materials, 
poultry products, items that cannot be properly cleaned and 
disinfected (such as manure, litter, and bedding), products of the 
response effort (such as PPE), and products of vaccination

88Critical Activities and Tools
Cleaning and Disinfection
89
Because of ND’s high survival rate on both 
organic and inorganic materials, aggressive 
cleaning and disinfection practices are required 
for control and eradication.
 Cleaning and disinfection are to be conducted 
within 48 hours of the disposal of depopulated 
poultry.
The NAHEMS Guidelines: Cleaning and Disinfection 
contains additional information on cleaning and 
disinfection.
Critical Activities and Tools
Vaccination 
Vaccination using lentogenic (low virulence) vaccines 
is widely practiced in the U.S. poultry industry, 
particularly in broiler breeders, layers, and turkeys.
Vaccination does prevent clinical signs, and can 
thereby mitigate production losses from low 
virulence strains of APMV-1. 
– However, poultry will still shed the virus, and typical 
lentogenic vaccination may not be sufficient to protect 
poultry from a velogenic challenge.

other infected material.
96Critical Activities and Tools
Appraisal and Compensation
 Indemnity is a key component of APHIS’s disease control 
programs in that the promise of fair compensation for 
losses helps to ensure cooperation from the owners of 
affected poultry.
 In an ND outbreak, ordering the destruction of poultry on 
premises that are epidemiologically linked to an IP may 
be necessary to ensure that the ND does not spread. 
 The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to pay up 
to 100 percent of the fair market value of the poultry, as 
well as for disposal, cleaning, and disinfection.

6Introduction and Information
Definitions
Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1(APMV-1) is the 
etiologic agent of Newcastle disease (ND) in birds.
APMV-1 viruses that cause ND are either virulent 
(vNDV) or low virulence (loNDV).
In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Newcastle 
Disease (ND) refers to an infection of poultry with 
vNDV.
NDV refers to the virus in general, for example, when 
discussing environmental persistence.

Etiology
8Introduction and Information
 ND is an infection of birds caused by vNDV, an avian 
paramyxovirus serotype-1 (APMV-1). 
 Nine serotypes of avian paramyxovirus have been 
identified. 
– There is one serotype of APMV-1 and six phylogenetic lineages.
 There are three major pathotypes based on virulence: 
– Lentogenic (low virulence viruses), 
– Mesogenic, and 
– Velogenic (virulent viruses). 
o The velogenic viruses are further classified as either neurotropic or 
viscerotropic.

 ND was first identified in England in 1927. 
 The first major outbreak of ND in the United States was 
identified in the early 1970s; this outbreak was 
epidemiologically linked to the transmission of ND from 
infected parrots to commercial poultry.
– The last ND outbreaks in the United States included the States 
of California (2002–2003), Nevada (2003), Arizona (2003), and 
Texas (2003).
– Virulent NDV is endemic in wild cormorants in the United States 
and Canada, but commercial poultry are currently free of 
velogenic isolates.
 Virulent NDV remains endemic in many parts of the 
world, including Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. 
Economic Impact
In 1971, the ND outbreak in the United States 
resulted in the destruction of 12 million birds at a 
cost of $56 million to eradicate the virus in 3 years. 
The 2002–2003 epidemic in the western United 
States resulted in industry losses estimated at $5 
billion, and a direct cost of $160 million to control 
the outbreak.
An ND outbreak in the United States today could 
exceed these economic costs and also result in 
significant disruptions to the U.S. food supply.
10Introduction and Information
Zoonotic Potential
 Virulent NDV can cause infection in humans. 
 This infection is mild and self-limiting.
– It usually causes conjunctivitis but can also result in mild 
influenza-like symptoms. 
 Direct contact with infected birds is the most common 
transmission pathway; it is not transmitted through the 
consumption of poultry products.

 Responders—particularly poultry workers and 
vaccination crews—should be protected from the virus 
through appropriate health and safety measures and 
personal protective equipment (PPE).
11Introduction and Information
Susceptible Species
More than 250 avian species can be infected with 
NDV. The most severely affected avian species are 
typically Galliformes, an order that includes:
– chickens,
– guinea fowl,
– peafowl,
– pheasant, and
– quail.
Turkeys can be infected, but usually present less 
severe clinical signs than chickens.
12Introduction and Information

Reservoirs
Wild birds and waterfowl can be reservoirs for NDV.
Upon transmission to domestic poultry, these strains 
may mutate into more virulent viruses. 
In addition, some psittacine species may shed virus 
for extended periods of time (several months to a 
year) but may not show clinical signs.

but can cause acute respiratory and neurologic signs.
 Velogenic strains cause severe disease, particularly in 
chickens.
Gross Pathological Lesions
 Only velogenic strains will result in significant gross 
lesions.
 Lesions can be variable within neurotropic and 
viscerotropic forms. In general, velogenic gross lesions 
may include the following:
– Swelling of the periorbital area or head,
– Edema of the interstitial or peritracheal neck tissue,
– Petechiae and small ecchymoses on the mucosa of the 
proventriculus,
– Necrosis, ulcerations, or hemorrhages of respiratory, digestive, 
or lymphoid tissue, and
– Enlarged spleen.
19Introduction and Information
Differential Diagnosis
Virulent NDV can resemble 
– highly pathogenic avian influenza (caused by 
influenzavirus A), 
– laryngotracheitis (caused by infectious 
laryngotracheitis virus), 
– psittacosis (caused by Chlamydophila psittaci), 
mycoplasmosis (caused by mycoplasma 
gallisepticum), 
– and fowl cholera (caused by Pasturella spp.).

quickly as possible;
– eradicate ND using strategies that seek to protect public 
health and the environment, and stabilize animal 
agriculture, the food supply, and the economy; and
– provide science- and risk-based approaches and systems to 
facilitate continuity of business for non-infected animals 
and non-contaminated animal products.

Definition
“Stamping-out” is defined in the OIE Terrestrial Animal 
Health Code as the “killing of animals which are 
affected and those suspected of being affected in the 
herd and, where appropriate, those in other herds 
which have been exposed to infection by direct animal 
to animal contact, or by indirect contact with the causal 
pathogen; this includes all susceptible animals, 
vaccinated or unvaccinated, on infected 
establishments.”
53Response Goals and Strategy
Stamping-Out
Critical Goals
 Within 24 hours of (or as soon as possible after) a premises 
being classified as an Infected Premises (IP), infected poultry 
will be depopulated in the quickest, safest, and most humane 
way possible. In many cases, poultry on Contact Premises (CP) 
may also be depopulated as soon as possible.
 Where resources are limited, premises will be prioritized so 
that those with the highest potential for active ND spread are 
‘stamped-out’ first.
 Based on the epidemiology of the outbreak, prioritizing the 
poultry to depopulate first may be necessary.
 Public concerns about stamping-out require a well-planned 
and proactive public relations and liaison campaign. 
Stakeholders, the public, and the international community 
must be involved.

Assessing a Possible Outbreak
 During the investigation of premises suspected of having 
ND, animal health responders use clinical signs, history, 
and professional judgment to determine the likelihood 
that ND exists on the premises. This assessment includes
– a history of clinical and epidemiological findings,
– results of physical examinations,
– necropsy findings,
– specimen collection and submission to an approved laboratory,
– reporting, and
– initiating appropriate control measures.
56Response Goals and Strategy
Authorization for Response 
and Associated Activities
When the criteria for a presumptive ND case have been 
met, the APHIS Administrator or VS Deputy 
Administrator (Chief Veterinary Officer [CVO] of the 
United States) can authorize APHIS personnel—in 
conjunction with State, Tribal, and IC personnel—to 
initiate depopulation, cleaning and disinfection 
procedures of the index case and investigation of 
Contact Premises (CP).
57Response Goals and Strategy
Management of Incident
 The outbreak response effort should be implemented 
through ICS with an appropriate span of control and 
delegation of authority.
 An Incident Commander should be identified and an ICP 
established.
 In-State resources (whether Federal, State, Tribal, local, 
or privately owned) should be used to manage a local

Closed Flocks
To the fullest extent possible, close the flock to the 
introduction of new poultry (with population 
increases occurring only from offspring).
If closing a flock is not possible, isolate newly 
purchased poultry (from the 
healthiest possible sources) and those returning 
from existing flocks for 30 days or more.
Vaccination status of introduced poultry should be
known.

Quarantine and Movement Control
 By restricting the movement of infected animals, animal 
products, and contaminated fomites, quarantine and 
movement control can be a powerful tool in controlling 
and eradicating an ND outbreak.
 Movement control is accomplished through a permit 
system that allows entities to 
make necessary movements 
without creating an 
unacceptable risk of disease 
spread. 
– EMRS  2.0 is the system of
record for these movements.

Continuity of Business
 Continuity of business is the management of non-IP and non-
contaminated animal products in the event of an ND 
outbreak.
 This helps agriculture and food industries facilitate routine 
business, or a return to business, during a disease response, 
while the risk of disease spread and threat to public health is 
effectively managed.
86
Critical Activities and Tools
Mass Depopulation and Euthanasia
Poultry on an IP will be depopulated as soon as 
possible after declaration of an ND outbreak.
Poultry on CP may also be depopulated as soon as 
possible after the premises are classified as CP.
The NAHEMS Guidelines: Mass Depopulation and 
Euthanasia contains additional information on 
euthanasia and mass depopulation.
87Critical Activities and Tools
Disposal
 Appropriate disposal of animal carcasses and materials is a critical 
component of a successful ND response.
 The Disposal SOP discusses how to dispose of thousands of bird 
carcasses, contaminated and potentially contaminated materials, 
poultry products, items that cannot be properly cleaned and 
disinfected (such as manure, litter, and bedding), products of the 
response effort (such as PPE), and products of vaccination 
response. 
 Disposal will occur as soon as possible after flock depopulation.

asses, contaminated and potentially contaminated materials, 
poultry products, items that cannot be properly cleaned and 
disinfected (such as manure, litter, and bedding), products of the 
response effort (such as PPE), and products of vaccination 
response. 
 Disposal will occur as soon as possible after flock depopulation.
The NAHEMS Guidelines: Disposal also contains further guidance on 
disposal activities.
88Critical Activities and Tools
Cleaning and Disinfection
89
Because of ND’s high survival rate on both 
organic and inorganic materials, aggressive 
cleaning and disinfection practices are required 
for control and eradication.
 Cleaning and disinfection are to be conducted 
within 48 hours of the disposal of depopulated 
poultry.
The NAHEMS Guidelines: Cleaning and Disinfection 
contains additional information on cleaning and 
disinfection.
Critical Activities and Tools
Vaccination 
Vaccination using lentogenic (low virulence) vaccines 
is widely practiced in the U.S. poultry industry, 
particularly in broiler breeders, layers, and turkeys.
Vaccination does prevent clinical signs, and can 
thereby mitigate production losses from low 
virulence strains of APMV-1. 
– However, poultry will still shed the virus, and typical 
lentogenic vaccination may not be sufficient to protect 
poultry from a velogenic challenge.

90Critical Activities and Tools
Deciding to Vaccinate for ND
 Probability that the disease can or 
cannot be rapidly contained;
 Proximity of high-value genetic 
birds to the rapidly spreading 
disease focal point;
 Risk of infection of valuable, rare, 
or endangered nondomestic 
species;
 Poultry density in an area;
 Increased risk of introduction due 
to the presence of ND in 
neighboring countries;
 The extent to which disease is 
found in waterfowl, other wild 
birds, backyard flocks, or in live 
bird markets;
 Availability of physical and human 
resources;
 Sociopolitical factors (public 
confidence in commercial poultry 
products);
 Impact on international trade; and
 Economic consequences of failure 
to control the disease.

Wildlife Management and Vector Control
Wildlife surveillance and management must be 
conducted by persons trained and proficient in 
wildlife health, capture, collection, biosecurity, and 
restraint.
ND can be transmitted mechanically by mice, 
vultures, and other vectors. 
Appropriate biosecurity measures should be in place 
during an ND outbreak to ensure that mechanical 
vectors do not have contact with infected flocks or 
other infected material.
96Critical Activities and Tools
Appraisal and Compensation
 Indemnity is a key component of APHIS’s disease control 
programs in that the promise of fair compensation for 
losses helps to ensure cooperation from the owners of 
affected poultry.
 In an ND outbreak, ordering the destruction of poultry on 
premises that are epidemiologically linked to an IP may 
be necessary to ensure that the ND does not spread. 
 The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to pay up 
to 100 percent of the fair market value of the poultry, as 
well as for disposal, cleaning, and disinfection.
97Critical Activities and Tools
Finance
During an ND outbreak, funding may be rapidly 
required. For responding to specific emergency 
situations, VS has access to a variety of sources for 
funding. The two most common sources are the 
APHIS Contingency Fund (CF) and the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC).

Surveillance for Recognition 
of Disease Freedom
Surveillance is fundamental in proving DF to regain 
disease-free status after an ND outbreak.
The OIE does not grant official recognition for ND-
freedom, but as a member of the OIE, the United 
States can self-declare a compartment, zone, or the 
country free from certain OIE-listed diseases such as 
ND.
100Recovery after an Outbreak
Release of Quarantine and 
Movement Control
Quarantine and movement control restrictions are 
maintained until at least 21 days have elapsed since 
the decontamination of all confirmed IP and negative 
results of surveillance activities.
101Recovery after an Outbreak

Repopulation
Following official approval of cleaning and 
disinfection procedures, IP will remain vacant for a 
minimum of 21 days to ensure that any residual virus 
has been eliminated. 
This period may be decreased if external heat is used 
to raise the temperature of the houses sufficiently to 
inactivate any residual virus in a shorter period.
Source flocks for all introduced poultry must test 
negative through rRT-PCR and other diagnostics, as 
determined by IC.
