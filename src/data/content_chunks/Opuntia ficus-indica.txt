 5-7 m with a crown of over 3 m in diameter and a trunk up to 1 m in diameter. Cladodes (flat stem segments) are green to blue-green, whereas the terminal cladodes are always bright green and produce the flowers and new growth. Large pads (cladodes) bear few spines to 2.5 cm or are completely spineless. Cladodes are obovate to oblong, 20-60 cm long and 10-40 cm wide, generally a half to two-thirds as broad as long. Glochids (spines) are yellow, numerous, caducous, or may not be present in older plants and some cultivars. Basal cladodes become woody with age. Small to large, raised and wooly areoles, which can number a few hundred per cladode, generally produce only one flower each (PROTA, 2023). Flowers form at the apex of the cladodes, yellow or orange, cup-shaped, 6-7 cm long by 5-7 cm across. Flowers with broadly cylindrical hypanthium, contracted below, with numerous raised areoles spirally arranged, densely wooly and filled with glochidia which occasionally also bear small spines and minute leaves (Orwa et al., 2009). The fruit is oblong, 5-10 cm long by 4-9 cm across, green at first ripening to yellow, orange, red or purple in colour depending on the variety. Fruit is succulent and edible. The number of ovules and hence possible seeds is 150-400 (Janick and Paull, 2008). Seeds are pale yellow to tan or grey and about 5 mm long (PROTA, 2023). They are generally circular to reniform, flattened (discoid) to subspheric, angular to squarish, sometimes warped, glabrous and commonly with 1-4 large shallow depressions due to pressures from adjacent developing seeds

 Reproduccion: The genetic history of many domesticated plants is difficult to unravel and O. ficus-indica is no exception. This and many similar species in Mexico show great phenotypic variability, especially in rural home gardens where man has been cross-breeding and selecting types for his specific needs. This variability of domesticated and wild populations arose via natural hybridization and selection associated with polyploidy and geographic isolation ( Gibson and Nobel, 1986 ). These varieties further reproduced by self-fertilization, fraternal crossing with sister plants or the original parent giving rise to further variation ( Grant and Grant, 1979 ). During the early stages of domestication, phenotypes with higher ploidy levels, vigorous cladodes and bigger fruit were probably preferentially selected and established in gardens and small cultivations ( Pimienta-Barrios and Munoz-Urias, 1995 ).

 the original parent giving rise to further variation ( Grant and Grant, 1979 ). During the early stages of domestication, phenotypes with higher ploidy levels, vigorous cladodes and bigger fruit were probably preferentially selected and established in gardens and small cultivations ( Pimienta-Barrios and Munoz-Urias, 1995 ). It is these selections were probably introduced to Europe and later elsewhere. Cultivated O. ficus-indica plants are all octoploids with 2n=88 chromosomes according to Pimienta-Barrios and Munoz-Urias (1995) , whereas Nobel (2002) notes that cultivated forms may be octoploids (2n=88) or hexaploids (2n=66). Spontaneous forms are either diploid (2n=22) or tetraploid (2n=44) ( Nobel, 2002 ). The ecological successes of O. ficus-indica and other Opuntiae lies mainly in their ability to conserve water. This is done by means of the CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism) photosynthetic pathway which conserves water by nocturnal stomatal opening and by a relatively small stomatal surface area ( Nobel, 1995 ; Nobel and Bobich, 2002 ) while still retaining a high productivity compared to other plants ( Nobel, 1988 ; 1994). In addition, O. ficus-indica is able to store water within its vacuoles in the photosynthetic and parenchyma cells. Further adaptations include the epidermis, a single layer of cells on the outer side of the chlorenchyma and the thick, waxy, waterproof cuticle. Germination and the survival of the young seedling are the critical phases in the phenology of O. ficus-indica . Survival is higher where seedlings are associated with nurse plants for protection.

 the epidermis, a single layer of cells on the outer side of the chlorenchyma and the thick, waxy, waterproof cuticle. Germination and the survival of the young seedling are the critical phases in the phenology of O. ficus-indica . Survival is higher where seedlings are associated with nurse plants for protection. Once the seedlings have reached the 4-cladode stage and have become succulent, survival is considerably increased. Plants originating from seeds take longer to establish and flower than plants from cuttings. Among the main modifications in the course of evolution of Opuntia are the modified stems (cladodes) which have undergone changes towards succulency including increased stomatal frequency, a palisade cortex, a large internal surface area due to extensive intercellular spaces, wood modifications and atypical pith features ( Sudzuki Hills, 1995 ). Very young cladodes produce rudimentary leaves which dehisce within about a week leaving the plant leafless with the cladodes becoming increasingly succulent and taking over the function of leaves. A typical feature of the younger cladodes are the areoles which are the axillary buds imbedded in the epidermis and which give rise to new shoots, flowers and roots from the meristematic tissue. They are distributed over the entire surface of a cladode in a helical pattern. Spines also develop from the basal meristem cells in the areoles and could be either the typical long white ones or the very short ones that occur as clusters inside the cavities of the areoles and are known as glochids (spine hairs). Older cladodes become more woody and the green epidermis is eventually replaced by bark (periderm). These woody stems provide the necessary support that eventually gives rise to the typical shape of an O. ficus-indica tree. O. ficus-indica has a life-span of over

 of the areoles and are known as glochids (spine hairs). Older cladodes become more woody and the green epidermis is eventually replaced by bark (periderm). These woody stems provide the necessary support that eventually gives rise to the typical shape of an O. ficus-indica tree. O. ficus-indica has a life-span of over 80 years. Reproduction is both sexual and vegetative (Pimiento-Barrios and Castillo, 2002). Even a small section of a cladode can root and grow provided there are at least two areoles present. Pieces of a cladode can survive for long periods in extreme conditions waiting for moisture to take root. Asexual reproduction can also be apomyctic when embryogenesis occurs without pollination, and in O. ficus-indica , 10.9 to 18.5% of the seeds are produced by apomyxis ( Mondragon-Jacobo and Pimiento-Barrios, 1995 ). The number of viable seeds per fruit can vary from 177 to 357 with a few aborted seeds present. Although scarification is necessary for germination, the dormancy period is short and maximum germination occurs after 9 months where seeds have been stored at room temperature. Opuntia ficus-indica colonizes well in areas with mild winters usually associated with a prolonged dry spell followed by a hot summer rainfall period of low humidity. This explains in part why O. ficus-indica is less invasive in Mediterranean climates although it has become an important crop in these areas. A mean annual rainfall of 350–500 mm is required for good growth ( Inglese, 1995 ). O. ficus-indica is well adapted to proliferate in a wide range of soils, from sub-acid to sub-alkaline provided the clay content does not exceed 15-20% and the soil is well-drained.

O. ficus-indica is well adapted to proliferate in a wide range of soils, from sub-acid to sub-alkaline provided the clay content does not exceed 15-20% and the soil is well-drained.

Climate Opuntia ficus-indica colonizes well in areas with mild winters usually associated with a prolonged dry spell followed by a hot summer rainfall period of low humidity. This explains in part why O. ficus-indica is less invasive in Mediterranean climates although it has become an important crop in these areas. A mean annual rainfall of 350-500 mm is required for good growth ( Inglese, 1995 ). It is native to regions with a temperate to sub-tropical climate with typical summer rains and cool and dry winters ( Hoffmann, 1995 ). In other parts of the world where O. ficus-indica is invasive, similar climates exist, for example in Eritrea, Ethiopia and the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Although it is now successfully cultivated in several Mediterranean countries, critical moisture shortage can be a limiting factor during the hot and dry summers unless the plantations are irrigated which may explain why the plant has never seriously invaded Mediterranean areas. Its climatic tolerances are wide and it can proliferate in rainfall regimes of 250 to 1200 mm with very hot summers of over 40°C, and cold winters with temperatures frequently falling below 0°C for brief durations ( Houérou, 2002 ). O. ficus-indica does not thrive in tropical situations with constant high humidity or in shady conditions.

The superficial root system allows the plant to grow in shallow soils and explains why O. ficus-indica proliferates on mountain slopes. Plants do not tolerate saline soils but thrive on well-drained soils and because of their superficially spreading root system can proliferate in shallow and rocky substrates. Abandoned agricultural land is ideal for O. ficus-indica invasion. O. ficus-indica establishes well in disturbed savanna, bush and shrub land vegetation but poorly in high rainfall grassland.

 the original parent giving rise to further variation ( Grant and Grant, 1979 ). During the early stages of domestication, phenotypes with higher ploidy levels, vigorous cladodes and bigger fruit were probably preferentially selected and established in gardens and small cultivations ( Pimienta-Barrios and Munoz-Urias, 1995 ). It is these selections were probably introduced to Europe and later elsewhere. Cultivated O. ficus-indica plants are all octoploids with 2n=88 chromosomes according to Pimienta-Barrios and Munoz-Urias (1995) , whereas Nobel (2002) notes that cultivated forms may be octoploids (2n=88) or hexaploids (2n=66). Spontaneous forms are either diploid (2n=22) or tetraploid (2n=44) ( Nobel, 2002 ). The ecological successes of O. ficus-indica and other Opuntiae lies mainly in their ability to conserve water. This is done by means of the CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism) photosynthetic pathway which conserves water by nocturnal stomatal opening and by a relatively small stomatal surface area ( Nobel, 1995 ; Nobel and Bobich, 2002 ) while still retaining a high productivity compared to other plants ( Nobel, 1988 ; 1994). In addition, O. ficus-indica is able to store water within its vacuoles in the photosynthetic and parenchyma cells. Further adaptations include the epidermis, a single layer of cells on the outer side of the chlorenchyma and the thick, waxy, waterproof cuticle. Germination and the survival of the young seedling are the critical phases in the phenology of O. ficus-indica . Survival is higher where seedlings are associated with nurse plants for protection.

 the epidermis, a single layer of cells on the outer side of the chlorenchyma and the thick, waxy, waterproof cuticle. Germination and the survival of the young seedling are the critical phases in the phenology of O. ficus-indica . Survival is higher where seedlings are associated with nurse plants for protection. Once the seedlings have reached the 4-cladode stage and have become succulent, survival is considerably increased. Plants originating from seeds take longer to establish and flower than plants from cuttings. Among the main modifications in the course of evolution of Opuntia are the modified stems (cladodes) which have undergone changes towards succulency including increased stomatal frequency, a palisade cortex, a large internal surface area due to extensive intercellular spaces, wood modifications and atypical pith features ( Sudzuki Hills, 1995 ). Very young cladodes produce rudimentary leaves which dehisce within about a week leaving the plant leafless with the cladodes becoming increasingly succulent and taking over the function of leaves. A typical feature of the younger cladodes are the areoles which are the axillary buds imbedded in the epidermis and which give rise to new shoots, flowers and roots from the meristematic tissue. They are distributed over the entire surface of a cladode in a helical pattern. Spines also develop from the basal meristem cells in the areoles and could be either the typical long white ones or the very short ones that occur as clusters inside the cavities of the areoles and are known as glochids (spine hairs). Older cladodes become more woody and the green epidermis is eventually replaced by bark (periderm). These woody stems provide the necessary support that eventually gives rise to the typical shape of an O. ficus-indica tree. O. ficus-indica has a life-span of over

 of the areoles and are known as glochids (spine hairs). Older cladodes become more woody and the green epidermis is eventually replaced by bark (periderm). These woody stems provide the necessary support that eventually gives rise to the typical shape of an O. ficus-indica tree. O. ficus-indica has a life-span of over 80 years. Reproduction is both sexual and vegetative (Pimiento-Barrios and Castillo, 2002). Even a small section of a cladode can root and grow provided there are at least two areoles present. Pieces of a cladode can survive for long periods in extreme conditions waiting for moisture to take root. Asexual reproduction can also be apomyctic when embryogenesis occurs without pollination, and in O. ficus-indica , 10.9 to 18.5% of the seeds are produced by apomyxis ( Mondragon-Jacobo and Pimiento-Barrios, 1995 ). The number of viable seeds per fruit can vary from 177 to 357 with a few aborted seeds present. Although scarification is necessary for germination, the dormancy period is short and maximum germination occurs after 9 months where seeds have been stored at room temperature. Opuntia ficus-indica colonizes well in areas with mild winters usually associated with a prolonged dry spell followed by a hot summer rainfall period of low humidity. This explains in part why O. ficus-indica is less invasive in Mediterranean climates although it has become an important crop in these areas. A mean annual rainfall of 350–500 mm is required for good growth ( Inglese, 1995 ). O. ficus-indica is well adapted to proliferate in a wide range of soils, from sub-acid to sub-alkaline provided the clay content does not exceed 15-20% and the soil is well-drained.

O. ficus-indica is well adapted to proliferate in a wide range of soils, from sub-acid to sub-alkaline provided the clay content does not exceed 15-20% and the soil is well-drained.

Climate Opuntia ficus-indica colonizes well in areas with mild winters usually associated with a prolonged dry spell followed by a hot summer rainfall period of low humidity. This explains in part why O. ficus-indica is less invasive in Mediterranean climates although it has become an important crop in these areas. A mean annual rainfall of 350-500 mm is required for good growth ( Inglese, 1995 ). It is native to regions with a temperate to sub-tropical climate with typical summer rains and cool and dry winters ( Hoffmann, 1995 ). In other parts of the world where O. ficus-indica is invasive, similar climates exist, for example in Eritrea, Ethiopia and the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Although it is now successfully cultivated in several Mediterranean countries, critical moisture shortage can be a limiting factor during the hot and dry summers unless the plantations are irrigated which may explain why the plant has never seriously invaded Mediterranean areas. Its climatic tolerances are wide and it can proliferate in rainfall regimes of 250 to 1200 mm with very hot summers of over 40°C, and cold winters with temperatures frequently falling below 0°C for brief durations ( Houérou, 2002 ). O. ficus-indica does not thrive in tropical situations with constant high humidity or in shady conditions.

The superficial root system allows the plant to grow in shallow soils and explains why O. ficus-indica proliferates on mountain slopes. Plants do not tolerate saline soils but thrive on well-drained soils and because of their superficially spreading root system can proliferate in shallow and rocky substrates. Abandoned agricultural land is ideal for O. ficus-indica invasion. O. ficus-indica establishes well in disturbed savanna, bush and shrub land vegetation but poorly in high rainfall grassland.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics The genetic history of many domesticated plants is difficult to unravel and O. ficus-indica is no exception. This and many similar species in Mexico show great phenotypic variability, especially in rural home gardens where man has been cross-breeding and selecting types for his specific needs. This variability of domesticated and wild populations arose via natural hybridization and selection associated with polyploidy and geographic isolation ( Gibson and Nobel, 1986 ). These varieties further reproduced by self-fertilization, fraternal crossing with sister plants or the original parent giving rise to further variation ( Grant and Grant, 1979 ). During the early stages of domestication, phenotypes with higher ploidy levels, vigorous cladodes and bigger fruit were probably preferentially selected
