Leonticaceae S.M.H. JAFRI Herbarium, Department of Botany, University of Karachi, Karachi. Leontice eversmannii Illustration Credit: Azmat Fleshy or subfleshy perennial herbs, usually with tuberous rhizomes. Leaves ternate or pinnate, glabrous, glaucous, petiolate. Inflorescence simple or branched racemes, terminal or axillary. Flowers regular, hermaphrodite. Sepals 3-6 (-9), often caducous and petaloid. Petals 6, longer than sepals or much reduced, nectariform, or scale-like, flat or convolute, rarely absent. Stamens 6; anthers much shorter than filaments, dehiscing by 2 valves, not exserted. Ovary monocarpellary, 1-locular with 2-8 erect basal ovules; style short or inconspicuous with a small or plicate-dilated stigma. Pedicel often elongated, somewhat thickened in fruit. Capsule inflated, somewhat membranous or scarious, indehiscent, irregularly gaping above, or the walls evanescent exposing the large seeds; seeds often blackish with copious endosperm and small embryo. A small family of 3 genera and about a dozen species chiefly in S.E. Europe and Asia; only 2 genera with 1 species each, occur in W. Pakistan. A segregate from Podophyllaceae from which it differs primarily by its tuberous rhizomes, ternate or pinnate leaves, inflated membranous or scarious fruits and basal placentation.
