Senecio vulgaris var. hibernicusSyme - groundsel  -Compositae / Asteraceae(Map updated: March 2008)Groundsel is normally unrayed i.e. its flower heads have no ligulate florets. This variety is distinguished by having small ligulate florets around the edge of the flower heads, and appears to have increased over the past century or so. There seems to be a link in its distribution both with railways and the coast. The rays or ligulate florets may have been acquired fromSenecio viscosus(sticky groundsel) by interbreeding between the two species.All names:Senecio vulgaris var. hibernicusSymeNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
