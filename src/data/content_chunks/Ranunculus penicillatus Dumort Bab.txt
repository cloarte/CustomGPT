Ranunculus penicillatus(Dumort.) Bab. - Stream Water-crowfoot  -Ranunculaceae© Neville McKee© Neville McKee© Ralph Forbes(Map updated: March 2008)© Ian DodkinsThis is the commonest and one of the most robust water-crowfoots. It is very frequent in quite fast-flowing rivers or streams, rooted to the stream bed but with long branching stems swept out by the water current. Often it will form dense and very conspicuous beds, and when in full flower, is very attractive in appearance.Flowers are white (or very pale pink), somewhat larger than all other water-crowfoots. Leaves are either finely dissected if submerged, or rounded and lobed. Individual plants will normally carry both kinds of leaf at time of flowering (May to August).Sometimes not easily distinguished fromRanunculus peltatus.All names:Ranunculus penicillatus(Dumort.) Bab.;Ranunculus aquatilis ssp. pseudofluitans(Syme) Chapman;Ranunculus pseudofluitans(Syme) Newbouldex Bak. & FoggittNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
