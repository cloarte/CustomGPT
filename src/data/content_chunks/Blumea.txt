Blumea lacera
L., Compositae, is one of the common rabi weeds of India 
(Oudhia and Tripathi 1999a). It is an annual herb, with a strong odor of 
turpentine. Stem is erect, ash colored, densely glandular, pubescent. Leaves are 
often incised or lyrate. There are many flower heads in single plant, arranged 
in axillary cymes or terminal panicle. Pappus is white. Fruits is an achene, 
oblong and not ribbed. Flowering time January to April (Agharkar 1991).
The plant occurs throughout the plains of India from the north-west ascending 
to 2,000 ft in the Himalayas. It is a common roadside weed in Ceylon and Malaya. 
It is distributed to the Malay Islands, Australia, China and Tropical Africa.
Blumea
consists of about 80 species (Caius 1986).
Blumea lacera
competes with rabi crops such as linseed, chickpea, and wheat for light, food 
and moisture (Oudhia, 1997) and harbors diseases and insects such as
Euplexia 
dolorosa
,
Eublemma trifasiciata
(Lefroy, 1909).

Euplexia 
dolorosa
,
Eublemma trifasiciata
(Lefroy, 1909).
Blumea lacera
is described as a valuable medicinal plant in many popular systems of medicine 
including
Ayurveda
, homoeopathy, and unani. Stimulatory allelopathy of 
different parts of
B. lacera
on many agricultural crops has also been 
reported (Oudhia 1996). Not much work has been done on various utility aspects 
of
B. lacera
. In many parts of India,
Blumea
is cultivated for its 
green leaves and roots.
Blumea
is late kharif crop in these parts (Oudhia 
and Tripathi 1999b)
Reported Uses
Blumea
is described in
Ayurveda
as bitter, astringent, acrid, 
thermogenic, errhine, anti-inflammatory, styptic, opthalmic, digestive, 
anthelmintic, liver tonic, expectorant, febrifuge, antipyretic, diuretic, 
deobstruant, and stimulant (Warner et al. 1996). The root kept in the mouth is 
said to cure disease of the mouth. In the Konkan region of India, the plant is 
used to drive away fleas and other insects. It is prescribed as an antiscorbutic 
in West Africa (Caius 1986). Essential oil from

said to cure disease of the mouth. In the Konkan region of India, the plant is 
used to drive away fleas and other insects. It is prescribed as an antiscorbutic 
in West Africa (Caius 1986). Essential oil from
Blumea
has been shown 
analgesic, hypothermic, and tranquilizing activities (Anonymous 1972). 
Campestrol has been isolated from aerial parts and 5-hydroxy-3, 6, 7, 3',4'- 
pentamethoxy flavone, 5,3',4' trihydroxy flavone and an unidentified flavone 
have been isolated from leaves (Rastogi and Mehrotra 1991).
Blumea lacera
is considered a valuable homoeopathic drug (Oudhia et al. 1998a) useful in case 
of enuresis, neuralgia, headache, cold borne cough. A tincture is useful in case 
of bleeding piles (Ghosh 1988). Natives of Chhattisgarh use this weed for 
treating health problems (Oudhia et al. 1998b). There is a heavy demand of 
different parts (fresh and dry both) of this weed in national and international 
drug markets (Oudhia and Tripathi 1999c). Farmers can earn extra income after 
selling various parts of
Blumea
with the help of co-operatives (Oudhia 
and Traipathi 1999d). Fresh leaves of
Blumea
are the most valuable 
part.
Stimulatory allelopathy of

Stimulatory allelopathy of
B. lacera
on many agricultural crops such

kharif obnoxious weeds such as
Echinocloa colonum

Chenopodium album
,
Melilotus

,

Cirsium arvense
, and
Spilanthes
(Oudhia et al. 1997a)
Cultivation
Blumea is a late kharif crop. Standard agrotechniques have not been 
developed. Seeds are generally sown in late August on prepared land with good 
tilth; fertilizers are not used. Leaves are harvested at time of 50% flowering. 
Blumea leaf beetle (
Chrysolina madrasae
Jackoby) is the main insect pest 
(Oudhia 1989, 1997, 1999a,b,c,d; Oudhia & Thakur 1996).
