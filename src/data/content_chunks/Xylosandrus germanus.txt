Elytra 1.5 times as long as wide, striae and interstriae seriate-punctate, the punctures larger on the disc than at the sides; declivity less convex, impressed along apico-lateral margins. Egg: White, translucent, shiny, ellipsoidal, about 0.67 mm long and 0.38 mm wide (Hoffmann, 1941).Larva: The larva is described by Weber (1982; seeWeber and McPherson, 1982). There is a photograph of a larva inHoffmann (1941). There are three larval instars (Weber and McPherson, 1983c).Pupa: The pupa has not been described.

 Reproduccion: Life Cycle The important pest species in the genus Xylosandrus and the related genera Euwallacea, Xyleborinus and Xyleborus are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. All are closely associated with symbiotic ambrosia fungi, which are transported by the female, and form the sole food for both adult and larvae. Studies of the biology and life cycle of X. germanus have been made by Kaneko et al. (1965) , Kaneko et al. (1965) and Kaneko and Takagi (1966) in Japan, Hoffmann (1941) , Schneider and Farrier (1969) , Weber and McPherson (1983c) , and Oliver and Mannion (2001) in the USA, and in Europe by Groschke (1953) , Gauss (1960) , Heidenreich (1960, 1964) and Peer and Taborsky (2004, 2005). The species is not strongly size-selective, and breeds both in small branches and in large logs and stumps. There may be some preference for stems of less than 10 cm diameter ( Henin and Versteirt, 2004 ). In Japan, X. germanus also attacks the roots of tea ( Kaneko et al., 1965 ). In small stems, an entrance tunnel cut into the pith or wood is extended into a longitudinal tunnel or an irregular chamber.

 of less than 10 cm diameter ( Henin and Versteirt, 2004 ). In Japan, X. germanus also attacks the roots of tea ( Kaneko et al., 1965 ). In small stems, an entrance tunnel cut into the pith or wood is extended into a longitudinal tunnel or an irregular chamber. In larger stems, the gallery may branch once or twice in the transverse plane, with a brood chamber in the longitudinal plane, but not penetrating far into the wood. The female feeds on the ambrosia fungus, Ambrosiella hartigii, which she has introduced into the gallery system before oviposition begins. The eggs are laid loosely in the gallery over some days, and the larvae feed on the ambrosia fungus on the walls of the gallery. The size of the brood varies considerably. Broods from 1 to 54 individuals have been found, with an average of about 16 ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ; Weber and McPherson, 1983c ). Pupation and mating of brood adults occurs within the gallery system, the (usually) single male in each gallery mating with his sisters. The new generation of females emerges through the entrance hole made by the parent. It is usually considered that the males of xyleborine ambrosia beetles do not emerge from the gallery system (e.g. Kirkendall, 1993 ), but Peer and Taborsky (2004) have shown that some males of X. germanus do disperse locally (by walking because they are flightless) to seek additional matings. Total development time from egg to adult is about 25 days at 24°C in the laboratory ( Weber and McPherson, 1983c ), but in the field in the temperate zone summer, about 55-60 days is required from gallery initiation to emergence of a new generation ( Oliver and Mannion, 2001 ).

Genetics X. germanus, like other xyleborines ( Jordal et al., 2000 ), has diploid females and haploid males ( Takagi and Kaneko, 1966 ). The diploid number of chromsomes is 16, the haploid number 8 ( Takagi and Kaneko, 1966 ). Unmated females produce only haploid male offspring; mated females lay eggs with a sex ratio of about 9 females: 1 male, and produce adults with the same sex ratio ( Takagi and Kaneko, 1966 ). Phenology The number of generations per year depends primarily on environmental temperatures. In its native range in Japan, there are one or two generations per year ( Kaneko et al., 1965 ), in central Europe one generation ( Bruge, 1995 ; Henin and Versteirt, 2004 ), but in Italy usually two ( Faccoli, 2000 ), and in the USA (North Carolina to Illinois) two generations per year (Weber and McPherson, 1983). The optimum range of temperature for development is 21-23°C ( Kaneko et al., 1965 ). The flight period of the adults is usually between April and August, but may extend into March and September ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ; Weber and McPherson, 1991 ). Adults overwinter in the host plants, often clustering in galleries ( Hoffmann, 1941 ; Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ; Weber and McPherson, 1983).

Environmental Requirements The biotic and abiotic factors that could affect the distribution of the species are discussed by Henin and Versteirt (2004) , and it is concluded that climatic conditions, particularly winter temperatures, play a crucial role - at least in limiting its northward spread. The reasons for the absence of the species from more tropical regions are unknown. Associations X. germanus is often found together with other species of scolytid ambrosia beetles in the same trees, e.g. together with Xylosandrus compactus on tea ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ); Xylosandrus crassiusculus on black walnut ( Oliver and Mannion, 2001 ); Ambrosiodmus apicalis on apple ( National Horticultural Research Institute, 2002 ); Xyleborus (Anisandrus) dispar on grapevine ( Boll et al., 2005 ). The distributions of the species on the host tree may differ, for example, in Japan, X. germanus attacks mainly the roots of tea, X. compactus the stems ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ). These additional attacks add to the detrimental effect on the host plants.

Associations X. germanus is often found together with other species of scolytid ambrosia beetles in the same trees, e.g. together with Xylosandrus compactus on tea ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ); Xylosandrus crassiusculus on black walnut ( Oliver and Mannion, 2001 ); Ambrosiodmus apicalis on apple ( National Horticultural Research Institute, 2002 ); Xyleborus (Anisandrus) dispar on grapevine ( Boll et al., 2005 ). The distributions of the species on the host tree may differ, for example, in Japan, X. germanus attacks mainly the roots of tea, X. compactus the stems ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ). These additional attacks add to the detrimental effect on the host plants.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Life Cycle The important pest species in the genus Xylosandrus and the related genera Euwallacea, Xyleborinus and Xyleborus are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. All are closely associated with symbiotic ambrosia fungi, which are transported by the female, and form the sole food for both adult and larvae. Studies of the biology and life cycle of X. germanus have been made by Kaneko et al. (1965) , Kaneko et al. (1965) and Kaneko and Takagi (1966) in Japan, Hoffmann (1941) , Schneider and Farrier (1969) , Weber and McPherson (1983c) , and Oliver and Mannion (2001) in the USA, and in Europe by Groschke (1953) , Gauss (1960) , Heidenreich (1960, 1964) and Peer and Taborsky (2004, 2005). The species is not strongly size-selective, and breeds both in small branches and in large logs and stumps. There may be some preference for stems of less than 10 cm diameter ( Henin and Versteirt, 2004 ). In Japan, X. germanus also attacks the roots of tea ( Kaneko et al., 1965 ). In small stems, an entrance tunnel cut into the pith or wood is extended into a longitudinal tunnel or an irregular chamber. In larger stems, the gallery may branch once or twice in the transverse plane, with a brood chamber in the longitudinal plane, but not penetrating far into the wood. The female feeds on the ambrosia fungus, Ambrosiella hartig

 al., 1965 ). In small stems, an entrance tunnel cut into the pith or wood is extended into a longitudinal tunnel or an irregular chamber. In larger stems, the gallery may branch once or twice in the transverse plane, with a brood chamber in the longitudinal plane, but not penetrating far into the wood. The female feeds on the ambrosia fungus, Ambrosiella hartigii, which she has introduced into the gallery system before oviposition begins. The eggs are laid loosely in the gallery over some days, and the larvae feed on the ambrosia fungus on the walls of the gallery. The size of the brood varies considerably. Broods from 1 to 54 individuals have been found, with an average of about 16 ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ; Weber and McPherson, 1983c ). Pupation and mating of brood adults occurs within the gallery system, the (usually) single male in each gallery mating with his sisters. The new generation of females emerges through the entrance hole made by the parent. It is usually considered that the males of xyleborine ambrosia beetles do not emerge from the gallery system (e.g. Kirkendall, 1993 ), but Peer and Taborsky (2004) have shown that some males of X. germanus do disperse locally (by walking because they are flightless) to seek additional matings. Total development time from egg to adult is about 25 days at 24°C in the laboratory ( Weber and McPherson, 1983c ), but in the field in the temperate zone summer, about 55-60 days is required from gallery initiation to emergence of a new generation ( Oliver and Mannion, 2001 ). Genetics X. germanus, like other xyleborines ( Jordal et al., 2000 ), has diploid females and haploid males ( Takagi and Kaneko, 1966 ). The diploid number of chromsomes is 16

 temperate zone summer, about 55-60 days is required from gallery initiation to emergence of a new generation ( Oliver and Mannion, 2001 ). Genetics X. germanus, like other xyleborines ( Jordal et al., 2000 ), has diploid females and haploid males ( Takagi and Kaneko, 1966 ). The diploid number of chromsomes is 16, the haploid number 8 ( Takagi and Kaneko, 1966 ). Unmated females produce only haploid male offspring; mated females lay eggs with a sex ratio of about 9 females: 1 male, and produce adults with the same sex ratio ( Takagi and Kaneko, 1966 ). Phenology The number of generations per year depends primarily on environmental temperatures. In its native range in Japan, there are one or two generations per year ( Kaneko et al., 1965 ), in central Europe one generation ( Bruge, 1995 ; Henin and Versteirt, 2004 ), but in Italy usually two ( Faccoli, 2000 ), and in the USA (North Carolina to Illinois) two generations per year (Weber and McPherson, 1983). The optimum range of temperature for development is 21-23°C ( Kaneko et al., 1965 ). The flight period of the adults is usually between April and August, but may extend into March and September ( Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ; Weber and McPherson, 1991 ). Adults overwinter in the host plants, often clustering in galleries ( Hoffmann, 1941 ; Kaneko and Takagi, 1966 ; Weber and McPherson, 1983).
