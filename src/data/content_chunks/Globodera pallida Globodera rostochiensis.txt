1. Introduction 
 
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the United States Department of Agriculture Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) are the National Plant Protection Organizations 
(NPPO) of their respective countries. These guidelines (hereafter referred to as “the Guidelines”) on 
Surveillance and Phytosanitary Actions for Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida, also referred 
to as Potato Cyst Nematodes (PCN), were developed by both organizations in consultation with 
stakeholders from both countries to: 
 
Outline the phytosanitary measures to be taken on the detection of PCN. 
Provide guidance to the NPPOs on long term management and/or release of fields in regulated 
areas. 
   Establish the requirements for the movement of seed potatoes and other regulated articles 
between the two countries. 
 
The Guidelines are intended to ensure predictable and equivalent science-based phytosanitary 
actions in both countries. The establishment of risk-based regulatory controls and processes for the 
movement of regulated articles is intended to prevent the spread of PCN. 
 
The Guidelines were developed in accordance with the principles

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 other regulated articles 
between the two countries. 
 
The Guidelines are intended to ensure predictable and equivalent science-based phytosanitary 
actions in both countries. The establishment of risk-based regulatory controls and processes for the 
movement of regulated articles is intended to prevent the spread of PCN. 
 
The Guidelines were developed in accordance with the principles of the International Plant 
Protection Convention (IPPC) and the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of 
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The Guidelines also take into account recommendations of 
an Independent International Science Panel consisting of scientists with direct knowledge and 
experience with PCN and the recommendations of potato industry stakeholders including the 
National Potato Council and the Canadian Horticultural Council – Canadian Potato Council, as well 
as the views of the U.S. National Plant Board.  Relevant terms are defined by the IPPC unless 
otherwise noted in Appendix 1. 
 
2. Rationale for phytosanitary actions 
 
Potato Cyst Nematodes are considered quarantine pests for Canada and the United States. Existing 
evidence indicates that these pests are not widely distributed in Canada and the United States. 
Where present in the United States and Canada they are of limited distribution and under official 
control. 
 
PCNs are long-lived soil-borne pests that are difficult to detect at very low populations with cysts 
containing viable eggs known to survive decades in the soil. Once PCN is present, there is no quick, 
economical and effective treatment.  Control of PCN is difficult and requires integrated approaches 
that utilize phytosanitary measures including ongoing surveillance and testing, treatment 
(nematicides), and the adoption of cultural practices (e.g. crop rotation, use of resistant varieties, trap

 in the soil. Once PCN is present, there is no quick, 
economical and effective treatment.  Control of PCN is difficult and requires integrated approaches 
that utilize phytosanitary measures including ongoing surveillance and testing, treatment 
(nematicides), and the adoption of cultural practices (e.g. crop rotation, use of resistant varieties, trap 
cropping, and host avoidance). 
 
The movement of seed potatoes and other articles with soil presents the highest risk for the 
movement of these pests.  Appropriate surveillance and regulatory controls are essential to 
minimize the risk of PCN spread.

3. Soil sampling and laboratory analysis procedures 
 
CFIA and USDA-APHIS officials have agreed on harmonized soil sampling and laboratory 
analysis procedures in keeping with internationally recognized standards. All soil samples are to 
be officially collected and submitted to and processed by NPPO-recognized laboratories. 
 
When applicable, the NPPO will provide the procedures used for PCN delimiting and detection 
surveys to stakeholders and co- operators. 
 
 
4. Phytosanitary measures 
 
In response to a new PCN detection, the procedures in Appendix 5 must be used to confirm a PCN 
infestation within a field where cysts were detected. The NPPO will also initiate immediate 
phytosanitary measures to prevent potential PCN spread to non-infested areas. These actions will 
include the steps below: 
 
4.1 Fields where PCN infestation is confirmed 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from the infested field .  
2. NPPO and cooperators will investigate any historical movement of the regulated articles that 

Text Len: 1674
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 potential PCN spread to non-infested areas. These actions will 
include the steps below: 
 
4.1 Fields where PCN infestation is confirmed 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from the infested field .  
2. NPPO and cooperators will investigate any historical movement of the regulated articles that 
may have been associated with the infested field in order to identify potentially exposed 
fields. 
3. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from all fields identified as adjacent or 
exposed to the infested field. 
4. The adjacent, exposed and infested fields will make up the initial regulated area and will be 
subject to all sampling and regulatory controls outlined in Section 9. 
5. If the PCN infested field was used for seed potato production, trace forward information must 
be collected for the seed lots produced on the infested field.  The fields planted with seed 
potatoes originating from the last potato crop grown on the infested field must be part of the 
regulated area as exposed fields. 
6. Fields used as seed sources for the infested field will be prioritized for surveys but are not 
necessarily included as part of the regulated area. Seed potato movement from these fields is 
restricted until the surveys of these individual fields have been completed.  
7. Any deregulation of the initial regulated area should occur as outlined in Section 9.  
 
4.2 Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation 
 
In some cases, fields where PCN may have been detected may not immediately be considered 
as infested with PCN (Appendix 5).  Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation are 
considered suspect fields and should be treated as follows: 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5
Text Len: 1765
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation 
 
In some cases, fields where PCN may have been detected may not immediately be considered 
as infested with PCN (Appendix 5).  Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation are 
considered suspect fields and should be treated as follows: 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from the suspect field where the sample 
was collected. 
2. Initiate investigations of any historical movement of the regulated articles that may have 
been associated with the suspect field in order to identify potentially exposed fields. 
3. If a suspect field cannot be confirmed as infested with PCN after following all of the 
procedures outlined in Appendix 5, all phytosanitary measures are removed.  
4. If the suspect field is confirmed as PCN positive, that field as well as adjacent and exposed 
fields will be regulated  and will be subject to all sampling and regulatory controls outlined in 
Section 9.  
 
While the investigation described above is being conducted, the PCN phytosanitary certification 
requirements for seed potatoes traded between the two countries (Section 8) will provide the 
 
Page 5 of 19 
 
necessary safeguards to permit the undisrupted trade of seed potatoes from fields outside of 
the regulated area. 
 
5. Regulated articles 
Regulated articles include, but are not limited to: 
Cysts of Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida; 
Soil; 
PCN host crops; and 
Any other article that could result in the movement of soil or PCN. 
 
Because the principal pathway  of moving PCN is soil associated with equipment, potato tubers, root 
crops, nursery stock or other articles that move soil
Text Len: 1680
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
odera rostochiensis and G. pallida; 
Soil; 
PCN host crops; and 
Any other article that could result in the movement of soil or PCN. 
 
Because the principal pathway  of moving PCN is soil associated with equipment, potato tubers, root 
crops, nursery stock or other articles that move soil, it is important to regulate these articles to 
mitigate potential PCN spread. Equipment and regulated commodities can move from PCN-
regulated areas only after they meet risk mitigation requirements outlined in Table 1, or under 
compliance agreements, as authorized by the respective NPPO. The NPPO, in collaboration with its 
respective partners, is responsible for implementing all necessary regulatory controls within a 
regulated area, for monitoring the effectiveness of such controls, and for ensuring compliance to 
minimize the possibility of spreading PCN. 
 
To initiate regulatory controls and establish regulated areas, Canada will issue individual 
notices of restrictions, ministerial orders and/or regulations. The United States will use a 
combination of emergency action notification, state rules, and federal regulations to create 
a regulated area(s).

Note: There are no specific requirements for articles from outside of a PCN regulated area, 
however, other requirements may apply. 
 
 
6. National PCN detection survey 
 
Canada and the United States will survey a portion of the annual seed potato acreage in each country. 
Land used for seed potato production, including land owned by universities, government or other 
research organizations, should be surveyed as a part of any survey efforts. The recommended 
survey rate is Method B (Appendix 2). 
 
 
7. Pest-free places of production or pest-free production sites within regulated areas 
 
Pest-free places of production (PFPP) and pest-free production sites (PFPS), as described in ISPM 
No. 10, are allowed within regulated areas, on a case by case basis, provided that they maintain a 
compliance agreement with the applicable NPPO.

 be established in the regulated area provided that the criteria 
below are met: 
 
    PCN detection survey and testing has been conducted and found negative using 
minimum of Method A (Appendix 2) if soil is present in the facility; 
Production practices prevent entry of soil from the surrounding fields into the facility; 
Soil-less growing media is used; 
Water used is filtered, treated or from a cased and capped well;

that prevents contact with soil; 
A 4.6 m (5 yd.) perimeter around the site is maintained free of PCN hosts; 
Facility floors are constructed to provide separation from the underlying soil; and 
Equipment is rendered free of soil prior to entry into the facility and when moved outside of 
the regulated area. 
 
7.2. Field-grown plants for planting and propagation 
 
PFPP producing field-grown plants may be established in the regulated area, except in infested 
fields, provided the criteria below are met: 
 
 There is no history of host crop production within the last 10 years; 
 PCN detection survey & testing has been conducted and found negative (using Method A);    
 Ongoing PCN detection survey may be conducted every 36 months (using Method B); and  
 Minimum 4.6 m (5 yd.) buffer around the site is maintained free of PCN hosts. 
 
8. Phytosanitary certification of seed potatoes 
 
To be eligible for phytosanitary export certification, fields used to produce seed potatoes traded 
between Canada and the United States must meet the following conditions:  
 

Text Len: 1594
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.6 m (5 yd.) buffer around the site is maintained free of PCN hosts. 
 
8. Phytosanitary certification of seed potatoes 
 
To be eligible for phytosanitary export certification, fields used to produce seed potatoes traded 
between Canada and the United States must meet the following conditions:  
 
 The field from which the seed potato shipment originates must be sampled following the production 
of a potato crop at a minimum rate of Method B and test negative; or 
 
 A field that has been surveyed two times at a minimum rate of Method B and found negative for 
PCN would be exempt from further PCN surveys for the following three potato crops.  Following the 
exempt period, the field would be subject to an additional survey at a minimum rate of Method B, 
and if found negative, that field would again be exempt for an additional three potato crops. (Note: 
Surveys conducted at a minimum rate of Method B since 2009 count toward the two survey 
requirement.)   
 
These fields must have never had a PCN detection or be under the regulatory controls described in 
Sections 4 and 9.  PCN survey and laboratory testing of the field(s) used to produce the seed potatoes 
identified for export to the other country must be completed prior to the issuance of any phytosanitary 
certificate for the seed potato shipments from that field(s).  
 
Shipments of seed potato samples consisting of 500 tubers or less for trials or research purposes are 
exempt from these requirements, provided the field has been previously surveyed and found negative 
for PCN.   
 
The following additional declaration will appear on phytosanitary certificates associated with 
commercial shipments of seed potatoes traded between Canada

Shipments of seed potato samples consisting of 500 tubers or less for trials or research purposes are 
exempt from these requirements, provided the field has been previously surveyed and found negative 
for PCN.   
 
The following additional declaration will appear on phytosanitary certificates associated with 
commercial shipments of seed potatoes traded between Canada and the United States: 
 
“Field(s) used to produce the seed potatoes in this shipment were surveyed and tested according to 
 
Page 8 of 19 
 
the current PCN guidelines, and potato cyst nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis or Globodera pallida) 
were not detected.” 
 
The following additional declaration will appear on phytosanitary certificates associated with shipments 
of regulated articles produced in a PFPP or PFPS traded between Canada and the United States 
(Section 7): 
 
“The articles in this shipment were grown in a PCN-free place of production or pest-free production site 
and in a manner to prevent infestation by potato cyst nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis and 
Globodera pallida).” 
 
9. Releasing land from regulatory control 
 
This section describes a step-wise reduction of phytosanitary measures that can lead to the 
deregulation of all regulated fields . Procedures for sampling and release of suspect fields are 
described in Appendix 5.  Fields under regulatory control must be managed in compliance with the 
applicable phytosanitary measures as described in these guidelines.   
 
9.1 Regulated non-agricultural land  
 
There are a number of regulated fields in both Canada and the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . Procedures for sampling and release of suspect fields are 
described in Appendix 5.  Fields under regulatory control must be managed in compliance with the 
applicable phytosanitary measures as described in these guidelines.   
 
9.1 Regulated non-agricultural land  
 
There are a number of regulated fields in both Canada and the United States that have been 
converted to non-agricultural uses.  Non-agricultural land includes but is not limited to, 
highways or other paved roads, paved parking lots, industrial parks, other commercial 
developments (such as shopping malls, apartment housing, and office complexes), residential 
developments, state or national parks, other recreational areas, racetracks, golf courses etc.  
All regulated land in this category may be released under these criteria if it meets the following 
criteria: 
 
1. Records must be available to determine that the land has been out of agricultural 
production for the last 20 years and will not return to agriculture; or,  
2. Construction for non-agricultural purposes has rendered the land non-tillable and is not 
likely to ever return to agricultural production. 
 
9.2 Regulated agricultural land no longer in host crop production. 
 
There are some fields in Canada and the United States that are regulated and where 
agriculture does still occur but where all host crop production was prohibited or has ceased for 
a minimum of 30 years.  This could include formerly infested, adjacent or exposed fields.  
During this time, the fields may have been used for various purposes, including but not limited 
to hobby farms, fallow fields, forage crops, grain fields, nurseries, pasture, riding academies, 
sod farms etc.  All

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 has ceased for 
a minimum of 30 years.  This could include formerly infested, adjacent or exposed fields.  
During this time, the fields may have been used for various purposes, including but not limited 
to hobby farms, fallow fields, forage crops, grain fields, nurseries, pasture, riding academies, 
sod farms etc.  All regulated land in this category may be released if it meets all of the following 
criteria (except formerly infested fields, which may never be used for seed potato production): 
 
1. Records must be available to determine that land has been out of host crop production for 
the last 30 years.  
2. The field is surveyed at a minimum of Method A.   
3. If  PCN cysts are found, a viability test must be performed on these cysts. 
4. If no PCN cysts are found or no viable larvae or eggs are detected after viability assay, then 
the field can be released from regulatory control.  
5. If host crops are grown after regulatory changes are made, continued surveillance is 
strongly suggested.  
 
9.3  Adjacent and exposed fields used for host crop production 
 
Adjacent and exposed fields are subject to regulatory measures due to their association with 
infested fields and the consequent risk they pose for soil-borne spread of PCN. Host crops 
may be grown in the field as per Section 5. Processing or fresh market potatoes may be grown 
 
Page 9 of 19 
 
on adjacent and exposed fields only for non-seed purposes under regulatory control (i.e., 
compliance agreements or equivalent). Potatoes may be grown for seed purposes under 
regulatory control (i.e., compliance agreements or equivalent); however, seed potatoes 

Text Len: 1647
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 per Section 5. Processing or fresh market potatoes may be grown 
 
Page 9 of 19 
 
on adjacent and exposed fields only for non-seed purposes under regulatory control (i.e., 
compliance agreements or equivalent). Potatoes may be grown for seed purposes under 
regulatory control (i.e., compliance agreements or equivalent); however, seed potatoes 
harvested from adjacent and exposed fields may be used only within that regulated area. 
Exposed fields are eligible for the lifting of all regulatory controls when conditions 1 and 3, listed 
below, are met. Adjacent fields, however, are eligible for lifting of all regulatory controls when 
all of the following conditions are met: 
 
1. Negative surveys. In order to proceed to steps 2 and 3, negative test results must be 
obtained from one survey using Method A or two surveys using Method B following host 
crop production. Historical survey data can be used if available and the survey method 
used is at least comparable to 6000 cc (15 lb) per acre and if the surveys were 
conducted after the original exposure event occurred. 
2. Removal of equipment-cleaning requirement. Provided the above surveys are 
negative, and on a case-by-case evaluation, equipment-cleaning requirements may be 
removed. 
3.   Additional surveillance. Following a susceptible host plant crop, conduct one additional 
survey using Method A. If this survey is negative then all regulatory controls may be lifted 
on an exposed field. 
4.   Adjacent fields.  The lifting of all regulatory controls on adjacent fields may occur only 
following negative bioassay results from the corresponding infested field. 
 
9.4 Infested fields used for host crop production 
 
Infested fields to be used for host plant production
Text Len: 1748
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 controls may be lifted 
on an exposed field. 
4.   Adjacent fields.  The lifting of all regulatory controls on adjacent fields may occur only 
following negative bioassay results from the corresponding infested field. 
 
9.4 Infested fields used for host crop production 
 
Infested fields to be used for host plant production are subject to the most stringent 
phytosanitary measures due to the high risk of soil-borne PCN spread. Potatoes may only be 
grown under an NPPO approved management plan, unless potatoes are being planted as 
part of a bioassay.   
 
1. Negative viability assay.  Fields must be surveyed using the Viability Assay Survey 
(Appendix 2) and viable PCN must not be detected as per the PCN viability assay protocol 
(Appendix 3). 
2. Negative bioassay. After a negative viability assay is completed a bioassay must be 
conducted based on a process identified in Appendix 4. 
3. Release from equipment cleaning requirement. If the Bioassay is negative, and on a 
case-by-case evaluation, equipment-cleaning requirements may be removed and host 
crops may be grown in the field, as per Section 5. 
4. Continued monitoring or in-field bioassay. Conduct three additional full field surveys 
using viability assay method. Each survey must be conducted after the harvest of a 
susceptible host crop.   
5. Further release from regulatory control If no viable cysts are detected, the field can 
be released from most regulatory controls except that the field remains restricted for 
seed potato production.

10. Review and amendment 
 
A review of these guidelines should be undertaken at the request of either NPPO, or considered at 
regular intervals of two years from the date of endorsement . Such requests for review will be handled 
without undue delay. Relevant stakeholders, including the National Potato Coun cil and the Canadian 
Horticultural Council – Canadian Potato Council, as well as the U.S. National Plant Board, will be 
consulted in this review pro cess. 
 
While the NPPOs may di scuss proposed amendments to the guideline s, any such amendments will not 
be applicable until mutual con sent is obtained in writing and signed by autho rized representatives of both 
NPPOs. 
 
Reviews of the programs within Canada and the United States will be condu cted jointly between both 
NPPOs on a rotating ba sis and a mutually agreed s chedule. The results of these reviews will be used to 
improve these guidelines as needed.  
 
11. Duration of guidelines 
 
These guidelines will be implemented and applied immediately after the date of signature by authorized 
representatives of both NPPOs and will remain in effect unless they are terminated under one of the 
following conditions: 
 
    An NPPO has the right to terminate these guidelines at its sole discretion at any time after giving 60 
days written notice to the other NPPO. 
    The guidelines may be terminated by mutual consent

representatives of both NPPOs and will remain in effect unless they are terminated under one of the 
following conditions: 
 
    An NPPO has the right to terminate these guidelines at its sole discretion at any time after giving 60 
days written notice to the other NPPO. 
    The guidelines may be terminated by mutual consent as of a date approved in writing by both NPPOs 
and as confirmed by the signatures of their authorized representatives. 
 
12. Reporting 
 
To facilitate implementation of these guidelines and ensure timely communication of activities being 
undertaken, the NPPOs agree to provide reports, including national survey data, on at least an annual 
basis to stakeholders of both countries. Each individual NPPO is at liberty to communicate with 
stakeholders regarding issues pertaining to the guidelines within their country. 
 
In addition to reporting on these regulatory guidelines, both CFIA and USDA-APHIS are committed to 
keeping their respective stakeholders informed about science-based risk mitigation approaches to prevent 
the spread of PCN. 
 
13. Non-compliance and dispute resolution

Appendix 3 - Potato Cyst Nematode Viability Assay Protocol 
 
The following viability assay is provided here for guidance. Other viability protocols can also be used if 
scientifically valid. 
 
Meldola’s Blue Viability Assay Protocol 
 
These procedures describe a protocol for evaluating the viability of eggs/juveniles in cysts of Globodera 
pallida (also known as pale cyst nematode or PCN).  Cyst(s) are soake d in a stain that is absorbed by dead 
eggs/juveniles and is not absorbed by viable eggs/juveniles. 
 
I. Cyst Storage 
Cysts recovered from field samples should be stored at room temperature in a secure location prior to 
viability analysis. 
 
II. Cyst hydration 
A. Randomly extract 400 cysts from a field sample or  composited field sample.  Place cysts in 1”

I. Cyst Storage 
Cysts recovered from field samples should be stored at room temperature in a secure location prior to 
viability analysis. 
 
II. Cyst hydration 
A. Randomly extract 400 cysts from a field sample or  composited field sample.  Place cysts in 1” 
square (inside measurement) mesh bag (Figure 1) and seal bag with heat sealer.  Place mesh 
bag containing cysts in a clean 20 ml screw-top vial.  If fewer than 400 cysts are available, use 
as many cysts as possible from a sample or composited sample.  
B. Hydrate the cysts by adding distilled water to the shoulder of the 20 ml vial (Figure 2).  Replace 
lid and tighten. 
C. Allow cysts to hydrate at room temperature for at least 24 hours, but for no longer than 72 
hours. 
 
III.  Cyst staining 
A. Remove 10 ml of distilled water from the sample vial containing the hydrated cysts.   
B. Add 10 ml 0.1% (w/v) Meldola’s blue stain solution to the vial containing the remaining 10 ml of 
distilled water and hydrated cysts to bring the final concentration of Meldola’s Blue to 0.05%.  
C. Replace vial lid and store at room temperature for at least 48 hours, but for no longer than 7 
days.   
 
IV. Reading procedure 
A. Stack a 200 mesh sieve on top of a 500 mesh sieve and prime them by running tap water 
through them. Place the stacked sieves onto a 400 ml tri-corner beaker.

days.   
 
IV. Reading procedure 
A. Stack a 200 mesh sieve on top of a 500 mesh sieve and prime them by running tap water 
through them. Place the stacked sieves onto a 400 ml tri-corner beaker.   
B. Transfer the stained cyst packet onto the top of the 200 mesh sieve 
C. Thoroughly rinse stain off of the packet and cysts using a wash bottle filled with distilled water. 
D. Crush the cysts by gently pressing the tip of a rubber policeman or a pestle to the cyst packet 
on the top sieve.  Take care to not over-crush the cysts, as this will break open the eggs and 
pulverize the juveniles.   
E. Rinse the cyst packet to ensure that all eggs and juveniles are rinsed through packet and the 
top (200 mesh) sieve and into the bottom (500 mesh) sieve.  Take care to avoid overflowing the 
tri-corner beaker with rinsate. 
i. After the initial rinse, open the packet and prop a plastic slide cover inside the packet to 
hold it open and rinse again to ensure all eggs and juveniles are removed from the packet.  
ii. Once all eggs and juveniles are thoroughly rinsed through the top (200 mesh) sieve, 
remove the top sieve and set aside.   
iii. Debris from the top sieve should be autoclaved and discarded. 
F. Rinse eggs/juveniles to the edge of the 500 mesh sieve, and then into a 30 ml graduated 
conical cylinder.  Add distilled water to the conical until a final volume of 5 or 10 ml

iii. Debris from the top sieve should be autoclaved and discarded. 
F. Rinse eggs/juveniles to the edge of the 500 mesh sieve, and then into a 30 ml graduated 
conical cylinder.  Add distilled water to the conical until a final volume of 5 or 10 ml is reached. 
G. Using the fish tank aerator or a volumetric pipette, bubble the sample for at least 30 seconds to 
suspend eggs/juveniles in the sample.   
 
 
Page 15 of 19 
H. Transfer 1 ml of the suspension from the graduated conical to a 1 ml counting microscope slide.  
Cover the slide with a cover slip. 
I. Use Parafilm to cover the graduated cylinder containing the remaining egg/juvenile suspension.  
Label the cylinder with the sample ID and date.  The remaining suspension may be stored in 
the refrigerator for up to 7 days. 
J. Use the 40x objective of a compound microscope to count the number of stained (purple) and 
non-stained (pale amber) eggs/juveniles (Figure 3).  Use a dual hand counter to record counts 
in this step.  
i. Do not count empty eggs or juveniles that are less than ½ of a full-size juvenile. 
ii. Count the stained and non-stained eggs/juveniles until a minimum count of 1,000 
eggs/juveniles on a single slide is achieved.  
iii. Readers should read a slide in the same direction and from the same starting point to 
ensure that the same area of a slide is read by each reader. 
K. If a count of 1,000 eggs/juveniles is not achieved using the first 1
Text Len: 1479
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 minimum count of 1,000 
eggs/juveniles on a single slide is achieved.  
iii. Readers should read a slide in the same direction and from the same starting point to 
ensure that the same area of a slide is read by each reader. 
K. If a count of 1,000 eggs/juveniles is not achieved using the first 1 ml aliquot of egg/juvenile 
suspension, prepare additional slides as needed from the remaining sample suspension by 
repeating steps I through K. 
 
V. Controls 
A. Each day that field samples are analyzed for viability, both positive and negative control 
samples should also be read.   
i. Freshly reared Globodera pallida or G. tabacum cysts are suitable for use as controls. 
ii. Positive and negative controls should be prepared and analyzed separately.  At least 100 
eggs/juveniles should be counted from each slide preparation of positive and negative 
controls.  To achieve these counts, at least 4 cysts should be used in each preparation of 
positive and negative controls.  
B. Preparation of positive (live) controls: 
i. Positive controls are to be prepared in the same manner as field-collected viability samples.  
C. Preparation of negative (killed) controls: 
i. Negative control cysts are heat-killed by autoclaving for one hour at 121⁰C.

Appendix 4 - Potato Cyst Nematode Bioassay 
 
 
Purpose: 
 
The soil bioassay will be conducted following a negative viability assay (Appendix 3). During the time it 
takes to complete the bioassay procedure, the normal activities that occur in the regulated fields will 
continue, including sanitation procedures. 
 
Care must be taken during the bioassay procedure to ensure that the possibility of releasing live PCN 
cysts or infective juveniles is minimized. Regulatory requirements must be strictly adhered to pertaining to 
containment, permit and compliance agreement conditions. 
 
Procedure: 
 
Materials required: 
 80 mm by 80 mm nylon mesh muslin “tea” bags 
 1 gallon (min) pots 
 1:3 sterile soil: sterile sand mixture 
 Growth facilities with required biocontainment and capable of maintaining the

Procedure: 
 
Materials required: 
 80 mm by 80 mm nylon mesh muslin “tea” bags 
 1 gallon (min) pots 
 1:3 sterile soil: sterile sand mixture 
 Growth facilities with required biocontainment and capable of maintaining the required controlled 
conditions for the bioassay. 
 
Sample the mapped PCN foci in the field at the viability assay sampling rate (Appendix 2). Extract the 
organic fraction of the soil using a Fenwick can, USDA cyst extractors or other appropriate device. The 
appropriate organic fraction or flotsam, which contains the PCN cysts and other associated organic matter, 
is collected in a 250 ml beaker lined with an 80 mm by 80 mm nylon muslin “tea” bag containing a minimum 
of 20 cysts per pot, when available. Heat seal each ~20 ml of organic fraction in an individual nylon mesh 
tea bag. 
 
Place up to 4 muslin bags in an appropriate pot with a mixture of 1 part sterile loam soil and 3 parts sterile 
sand. This volume should be suitable for growing a potato plant to maturity. Up to 4 bags should be placed 
in each until all bags have been placed in a pot. A potato tuber should be placed in the center of the pot 
near the bags. 
 
Grow susceptible potato plant to at least 120 days from planting. Any weeds growing in the pots should be 
promptly removed. Temperatures in the greenhouse or growth chambers during growth periods must not 
exceed 24oC. Once the potato plant has grown to maturity, the plant must be carefully removed from the 
soil sand mixture. Examine all visible roots for the presence of
Text Len: 1549
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 susceptible potato plant to at least 120 days from planting. Any weeds growing in the pots should be 
promptly removed. Temperatures in the greenhouse or growth chambers during growth periods must not 
exceed 24oC. Once the potato plant has grown to maturity, the plant must be carefully removed from the 
soil sand mixture. Examine all visible roots for the presence of cysts. If necessary, the roots should be 
washed and the water should be drained into the original pot. If PCN cysts are detected on the roots, the 
bioassay is considered positive and the fields from which the organic fraction in the muslin bag originated 
will remain under regulation. If PCN cysts are not detected, the bioassay may immediately continue for up to 
an additional 2 cycles (no diapause is needed if the fields undergoing bioassay have been out of host 
production for a minimum of 5 years) . Examine the tea bags for deterioration after plant removal and 
replace as appropriate. 
 
Repeat the bioassay for two more cycles of growth as described above. Once the final potato plant has 
grown to maturity, the plant must be carefully removed from the soil sand mixture and the roots and soil and 
sand mixture examined for cysts. If necessary the roots should be washed. The cysts in the muslin bags 
must also be examined for viability using the methods described in Appendix 3. Additionally, extract the soil 
and examine the organic fraction for the presence of cysts. If PCN cysts are detected, the bioassay is 
considered positive. 
 
A bioassay may also be conducted in the infested fields.  The fields must have been surveyed at a 
minimum of the viability assay survey and any and all cysts detected must be tested for viability using 
either the staining method
Text Len: 1759

 the presence of cysts. If PCN cysts are detected, the bioassay is 
considered positive. 
 
A bioassay may also be conducted in the infested fields.  The fields must have been surveyed at a 
minimum of the viability assay survey and any and all cysts detected must be tested for viability using 
either the staining method described in Appendix 3 or viability must be determined by a trained 
nematologist.  If all of the cysts detected are determined to be non-viable, then a susceptible host crop 
may be planted on the field in each PCN infestation foci and a minimum of 15ft (4.6 m) buffer completely 
around each focus within a field.  If the foci within the field are not known, the full field must be planted w ith 
susceptible hosts.  After the susceptible host crop is grown to maturity, it may be harvested and moved 
 
 
Page 18 of 19 
under compliance agreement (or other appropriate regulatory tool).  After harvest is completed, the field 
must be surveyed in the areas where the susceptible crops were planted at the viability assay survey rate 
(45000cc per ha, 18,000cc per acre to a depth of 10 inches/25cm).  Any cysts found must be assayed 
using an appropriate viability testing method. 
 
The planting of a susceptible host must occur each of the next two growing seasons, followed by harvest 
and viability assay surveys and viability testing each time to any detected cysts. If all viability results are 
negative, then the bioassay is considered to be negative and the stepwise process out lined in Section 9 
may continue.

Appendix 5 - Confirmatory Policy for Suspect Potato Cyst Nematode (PCN) Infestations 
Introduction: 
This policy is specific to PCN and is based on knowledge about the biology and epidemiology of the 
organism. 
 
Specimens must be identified and confirmed by an NPPO or NPPO-approved laboratory using 
definitive morphological/morphometric and molecular identification techniques, including those 
specimens originating from a non-NPPO or non-NPPO-approved laboratory. If the pest is confirmed, 
regulatory action may result. 
 
Subsequent samples from a field with at least one confirmed positive sample do not require 
confirmatory testing. If the suspect sample is not an official sample, the collection of an official 
sample may be required. 
 
 
 
Morphological and Molecular PCN Confirmation: 
 
Complete, definitive identification of G. pallida or G. rostochiensis is a multi-step process, as follows: 
 
1. Verify that the sample contains suspect Globodera spp. or other cyst nematode genera (such as 
Cactodera). 
2. Verify that the suspect cysts and/or any juvenile forms have key characters and are 
morphometrically within the range of the PCN species. 
3. Verify that the suspect nematode tissue yields DNA identifiable as a PCN species. (As per PPQ 

Text Len: 1536
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
st nematode genera (such as 
Cactodera). 
2. Verify that the suspect cysts and/or any juvenile forms have key characters and are 
morphometrically within the range of the PCN species. 
3. Verify that the suspect nematode tissue yields DNA identifiable as a PCN species. (As per PPQ 
CPHST-Beltsville work instructions posted at www.nahln.org and Skantar et al, 2007 at 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2586493/ .) 
4. Verify that the morphological and molecular analyses concur. 
 
PCN Infested Field Confirmation: 
 
For a field to be considered infested with PCN, the following criteria should be met: 
 
    at least two cysts from two different soil samples with one of those cysts containing viable PCN 
eggs or juveniles. 
 
If the above criteria are not met, a survey using Method A must be conducted as soon as 
possible.  If no additional cysts are detected, a Viability Assay Survey must also be conducted 
following the next susceptible host crop.  If no additional cysts are detected after these surveys 
then the regulatory controls can be removed.   
 
Fields that do not meet the terms of this policy will not be considered as infested, however, continued 
monitoring of the fields would be prudent after any susceptible host crops.

1. Introduction 
 
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the United States Department of Agriculture Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) are the National Plant Protection Organizations 
(NPPO) of their respective countries. These guidelines (hereafter referred to as “the Guidelines”) on 
Surveillance and Phytosanitary Actions for Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida, also referred 
to as Potato Cyst Nematodes (PCN), were developed by both organizations in consultation with 
stakeholders from both countries to: 
 
Outline the phytosanitary measures to be taken on the detection of PCN. 
Provide guidance to the NPPOs on long term management and/or release of fields in regulated 
areas. 
   Establish the requirements for the movement of seed potatoes and other regulated articles 
between the two countries. 
 
The Guidelines are intended to ensure predictable and equivalent science-based phytosanitary 
actions in both countries. The establishment of risk-based regulatory controls and processes for the 
movement of regulated articles is intended to prevent the spread of PCN. 
 
The Guidelines were developed in accordance with the principles

 other regulated articles 
between the two countries. 
 
The Guidelines are intended to ensure predictable and equivalent science-based phytosanitary 
actions in both countries. The establishment of risk-based regulatory controls and processes for the 
movement of regulated articles is intended to prevent the spread of PCN. 
 
The Guidelines were developed in accordance with the principles of the International Plant 
Protection Convention (IPPC) and the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of 
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The Guidelines also take into account recommendations of 
an Independent International Science Panel consisting of scientists with direct knowledge and 
experience with PCN and the recommendations of potato industry stakeholders including the 
National Potato Council and the Canadian Horticultural Council – Canadian Potato Council, as well 
as the views of the U.S. National Plant Board.  Relevant terms are defined by the IPPC unless 
otherwise noted in Appendix 1. 
 
2. Rationale for phytosanitary actions 
 
Potato Cyst Nematodes are considered quarantine pests for Canada and the United States. Existing 
evidence indicates that these pests are not widely distributed in Canada and the United States. 
Where present in the United States and Canada they are of limited distribution and under official 
control. 
 
PCNs are long-lived soil-borne pests that are difficult to detect at very low populations with cysts 
containing viable eggs known to survive decades in the soil. Once PCN is present, there is no quick, 
economical and effective treatment.  Control of PCN is difficult and requires integrated approaches 
that utilize phytosanitary measures including ongoing surveillance and testing, treatment 
(nematicides), and the adoption of cultural practices (e.g. crop rotation, use of resistant varieties, trap

 in the soil. Once PCN is present, there is no quick, 
economical and effective treatment.  Control of PCN is difficult and requires integrated approaches 
that utilize phytosanitary measures including ongoing surveillance and testing, treatment 
(nematicides), and the adoption of cultural practices (e.g. crop rotation, use of resistant varieties, trap 
cropping, and host avoidance). 
 
The movement of seed potatoes and other articles with soil presents the highest risk for the 
movement of these pests.  Appropriate surveillance and regulatory controls are essential to 
minimize the risk of PCN spread.

3. Soil sampling and laboratory analysis procedures 
 
CFIA and USDA-APHIS officials have agreed on harmonized soil sampling and laboratory 
analysis procedures in keeping with internationally recognized standards. All soil samples are to 
be officially collected and submitted to and processed by NPPO-recognized laboratories. 
 
When applicable, the NPPO will provide the procedures used for PCN delimiting and detection 
surveys to stakeholders and co- operators. 
 
 
4. Phytosanitary measures 
 
In response to a new PCN detection, the procedures in Appendix 5 must be used to confirm a PCN 
infestation within a field where cysts were detected. The NPPO will also initiate immediate 
phytosanitary measures to prevent potential PCN spread to non-infested areas. These actions will 
include the steps below: 
 
4.1 Fields where PCN infestation is confirmed 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from the infested field .  
2. NPPO and cooperators will investigate any historical movement of the regulated articles that 

Text Len: 1674
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 potential PCN spread to non-infested areas. These actions will 
include the steps below: 
 
4.1 Fields where PCN infestation is confirmed 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from the infested field .  
2. NPPO and cooperators will investigate any historical movement of the regulated articles that 
may have been associated with the infested field in order to identify potentially exposed 
fields. 
3. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from all fields identified as adjacent or 
exposed to the infested field. 
4. The adjacent, exposed and infested fields will make up the initial regulated area and will be 
subject to all sampling and regulatory controls outlined in Section 9. 
5. If the PCN infested field was used for seed potato production, trace forward information must 
be collected for the seed lots produced on the infested field.  The fields planted with seed 
potatoes originating from the last potato crop grown on the infested field must be part of the 
regulated area as exposed fields. 
6. Fields used as seed sources for the infested field will be prioritized for surveys but are not 
necessarily included as part of the regulated area. Seed potato movement from these fields is 
restricted until the surveys of these individual fields have been completed.  
7. Any deregulation of the initial regulated area should occur as outlined in Section 9.  
 
4.2 Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation 
 
In some cases, fields where PCN may have been detected may not immediately be considered 
as infested with PCN (Appendix 5).  Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation are 
considered suspect fields and should be treated as follows: 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5
Text Len: 1765
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation 
 
In some cases, fields where PCN may have been detected may not immediately be considered 
as infested with PCN (Appendix 5).  Fields undergoing confirmation of PCN infestation are 
considered suspect fields and should be treated as follows: 
 
1. Restrict movement of regulated articles (Section 5) from the suspect field where the sample 
was collected. 
2. Initiate investigations of any historical movement of the regulated articles that may have 
been associated with the suspect field in order to identify potentially exposed fields. 
3. If a suspect field cannot be confirmed as infested with PCN after following all of the 
procedures outlined in Appendix 5, all phytosanitary measures are removed.  
4. If the suspect field is confirmed as PCN positive, that field as well as adjacent and exposed 
fields will be regulated  and will be subject to all sampling and regulatory controls outlined in 
Section 9.  
 
While the investigation described above is being conducted, the PCN phytosanitary certification 
requirements for seed potatoes traded between the two countries (Section 8) will provide the 
 
Page 5 of 19 
 
necessary safeguards to permit the undisrupted trade of seed potatoes from fields outside of 
the regulated area. 
 
5. Regulated articles 
Regulated articles include, but are not limited to: 
Cysts of Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida; 
Soil; 
PCN host crops; and 
Any other article that could result in the movement of soil or PCN. 
 
Because the principal pathway  of moving PCN is soil associated with equipment, potato tubers, root 
crops, nursery stock or other articles that move soil
Text Len: 1680
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
odera rostochiensis and G. pallida; 
Soil; 
PCN host crops; and 
Any other article that could result in the movement of soil or PCN. 
 
Because the principal pathway  of moving PCN is soil associated with equipment, potato tubers, root 
crops, nursery stock or other articles that move soil, it is important to regulate these articles to 
mitigate potential PCN spread. Equipment and regulated commodities can move from PCN-
regulated areas only after they meet risk mitigation requirements outlined in Table 1, or under 
compliance agreements, as authorized by the respective NPPO. The NPPO, in collaboration with its 
respective partners, is responsible for implementing all necessary regulatory controls within a 
regulated area, for monitoring the effectiveness of such controls, and for ensuring compliance to 
minimize the possibility of spreading PCN. 
 
To initiate regulatory controls and establish regulated areas, Canada will issue individual 
notices of restrictions, ministerial orders and/or regulations. The United States will use a 
combination of emergency action notification, state rules, and federal regulations to create 
a regulated area(s).

6. National PCN detection survey 
 
Canada and the United States will survey a portion of the annual seed potato acreage in each country. 
Land used for seed potato production, including land owned by universities, government or other 
research organizations, should be surveyed as a part of any survey efforts. The recommended 
survey rate is Method B (Appendix 2). 
 
 
7. Pest-free places of production or pest-free production sites within regulated areas 
 
Pest-free places of production (PFPP) and pest-free production sites (PFPS), as described in ISPM 
No. 10, are allowed within regulated areas, on a case by case basis, provided that they maintain a 
compliance agreement with the applicable NPPO.

below are met: 
 
    PCN detection survey and testing has been conducted and found negative using 
minimum of Method A (Appendix 2) if soil is present in the facility; 
Production practices prevent entry of soil from the surrounding fields into the facility; 
Soil-less growing media is used; 
Water used is filtered, treated or from a cased and capped well;

that prevents contact with soil; 
A 4.6 m (5 yd.) perimeter around the site is maintained free of PCN hosts; 
Facility floors are constructed to provide separation from the underlying soil; and 
Equipment is rendered free of soil prior to entry into the facility and when moved outside of 
the regulated area. 
 
7.2. Field-grown plants for planting and propagation 
 
PFPP producing field-grown plants may be established in the regulated area, except in infested 
fields, provided the criteria below are met: 
 
 There is no history of host crop production within the last 10 years; 
 PCN detection survey & testing has been conducted and found negative (using Method A);    
 Ongoing PCN detection survey may be conducted every 36 months (using Method B); and  
 Minimum 4.6 m (5 yd.) buffer around the site is maintained free of PCN hosts. 
 
8. Phytosanitary certification of seed potatoes 
 
To be eligible for phytosanitary export certification, fields used to produce seed potatoes traded 
between Canada and the United States must meet the following conditions:  
 

Text Len: 1594
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.6 m (5 yd.) buffer around the site is maintained free of PCN hosts. 
 
8. Phytosanitary certification of seed potatoes 
 
To be eligible for phytosanitary export certification, fields used to produce seed potatoes traded 
between Canada and the United States must meet the following conditions:  
 
 The field from which the seed potato shipment originates must be sampled following the production 
of a potato crop at a minimum rate of Method B and test negative; or 
 
 A field that has been surveyed two times at a minimum rate of Method B and found negative for 
PCN would be exempt from further PCN surveys for the following three potato crops.  Following the 
exempt period, the field would be subject to an additional survey at a minimum rate of Method B, 
and if found negative, that field would again be exempt for an additional three potato crops. (Note: 
Surveys conducted at a minimum rate of Method B since 2009 count toward the two survey 
requirement.)   
 
These fields must have never had a PCN detection or be under the regulatory controls described in 
Sections 4 and 9.  PCN survey and laboratory testing of the field(s) used to produce the seed potatoes 
identified for export to the other country must be completed prior to the issuance of any phytosanitary 
certificate for the seed potato shipments from that field(s).  
 
Shipments of seed potato samples consisting of 500 tubers or less for trials or research purposes are 
exempt from these requirements, provided the field has been previously surveyed and found negative 
for PCN.   
 
The following additional declaration will appear on phytosanitary certificates associated with 
commercial shipments of seed potatoes traded between Canada

Shipments of seed potato samples consisting of 500 tubers or less for trials or research purposes are 
exempt from these requirements, provided the field has been previously surveyed and found negative 
for PCN.   
 
The following additional declaration will appear on phytosanitary certificates associated with 
commercial shipments of seed potatoes traded between Canada and the United States: 
 
“Field(s) used to produce the seed potatoes in this shipment were surveyed and tested according to 
 
Page 8 of 19 
 
the current PCN guidelines, and potato cyst nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis or Globodera pallida) 
were not detected.” 
 
The following additional declaration will appear on phytosanitary certificates associated with shipments 
of regulated articles produced in a PFPP or PFPS traded between Canada and the United States 
(Section 7): 
 
“The articles in this shipment were grown in a PCN-free place of production or pest-free production site 
and in a manner to prevent infestation by potato cyst nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis and 
Globodera pallida).” 
 
9. Releasing land from regulatory control 
 
This section describes a step-wise reduction of phytosanitary measures that can lead to the 
deregulation of all regulated fields . Procedures for sampling and release of suspect fields are 
described in Appendix 5.  Fields under regulatory control must be managed in compliance with the 
applicable phytosanitary measures as described in these guidelines.   
 
9.1 Regulated non-agricultural land  
 
There are a number of regulated fields in both Canada and the

 . Procedures for sampling and release of suspect fields are 
described in Appendix 5.  Fields under regulatory control must be managed in compliance with the 
applicable phytosanitary measures as described in these guidelines.   
 
9.1 Regulated non-agricultural land  
 
There are a number of regulated fields in both Canada and the United States that have been 
converted to non-agricultural uses.  Non-agricultural land includes but is not limited to, 
highways or other paved roads, paved parking lots, industrial parks, other commercial 
developments (such as shopping malls, apartment housing, and office complexes), residential 
developments, state or national parks, other recreational areas, racetracks, golf courses etc.  
All regulated land in this category may be released under these criteria if it meets the following 
criteria: 
 
1. Records must be available to determine that the land has been out of agricultural 
production for the last 20 years and will not return to agriculture; or,  
2. Construction for non-agricultural purposes has rendered the land non-tillable and is not 
likely to ever return to agricultural production. 
 
9.2 Regulated agricultural land no longer in host crop production. 
 
There are some fields in Canada and the United States that are regulated and where 
agriculture does still occur but where all host crop production was prohibited or has ceased for 
a minimum of 30 years.  This could include formerly infested, adjacent or exposed fields.  
During this time, the fields may have been used for various purposes, including but not limited 
to hobby farms, fallow fields, forage crops, grain fields, nurseries, pasture, riding academies, 
sod farms etc.  All

 has ceased for 
a minimum of 30 years.  This could include formerly infested, adjacent or exposed fields.  
During this time, the fields may have been used for various purposes, including but not limited 
to hobby farms, fallow fields, forage crops, grain fields, nurseries, pasture, riding academies, 
sod farms etc.  All regulated land in this category may be released if it meets all of the following 
criteria (except formerly infested fields, which may never be used for seed potato production): 
 
1. Records must be available to determine that land has been out of host crop production for 
the last 30 years.  
2. The field is surveyed at a minimum of Method A.   
3. If  PCN cysts are found, a viability test must be performed on these cysts. 
4. If no PCN cysts are found or no viable larvae or eggs are detected after viability assay, then 
the field can be released from regulatory control.  
5. If host crops are grown after regulatory changes are made, continued surveillance is 
strongly suggested.  
 
9.3  Adjacent and exposed fields used for host crop production 
 
Adjacent and exposed fields are subject to regulatory measures due to their association with 
infested fields and the consequent risk they pose for soil-borne spread of PCN. Host crops 
may be grown in the field as per Section 5. Processing or fresh market potatoes may be grown 
 
Page 9 of 19 
 
on adjacent and exposed fields only for non-seed purposes under regulatory control (i.e., 
compliance agreements or equivalent). Potatoes may be grown for seed purposes under 
regulatory control (i.e., compliance agreements or equivalent); however, seed potatoes 

Text Len: 1647
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 per Section 5. Processing or fresh market potatoes may be grown 
 
Page 9 of 19 
 
on adjacent and exposed fields only for non-seed purposes under regulatory control (i.e., 
compliance agreements or equivalent). Potatoes may be grown for seed purposes under 
regulatory control (i.e., compliance agreements or equivalent); however, seed potatoes 
harvested from adjacent and exposed fields may be used only within that regulated area. 
Exposed fields are eligible for the lifting of all regulatory controls when conditions 1 and 3, listed 
below, are met. Adjacent fields, however, are eligible for lifting of all regulatory controls when 
all of the following conditions are met: 
 
1. Negative surveys. In order to proceed to steps 2 and 3, negative test results must be 
obtained from one survey using Method A or two surveys using Method B following host 
crop production. Historical survey data can be used if available and the survey method 
used is at least comparable to 6000 cc (15 lb) per acre and if the surveys were 
conducted after the original exposure event occurred. 
2. Removal of equipment-cleaning requirement. Provided the above surveys are 
negative, and on a case-by-case evaluation, equipment-cleaning requirements may be 
removed. 
3.   Additional surveillance. Following a susceptible host plant crop, conduct one additional 
survey using Method A. If this survey is negative then all regulatory controls may be lifted 
on an exposed field. 
4.   Adjacent fields.  The lifting of all regulatory controls on adjacent fields may occur only 
following negative bioassay results from the corresponding infested field. 
 
9.4 Infested fields used for host crop production 
 
Infested fields to be used for host plant production
Text Len: 1748
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 controls may be lifted 
on an exposed field. 
4.   Adjacent fields.  The lifting of all regulatory controls on adjacent fields may occur only 
following negative bioassay results from the corresponding infested field. 
 
9.4 Infested fields used for host crop production 
 
Infested fields to be used for host plant production are subject to the most stringent 
phytosanitary measures due to the high risk of soil-borne PCN spread. Potatoes may only be 
grown under an NPPO approved management plan, unless potatoes are being planted as 
part of a bioassay.   
 
1. Negative viability assay.  Fields must be surveyed using the Viability Assay Survey 
(Appendix 2) and viable PCN must not be detected as per the PCN viability assay protocol 
(Appendix 3). 
2. Negative bioassay. After a negative viability assay is completed a bioassay must be 
conducted based on a process identified in Appendix 4. 
3. Release from equipment cleaning requirement. If the Bioassay is negative, and on a 
case-by-case evaluation, equipment-cleaning requirements may be removed and host 
crops may be grown in the field, as per Section 5. 
4. Continued monitoring or in-field bioassay. Conduct three additional full field surveys 
using viability assay method. Each survey must be conducted after the harvest of a 
susceptible host crop.   
5. Further release from regulatory control If no viable cysts are detected, the field can 
be released from most regulatory controls except that the field remains restricted for 
seed potato production.

10. Review and amendment 
 
A review of these guidelines should be undertaken at the request of either NPPO, or considered at 
regular intervals of two years from the date of endorsement . Such requests for review will be handled 
without undue delay. Relevant stakeholders, including the National Potato Coun cil and the Canadian 
Horticultural Council – Canadian Potato Council, as well as the U.S. National Plant Board, will be 
consulted in this review pro cess. 
 
While the NPPOs may di scuss proposed amendments to the guideline s, any such amendments will not 
be applicable until mutual con sent is obtained in writing and signed by autho rized representatives of both 
NPPOs. 
 
Reviews of the programs within Canada and the United States will be condu cted jointly between both 
NPPOs on a rotating ba sis and a mutually agreed s chedule. The results of these reviews will be used to 
improve these guidelines as needed.  
 
11. Duration of guidelines 
 
These guidelines will be implemented and applied immediately after the date of signature by authorized 
representatives of both NPPOs and will remain in effect unless they are terminated under one of the 
following conditions: 
 
    An NPPO has the right to terminate these guidelines at its sole discretion at any time after giving 60 
days written notice to the other NPPO.

following conditions: 
 
    An NPPO has the right to terminate these guidelines at its sole discretion at any time after giving 60 
days written notice to the other NPPO. 
    The guidelines may be terminated by mutual consent as of a date approved in writing by both NPPOs 
and as confirmed by the signatures of their authorized representatives. 
 
12. Reporting 
 
To facilitate implementation of these guidelines and ensure timely communication of activities being 
undertaken, the NPPOs agree to provide reports, including national survey data, on at least an annual 
basis to stakeholders of both countries. Each individual NPPO is at liberty to communicate with 
stakeholders regarding issues pertaining to the guidelines within their country. 
 
In addition to reporting on these regulatory guidelines, both CFIA and USDA-APHIS are committed to 
keeping their respective stakeholders informed about science-based risk mitigation approaches to prevent 
the spread of PCN. 
 
13. Non-compliance and dispute resolution 
 
In the event of non-compliance with a requirement specified in these guidelines, or regarding the 
interpretation or implementation, the NPPOs agree to discuss the matter for mutual and prompt resolution. If 
bilateral discussions between the NPPOs are not able to resolve the dispute the NPPOs will jointly select a 
facilitator for continued discussions. If the dispute still cannot be resolved, either NPPO may, at its sole 
discretion, terminate these guidelines immediately or as described above.

Appendix 3 - Potato Cyst Nematode Viability Assay Protocol 
 
The following viability assay is provided here for guidance. Other viability protocols can also be used if 
scientifically valid. 
 
Meldola’s Blue Viability Assay Protocol 
 
These procedures describe a protocol for evaluating the viability of eggs/juveniles in cysts of Globodera 
pallida (also known as pale cyst nematode or PCN).  Cyst(s) are soake d in a stain that is absorbed by dead 
eggs/juveniles and is not absorbed by viable eggs/juveniles. 
 
I. Cyst Storage 
Cysts recovered from field samples should be stored at room temperature in a secure location prior to 
viability analysis. 
 
II. Cyst hydration 
A. Randomly extract 400 cysts from a field sample or  composited field sample.  Place cysts in 1”

I. Cyst Storage 
Cysts recovered from field samples should be stored at room temperature in a secure location prior to 
viability analysis. 
 
II. Cyst hydration 
A. Randomly extract 400 cysts from a field sample or  composited field sample.  Place cysts in 1” 
square (inside measurement) mesh bag (Figure 1) and seal bag with heat sealer.  Place mesh 
bag containing cysts in a clean 20 ml screw-top vial.  If fewer than 400 cysts are available, use 
as many cysts as possible from a sample or composited sample.  
B. Hydrate the cysts by adding distilled water to the shoulder of the 20 ml vial (Figure 2).  Replace 
lid and tighten. 
C. Allow cysts to hydrate at room temperature for at least 24 hours, but for no longer than 72 
hours. 
 
III.  Cyst staining 
A. Remove 10 ml of distilled water from the sample vial containing the hydrated cysts.   
B. Add 10 ml 0.1% (w/v) Meldola’s blue stain solution to the vial containing the remaining 10 ml of 
distilled water and hydrated cysts to bring the final concentration of Meldola’s Blue to 0.05%.  
C. Replace vial lid and store at room temperature for at least 48 hours, but for no longer than 7 
days.   
 
IV. Reading procedure 
A. Stack a 200 mesh sieve on top of a 500 mesh sieve and prime them by running tap water 
through them. Place the stacked sieves onto a 400 ml tri-corner beaker.

days.   
 
IV. Reading procedure 
A. Stack a 200 mesh sieve on top of a 500 mesh sieve and prime them by running tap water 
through them. Place the stacked sieves onto a 400 ml tri-corner beaker.   
B. Transfer the stained cyst packet onto the top of the 200 mesh sieve 
C. Thoroughly rinse stain off of the packet and cysts using a wash bottle filled with distilled water. 
D. Crush the cysts by gently pressing the tip of a rubber policeman or a pestle to the cyst packet 
on the top sieve.  Take care to not over-crush the cysts, as this will break open the eggs and 
pulverize the juveniles.   
E. Rinse the cyst packet to ensure that all eggs and juveniles are rinsed through packet and the 
top (200 mesh) sieve and into the bottom (500 mesh) sieve.  Take care to avoid overflowing the 
tri-corner beaker with rinsate. 
i. After the initial rinse, open the packet and prop a plastic slide cover inside the packet to 
hold it open and rinse again to ensure all eggs and juveniles are removed from the packet.  
ii. Once all eggs and juveniles are thoroughly rinsed through the top (200 mesh) sieve, 
remove the top sieve and set aside.   
iii. Debris from the top sieve should be autoclaved and discarded. 
F. Rinse eggs/juveniles to the edge of the 500 mesh sieve, and then into a 30 ml graduated 
conical cylinder.  Add distilled water to the conical until a final volume of 5 or 10 ml

iii. Debris from the top sieve should be autoclaved and discarded. 
F. Rinse eggs/juveniles to the edge of the 500 mesh sieve, and then into a 30 ml graduated 
conical cylinder.  Add distilled water to the conical until a final volume of 5 or 10 ml is reached. 
G. Using the fish tank aerator or a volumetric pipette, bubble the sample for at least 30 seconds to 
suspend eggs/juveniles in the sample.   
 
 
Page 15 of 19 
H. Transfer 1 ml of the suspension from the graduated conical to a 1 ml counting microscope slide.  
Cover the slide with a cover slip. 
I. Use Parafilm to cover the graduated cylinder containing the remaining egg/juvenile suspension.  
Label the cylinder with the sample ID and date.  The remaining suspension may be stored in 
the refrigerator for up to 7 days. 
J. Use the 40x objective of a compound microscope to count the number of stained (purple) and 
non-stained (pale amber) eggs/juveniles (Figure 3).  Use a dual hand counter to record counts 
in this step.  
i. Do not count empty eggs or juveniles that are less than ½ of a full-size juvenile. 
ii. Count the stained and non-stained eggs/juveniles until a minimum count of 1,000 
eggs/juveniles on a single slide is achieved.  
iii. Readers should read a slide in the same direction and from the same starting point to 
ensure that the same area of a slide is read by each reader. 
K. If a count of 1,000 eggs/juveniles is not achieved using the first 1
Text Len: 1479
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 minimum count of 1,000 
eggs/juveniles on a single slide is achieved.  
iii. Readers should read a slide in the same direction and from the same starting point to 
ensure that the same area of a slide is read by each reader. 
K. If a count of 1,000 eggs/juveniles is not achieved using the first 1 ml aliquot of egg/juvenile 
suspension, prepare additional slides as needed from the remaining sample suspension by 
repeating steps I through K. 
 
V. Controls 
A. Each day that field samples are analyzed for viability, both positive and negative control 
samples should also be read.   
i. Freshly reared Globodera pallida or G. tabacum cysts are suitable for use as controls. 
ii. Positive and negative controls should be prepared and analyzed separately.  At least 100 
eggs/juveniles should be counted from each slide preparation of positive and negative 
controls.  To achieve these counts, at least 4 cysts should be used in each preparation of 
positive and negative controls.  
B. Preparation of positive (live) controls: 
i. Positive controls are to be prepared in the same manner as field-collected viability samples.  
C. Preparation of negative (killed) controls: 
i. Negative control cysts are heat-killed by autoclaving for one hour at 121⁰C.

Appendix 4 - Potato Cyst Nematode Bioassay 
 
 
Purpose: 
 
The soil bioassay will be conducted following a negative viability assay (Appendix 3). During the time it 
takes to complete the bioassay procedure, the normal activities that occur in the regulated fields will 
continue, including sanitation procedures. 
 
Care must be taken during the bioassay procedure to ensure that the possibility of releasing live PCN 
cysts or infective juveniles is minimized. Regulatory requirements must be strictly adhered to pertaining to 
containment, permit and compliance agreement conditions. 
 
Procedure: 
 
Materials required: 
 80 mm by 80 mm nylon mesh muslin “tea” bags 
 1 gallon (min) pots 
 1:3 sterile soil: sterile sand mixture 
 Growth facilities with required biocontainment and capable of maintaining the

Procedure: 
 
Materials required: 
 80 mm by 80 mm nylon mesh muslin “tea” bags 
 1 gallon (min) pots 
 1:3 sterile soil: sterile sand mixture 
 Growth facilities with required biocontainment and capable of maintaining the required controlled 
conditions for the bioassay. 
 
Sample the mapped PCN foci in the field at the viability assay sampling rate (Appendix 2). Extract the 
organic fraction of the soil using a Fenwick can, USDA cyst extractors or other appropriate device. The 
appropriate organic fraction or flotsam, which contains the PCN cysts and other associated organic matter, 
is collected in a 250 ml beaker lined with an 80 mm by 80 mm nylon muslin “tea” bag containing a minimum 
of 20 cysts per pot, when available. Heat seal each ~20 ml of organic fraction in an individual nylon mesh 
tea bag. 
 
Place up to 4 muslin bags in an appropriate pot with a mixture of 1 part sterile loam soil and 3 parts sterile 
sand. This volume should be suitable for growing a potato plant to maturity. Up to 4 bags should be placed 
in each until all bags have been placed in a pot. A potato tuber should be placed in the center of the pot 
near the bags. 
 
Grow susceptible potato plant to at least 120 days from planting. Any weeds growing in the pots should be 
promptly removed. Temperatures in the greenhouse or growth chambers during growth periods must not 
exceed 24oC. Once the potato plant has grown to maturity, the plant must be carefully removed from the 
soil sand mixture. Examine all visible roots for the presence of
Text Len: 1549
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 susceptible potato plant to at least 120 days from planting. Any weeds growing in the pots should be 
promptly removed. Temperatures in the greenhouse or growth chambers during growth periods must not 
exceed 24oC. Once the potato plant has grown to maturity, the plant must be carefully removed from the 
soil sand mixture. Examine all visible roots for the presence of cysts. If necessary, the roots should be 
washed and the water should be drained into the original pot. If PCN cysts are detected on the roots, the 
bioassay is considered positive and the fields from which the organic fraction in the muslin bag originated 
will remain under regulation. If PCN cysts are not detected, the bioassay may immediately continue for up to 
an additional 2 cycles (no diapause is needed if the fields undergoing bioassay have been out of host 
production for a minimum of 5 years) . Examine the tea bags for deterioration after plant removal and 
replace as appropriate. 
 
Repeat the bioassay for two more cycles of growth as described above. Once the final potato plant has 
grown to maturity, the plant must be carefully removed from the soil sand mixture and the roots and soil and 
sand mixture examined for cysts. If necessary the roots should be washed. The cysts in the muslin bags 
must also be examined for viability using the methods described in Appendix 3. Additionally, extract the soil 
and examine the organic fraction for the presence of cysts. If PCN cysts are detected, the bioassay is 
considered positive. 
 
A bioassay may also be conducted in the infested fields.  The fields must have been surveyed at a 
minimum of the viability assay survey and any and all cysts detected must be tested for viability using 
either the staining method
Text Len: 1759

 the presence of cysts. If PCN cysts are detected, the bioassay is 
considered positive. 
 
A bioassay may also be conducted in the infested fields.  The fields must have been surveyed at a 
minimum of the viability assay survey and any and all cysts detected must be tested for viability using 
either the staining method described in Appendix 3 or viability must be determined by a trained 
nematologist.  If all of the cysts detected are determined to be non-viable, then a susceptible host crop 
may be planted on the field in each PCN infestation foci and a minimum of 15ft (4.6 m) buffer completely 
around each focus within a field.  If the foci within the field are not known, the full field must be planted w ith 
susceptible hosts.  After the susceptible host crop is grown to maturity, it may be harvested and moved 
 
 
Page 18 of 19 
under compliance agreement (or other appropriate regulatory tool).  After harvest is completed, the field 
must be surveyed in the areas where the susceptible crops were planted at the viability assay survey rate 
(45000cc per ha, 18,000cc per acre to a depth of 10 inches/25cm).  Any cysts found must be assayed 
using an appropriate viability testing method. 
 
The planting of a susceptible host must occur each of the next two growing seasons, followed by harvest 
and viability assay surveys and viability testing each time to any detected cysts. If all viability results are 
negative, then the bioassay is considered to be negative and the stepwise process out lined in Section 9 
may continue.

Appendix 5 - Confirmatory Policy for Suspect Potato Cyst Nematode (PCN) Infestations 
Introduction: 
This policy is specific to PCN and is based on knowledge about the biology and epidemiology of the 
organism. 
 
Specimens must be identified and confirmed by an NPPO or NPPO-approved laboratory using 
definitive morphological/morphometric and molecular identification techniques, including those 
specimens originating from a non-NPPO or non-NPPO-approved laboratory. If the pest is confirmed, 
regulatory action may result. 
 
Subsequent samples from a field with at least one confirmed positive sample do not require 
confirmatory testing. If the suspect sample is not an official sample, the collection of an official 
sample may be required. 
 
 
 
Morphological and Molecular PCN Confirmation: 
 
Complete, definitive identification of G. pallida or G. rostochiensis is a multi-step process, as follows: 
 
1. Verify that the sample contains suspect Globodera spp. or other cyst nematode genera (such as 
Cactodera). 
2. Verify that the suspect cysts and/or any juvenile forms have key characters and are 
morphometrically within the range of the PCN species. 
3. Verify that the suspect nematode tissue yields DNA identifiable as a PCN species. (As per PPQ

st nematode genera (such as 
Cactodera). 
2. Verify that the suspect cysts and/or any juvenile forms have key characters and are 
morphometrically within the range of the PCN species. 
3. Verify that the suspect nematode tissue yields DNA identifiable as a PCN species. (As per PPQ 
CPHST-Beltsville work instructions posted at www.nahln.org and Skantar et al, 2007 at 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2586493/ .) 
4. Verify that the morphological and molecular analyses concur. 
 
PCN Infested Field Confirmation: 
 
For a field to be considered infested with PCN, the following criteria should be met: 
 
    at least two cysts from two different soil samples with one of those cysts containing viable PCN 
eggs or juveniles. 
 
If the above criteria are not met, a survey using Method A must be conducted as soon as 
possible.  If no additional cysts are detected, a Viability Assay Survey must also be conducted 
following the next susceptible host crop.  If no additional cysts are detected after these surveys 
then the regulatory controls can be removed.   
 
Fields that do not meet the terms of this policy will not be considered as infested, however, continued 
monitoring of the fields would be prudent after any susceptible host crops.
