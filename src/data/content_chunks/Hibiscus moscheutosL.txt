Plant Notes:  Common Marsh Mallow is a native herbaceous perennial in the Hibiscus family (Malvaceae). It is found throughout Alabama. Common Marsh Mallow occurs around ponds and lakes, along rivers and streams, around beaver ponds and sloughs, and in wet pastures and roadside ditches. It is a perennial with a woody crown. The roots are thick, cord-like, and often spongy. Several stems 4-8 feet in height are produced from each crown. The stems are usually unbranched, reddish in color, and pubescent with star shaped hairs. Leaves are alternate, petiolate, lanceolate, elliptic, or 3-lobed in outline, with crenate or serrate margins. The leaves are pubescent, especially on the lower surface. Flowers are solitary from the axils of the upper leaves. Each flower has a pubescent pedicel, 10-14 linear bracts, and a green calyx with 5 triangular lobes. The flowers are funnelform with 5 white to pink petals. The petals have a red spot at their base. The numerous stamens are fused with the style. The fruit is a capsule surrounded by the papery calyx. Common Marsh Mallow is one of the parents of the “hardy” perennial Hibiscus plants common in gardens throughout the south.
