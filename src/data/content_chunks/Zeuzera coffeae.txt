 Invasion: The larva, when fully grown, is about 50 mm long and orange-red. The head, thoracic plate and anal plate are brownish-black; young larvae are darker in colour.The adult moth is variable in size, with a wingspan from 30 to 50 mm. The thorax is white with four blue-black spots near the margin. The forewings are white with numerous steel-blue spots, chiefly between the veins; sometimes a larger spot is present near the middle of the wing. The abdomen is variegated blue.

 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: No encontrado
 Reproduccion: The eggs are laid in crevices in the bark; the egg stage lasts for 9-30 days.The larvae tunnel within twigs and branches of the host plant, causing the leaves to wither and possibly the branches to die. Seedlings can be killed when the main stem is attacked. The larvae overwinter in the stems when fully grown. The larval stage lasts for 73-205 days.The pupa is also situated in the feeding place. The pupal stage lasts for 19-36 days ( Chang, 1984 ). After emergence, the pupal skin protrudes from the exit hole.The adult moth lives for up to 18 days. In that time females may lay between 190 and 1134 eggs. In Taiwan, adults emerge in April-June and August-October. In Anhui Province of China, Yang et al. (1997) found that there was one generation a year; whereas in Taiwan, Chang (1984) recorded two discreet generations, although larvae are present all the year round with the highest population density in June-July and October-November.
 Sintomas: Because of internal boring, branches and twigs wilt quickly and then become brittle and easily break off; there are holes visible from which the frass is exuded.
