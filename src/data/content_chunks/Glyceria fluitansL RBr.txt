Glyceria fluitans(L.) R.Br. - Flote-grass  -Gramineae / Poaceae© Paul Hackney© Ian Dodkins© Ian Dodkins(Map updated: March 2008)A perennial, succulent, aquatic grass, very common and widespread in shallow water in ponds, lakes, rivers, canals etc. The long narrow leaves float on the water and lie in the direction of the stream flow (if any). The stems rise up to about three or four feet in height out of the water and carry long narrow spikelets of flowers. The spikelets are similar in appearance to those of otherGlyceriaspecies, and close attention to length of the spikelets, and size and shape of  their parts, is necessary to clearly distinguish the species of this genus.All names:Glyceria fluitans(L.)
