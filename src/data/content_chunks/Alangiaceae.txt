Leaves alternate, simple, estipulate, bases often oblique. Flowers bisexual, actinomorphic, often bracteate, in axillary cymes. Calyx lobes 4-10, toothlike or obsolete. Petals as many as calyx lobes, valvate, linear to lorate, sometimes basally coherent. Stamens as many as petals or 2-4 × as many, distinct, arising from an enlarged disk; anthers 2-celled, dehiscing longitudinally. Ovary inferior, commonly 1- or rarely 2-loculed; ovule solitary, pendulous; style and stigma simple, or 2- or 3-lobed. Fruit a drupe, crowned with persistent calyx and disk. Seeds 1 or 2, with straight embryo and copious endosperm.One genus and ca. 21 species: tropical and subtropical regions from Africa east to Australia and Fiji; 11 species (four endemic) in China.Alangiaceae are treated here as separate from the Cornaceae, into which they have sometimes been placed.
