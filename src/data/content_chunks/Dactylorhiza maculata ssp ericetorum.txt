Dactylorhiza maculata ssp. ericetorum(Linton) P.Hunt & Summerh. - Heath Spotted-Orchid (subspecies)  -Orchidaceae© Robert Thompson© Graham Day© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)Heath Spotted-Orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata). This is a very common species similar to the Common Spotted-Orchid (and only separated from it as a distinct species in relatively recent times) but usually less heavily spotted than that species, and with the lower lip of the flower having a comparatively small middle lobe. The lip is marked with dots and dashes of a deep lilac, the petals being a paler colour varying from whitish to a deep lilac-rose.It is a plant of rough or uncultivated acid grassland, damp moorland, and dry heaths. It frequently grows in company with the Common Spotted-Orchid and so-called 'hybrid swarms' may then occur.It tends to have fewer flowers in the spike than the Common-Spotted Orchid and comes into flower somewhat earlier.All Irish plants belong to the subspeciesericetorum.All names:Dactylorhiza maculata ssp. ericetorum(Linton) P.Hunt & Summerh.;Dactylorchis maculata ssp. ericetorum(E.F.Linton) Vermeul.;Orchis ericetorum(E.F.Linton) E.S.Marshall;Orchis maculataauct.;Dactylorhiza elodesauct.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
