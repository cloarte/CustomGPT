 Invasion: T. minutais an erect, woody annual herb, usually 0.5–2 m tall with strongly odorous foliage. The taproots are usually short and tapering, and surrounded by fibrous lateral roots, which form mycorrhizal associations. The stems are typically erect, woody, and grooved or ridged, initially green but often maturing to brownish or reddish. They are usually branched only in the upper part, unless broken or cut off near the base. Leaves occur in opposite pairs on the main stem and usually singly on the laterals. Leaves are 5–20 cm long, slightly glossy-green and are pinnately compound with 4–6 pairs of pinnae, opposite below and alternate or opposite above. Leaflets are narrowly lanceolate, sharply toothed and 2–4 cm long. The undersurface of the leaves bears a number of small, punctate, orange, multicellular glands, which exude a licorice-like aroma when ruptured. Glands occur beside the midribs and towards the margins of each leaflet, and may also be found in the stem and involucre bracts. The scented, panicle-like infloresc

 undersurface of the leaves bears a number of small, punctate, orange, multicellular glands, which exude a licorice-like aroma when ruptured. Glands occur beside the midribs and towards the margins of each leaflet, and may also be found in the stem and involucre bracts. The scented, panicle-like inflorescences consist of 20–80 narrowly cylindrical flower heads. The heads are small, 10–15 mm long and 3–4 mm in diameter, surrounded by 4–5 fused involucre bracts, and dotted with glands not splitting apart at maturity. Ray and disk flowers barely extend beyond the phyllaries; ray flowers are 3–5 yellow-orange florets, disk flowers are 10–15 yellow-orange (Soule, 1996). The dark-brown achenes are 10–20 mm long, with a pappus of 1–4 tiny scales and 0–2 retrosely serrulate awns, which are 1–3 mm long. The slender black fruits are 5–8 mm long, finely hairy, and tipped with a chaffy pappus of 4–8 scales of different lengths.The seedlings have epigeal germination. The slender, often reddish, hypocotyls are 1.0–1.5 cm long, and end in elongate cotyledons about 1 cm long which are often reddish below. The first pair of leaves are deeply divided into three segments with a large terminal lobe and have irregularly toothed edges.

 Reproduccion: Genetics No chromosome number has been recorded for T. minuta . Flowers are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects. Galicia, (1995) has distinguished four phenotypes of T. minuta on the basis of the morphological traits of capitula. Three chemotypes, which differ in biomass and essential oil yield of inflorescence and leaves, were identified by Gil et al. (2000) . Physiology and phenology T. minuta is an annual herbaceous weed that flowers 120–150 days after emergence ( Aranha et al., 1982 ). Under controlled conditions flowering is initiated by 13 hours daylength ( Luciani-Gresta, 1975 ). When grown outdoors the plant flowered in July and in Zimbabwe, average seed production per plant was 29,100 ( Schwerzel, 1967 ). However, in less sunny areas or far northern regions, plants may not flower. The seeds lie loosely within the upright tubular inflorescences until shaken out, and are distributed attached to clothing and animals and with soil, water and plant debris. Reproductive biology T. minuta has a relative small seed, with no dormancy stage, and 7–8 month longevity. It has an aerial seed bank, which compensates for the lack of a persistent soil seed bank. The seeds have hooks, which aid in animal dispersal, as well as secondary products that prevent herbivory ( Martinez-Ghersa et al., 2000 ). The plant is propagated by seeds, which germinate over a period of 48 h; most seeds germinate between 20 and 30°C (optimal 25°C). Germination of fresh seed may be as high as 95%.

Germination of fresh seed may be as high as 95%. At 36°C, the achenes become thermoinhibited and do not germinate; however, once the temperature is reduced below 35°C, germination occurs but is spread over a reduced period of 24 h. The thermoinhibited proteins may result in the prevention of radical emergence at unfavourable temperatures. Seeds do not require light for germination; however, they respond to it very positively, so that germination only occurs from seeds near the soil surface and most seedlings emerge from soil depths of less than 6 mm ( Holm et al., 1997 ). Detailed studies on some aspects of its germination have been conducted by Forsyth and van Staden (1983), Drewes and van Staden (1991) and ( Hills et al., 2001 ). Mohamed et al. (1998) has developed an efficient in vitro propagation protocol for T. minuta .
