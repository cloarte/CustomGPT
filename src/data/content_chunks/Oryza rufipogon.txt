 Invasion: Oryza rufipogonin the strictest sense is an erect, perennial tufted or stoloniferous grass, 150-400 cm tall, with erect to trailing culms spongy below, the lower parts floating and rooting at the nodes, the upper parts sub-erect, culm nodes glabrous and hollow. In the broadest sense, as used for the purposes of this datasheet,O. rufipogonsensu lato includes a range of annual types intermediate betweenO. rufipogonsensu stricto andO. sativa. These types, however, have much the same morphology, other than being annual. Studies on the germplasm of 202 wild rice shows that there is an annual type in China. The characteristics investigated include 13 morphological characters, ratooning ability from node cuttings, mode of reproduction and the germination of seed harvested in the current year or stored for 2-3 years (Pang and Wang, 1996). Leaf blades linear, involute in bud (also when dry), acute, flat, somewhat glaucous, scabrid on margins and main nerves, 15-18 cm x 10-25 mm. Leaf sheaths loose, cylindrical, glabrous with distinct auricles at the junction with the blade. Auricles 1-8 mm long, 1 mm wide at the base, 0.3 mm wide at the tip, narrow, curved, glabrous or lined with long hairs to 2 mm long. Ligule, triangular, an unfringed membrane up to 17 mm long, divided into acute points. Roots, fibrous, often with rhizomes.

 Reproduccion: Genetics The chromosome number is 2n=24 ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2024 ). Environmental requirements Oryza rufipogon is a perennial, tufted grass which grows in shallow water. It is a close relative of cultivated rice, O. sativa , and shares many of the characteristics of the crop. It is tolerant to flooding and acid soils ( Mandal and Gupta, 1997 ). It is suited to clay/loam soil ( Watve et al., 2017 ). Vital differences from the crop are the tendency for the seed to shatter as soon as they mature and their often-prolonged dormancy. Like the crop, the seeds are unable to germinate in saturated soil. Chen (2001) reported that the number of wild rice seeds in a soil sample 1 m² x 15 cm deep ranged from 10 to 30,000. After harvest and before disk harrowing, 84.4% seeds remained in the 0-3 cm surface layer of soil. Disk cultivation helped move the seeds downward to the 3-15 cm soil layer resulting in serious infestations and control difficulties. O. rufipogon has similar ecological requirements to the crop and hence tends to benefit from most of the conditions created by farmers for their rice crops. Reproductive biology Reproduces by seed and vegetatively from rhizomes. Seeds fall near the parent plant or disperse to greater distances as rice seed contaminants, with human activities, water, soil movement and possibly birds (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2001).

Reproductive biology Reproduces by seed and vegetatively from rhizomes. Seeds fall near the parent plant or disperse to greater distances as rice seed contaminants, with human activities, water, soil movement and possibly birds (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2001). O. rufipogon seeds are typically dormant at maturity. Dormancy is partly due to the presence of inhibitors in the seed coat. The seed may remain dormant and viable for up to 3 years or more under field conditions, depending on the biotype and environment. Many seeds decay during long periods of flooded conditions. Germination typically occurs between 15°C and 40°C. Seeds often germinate slightly sooner and at lower temperatures than commercial rice seeds. Some biotypes emerge from soil depths of up to 12 cm (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2001). Chen (2001) reported that in a pot experiment, 98% of O. rufipogon seeds germinated within the 0-4 cm soil layer and only 0.8% seeds germinated in the 4-15 cm soil layer. A field investigation further proved that seeds of O. rufipogon germinated almost exclusively in the 0-4 cm layer, with very few seeds germinating below a depth of 4 cm. Chen (2001) reported that the growth duration of O. rufipogon lasted about 130 days, 30-40 days shorter than rice cultivar IR8. The period from the start of inflorescence to seed maturation lasted only 14-15 days and the starch transport stage lasted only 10 days. In a pot experiment, a single O. rufipogon plant produced 86 tillers, 38 panicles and over 1000 seeds.

In a pot experiment, a single O. rufipogon plant produced 86 tillers, 38 panicles and over 1000 seeds. Although O. rufipogon is carefully controlled in rice fields, it reproduces heavily in irrigation canals, shedding its seeds in irrigation water and, thus, re-infesting commercial fields ( Rojas and Agüero, 1996 ). Physiology and phenology In China, O. rufipogon flowers and fruits April to May and October to November ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2024 ). The long-barbed awns of O. rufipogon were found to enhance the detachment of matured seeds from the panicles in the initial seed dispersal step. They regulated vertical orientation in the air, and the vertical form may enable seeds to squeeze to the ground. Awned seeds also showed advantages in horizontal movements in the water and on the ground. Seeds with full awns showed the best performance for seed dispersal which suggests that wild rice keeps long awns to survive under natural conditions ( Amarasinghe et al., 2020 ).
