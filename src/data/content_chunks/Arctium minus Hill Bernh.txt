Arctium minus(Hill) Bernh. - Lesser Burdock  -Compositae / Asteraceae© John Wilde© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)Burdocks have very large pointed-oval leaves and spiny thistle-like flowers. The flowers are succeeded by the fruiting heads which are covered with hooked spines. These spiny heads or 'burs' give the plant its name. They have developed as a means of fruit dispersal, latching on to animal fur or human clothing. The lesser burdock is by far the commonest burdock in Northern Ireland. It is a plant of roadside hedge banks, woodland margins, waste ground and streamsides.All names:Arctium minus(Hill) Bernh.;Arctium minus agg.Bernh.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
