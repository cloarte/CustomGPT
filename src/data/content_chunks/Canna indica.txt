 Invasion: Canna indicais a rhizomatous, perennial, erect, robust herb, up to 3.5 m tall. Rhizome branching horizontally, up to 60 cm long and 10 cm in diameter, with fleshy segments resembling corms, covered with scale leaves, and thick fibrous roots. Stem fleshy, arising from the rhizome, usually 1-1.5 m tall, often tinged with purple. Leaves arranged spirally with large open sheaths, sometimes shortly petiolate; blade narrowly ovate to narrowly elliptical, up to 60 cm x 15-27 cm, entire, base rounded to cuneate, gradually attenuate to the sheath, apex acuminate, midrib prominent, underside often slightly purplish. Inflorescence terminal, racemose, usually simple but sometimes branched, bearing single or paired, irregular, bisexual flowers; bracts broadly obovate. 1-2 x 1 cm; sepals 3, ovate, acute, 1-1.5 x 0.4-0.9 cm; corolla 4-5 cm long, the lowermost 1 cm fused into a tube, lobes free; lobes 3, linear, 3-4 x 0.3-0.6 cm, pale red to yellow; androecium petaloid and forming the showy part of the flower, composed of an outer whorl of three staminodes and an inner whorl of two connate staminodes (one of which forms a large lip or labellum) and one fertile stamen; outer stamin

Fruit a loculicidally dehiscent ovoid capsule, 3 x 2.5 cm, outside with soft spines, initially green or purplish in colour and covered in numerous short projections (they are verrucose), but turning brown as they mature and possibly losing some or all of their tiny projections. They split open at maturity to release numerous smooth, black, rounded (spherical) or egg-shaped (ovoid) seeds, 0.5 cm in diameter. Fruiting occurs mainly during summer and early autumn.

 Reproduccion: Genetics Canna indica is a problematic species complex in which flower colour as well as length, number and shape of staminodes are extremely variable. Sometimes chromosome countings of 2n=27 is reported (triploid species), but Tanaka et al. (2009) record and confirm many reports of a diploid chromosome number 2n=18. Numerous, mainly unnamed, cultivars exist. Reproductive Biology Canna indica reproduces almost entirely from rhizomes. Reproduction in diploid forms may occur by seed, the species being autogamous ( Rambuda and Johnson, 2004 ). Physiology and Phenology Plantings of C. indica will increase in size as a result of asexual reproduction. Seedlings are rarely observed in dense plantings but can often be found at the boundaries where there is soil free from plants. Germination from seeds can occur in the field provided there is exposed soil; seedlings of C. indica took about 2 weeks to appear after complete removal of the plants ( Ciciarelli, 2012 ). Some studies suggest that C. indica flowers are pollinated by hawkmoths, however a variety of insects including bees, moths and butterflies, as well as hummingbirds, have been observed visiting Canna flowers ( Darsini et al., 2015 ). Cross pollination between different plantings/colonies may occur, possibly accounting for the variability that exists in several morphological traits, particularly flowers in this species (

 C. indica flowers are pollinated by hawkmoths, however a variety of insects including bees, moths and butterflies, as well as hummingbirds, have been observed visiting Canna flowers ( Darsini et al., 2015 ). Cross pollination between different plantings/colonies may occur, possibly accounting for the variability that exists in several morphological traits, particularly flowers in this species ( Ciciarelli, 2012 ). Recently, studies have indicated a high-quality reference genome which may provide new insights into the molecular basis of flower colouration in C. indica ( Liu et al., 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Canna indica grows well in various tropical and sub-tropical climates. A well distributed annual rainfall of 1000-1200 mm is satisfactory. It seems to be daylength neutral, as it grows and flowers under a broad range of photoperiodic conditions. However, studies into the best light-growing conditions showed that C. indica grown in low light has the best growth with increased height, leaf area, and root and shoot dry weights, but decreased leaf thickness, which caused the increase in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and leaf weight ratio, but decreased root to shoot ratio. These findings indicate that C. indica can be used as an intercropping plant under tree canopies ( Sasaerila et al., 2021 ). It is affected by drought, but tolerates excessive moisture (but not waterlogging). It is very tolerant of shade. Windy conditions can tear the leaves to shreds. Normal growth occurs at temperatures above 10°C, but it also survives high temperatures of 30-32°C. It can be found in many temperate countries as a garden ornamental, and even though it can tolerate light frosts, it cannot survive persistent cold temperatures therefore it could not naturalize in such climates.

C. indica grows from sea-level up to 1000-2900 m altitude. It thrives on many soils, including those marginal for most other tuber crops (e.g. weathered, acidic latosols). Preferred soils are deep sandy loams, rich in humus. It tolerates a pH range of 4.5-8.0. Growth and Development Rhizome cuttings develop into harvestable plants in 6-8 months after planting. A rhizome is considered mature when the triangular slit in the outer scale leaf of the rhizome has turned purple. In tropical regions, flowering starts a few months after planting and flowers continue to appear as long as the plant lives. In regions where frost can be expected, rhizomes should be lifted and overwintered at about 7°C.
