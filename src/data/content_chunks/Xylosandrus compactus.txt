 Invasion: EggsThe egg of X. compactus is about 0.3 mm wide and 0.5 mm long. It is white and ovoid with a smooth surface (Hara and Beardsley, 1979). The incubation period varies from 3 to 5 days with over 80% of eggs hatching after 4 days (Hara and Beardsley, 1979).LarvaeThe mature larva is about 2.0 mm long. The body is creamy white with a pale-brown head. It has no legs. The mean head width of final-instar larvae is about 0.36 mm (Ngoan et al., 1976). A detailed description of the larva has not been published.PupaeThe pupae are illustrated by Hara and Beardsley (1979). The body of the pupa is creamy white and exarate. It is about the same length as the adult.AdultsBright (1968)provided a brief description of the female and male of X. compactus.

The adult females are dark brown to almost black, 1.4-1.9 mm long and about two times longer than wide. The front of the head is convex, with a weak transverse impression just above the mouthparts. The antennal funicle is five-segmented, and the antennal club is obliquely truncate, about 1.2 times longer than wide. The pronotum, viewed from above, is subcircular. The anterior margin of the pronotum is broadly rounded, with 6-8 (sometimes 10) distinct, equal-sized serrations. The anterior half of the pronotum is finely asperate whereas the posterior portion is smooth with distinct, shallow punctures. The elytra are 1.1 times longer than wide, convex and steeply declivitous posteriorly. The strial punctures on the elytra are distinctly impressed, about equal in size to those between the striae. Each interstria bears a row of long setae, these are about two times longer than the interstrial width. The steeply convex, posterior portion of the elytra is similar to the remaining portion of the elytra.The small, wingless males are about 0.8-1.1 mm long and two times longer than wide. The pronotum is narrowly rounded in front without serrations. The anterior portion of the pronotum is flattened and slightly concave in the median portion and the asperities are very low, almost obsolete.The elytral striae and interstrial are irregularly punctured.A partial list of illustrations of the adult is given inWood and Bright (1992)andBright and Skidmore (1997).Wood (1982) provided a key to species of Xylosandrus found

Bright and Skidmore (1997, 2002) give more recent references.Only the adult females initiate the attack on the host plants. X. compactus is mainly a borer of seedlings, shoots and small twigs, but it will also breed in cut branches and poles up to a diameter of about 6 cm, rarely in larger material ( Browne, 1961 ). Attacks in the tap root of seedlings have been noted in West Africa ( Entwistle, 1972 ), but such attacks are more likely to be caused by the related species, Xylosandrus morigerus. On cocoa seedlings in Nigeria, attacks were most abundant 20-40 cm above ground level, and on stems of 6-10 mm diameter ( Entwistle, 1972 ). The female constructs an entrance tunnel into the pith or wood of the host to a depth of 1-3 cm. The tunnel system consists of a simple or bifurcated entrance tunnel, and a longitudinal chamber or irregular tunnel where a loose cluster of eggs is deposited ( Browne, 1961 ; Entwistle, 1972 ). One or more females may occupy a twig or branch. Generally, there is only one female if the twig diameter is less than 7 mm, but up to 20 females may be found on branches of diameter 8-22 mm. Entwistle (1964) and Takenouchi and Tagaki (1967) report arrhenotokous parthenogenesis in X. compactus. Unmated females produce an all-male brood, but such broods are rare ( Brader, 1964 ; Entwistle, 1972 ).

Hara and Beardsley (1979) found seven all-male broods out of 416 examined.The size of the brood varies considerably. Browne (1961) found that in peninsular Malaysia, broods rarely exceeded 10 individuals, and in the Seychelles, the largest brood that was observed by Brown (1954) included two eggs and seven larvae. Chevalier (1931) reported broods of 30-50 individuals in tropical Africa. In one gallery system in Fiji, 26 individuals of all instars were found ( Lever, 1938 ). Entwistle (1972) found a mean of 12.3 offspring in field-collected galleries, but the number could occasionally exceed 60. The larvae feed on an ambrosia fungus growing on the walls of the gallery.The pupation and mating of brood adults occurs in the infested material; the (usually) single male in each gallery mating with his sisters. The brood adults emerge through the entrance holes made by the parent beetles. In tropical Africa, Lavabre (1958, 1959) found that oviposition began 7-8 days after the parent female began her gallery. The egg stage lasted 4-5 days, larval development took 11 days, 7 days were spent in the pupal stage and the teneral adults remained in the gallery system for another 6 days before emerging. Thus about 37 days were required from the time the female first began boring into the branch until sexual maturity of the next generation. Ngoan et al. (1976) found that approximately 28 days (at 25°C) were required for development from egg to adult. According to Ngoan et al. (1976) and Hara and Beardsley (1979), there are two larval instars. The ratio of females to males varies, but is usually

 into the branch until sexual maturity of the next generation. Ngoan et al. (1976) found that approximately 28 days (at 25°C) were required for development from egg to adult. According to Ngoan et al. (1976) and Hara and Beardsley (1979), there are two larval instars. The ratio of females to males varies, but is usually approximately 9:1 ( Entwistle, 1972 ; Hara and Beardsley, 1979).In Japan, there are normally two generations per year, and adult females overwinter, but in most parts of the range, breeding is continuous, with overlapping generations, so that the species is active at all times, and in all stages of development ( Browne, 1968 ).
 Sintomas: X. compactus bores into the current year&apos;s twigs, killing them in a few weeks or causing them to break from the weight of the crop. The pest weakens and retards the fruiting of young plants and makes the replacement of trees very difficult. The typical host symptoms that characterize X. compactus infestation are necrosis of the leaves and stem extending from the entrance hole distally to the end of the branch. Flagging of branches occurs about 5-7 days after initial tunnelling and gallery formation. Wilting of twigs and branches usually becomes evident within weeks of infestation. The entrance holes are small (0.8 mm diameter) and are located on the underside of branches. Cankers, 10-210 mm long, are commonly seen around the attacked areas of larger twigs and branches (Dixon and Woodruff, 1982). A whitish pile of dust from boring may be seen at each hole.X. compactus is one of the few species of ambrosia beetles that can attack and kill live twigs and branches. Most of the other species of ambrosia beetles primarily attack newly felled, stressed, dead or

 around the attacked areas of larger twigs and branches (Dixon and Woodruff, 1982). A whitish pile of dust from boring may be seen at each hole.X. compactus is one of the few species of ambrosia beetles that can attack and kill live twigs and branches. Most of the other species of ambrosia beetles primarily attack newly felled, stressed, dead or dying trees and shrubs. Apparently, the pathogenic action of the ambrosia fungus, Fusarium solani to the host plant enables X. compactus to attack live plants. The pathogenic action of F. solani to woody host plants has been proven by pure culture isolates of F. solani from discoloured vascular tissues of a large number of host species (Dixon and Woodruff, 1982).

Hara and Beardsley (1979) found seven all-male broods out of 416 examined.The size of the brood varies considerably. Browne (1961) found that in peninsular Malaysia, broods rarely exceeded 10 individuals, and in the Seychelles, the largest brood that was observed by Brown (1954) included two eggs and seven larvae. Chevalier (1931) reported broods of 30-50 individuals in tropical Africa. In one gallery system in Fiji, 26 individuals of all instars were found ( Lever, 1938 ). Entwistle (1972) found a mean of 12.3 offspring in field-collected galleries, but the number could occasionally exceed 60. The larvae feed on an ambrosia fungus growing on the walls of the gallery.The pupation and mating of brood adults occurs in the infested material; the (usually) single male in each gallery mating with his sisters. The brood adults emerge through the entrance holes made by the parent beetles. In tropical Africa, Lavabre (1958, 1959) found that oviposition began 7-8 days after the parent female began her gallery. The egg stage lasted 4-5 days, larval development took 11 days, 7 days were spent in the pupal stage and the teneral adults remained in the gallery system for another 6 days before emerging. Thus about 37 days were required from the time the female first began boring into the branch until sexual maturity of the next generation. Ngoan et al. (1976) found that approximately 28 days (at 25°C) were required for development from egg to adult. According to Ngoan et al. (1976) and Hara and Beardsley (1979), there are two larval instars. The ratio of females to males varies, but is usually

According to Ngoan et al. (1976) and Hara and Beardsley (1979), there are two larval instars. The ratio of females to males varies, but is usually approximately 9:1 ( Entwistle, 1972 ; Hara and Beardsley, 1979).In Japan, there are normally two generations per year, and adult females overwinter, but in most parts of the range, breeding is continuous, with overlapping generations, so that the species is active at all times, and in all stages of development ( Browne, 1968 ).
 Sintomas: X. compactus bores into the current year&apos;s twigs, killing them in a few weeks or causing them to break from the weight of the crop. The pest weakens and retards the fruiting of young plants and makes the replacement of trees very difficult. The typical host symptoms that characterize X. compactus infestation are necrosis of the leaves and stem extending from the entrance hole distally to the end of the branch. Flagging of branches occurs about 5-7 days after initial tunnelling and gallery formation. Wilting of twigs and branches usually becomes evident within weeks of infestation. The entrance holes are small (0.8 mm diameter) and are located on the underside of branches. Cankers, 10-210 mm long, are commonly seen around the attacked areas of larger twigs and branches (Dixon and Woodruff, 1982). A whitish pile of dust from boring may be seen at each hole.X. compactus is one of the few species of ambrosia beetles that can attack and kill live twigs and branches. Most of the other species of ambrosia beetles primarily attack newly felled, stressed, dead or

 around the attacked areas of larger twigs and branches (Dixon and Woodruff, 1982). A whitish pile of dust from boring may be seen at each hole.X. compactus is one of the few species of ambrosia beetles that can attack and kill live twigs and branches. Most of the other species of ambrosia beetles primarily attack newly felled, stressed, dead or dying trees and shrubs. Apparently, the pathogenic action of the ambrosia fungus, Fusarium solani to the host plant enables X. compactus to attack live plants. The pathogenic action of F. solani to woody host plants has been proven by pure culture isolates of F. solani from discoloured vascular tissues of a large number of host species (Dixon and Woodruff, 1982).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Several studies of the biology of X. compactus have been made. Browne (1961) reviewed the biology of X. compactus in South-East Asia, under the name Xylosandrus morstatti. Brader (1964) studied the biology of the pest when attacking coffee in West Africa, with particular reference to the effects of climatic factors, and relationships to the associated ambrosia fungus, and to the host plant. Kaneko (1965) and Kaneko et al. (1965) studied the biology of X. compactus in tea plants in Japan. Entwistle (1972) gives a detailed review of earlier work. Dixon and Woodruff (1982) summarized the biology and ecology of X. compactus in Florida, USA. Hara and Beardsley (1979) reported on the biology of X. compactus in Hawaii, USA. Beaver (1988) studied the biology and host associations of X. compactus in the

 plants in Japan. Entwistle (1972) gives a detailed review of earlier work. Dixon and Woodruff (1982) summarized the biology and ecology of X. compactus in Florida, USA. Hara and Beardsley (1979) reported on the biology of X. compactus in Hawaii, USA. Beaver (1988) studied the biology and host associations of X. compactus in the Seychelles. Wood and Bright (1992) give several hundred references relating to the biology, habits, taxonomy and control of X. compactus. Bright and Skidmore (1997, 2002) give more recent references.Only the adult females initiate the attack on the host plants. X. compactus is mainly a borer of seedlings, shoots and small twigs, but it will also breed in cut branches and poles up to a diameter of about 6 cm, rarely in larger material ( Browne, 1961 ). Attacks in the tap root of seedlings have been noted in West Africa ( Entwistle, 1972 ), but such attacks are more likely to be caused by the related species, Xylosandrus morigerus. On cocoa seedlings in Nigeria, attacks were most abundant 20-40 cm above ground level, and on stems of 6-10 mm diameter ( Entwistle, 1972 ). The female constructs an entrance tunnel into the pith or wood of the host to a depth of 1-3 cm. The tunnel system consists of a simple or bifurcated entrance tunnel, and a longitudinal chamber or irregular tunnel where a loose cluster of eggs is deposited ( Browne, 1961 ; Entwistle, 1972 ). One or more females may occupy a twig or branch. Generally, there is only one female if the twig diameter is less than 7 mm, but up to 20 females may be found on branches of diameter 8-22 mm. Entwistle (1964) and Takenouchi and Tagaki (1967) report arrhenotokous
