 Invasion: Commelina benghalensisbelongs to a family with 500-600 species with distinct characteristics.C. benghalensishas erect or creeping stems which assume an ascending position, are 15-40 cm long, branched and rooting at the nodes. The leaves are ovate or elliptical, acuminate, 3-7 cm long, 1-2.5 cm wide with a base narrowed into a petiole. The leaf sheath is covered in red or white hairs at the apex which is a unique identifying characteristic of this species (Webster et al., 2005). The flowers are subtended by bracts with their edges fused to a length of about 10 mm to form a flattened funnel-shaped spathe, 1.5 cm long and wide. Flowers have three lilac blue petals 3-4 mm long, the lower rather smaller than the two laterals and occasionally white. There are two anterior cells which are two-ovuled. The fruit consists of a pear-shaped capsule with five seeds and the capsule opens when mature (dehiscent). Seeds which sometimes appear sugar-coated are 2 mm long, ribbed-rough (rugose) and greyish brown in colour.C. benghalensisproduces white underground rhizomes with reduced leaves and closed modified flowers which produce subterranean seeds. These seeds are fewer but remain viable longer than the aerial ones. The species is distinguished from others by the blue flowers, the short flower stalk which does not extend above the spathe, the partially joined spathe margins and the reddish-brown hairs on the leaf sheath

 Reproduccion: Commelina benghalensis is a fleshy, herbaceous, creeping annual which becomes perennial depending on moisture conditions. It is found in wet and dry lands making it a troublesome weed in arable and plantation crops. C. benghalensis grows best in moist and highly fertile soils. Stems have a high moisture content, and once well rooted the plant can survive for long periods without moisture availability ( Wilson, 1981 ) and can then grow rapidly on the onset of rains ( Holm et al., 1977 ). It reproduces both vegetatively and by seeds. It spreads by runners which root at the nodes and by re-establishment of stem fragments. It also produces underground stolons which bear cleistogamous flowers and seeds, in addition to the normal aerial flowers ( Budd et al., 1979 ). One C. benghalensis plant can produce about 1600 seeds ( Pancho, 1964 ). Freshly shed aerial seeds have a dormancy depending on an impermeable seedcoat but will germinate following scarification or pricking of the seed. Aerial seeds germinate mainly from the upper 5 cm, while the larger subterranean seeds may emerge from depths down to 14 cm ( Budd et al., 1979 ). These authors found that a majority of seedlings in the field in Zimbabwe derived from subterranean seeds. However, Walker and

Aerial seeds germinate mainly from the upper 5 cm, while the larger subterranean seeds may emerge from depths down to 14 cm ( Budd et al., 1979 ). These authors found that a majority of seedlings in the field in Zimbabwe derived from subterranean seeds. However, Walker and Evenson (1985a , b ) concluded that the aerial seeds were the more important in Queensland, Australia. They also distinguished large and small classes of seed within the aerial and subterranean, and showed each of the four classes to have characteristic germination behaviour. Subterranean seeds had a more pronounced light requirement for germination and a higher optimum germination temperature (28 v. 24°C). They comment on the long persistence of the seeds due to dormancy and the corresponding difficulty of control. Fertilizer application reduced seed production and resulted in stunted growth when grown under artificial dense competition in cereals in Russia ( Shcherbakova, 1974 ). The rate of stem elongation, branch and leaf formation increases as the node number on the stem increases ( Chivinge and Kawisi, 1989 ). Broken stems may persist on the soil surface for several weeks or months in low moisture conditions and easily form leaves 10-14 days after moisture becomes available. Though stem cuttings on the surface regenerate easily ( Chivinge and Kawisi, 1989 ), cuttings buried deeper than 2 cm fail to regenerate ( Budd et al., 1979 ). The weed is used as fodder for pigs and rabbits in Zimbabwe. Crops are affected most severely during the first 2-5 weeks of crop growth, but mature plants can also be affected.

Overview
Appearance
Commelina benghalensis
, or tropical spiderwort, is an annual or perennial, creeping herb that is on the Federal Noxious Weed List.
Foliage
Leaves are alternate, lily-like, 1.2-2.8 in. (3-7 cm) long and often have reddish hairs towards the tip.
Flowers
Aboveground flowers are very small with relatively large lilac to blue petals and are present from the spring into the fall. Underground flowers, which grow on burrowing rhizomes, are white and very small.
Fruit
Fruits are ovoid capsules.
Ecological Threat
Commelina benghalensis
invades areas with moist soil including roadsides, grasslands and other disturbed areas. It is especially problematic in pastures and crop fields where it forms dense, pure stands that can smother other plants such as low-growing crops.
Commelina benghalensis
is native to Asia and Africa and was first found in the United States in 1963.
