Stylet 16-18 µm with pronounced knobs flattened anteriorly. Vulva anterior, 71-78%. Genital tract mono-prodelphic. Post-vulval sac about a vulval body width long. Spermatheca large, sub-rectangular in shape and filled with sperm. Tail conoid, ventrally concave with the dorsal contour sinuate just prior to the tail tip. Tail usually with 22-24 ventral annules (range 19-27). Phasmid usually conspicuous, 10-14 annules from the tail tip.Measurements (after Sher and Allen, 1953). Female: L=0.64-0.68 mm; a=27-37; b=5.5-6.1; c=16-18; V=(30-41)73-75(3.4-4.5). Male: L=0.55-0.57 mm; a=26; b=5.4-5.8; c=17-18.

 Reproduccion: P. goodeyi is a migratory endoparasitic nematode feeding in the cortex of banana, plantain and ensete roots, causing brown to purplish lesions which can spread throughout a large proportion of the roots. All stages of the nematode can invade the roots; eggs are laid in the root tissues or in the soil. The species multiplies at a significantly greater rate at lower temperatures of 16-21°C, and considerably less at higher temperatures of 25°C and above, compared with other, similar endoparasitic nematodes of banana (Pinochet et al., 1995).

 All stages of the nematode can invade the roots; eggs are laid in the root tissues or in the soil. The species multiplies at a significantly greater rate at lower temperatures of 16-21°C, and considerably less at higher temperatures of 25°C and above, compared with other, similar endoparasitic nematodes of banana (Pinochet et al., 1995). This accounts for its distribution in the cooler highlands of Africa and its presence in the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean.
 Sintomas: The endoparasitic root feeding of P. goodeyi produces necrotic lesions and destruction of cortical tissues. The lesions are initially yellow, but change to a characteristic purple and then brown when examined internally. The root surface over necrosed tissues turns black. The ensuing reduction in nutrient and water uptake causes a stunting of growth, nutrient deficiency including chlorosis, small bunches, and weak or reduced followers in bananas and plantains. Nematode feeding on tissues can cause breaking of roots around the areas of necrotic tissue, leading to toppling or uprooting of plants and the complete loss of bunches. Stunted, severely infested bananas with relatively small bunches generally have less tendency to topple compared with taller infested plants with larger and heavier bunches.
