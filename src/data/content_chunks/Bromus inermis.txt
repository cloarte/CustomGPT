 Invasion: Bromus inermisis a perennial grass with spreading rhizomes. Culms loosely tufted, erect, 50-120 cm tall, glabrous or retrorsely hairy below nodes. Leaf sheaths glabrous or shortly hairy; leaf blades flat, 20-30 cm × 4-8 mm, both surfaces and margins scabrid, glabrous or margins sparsely ciliate, apex acuminate, ligule 1-2 mm. Panicle dense at first, spreading after anthesis, 10-20 cm; branches 3-5 per node, up to 10 cm, scabrid, each bearing 2-6 spikelets. Spikelets 15-25 mm, florets 6-12; rachilla internodes 2-3 mm, spinulose; glumes lanceolate, margins membranous, lower glume 4-7 mm, 1-veined, upper glume 6-10 mm, 3-veined; lemmas oblong-lanceolate,8-12 mm, 5-7-veined, glabrous, base scabrid, apex obtuse or emarginate; awn up to 3-4 mm, or awnless; palea shorter than lemma, keels ciliate. Anthers 3-4 mm (Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023).

 Reproduccion: Genetics The chromosome number reported for B. inermis varies from 2n = 14, 28, 56 ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ). Reproductive Biology Bromus inermis is a self-incompatible grass. It reproduces by seed and through rhizome development. Plants are cross-pollinated, flower production is synchronous, and pollination may occur between plants up to 50 m apart. Seed production is variable, with plants producing between 156 and 10,080 viable seeds. This species can also reproduce vegetatively through rhizome development which begins 3 weeks to 6 months after germination ( Howard, 1996 ; DiTomaso et al., 2013 ; GISD, 2023 ). Physiology and Phenology Bromus inermis may grow and remain green year-round in warmer areas, but in colder climates it could be dormant in winter and, in general, the reproductive phenology is delayed in northern latitudes and high elevations. In areas across the Great Plains, the growth phase of B. inermis begins in early spring and continues into the late fall with flowering often occurring between May and June and seeds maturing in early to late summer. It may regrow and reflower in the fall if moisture is sufficient ( Howard, 1996 ; DiTomaso et al., 2013 ; GISD, 2023 ). In China, it

It may regrow and reflower in the fall if moisture is sufficient ( Howard, 1996 ; DiTomaso et al., 2013 ; GISD, 2023 ). In China, it has been reported flowering and fruiting from July to September ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2023 ). Longevity Bromus inermis is a perennial grass. Seeds can remain viable for 2-10 years ( Howard, 1996 ; GISD, 2023 ). Environmental Requirements Bromus inermis grows best in regions receiving more than 380 mm of annual precipitation and some cultivars are adapted to northern latitudes and high elevations where it can tolerate temperatures as low as -38ºC. It may survive at elevation ranging from 2743 m in the northern Rocky Mountains to 3300 m in the central and southern Rocky Mountains. This species is well-adapted to all soil textures, although it may not thrive on sand or heavy clay. It grows best on sunny areas with moist, well-drained soils with pH in the range 5.5-8, but tolerates acid (~pH 4.5) and poorly drained soils ( Howard, 1996 ; DiTomaso et al., 2013 ; Palit and Dekeyser, 2022 ; GISD, 2023 ). Under laboratory conditions, the germination rate of fresh, stratified seed has varied from 80-95%. Optimal temperatures for germination in greenhouse range from 20-30ºC, but as a cool-season species, it can germinate at lower temperatures. Light enhances germination but is not required. Cultivars differ in rates of germination and growth ( Howard, 1996 ; DiTomaso et al., 2013 ; Palit and Dekeyser, 2022 ; GIS
