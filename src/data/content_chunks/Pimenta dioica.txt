 Reproduccion: The basic chromosome number for the genus is x = 11; with a chromosome number of 2 n = 22 reported for P. dioica . There is a lot of variation in this species with regard to yield and essential oil content, and in Jamaica there are many varieties, including dwarfs; some varieties produce many berries whilst others do not. Mexican trees have larger berry size, but the yield is lower ( Rodriquez, 1969 ). Two seedling variant types with dwarf/semi-dwarf habits and bushy nature are being conserved in the Indian Institute of Spices Research. The leaves of these variants are around a third smaller than normal P. dioica leaves, and because of the bushy form with many branches, they may offer potential for crop improvement programmes ( Parthasarathy et al., 2008 ). Germination occurs after 9-10 days and continues over a month. There is some discrepancy over when trees become fully fruit bearing: Parthasarathy et al. (2008) state that trees grown from seed flower after 5-6 years, and take 18-20 years before becoming full bearing trees, whereas Rodriquez (1969) suggests full bearing is achieved between 25 and 35 years. Seeds can be dispersed by fruit-eating birds ( Starr et al., 2003 ) as well as lizards, bats and insects ( Rodriquez, 1969 ). Space and Flynn (2001) indicate that germination success is high, having observed ‘dense mats of seedlings’ growing under the parent tree; P. dioica seed production is >1000/m 2 ( PIER, 2017 ). Some trees can be barren, but the cause of this is currently unknown.

Some trees can be barren, but the cause of this is currently unknown. Barren trees do, however, have a higher concentration of oil in their leaves. The species does not readily thrive outside of Jamaica and Grenada, possibly due to reproductive processes when certain critical environmental factors are absent, or in an unbalanced or unsatisfactory state ( Rodriquez, 1969 ). The time and extent of flowering in P. dioica is affected by local conditions and climate, particularly the onset of spring rains ( Parthasarathy et al., 2008 ), and this can mean that flowering times can vary spatially within short distances such as between different sides of an island. In Jamaica, the main flowering period is from March to June. The functionally male trees shed copious pollen that is mainly transported by bees and wind. Pollen of functionally female trees is usually sterile, so male trees are always necessary ( Sulistiarini, 1999 ). Pimenta dioica is a perennial long-lived tree. Seeds germinating in the wild may take up to 10 years before flowering and fruiting. Full bearing can last for many years (15-25 years), and over 100 years for exceptional trees ( Rodriquez, 1969 ). Pimenta dioica is tolerant of a wide range of rainfall, temperature and altitude within tropical areas. It is somewhat selective over soil type, requiring free-draining coarse soil, preferably in limestone areas. Soil type is thought to affect reproductive output, and is a possible reason why outside of Jamaica and Grenada, the species is not as productive ( Rodriquez, 1969 ). In general, P. dioica prefers

Soil type is thought to affect reproductive output, and is a possible reason why outside of Jamaica and Grenada, the species is not as productive ( Rodriquez, 1969 ). In general, P. dioica prefers to grow in areas where average annual rainfall is 1500-1600 mm, but a range of 1000-2500 mm annual rainfall is acceptable, with only a few months with less than 100 mm rain. Mean annual temperatures range from 18 to 24°C, with a minimum of 15°C and a maximum of 32°C. This species grows best on well-drained loamy limestone soils with pH of 6.3-8.0, at elevation from sea level up to 1000 m ( Sulistiarini, 1999 ).

Allspice is the dried, unripe berries of a large evergreen tree, native to the Caribbean area. The leaves are large and leathery, about 8 inches long by 2 inches wide. The fruits are about 0.33 inch diameter, near globose, produced in clusters of a dozen or more at or near the terminals of branches. The fruit is harvested while immature, as it is then most strongly flavored. It is a drupe, with 1 or 2 seeds. The whole dried fruit is ground to produce the allspice powder of commerce. Both pulp and seeds are aromatic, and contain an oil with qualities similar to clove oil.
