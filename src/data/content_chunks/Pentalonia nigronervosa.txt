Previous|NextPentalonia nigronervosais a tropical and subtropical aphid species with a preference for banana.Common names.Banana aphid.Distribution.This aphid is a tropical and subtropical aphid species. It has been introduced greenhouses in Europe and North America.Host associations.It has a narrow host range, limited to mostly banana and otherMusaspecies (Musaceae), but occasionally is found onHeliconia(Heliconiaceae).Economic importance.It is particularly important on banana and its varieties. It can easily be confused with its congener,P. caladii, which is found in similar habitats, but typically feeds on ginger (Zingiberaceae) and taro (Araceae), and related species.  It has been implicated in the transmission of 3 plant viruses.See also.Taxonomy at Aphid Species File.Aphids on the World's Plants.Literature references.AllLifeHabitusHeadAbdomen
