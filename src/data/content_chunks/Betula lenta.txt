Uses
A beer is made from birch bark. Fernald et al., (1958) quote an old English
recipe for the beer:
"To every Gallon of Birch-water put a quart of Honey, well stirr'd together;
then boil it almost an hour with a few Cloves, and a little Limon-peel, keeping
it well scumm'd.  When it is sufficiently boil'd, and become cold, add to it
three or four Spoonfuls of good Ale to make it work...and when the Test begins
to settle, bottle it up . . . it is gentle, and very harmless in operation
within the body, and exceedingly sharpens the Appetite, being drunk ante
pastum."
According to Grieve (1931), Kamschatka natives drink the sap without previous
fermentation.  In Spring, the inner bark can be cut up into noodle-sized strips
and cooked as birch "noodles."  Like maple sap, the sap can be used for honey,
syrup, or sugar after boiling down.  Wood used by cabinet makers.  The oil
distilled from the wood is insectifugal and can be used to preserve furs.

syrup, or sugar after boiling down.  Wood used by cabinet makers.  The oil
distilled from the wood is insectifugal and can be used to preserve furs.
Sweet Birch oil is used as a counter irritant for arthralgia and neuralgia,
usually in balms, liniments, and ointments.  It is used to impart a wintergreen
flavor in such things as baked goods, candies, chewing gums, dairy desserts,
gelatins, puddings, and root beer, rarely constituting as much as 0.1% of candy
(Leung, 1980).  Used in cosmetic shampoos (List and Horhammer, 1969–1979), and
in the sugar industry for flavoring and in perfumery.  Birch tar oil, distilled
from the wood and bark of Betula pendula Roth is used for eczema, psoriasis,
and other skin diseases.
Folk Medicine
According to Hartwell (1967–1971), the birch species are used in folk remedies
for abdominal and mammary cancers and carcinomas and warts.  Reported to be
alterative, anodyne, antiseptic, counterirritant, deobstruent, depurative,
diaphoretic, diuretic, parasiticide, pectoral, stomachic, and vulnerary, sweet birch is a folk remedy for burns, chafing, cold, cough, dandruff,
dysentery, dysmenorrhea, gout, gravel, lumbago, rheumatism, scalds, sciatica,
and sores (Duke and Wain,1981; List and Horhammer, 1969–1979; Erichsen-Brown,
1979).

and sores (Duke and Wain,1981; List and Horhammer, 1969–1979; Erichsen-Brown,
1979).  The bark has been used as an astringent, antiseptic,
antipyretic, and antirheumatic.  Cherokee chewed the leaves for
dysentery and used the bark tea for colds, dysentery, milky urine, and stomach
ailments.  Delaware used the bark decoction as cathartic or emetic.  Iroquois
used it for colds, fever, soreness, and venereal diseases.  Ojibwa used
bark as diuretic.  In the days of Milspaugh, much of the so-called oil in
wintergreen was made instead from young birch, there being little variance
between oil of wintergreen and oil of birch (Duke,1983c).
Chemistry
Per 100 g, the leaves are reported to contain, on a zero-moisture basis, 28.1 g
protein, 8.6 g fat, 55.6 g total carbohydrate, 16.9 g fiber, and 7.7 g ash
(Miller, 1958).  Hager's Handbuch lists 3% monotropitoside (Salicylic-acid

) and 0.23–0.6% essential oil, 99.8% of
which is methysaliclate.  Buds contain 4–6% essential oil containing betulol.
According to Morton (1977), the distilled oil contains 97–99% methyl salicylate
(List and Horhammer, 1969–1979).
Toxicity
Very toxic orally, methyl salicylate can be absorbed through the skin,
resulting in human fatalities.  As little as 4, 700 mg can be fatal in children
(Leung, 1980).
Description
Aromatic tree with brown, exfoliating bark on young stems, twigs glabrous.
Leaves ovate or elliptic, 2.7–10 cm long, 1.5–6 cm wide, pubescent on the veins
beneath, apically acute or acuminate; sharply serrate, base cordate, rounded or
cuneate; petioles usually pubescent, 0.8–1.9 cm long.  Pistillate catkins
cylindric or oblong, 1.2–3.4 cm long, 0.6–1.2 cm broad; bracts glabrous;

(2
n
= 28).
Distribution
Southern Maine to southern Ontario, southern to eastern Ohio and Delaware,
along the mountains to Alabama and Georgia.
Ecology
Estimated to range from Cool Temperate Moist to Wet through Boreal Moist to Wet
Forest Life Zones, and to tolerate annual precipitation of ca 6 to 15 dm,
annual temperature of 5 to 12°C, and pH of 4.5 to 7.5.  Farther south
in rich woods and heath balds.
Cultivation
For the oil, birch is usually harvested from the wild.  Birch seeds do best if
stratified, or can be sown after collection in late summer or fall.  Seed is
broadcast and covered very lightly (2–5 mm) keeping the seedbed moist if
possible.  Epigeal germination is usually complete 4–6 weeks after spring
sowing.  Seedlings require light shade during their first summer.
Harvesting
Midrange this flowers from April to May, fruits ripening from August to
September, the seeds dispersing from September to November (Agriculture
Handbook 450).  Birch seed is collected by picking or stripping the cones while
they are still green (to prevent shattering).  Ripe cones, on the other hand,
are placed in, bags to prevent loss of seed.  Seedling densities of 250–475 m

are suggested.

2
are suggested.
Yields and Economics
Most sources indicate that birch oil, which replaced wintergreen oil, has been
largely replaced by synthetic methyl salicylate.  Salicylic acid is now
synthesized and selling at ca $2.50 to $3.00 per kilo.  Salicylic acid in
technical form is used as a coupling agent dye intermediates, in the foundry
industry as a curing agent in the production of shell moulding compounds, as an
agent for retarding the vulcanization process in rubber, as a preservative for
glues and leather goods, and in alkyl/alkyd resins and latex paints (CMR, Dec.
13, 1982).
Energy
According to the phytomass files (Duke, 1981b), annual productivity ranges from
3 to 12 MT/ha in various species of birch, standing biomass 2–220 MT/ha.
Rather lower productivity and standing biomass are reported by Cannell (1982).
If there were a decent market for the oil of the bark and wood, then most of
the aerial biomass could be an energetic byproduct.
