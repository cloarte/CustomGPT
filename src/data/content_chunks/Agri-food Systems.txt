The use of new technologies and techniques in agriculture, such as satellite imagery, remote sensing, and geographic information systems, enable the transformation of data into actionable information. Geospatial technologies and agricultural data represent an opportunity to find new ways of reducing hunger and poverty through more accessible and integrated data-driven solutions. Applying sophisticated data and technology to FAO’s programmes can help us to identify challenges and opportunities to ensure that the planet can continue to sustain us, now and in the future. The development, continuous improvement, and scaling up of ICTs and Agro-informatics Digital Public Goods are an integral part of FAO’s work and one of the Organization’s core IT services.  They are essential to FAO’s work in  delivering the tools for more evidence-based decision-making , accurate natural resource management, improved production and strengthen early warning systems.

s strategic technical initiatives from Hand-in-Hand to OneHealth. One of the key pillars is working with technical teams throughout the Organization to ensure the good functioning, continuous improvement and interoperability of FAO digital tools. FAO Agro-informatics Platform The Agro-informatics Platform, led by the Digital FAO and Agro-informatics Division's Agro-informatics team, is a digital public good that helps analyze and compare data on food and agriculture to reduce poverty, hunger and increase economic development. Building on the first and still growing success of the flagship FAO Hand-in-Hand Geospatial platform , the technical arm of FAO Hand-in-Hand Initiative , FAO's expanded Agro-informatics Platform (AP) aims to showcase through more digital capabilities and developments all the new possibilities that are opening now to enable more targeted interventions on the ground. Besides data and geospatial, more elements have now been incorporated, with more content in terms of knowledge, information as well as new techniques, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). To access the Agro-informatics Platform, click here For the training material -guides and tutorials- consult our Resources and Training section. Hand-in-Hand Geospatial Platform FAO's open-access Hand in Hand (HIH) Geospatial Platform provides advanced information, including food security indicators and agricultural statistics, for more targeted agriculture interventions. The platform unlocks millions of data layers from different domains and sources to serve as the key enabling tool for FAO's HiH Initiative.

FAO Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) EMPRES Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) supports veterinary services by facilitating the organization and access to regional and global disease information. Timely and reliable disease information enhances early warning and response to transboundary and high impact animal diseases, including emergent zoonoses, and supports prevention, improved management and progressive approach to control. Climate Risk ToolBox The Climate Risk ToolBox (CRTB) allows users to conduct climate risk screenings in a few steps, and to obtain a comprehensive report that includes climate-resilient measures and tailored recommendations to prevent and reduce climate risk. The CRTB includes a repository of up-to-date climatic, geographical, social, and economic geospatial information which helps identify the climate-related risk in any area of interest worldwide.
