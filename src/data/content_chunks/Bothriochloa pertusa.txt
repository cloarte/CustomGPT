Uses
Much valued as a good fodder grass, both for grazing and for stacking.
Satisfactory for lawns, as it sends out numerous creeping shoots which root at
the nodes.  Although valued by some for pasture, others consider it a weed.  In
the Virgin Islands, e.g., some forms are difficult to eradicate and replace
with better pasture grasses (Bogdan, 1977).
Folk Medicine
No data uncovered.
Chemistry
On a zero moisture basis the early-bloom grass (34.7% DM) contains 5.7% CP,
34.9% CF, 11.7% ash, 1.0% EE, 46.7% NFE (Venezuela); the mature grass (India)
contains 3.9% CP, 37.9% CF, 10.0% ash, 2.3% EE, 45.9% NFE; the hay (94.3% DM)
contains 5.7% CP, 34.9% CF, 11.7% ash, 1.0% EE, 46.7% NFE (India) (Gohl, 1981).

Description
Stoloniferous or tufted perennial grass; culms ascending, branching, sometimes
long running, rooting at the nodes, about 30 cm tall, much taller when
cultivated; sheaths rounded; leaf-blades flat; panicle axis shorter than the
lower branches, purplish, emitting an aromatic odor when crushed; racemes few
to several, sparsely villous; first glumes of sessile spikelets always pitted;
awn of sessile spikelet geniculate, 10–15 mm long; pedicellate spikelet about
as long and broad as the sessile ones.  2
n
= 60.  Fl.  summer-fall.
Germplasm
Reported from the Africa, Mediterranean, and Near East Centers of Diversity,
comagueyana or cvs thereof is reported to tolerate drought, grazing, and slope.
Both apomictic and sexual reproduction have been observed in India, the latter
predomina.tly.  (2
n
= 40, 60)
Distribution
Widely distributed in Old World Tropics, from Arabia and Tropical Africa to
Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.  Considered one of the better
pasture grasses in the West Indies, Uganda and India.  Sparingly introduced in
southern United States on experimental basis.

Widely distributed in Old World Tropics, from Arabia and Tropical Africa to
Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.  Considered one of the better
pasture grasses in the West Indies, Uganda and India.  Sparingly introduced in
southern United States on experimental basis.
Ecology
Ranging from Warm Temperate Moist through Tropical Very Dry to Wet Forest Life
Zones, comagueyana is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 5 to 40 dm
(mean of 7 cases = 13.9), annual temperature of 17 to 27°C (mean of
7 cases = 23.3), and pH of 5.0 to 7.8 (mean of 7 cases = 6.9) (Duke,
1978,1979).  Bogdan (1977) suggests that it occurs where rainfall is 500–900
mm, mainly on well drained soil.  Rather common in disturbed as well as
undisturbed areas, along roadsides, and in rather dry areas.  Can withstand
moderate periods of drought.  Thrives on a wide range of soils in tropical
climates.  Does not tolerate frost.
Cultivation
Cultivated mainly in pasture mixtures.  Also seeded along roadside embankments
in warmer regions.  Germinated quickly and established readily.
Harvesting
Mature plants stand repeated cutting, continuous grazing and trampling.
Because of its ability to withstand being trampled and its habit to send out
rooting shoots, it is used for lawns.  Moisture-free grass contains 8.8%
protein, 33% fiber, 46.1% N-free extract and 1.7% fat.
Yields and Economics
Said to be low yielding (Gohl, l981), but yield figures approach 15 MT

Yields and Economics
Said to be low yielding (Gohl, l981), but yield figures approach 15 MT DM/ha.
An excellent pasture grass in many tropical areas of the world, as West Indies,
East Africa, India, in the last where it is suggested for reseeding degraded
grassland.  Used to some extent in warmer parts of the United States along
roadsides.
Energy
According to the phytomass files (Duke, 1981b), annual productivity ranges to
15 MT/ha.
Biotic Factors
Following fungi have been reported on this grass:
Balansia sclerotica,
Claviceps purpurea, Physoderma bothriochloae, Puccinia cesatii, P. duthiae, P.
erythroaeensis, P. pusilla, Sphacelotheca tenuis, Ustilago bothrioch- loae,
Uromyces andropogonis-annulati.
