Imported fire ants are one hitch-
hiker you want to avoid. Their 
painful sting can hurt people,  
injure animals, and harm  
U.S. agriculture. They can also  
cause you significant delays on  
the road—24 to 48 hours—if  
Federal or State agriculture  
inspectors find these ants in your truck or on the cargo you’re 
carrying. So, if you’re hauling baled hay, straw, nursery stock, 
sod, loose soil, or soil-caked heavy equipment, read on to find 
out what you need to do to keep these ants from hitching a ride.
 
Know the Risk 
To stop the spread of imported fire ants, the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) and State departments of agriculture regulate 
the movement of certain items out of areas where we know 
imported fire ant colonies exist. Quarantined areas include all 
of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South 
Carolina, and Puerto Rico and portions of Arkansas, California, 
New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, 
and Virginia. To see the most current quarantine map, visit 
www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-health/ifa and click the “Imported 
Fire Ant Quarantine Map” link. 
Avoid Delays
Some items require a permit if you move them out of a  
quarantine area. The permit confirms that these items aren’t 
infested with imported fire ants. If you don’t have a permit

confirming your cargo is free of imported fire ants, State 
agriculture station officials may delay you 24 to 48 hours 
while they inspect your truck and its cargo and, if necessary, 
supervise its cleaning.  
The following items must be inspected and permitted before 
you can move them out of a quarantine area:
• Bulk soil, mulch, composted soil, topsoil, and other articles   
 whenever compacted soil is present. Commercially prepared  
 potting soil in its original container is exempt.
• Baled hay and straw that has been stored in direct contact   
 with the ground.
• Plants and grass sod with roots and soil attached, including   
 containerized nursery stock, balled-and-burlapped  
 nursery stock, sod squares, or rolls (plants maintained   
 indoors

• Soil-moving equipment, unless all compacted soil is  
 removed.
• Any other article that could spread imported fire ants.
The owner is responsible for getting the cargo inspected and 
giving you a copy of the permit before you leave the  
quarantine area. To obtain a permit, the owner should contact 
the State department of agriculture (nationalplantboard.org/
membership) or the local APHIS office (www.aphis.usda.gov/
planthealth/sphd). 
Look Before You Leave
Even if your truck and its cargo have been inspected, you still 
need to take care to prevent imported fire ants from hitching 
a ride. Be aware when you overnight. Mound-shaped fire ant 
nests may be near parking and rest areas, and if disturbed, ants 
can easily relocate their colony in a few hours…and that may 
be onto your truck! Here are some simple tips for steering clear 
of fire ants:
• Inspect the truck before beginning your trip to make sure no   
 fire ants are present.
• Park on pavement whenever possible to discourage fire ants   
 from climbing onto your truck.
• Eliminate an infestation in or around your truck with a  
 commercially available insecticide labeled for use on  
 fire ants.
