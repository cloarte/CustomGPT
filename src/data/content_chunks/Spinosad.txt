 formulation of 
spinosad in its fruit fly eradication program.  Spinosad is currently used in the program however 
there is a need to develop a new formulation with increased efficacy and as a potential 
replacement for a similar formulation that uses the organophosphate insecticide naled.  The 
proposed formulation STATIC™ Spinosad ME contains the insecticide spinosad, as well as the 
attractant methyl eugenol, which is designed to attract and kill, male fruit flies.   
 
USDA APHIS evaluated the potential human health and ecological risks from the proposed use 
of STATIC™ Spinosad ME in this assessment and determined that the risks to human health and 
the environment are negligible.  The lack of risk to human health and the environment is based 
on the low probability of exposure to human health and the environment and favorable 
environmental fate and effects data.  The method of application for STATIC™ Spinosad ME is 
by hand as dollops or large droplets to sites on telephone poles, light poles, fences, other 
inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs and non-edible foliage. The proposed method of 
application substantially reduces the potential for exposure to human health and the environment, 
such as nontarget fish and wildlife.  Risks to workers and the general population are expected to 
be minimal based on the labeled use, lack of application to food crops, and a favorable toxicity 
profile when considering acute or chronic effects.  Risks to nontarget fish and wildlife are also 
anticipated to be negligible based on the proposed use pattern resulting in a low potential for 
exposure to most taxa.  A favorable environmental fate profile and low toxicity to most nontarget 
organisms further reduces the risk to terrestrial and aquatic animals.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
USDA APHIS is proposing to use a new formulation of spinosad, STATICTM Spinosad ME, in 
its fruit fly eradication program.  This product has been shown to effectively control fruit flies 
and is intended to supplement other uses of spinosad in the program and may reduce the need for 
naled, an organophosphate insecticide, in its male annihilation technique (MAT) applications 
(Vargas et al. 2003, 2009).  USDA APHIS has previously assessed the human health and 
ecological risks of spinosad under different formulations and use patterns however with the 
proposed new formulation there is a need to determine if this specific formulation and use 
pattern will pose a risk beyond what has been determined in previous assessments (USDA 
APHIS1999, 2003).    
 
This human health risk assessment (HHRA) and ecological risk assessment (ERA) provide a 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the potential risks and hazards to human health and 
non-target fish, and wildlife as a result of exposure to spinosad under the proposed bait  
applications of STATIC™ Spinosad ME.

This human health risk assessment (HHRA) and ecological risk assessment (ERA) provide a 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the potential risks and hazards to human health and 
non-target fish, and wildlife as a result of exposure to spinosad under the proposed bait  
applications of STATIC™ Spinosad ME. 
 
The methods used in this HHRA follow standard regulatory guidance and methodologies (NRC 
1983, USEPA 2013a), and generally conform to other Federal agencies such as U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs (USEPA/OPP).  The methods 
used to assess potential ecological risk to nontarget fish and wildlife follow EPA methodologies 
regarding eco-risk assessment, with an emphasis on those used by USEPA/OPP in the pesticide 
registration process.   
 
The following risk assessment is divided into four sections: problem formulation (identifying 
hazard), exposure assessment (identifying potentially exposed populations and determining 
potential exposure pathways for these populations), toxicity assessment (the dose-response 
assessment), and the integration of the exposure and toxicity assessments, or risk 
characterization. 
   
2.0 PROBLEM FORMULATION 
 
Fruit flies in the family Tephritidae are among the most destructive pests of fruits and vegetables 
around the world.  The genera Anastrepha, Bactrocera, and Ceratitis pose the greatest risk to U.S. 
agriculture.  Tephritid fruit flies spend their larval stages feeding and growing in over 400 host 
plants.  Introduction of these pest species into the United States causes economic losses from 
destruction and spoiling of host commodities by larvae, costs associated with

, Bactrocera, and Ceratitis pose the greatest risk to U.S. 
agriculture.  Tephritid fruit flies spend their larval stages feeding and growing in over 400 host 
plants.  Introduction of these pest species into the United States causes economic losses from 
destruction and spoiling of host commodities by larvae, costs associated with implementing 
control measures, and loss of market share due to restrictions on shipment of host commodities.  
The extensive damage and wide host range of tephritid fruit flies become obstacles to 
agricultural diversification and trade when pest fruit fly species become established in these 
areas (USDA APHIS 2013).  
 
Spinosad is a broad spectrum insecticide registered for use on agricultural crops, ornamentals, 
tree farms/plantations, turfgrass, home gardens and lawns (residential use).  It is also registered 
for drywood termiticide use, poultry use, area-wide fruit fly use, post-harvest grain use, larval 
mosquitoes, and as a seed treatment (USEPA 2011).

In the USDA APHIS Fruit Fly Eradication Program, spinosad and the attractant, methyl eugenol, 
are used in combination as a bait to control multiple species of tephritid fruit flies that infest tree, 
vine and vegetable crops.  The bait is a thick yellow-brown liquid with a sweet fruit odor.  Fruit 
flies can detect the bait several yards away from the deposition site.  Through ingestion. spinosad 
over-activates the central nervous system of insects via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

 a thick yellow-brown liquid with a sweet fruit odor.  Fruit 
flies can detect the bait several yards away from the deposition site.  Through ingestion. spinosad 
over-activates the central nervous system of insects via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  
Target insects exhibit tremors, trembling, paralysis and eventual death.  APHIS PPQ proposes to 
use STATICTM Spinosad ME bait for its programs. 
 
The following sections discuss the chemical description and product use of STATICTM Spinosad 
ME; physical and chemical properties; environmental fate; and hazard identification for spinosad 
and methyl eugenol.   
2.1 Chemical Description and Product Use 
 
STATICTM Spinosad ME is an insecticidal bait containing 2% spinosad (active ingredient) and 
51% methyl eugenol (a chemical attractant) dispersed within a waxy formulation carrier 
(SPLATTM).  Spinosad is a mixture of spinosyn A and D (macrocyclic lactones).  The 
formulation is in a ratio of 85:15 of spinosyn A to D.  Spinosad is produced biologically from the 
fermentation culture of the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora spinosa, a bacterial organism 
isolated from soil.  
 
STATICTM Spinosad ME is used for selective attraction and control of male tephritid fruit files 
of the genus Bactrocera (or other fruit fly species which respond to the male specific attractant 
methy eugenol).  The product selectively eliminates male fruit flies from a localized area, which 
disrupts mating leading to decline or local eradication of a fruit fly population.  It is most 
effective when fruit fly populations

ritid fruit files 
of the genus Bactrocera (or other fruit fly species which respond to the male specific attractant 
methy eugenol).  The product selectively eliminates male fruit flies from a localized area, which 
disrupts mating leading to decline or local eradication of a fruit fly population.  It is most 
effective when fruit fly populations are maintained at low levels and males are already scarce.   
 
The preferred application method is as small dollops or large droplets targeted as spot 
applications to stakes, posts, fences, non-crop tree trunks or limbs, artificial targets, or non-edible 
border vegetation surrounding crop fields.  The proposed use of this new formulation is similar 
where it will be applied by hand in dollops to sites on telephone poles, light poles, fences, other 
inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs, non-edible foliage where it won’t be readily 
accessible to the general public.  The application techniques can vary from application of dollops 
using a spatula or other spreading implement to mechanical or pneumatic meter-jet capable of 
delivering large droplets.  Aerial applications are not permitted.   
 
The product comes as a ready-to-use formulation.  The application rates of this formulation for 
spot applications to non-crop surfaces are 3.4 to 6.85 fl oz (0.0045 to 0.009 lb) active ingredient 
(ai) spinosad per acre.   
2.2 Physical and Chemical Properties  
 
Spinosad (technical grade) is a light gray to white crystalline solid with an odor of slightly stale 
water (CDPR 2002).  The chemical structure of spinosad is shown in Figure 2-1.

2.3 Environmental Fate 
 
The environmental fate describes the processes by which spinosad moves and is transformed in 
the environment.  The environmental fate processes include: 1) mobility, persistence, and 
degradation in soil, 2) movement to air, 3) migration potential to groundwater and surface water, 
and 4) plant uptake.   
 
Spinosad persistence in the environment is variable in terrestrial and aquatic systems (Table 2-2) 
(USEPA 1998).  Spinosad is not sensitive to hydrolysis but breaks down rapidly in water in the 
presence of light with reported photolytic half-lives of less than 1 day.  The rapid photolytic 
breakdown of spinosad in laboratory studies has also been confirmed in microcosm studies 
(Cleveland et al. 2002).  Solubility of spinosad in water is pH dependent and is dependent on the 
structurally similar active ingredients.  Solubility for spinosyn A ranges from 290 to 16 mg/L 
with increasing pH, while the solubility for spinosyn D is much less but still pH-dependent with 
values ranging from 28.7 to 0.05 mg/L for pH values between five and nine (Cleveland et al. 
2002).

Degradation of spinosyn A and D in soil is rapid under aerobic conditions suggesting spinosad is 
susceptible to microbial degradation (EPA 1998a, Hale and Portwood 1996).  Spinosad also 
degrades quickly on plant surfaces with reported half-lives ranging from 2.0 to 11.7 days (CDPR 
2002, Sharma et al. 2008). 
 
Spinosad is not considered mobile based on the available soil adsorption (Koc) studies that have 
been conducted on a range of soil types.  Values range from 884 to 145,350, with the lowest 
value occurring in a loamy sand with 1.1 percent organic matter and a cation exchange capacity

5 
 
(cec) of 1.9, while the highest value is for a silt loam soil with 0.4 percent organic matter and a 
cec of 12.0 (CDPR 2002).  
  
Spinosad is not considered to be volatile based on the vapor pressure for both active ingredients, 
with values of 2.4 x 10-10 mm Hg for spinosyn A and 1.6 x 10-10 mm Hg for spinosyn D 
(Cleveland et al., 2002).  Chemicals with vapor pressure values less that 1 x 10-6 are considered 
nonvolatile (CDPR 2002). 
Methyl eugenol is a volatile compound.  In the atmosphere, methyl eugenol will be degraded by 
reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals.  The half-life for this reaction in air 
is estimated to be 5 hours (Toxnet 2013).  Based upon an estimated Koc of 140, methyl eugenol 
released to soil is expected to have high mobility, and methyl eugenol released to water is 
expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment.  Based upon an estimated 
Henry's Law constant of 5.6 x 10-6 atm-cu m/mole, methyl eugenol in moist soil surface and 
water surface is expected to volatilize.  Dissipation half-lives of 6 and 16 hours (at 32 and 22 deg 
C, respectively) in soil and 6 and 34 hours (at 32 and 22 deg C, respectively) in water have been

 10-6 atm-cu m/mole, methyl eugenol in moist soil surface and 
water surface is expected to volatilize.  Dissipation half-lives of 6 and 16 hours (at 32 and 22 deg 
C, respectively) in soil and 6 and 34 hours (at 32 and 22 deg C, respectively) in water have been 
reported.  Methyl eugenol in water is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due 
to the lack of hydrolysable functional groups (Toxnet 2013).  Modelling predicted half-lives of 
methyl eugenol in soil, water, and sediment were 8 days, 8 days, and 32 days, respectively.  
These predicted half-lives suggested that methyl eugenol is expected to reside mainly in the 
environmental compartment to which it is released (Environment Canada 2010).   
The active ingredients in STATICTM Spinosad ME are applied within a waxy formulation carrier, 
which serves to impart increased residual and rainfastness to the active ingredient and methyl 
eugenol lure.  Therefore, the degradation rates of the active ingredient are lower. 
2.4 Hazard Identification  
 
Spinosad has low acute toxicity and is classified by USEPA as Toxicity Category III (slightly 
toxic with “caution” warning on label) for acute oral and dermal toxicity and Toxicity Category 
IV (Not acutely toxic with no warning on label) for acute inhalation toxicity, primary eye 
irritation, and primary skin irritation (USEPA 2005).  The rat oral median lethal dose (LD50) is 
3,738 mg/kg for males and >5,000 mg/kg for females, whereas the mouse oral LD50 is >5,000 
mg/kg. The

 no warning on label) for acute inhalation toxicity, primary eye 
irritation, and primary skin irritation (USEPA 2005).  The rat oral median lethal dose (LD50) is 
3,738 mg/kg for males and >5,000 mg/kg for females, whereas the mouse oral LD50 is >5,000 
mg/kg. The rabbit dermal LD50 is >2,000 mg/kg and the rat inhalation median lethal 
concentration (LC50) is >5.18 mg/l air (USEPA 1998).   
 
In subchronic toxicity studes the primary effects in mouse were increased vacuolation of cells in 
the lymphoid organs, liver, kidney, stomach, female reproductive tract, and epididymis, and less 
severely in the heart, lung, pancreas, adrenal cortex, bone marrow, tongue, pituitary gland, and 
anemia.  Thyroid follicle epithelial cell vacuolation, anemia, multifocal hepatocellular 
granuloma, cardiomyopathy and spleenic histiocytosis were observed in rats.  Microscopic 
changes in a variety of tissues, anemia, and possible liver damage were observed in dogs 
(USEPA 2005).  Spinosad was evaluated in 13-week dietary studies and showed No Observable 
Effect Levels (NOELs) of 4.9 mg/kg/day in dogs, 6 mg/kg/day in mice, and 8.6 mg/kg/day in 
rats. No dermal irritation or systemic toxicity occurred in a 21-day repeated dose dermal toxicity 
study in rabbits at 1,000 mg/kg/day (USEPA 1998).  It is not a dermal sensitizer based on a lack

study in rabbits at 1,000 mg/kg/day (USEPA 1998).  It is not a dermal sensitizer based on a lack

of toxicity observed at the limit dose in a 21-day dermal toxicity study using rabbits (USEPA 
2005).   
 
Chronic toxicity studies in the dog and rat report NOELs of 2.68 and 2.72 mg/kg/day, 
respectively for male and female dogs, and 2.4 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively for male and 
female rats. 
 
Spinosad is not a neurotoxic agent in acute, subchronic, or chronic toxicity studies.  No 
neurotoxic effects were observed at the limit dose in an acute neurotoxicity study in rats and at 
doses up to 42.7 mg/kg/day in a subchronic neurotoxicity study.  In a chronic feeding study in 
dogs, increases in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglycerides 
levels, and the presence of tissue abnormalities, including vacuolated cell aggregations, arteritis, 
and glandular cell vacuolation (parathyroid) were observed.  In a chronic oral toxicity study in 
rats, vacuolation of thyroid follicular cells, increased absolute, and relative thyroid weights were 
observed.  In mice, rats, and dogs, other organs including liver, kidney, spleen, heart, thyroid, 
and bone marrow (anemia) appeared to be the target organs (USEPA

rats, vacuolation of thyroid follicular cells, increased absolute, and relative thyroid weights were 
observed.  In mice, rats, and dogs, other organs including liver, kidney, spleen, heart, thyroid, 
and bone marrow (anemia) appeared to be the target organs (USEPA 2005).  
 
No developmental effects were observed in the rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies. In a 
2-generation reproduction study in rats, decreased litter size and survival was observed in the 
presence of maternal toxicity (deaths) at the highest dose tested.  However, the maternal and 
offspring toxicity (deaths) indicated no evidence of increased susceptibility in this study (USEPA 
2005). 
 
There were no major differences in the bioavailability, routes or rates of excretion, or 
metabolism following a single low oral dose, single high oral dose, or repeated oral doses in rats.  
Most of the dose (approximately 70-80%) was absorbed.  Approximately 20% of the dose was 
eliminated in the feces which was the major route of excretion.  The excreted metabolites were 
glutathione conjugates of the parent and O-demethylated Factor A.  Metabolites in the tissues 
were the N-and O-demethylated Factor A.  With rapid biliary excretion, metabolites in the bile 
were the glutathione conjugates of parent and N-and O-demethylated forms of Factor D (USEPA 
2005).

2005). 
 
Carcinogenicity/Mutagenicity:  
 
Carcinogenic toxicity studies show spinosad is not likely to be carcinogenic (USEPA 1998, Yano 
et al. 2002, Stebbins et al. 2002, USEPA 2005).  It is also negative for mutagenicity in various 
mutagenicity assays.   
 
Endocrine disruption: 
 
A literature search regarding available spinosad toxicity studies show that there was no estrogen 
or thyroid mediated toxicity (USEPA 2005).   
 
Spinosad is not among the group of 58 pesticide active ingredients on the initial list to be 
screened under the EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.  This program determines 
whether certain substances may have an effect in humans or wildlife similar to an effect 
 
7 
 
produced by a “naturally occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effects as the Administrator 
may designate”.  Spinosad is not on the USEPA Draft Second Endocrine Disruptor Screening 
Program (EDSP) List of Chemicals for Tier 1 Screening (USEPA 2010).  USEPA considers that 
the compounds on the list are candidates (at least for screening purposes) under EDSP testing 
based only on their pesticide registration status and/or because such substances may occur in 
sources of drinking water to which a substantial population may be exposed (USEPA 2013b).

 only on their pesticide registration status and/or because such substances may occur in 
sources of drinking water to which a substantial population may be exposed (USEPA 2013b). 
 
Other ingredients: 
 
Methy eugenol is another ingredient in the formulation used as a chemical attractant for fruit 
flies.  Methyl eugenol is a naturally occurring constituent found in a number of plants such as 
nutmeg, pimento, lemongrass, tarragon, basil, star anise and fennel (European Commission 
2001). 
 
Methyl eugenol is considered moderately toxic to mammals with median lethal oral doses of 810 
to 1,560 mg/kg for rats and 540 mg/kg for mice.  The undiluted chemical (98% purity) is not 
considered an eye or a skin irritant (NTP 2000).  Methyl eugenol is considered practically 
nontoxic in dermal or inhalation acute exposures (Beroza et al. 1975).  Longer term studies using 
methyl eugenol have also been conducted using rats and mice.  In a 14-week study, a dose of 0, 
10, 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg methyl eugenol/kg body weight in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose 
were administered to groups of 10 males and 10 females per sex per species by gavage (5 days 
per week) (Abdo et al. 2001).  Methyl eugenol administration to rats induced erythrocyte 
microcytosis, thrombocytosis, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia.  It caused an increase in

do et al. 2001).  Methyl eugenol administration to rats induced erythrocyte 
microcytosis, thrombocytosis, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia.  It caused an increase in 
serum alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities and bile acid 
concentration.  Methyl eugenol also caused an increase in the incidence of hepatocyte cytologic 
alteration, cytomegaly, Kupffer cell pigmentation, mixed foci of cellular alteration and bile duct 
hyperplasia of the liver and atrophy and chronic inflammation of the mucosa of the glandular 
stomach.  In mice, methyl eugenol caused an increase in the incidence of cytologic alteration, 
necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia and subacute inflammation of the liver and atrophy, degeneration, 
necrosis, edema, mitotic alteration, and cystic glands of the fundic region of the glandular 
stomach.  The NOEL of methyl eugenol for both species was estimated at 10 mg/kg (NTP 2013).  
In long-term exposures the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted 2-year studies in rats 
and mice and concluded that there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male and 
female F344/N rats, based on an increase incidence of liver neoplasms and neuroendocrine 
tumors of the glandular stomach in male and female rats, and increased incidence of kidney 
neoplasms, malignant fibroma and fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) in male rats (NTP 2000, 
2013).  Dose rates in both studies ranged from 37 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg with the dose-related

tumors of the glandular stomach in male and female rats, and increased incidence of kidney 
neoplasms, malignant fibroma and fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) in male rats (NTP 2000, 
2013).  Dose rates in both studies ranged from 37 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg with the dose-related 
effects varying based on the endpoint and a NOEL not reported for either test species.  Methyl 
eugenol is not considered to be mutagenic and in metabolism studies has been shown to be 
rapidly eliminated and excreted from human blood serum (NTP 2013, Schecter et al. 2004). 
 
The reported effects of methyl eugenol are at doses above those expected to occur in human 
populations and is reflected in the USEPA’s Tolerance Reassessment Eligibility Document for 
methyl eugenol that concluded "...there is a reasonable certainty that no harm to any population 
or subgroup will result from the dietary and water exposure to methyl eugenol from uses 
specified in the existing exemption for the requirements for tolerance for methyl eugenol under 
 
8 
 
40 CFR §180.1067." (USEPA 2006).  In addition the Food and Drug Admnistration (FDA) 
classifies methyl eugenol as a “Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)” compound suggesting a 
low hazard to human health.

3.1 Human Health Dose-Response Assessment 
 
A dose-response assessment evaluates the dose levels (toxicity criteria) for potential human 
health effects including acute and chronic toxicities.   
 
USEPA established a chronic oral reference dose (RfD) of 0.0268 mg/kg/day for spinosad based 
on chronic toxicity studies with the dog and rat.  This RfD has incorporated a 100-fold safety 
factor to the NOELs (see Section 2.4) found in the chronic dog study to include animal to human 
extrapolation (an uncertainty factor of 10) and sensitive subgroups with a population (an 
uncertainty factor of 10) (USEPA 1998).  For occupational exposure, the RfD is 0.27 mg/kg/day 
because the uncertainty factor of 10 for protection of sensitive subgroups such as infants or 
children is not applicable.  The RfD for occupational exposure of 0.27 mg/kg/day is used for this 
human health risk assessment. 
3.2 Ecological Dose-Response Assessment 
3.2.1 Wild Mammal Toxicity 
 
The acute and chronic toxicity of spinosad to wild mammals is expected to be low from oral, 
dermal and inhalation exposures based on the available data summarized above in the hazard 
identification section of this risk assessment. Using the lowest reported acute LD50 value and the 
lowest subchronic rat NOEL, adjusted LD50 and NOEL values were calculated for different size 
mammals (Table 3-1).  The ranges of different body weights and consumption rates were 
selected to represent mammals, such as the shrew that

 in the hazard 
identification section of this risk assessment. Using the lowest reported acute LD50 value and the 
lowest subchronic rat NOEL, adjusted LD50 and NOEL values were calculated for different size 
mammals (Table 3-1).  The ranges of different body weights and consumption rates were 
selected to represent mammals, such as the shrew that consumes a large percentage of their body 
weight and may receive higher exposure, as well as larger mammals (1 kg) that may consume 
less when compared to the standard laboratory rat, which is used in several of the mammalian 
toxicity studies.  The lowest subchronic value was selected due to the short environmental half-
life of spinosad.  Effects from daily exposure over a 13-week period are not expected but provide 
a conservative estimate of effects.  These values are also lower than any of the developmental 
and reproductive NOEL values that have been determined in previous studies.

3.2.2 Avian and Reptile Toxicity 
 
Spinosad acute and chronic toxicity to birds is low for both surrogate species that have been 
tested (Table 3-2).  Acute LD50 and LC50 for the mallard and bobwhite quail are greater than the 
highest concentration tested, 1,333 mg/kg and 5,156 parts per million (ppm), respectively (EPA, 
2010).  Chronic toxicity is also low with reproduction NOEC values of 500 ppm for the mallard 
and 550 ppm for the bobwhite quail in 20-week exposure studies.

No reptile toxicity data appears to be available for spinosad.  USEPA/OPP uses the effects data 
for birds to represent sensitivity to reptiles.  There is uncertainty in this assumption; however, 
based on the low toxicity of spinosad to birds and mammals, as well as aquatic vertebrates, 
toxicity to reptiles would also be expected to be low. 
3.2.3 Terrestrial Invertebrate Toxicity 
 
Toxicity to terrestrial invertebrates is variable based on the available toxicity data for pests, 
pollinators, and biocontrol agents.  Honey bees appear to be one of the more sensitive terrestrial 
invertebrates to spinosad, with 48-hour contact LD50 values ranging from 0.0029 to 0.078 µg 
ai/bee and a reported NOEC of 0.0016 µg ai/bee (0.016 µg/g) (

ocontrol agents.  Honey bees appear to be one of the more sensitive terrestrial 
invertebrates to spinosad, with 48-hour contact LD50 values ranging from 0.0029 to 0.078 µg 
ai/bee and a reported NOEC of 0.0016 µg ai/bee (0.016 µg/g) (Mayes et al. 2003).  Toxicity to 
honey bees is similar to other native bees with reported contact LD50 values of 0.058, 0.065, and 
0.078 µg ai/bee for the alfalfa leafcutter bee (Megachile rotundata), alkali bee (Nomia 
melanderi) and honey bee, respectively (Mayer et al., 2001).  Contact toxicity to spinosad 
decreases rapidly after applications are allowed to dry.  Laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies 
have demonstrated that spinosad is nontoxic to bees 3 hours after application (Mayes et al., 
2003).  Studies using honey bees and bumblebees exposed to spinosad residues on alfalfa, 
strawberries, almonds, citrus, and kiwifruit have documented a lack of impacts to pollinators 
when applications are made when bees are not active, and after residues have weathered. 
Toxicity to other nontarget insects ranges from 3.3 to greater than 200 mg/L based on reported 
LC50 values (Thompson et al. 2000, Williams et al. 2003, Penagos et al. 2005, Miles and Eelen 
2006, Semiz et al. 2006).  Within Lepidoptera, sensitivity can vary with effective treatment rates 
ranging from 25 to 360 g/ha (Thompson et al. 2000).  Lepidoptera appear to be less

LC50 values (Thompson et al. 2000, Williams et al. 2003, Penagos et al. 2005, Miles and Eelen 
2006, Semiz et al. 2006).  Within Lepidoptera, sensitivity can vary with effective treatment rates 
ranging from 25 to 360 g/ha (Thompson et al. 2000).  Lepidoptera appear to be less sensitive to 
spinosad compared to pollinators, such as honey bees and bumblebees.  For example, contact 
toxicity of fourth instar Spodoptera littoralis larvae to spinosad is reported as 4.74 µg/g, which is 
lower than the 0.029 µg/g reported for the honey bee (Pineda et al. 2006).   Dietary spinosad 
LC50 values for S. littoralis range from 0.5 to 2.98 ppm.  
Based on field-collected data, there were no effects on abundance and diversity of Lepidoptera, 
Coleoptera, or Hymenoptera when sampled using malaise traps 2 and 6 days after spinosad 
treatment for emerald ash borer (USDA APHIS 2007).  Aerial broadcast applications were made 
to several plots ranging in size from 8 to 20 acres at a rate (0.23 lb ai/ac) which is greater than 
two orders of magnitude above the use rate proposed in the fruit fly program.  Non-target 
terrestrial invertebrate impacts have also been evaluated using this specific combination of 
spinosad and the attractant methyl eugenol.  Methyl eugenol is a naturally occurring chemical 
produced in over 450 plant species with varied effects on terrestrial invertebrates (Tan and 
Nishida 2012).  Stark et al. (2004) demonstrated that contact toxicity

produced in over 450 plant species with varied effects on terrestrial invertebrates (Tan and 
Nishida 2012).  Stark et al. (2004) demonstrated that contact toxicity of spinosad to two 
parasitoids only occurred at levels well above those that would be encountered in any field 
setting.

3.2.5 Aquatic Toxicity 
 
Spinosad has moderate toxicity to fish based on the available toxicity data, with acute toxicity 
values ranging from 4.99 to 30 mg/L in 96-hour exposures (Table 3-4).

A literature review revealed no apparent toxicity data for spinosad on amphibians.  EPA–OPP 
uses fish toxicity data to represent the sensitivity of amphibians which provides uncertainty due 
to potential differences in sensitivities, and differences in exposure pathways between fish and 
adult amphibians.  However, due to the lack of amphibian-related data for spinosad, fish effects 
data will be used as a surrogate and discussed in relation to risk in the below aquatic risk 
characterization section.   
 
Based on the available aquatic toxicity profile, spinosad has variable toxicity to aquatic 
invertebrates (Table 3-5) (EPA 1998a, Stark and Banks 2001,  Cleveland et al. 2001).  Longer 
term studies show that under continuous exposure for 21 days, spinosad has a greater effect on 
the freshwater cladoceran, Daphnia magna.  The same study using pulse doses within a short 
period of time demonstrates the rapid breakdown of spinosad with an approximate tenfold 
decrease in toxicity.  Stark and Vargas (2003) demonstrated demographic effects to D. pulex

populations exposed to formulated spinosad at 8 µg/L and greater in 60- to 70-day exposures.  
Test chambers were renewed every other day for the duration of the study.  In a long-term 
sediment study, the midge Chironomus riparius was shown to have lower chronic sensitivity 
when compared to D. magna tested under continuous exposure conditions.

Mosquito species, such as Culex pipiens, Aedes aegypti, and A. albimanus appear to be the most 
sensitive aquatic invertebate taxa to spinosad, while the cladoceran D. magna was the least 
sensitive with a 48-hour EC50 of 14 mg/L (EPA 1998a,  Bond et al. 2004).  Mosquito sensitivity 
was comparable between technical and formulated spinosad based on the available data using 
other spinosad formulations  (Bond et al. 2004, Cetin et al. 2005, Stevens et al. 2005,  Ayesa et

al. 2006).  
  
Toxicity to aquatic plants, such as diatoms and algae, range from 0.107 mg/L for the freshwater 
diatom, Navicula pelliculosa, to greater than 105.5 mg/L for green algae based on 5-day 
exposures (EPA 2010).  Toxicity to aquatic macrophytes is based on a 14-day EC50 value for 
duckweed, Lemna gibba, which was reported as 10.6 mg/L. 
 3.2.6 Metabolite and Formulation Toxicity 
 
Available acute and chronic aquatic toxicity data for metabolites of spinosyn A and D 
demonstrate that metabolites are less toxic than the parent material (Table 3-6) (USEPA 2013c).  
The spinosyn A metabolite has a sublethal toxicity value that is more than 160 times below the 
reported spinosad NOEC for D. magna.  The same is true when comparing chronic toxicity 
values for D. magna between the parent and metabolite.  Based on NOEC values from the 
21-day studies, the spinosyn A metabolite is more than 15,000 times less toxic than the parent.  
Similar reductions in toxicity are also observed when comparing spinosad aquatic invertebrate 
toxicity to the primary metabolite for spinosyn D.

No aquatic ecological effects data is available for the proposed formulation however available 
data on other formulations of spinosad, and the other primary product in the formulation, methyl

 for the proposed formulation however available 
data on other formulations of spinosad, and the other primary product in the formulation, methyl 
eugenol, suggest toxicity will occur primarily through exposure to spinosad.  Methyl eugenol 
comprises 51% of the proposed formulation.  Reported methyl eugenol 96-hour acute aquatic 
toxicity values range from 6.9 mg/L for the rainbow trout and 8.1 mg/L for the bluegill sunfish 
(Beroza et al. 1975).  These values are in the same range of acute toxicity values for fish and 
spinosad however the methyl eugenol toxicity values exceed the solubility for methyl eugenol 
and therefore would not occur in aquatic systems.  Available aquatic invertebrate data is limited 
however median lethality values for various mosquito species exceed 50 mg/L which is well 
above the solubility limit for methyl eugenol (Perumalsamy et al. 2010).  Toxicity to terrestrial 
wildlife is expected to be similar between the formulation and technical active ingredient based 
on the previously discussed acute mammalian formulation data and the technical active 
ingredient. 
 
4.0 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT 
4.1 Human Health Exposure Assessment 
 
Exposure assessment estimates the potential exposure of humans to spinosad.  The exposure 
assessment begins with the use and application method of STATICTM Spinosad ME.  A complete 
exposure pathway for spinosad includes (1) a release from a spinosad source, (2) an exposure 
point where contact can occur, and (3) an exposure route such as ingestion, inhalation, or dermal 
contact by which contact can occur (USEPA 1989).  Exposures for the identified human

.  A complete 
exposure pathway for spinosad includes (1) a release from a spinosad source, (2) an exposure 
point where contact can occur, and (3) an exposure route such as ingestion, inhalation, or dermal 
contact by which contact can occur (USEPA 1989).  Exposures for the identified human 
populations are evaluated for each identified exposure pathway. 
 
 
 
 
14 
 
4.1.1 Potentially Exposed Human Populations and Complete Exposure Pathways 
 
The STATICTM Spinosad ME formulation is used as a bait (small dollops or large droplets) and 
hand applied using a spatula or other spreading implement, or pneumatic meter-jet capable of 
delivering large droplets.  STATICTM Spinosad ME is expected to be applied to sites higher up 
on telephone poles, light poles, fences, other inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs, 
non-edible foliage where it is not readily accessible to the general public.  Therefore, workers 
(i.e. handlers) in the program are the most likely subgroup that could be exposed to spinosad.  
The potential exposure to workers to spinosad is from mixing (thorough stirring and mixing of

 normal applications, the potential for handlers to be exposed to spinosad is 
minimal from mixing and spot application with adherence to labeled requirements for personal 
protective equipment (PPE) (long-sleeved shirt and long pants, shoes and socks, and chemical-
resistant gloves).  Under the accidental event when PPEs do not function properly, the complete 
exposure pathway for these workers includes dermal contact and is further evaluated in Section 
6.  Inhalation route is not complete for spinosad because spinosad is not volatile, and exposure 
from the inhalation route is limited for methyl eugenol during stirring and mixing of the waxy 
formulation.  Incidental ingestion route is not complete under the spot application method.   
 
The general public such as residents is not identified as a potentially exposed human population 
because their exposure to spinosad in STATICTM Spinosad ME bait formulation is extremely 
unlikely when the locations of the baits are not readily accessible to the general public.   
 
A complete exposure pathway is not identified for dietary plant consumption or dermal contact 
to plants because the STATICTM Spinosad ME bait is not applied to plants that would be 
harvested for human consumption.  In addition, spinosad degrades quickly on plant surfaces (see 
Section 2.3). 
 
A complete exposure pathway is not identified for the groundwater medium or surface water 
medium based on the specific spot application method required by the label.  Surface runoff via 
rain fall may occur, however, the amount of spinosad from this bait formulation releasing to soil 
is minimal based on the proposed low application rates.  In addition this particular formulation of 
spinosad within a waxy carrier is rain fast and would not be expected to be removed from the

rain fall may occur, however, the amount of spinosad from this bait formulation releasing to soil 
is minimal based on the proposed low application rates.  In addition this particular formulation of 
spinosad within a waxy carrier is rain fast and would not be expected to be removed from the site 
of application until after significant weathering and degradation occurs reducing the amount of 
spinosad available for runoff to receiving water that could serve as a drinking water source.   
 4.1.2 Exposure Evaluation 
 
This section quantitatively evaluates the worker accidental exposures from dermal contact 
pathway while mixing, loading, and applying the spinosad baits.  Under the accidental exposure 
scenario, it assumes that chemical-resistant gloves are broken.    
 
Chemical-specific data to assess potential exposure to occupational pesticide handlers were not 
available.  The estimates of exposure to pesticide handlers are based on surrogate study data 
available in the Pesticide Handlers Exposure Database (PHED) (USEPA 2013d).  The 
mixer/loader/applicator, mechanically-pressurized handgun sprayer in orchards, vineyards, 
specialty agricultural crops, rights-of-way, nurseries, landscaping (non-turf),

formulations, except wettable powders exposure scenario with single layer (long-sleeve shirt, 
long pants, shoes plus socks) and no gloves is the closest scenario to represent the mixing, 
loading and spot application of the formulation and is used for the dermal exposure evaluation.  
The unit exposure for the surrogate scenario is 1300 µg/lb ai.  Application rates range from 
0.0045 to 0.009 lb ai/acre.  The following equations are used to estimate the exposure dose of 
dermal contact for workers:   
 
Exposure Dose = Daily Dose Rate/Body Weight 
Daily Dose Rate = Unit Exposure (mg/lb ai) x Application Rate (lb ai/acre) x Area 
Treated (acre/day) 
 
The exposure doses were estimated for the application rates and summarized in Appendix A. 
 
4.2 Ecological Exposure Assessment 
 4.2.1 Terrestrial Exposure Pathway Evaluation 
 
The potential for exposure of nontarget terrestrial vertebrates to the proposed formulation of 
spinosad is minimal through either the dermal, inhalation or dietary routes.  The lack of dietary 
exposure is based on the method of application which will not include objects that would be 
consumed by nontarget vertebrates (ex. light poles, tree trunks).  Dermal exposure would also be 
low and would only occur when a nontarget vertebrate would come into contact with the material 
while moving over an area on a pole or tree where an application was made.  Inhalation exposure 
would also be low due to the method of application and low volatility of spinosad.  There is the 
potential for some inhalation exposure to methyl eugenol due to its volatility however methyl

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 a nontarget vertebrate would come into contact with the material 
while moving over an area on a pole or tree where an application was made.  Inhalation exposure 
would also be low due to the method of application and low volatility of spinosad.  There is the 
potential for some inhalation exposure to methyl eugenol due to its volatility however methyl 
eugenol is a naturally occurring phenylpropanoid compound that is released when plants are 
damaged and its use in this program would not be expected to result in exposures to terrestrial 
vertebrates beyond ambient levels. 
 4.2.2 Aquatic Exposure Pathway Evaluation 
 
Exposure to aquatic biota from the proposed use of spinosad is expected to result in negligible 
residues based on the use pattern and low application rates.  Applications are hand applied to 
specific objects such as light and telephones poles, tree limbs as either large dollops are very 
large droplets that would not be susceptible to drift.  A possible scenario of aquatic exposure 
could occur where a dollop or large droplet becomes dislodged from the site of application after 
it has weathered and washed into a receiving stream.   This scenario would result in negligible 
residues based on conservative estimates of spinosad transport into water bodies.  Assuming the 
maximum application rate for spinosad (0.009 lb ai/ac) is discharged into a water body such as a 
wetland that is one acre in size and six inches deep would result in a spinosad reside of 3.3 µg/L.  
This very conservative assumption assumes all material applied in one acre is available for 
transport and that no degradation would occur.   Residues into other larger bodies of water or 
those where water is running would

wetland that is one acre in size and six inches deep would result in a spinosad reside of 3.3 µg/L.  
This very conservative assumption assumes all material applied in one acre is available for 
transport and that no degradation would occur.   Residues into other larger bodies of water or 
those where water is running would result in substantially lower residues due to the dilution in 
those types of water bodies.

5.0 RISK CHARACTERIZATION 
5.1 Human Health 
 
Risks associated with adverse human health and fish and wildlife are characterized quantitatively 
and qualitatively in this section.  Under the proposed use, STATICTM Spinosad ME baits for spot 
application to eradicate fruit flies poses minimal risk to human health due to limited exposure for 
applicators using appropriate PPE and the low acute toxicity of spinosad to mammals.  
Accidental risk (hazard quotient) was estimated by dividing the exposure doses with the toxicity 
value (RfD) for the handler dermal contact exposure scenario.  The estimated risk for labeled 
application rates is low with hazard quotients three to four orders of magnitude below one 
indicating risk from accidental spinosad exposure is minimal (Appendix A).   
 
The general public is not a concern because STATICTM Spinosad ME will be applied to sites on 
telephone poles, light poles, fences, other inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs and 
non-edible foliage where the material is not readily accessible.

telephone poles, light poles, fences, other inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs and 
non-edible foliage where the material is not readily accessible. 
 
5.2 Ecological   
 
Risks to fish and wildlife are anticipated to be minimal based on the favorable toxicity profile for 
spinosad, its environmental fate and the proposed use pattern in the fruit fly program.  Direct risk 
to terrestrial vertebrates from ingestion of the bait is extremely low since applications aren’t 
directed to food items such as seeds, fruits and insects that would contain spinosad residues.  In 
cases where terrestrial vertebrates would consume the bait, they would have to consume many 
times their body weight to receive a dose that could result in any effects which is highly unlikely. 
Risk to food items or shelter required by terrestrial vertebrates would also not be anticipated due 
to the method of application, the selective nature of the bait to certain invertebrates and lack of 
risk to terrestrial or aquatic plants.  There is some risk to certain terrestrial invertebrates that are 
attracted to the bait due to the presence of methyl eugenol, and could receive a lethal dose of 
spinosad, however, based on the selective nature of methyl eugenol and spinosad as well as field 
collected data the impacts would be localized and transient and not anticipated to result in 
population level effects to sensitive taxa including beneficial arthropods. 
 
Aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates are also at low risk from the proposed spinosad 
applications.  The method of application eliminates the potential for off-site drift and runoff and 
would only occur in cases where baits become weathered and fall from where they were applied, 
and then carried to aquatic areas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 arthropods. 
 
Aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates are also at low risk from the proposed spinosad 
applications.  The method of application eliminates the potential for off-site drift and runoff and 
would only occur in cases where baits become weathered and fall from where they were applied, 
and then carried to aquatic areas.  A comparison of the aquatic residue from the wetland habitat 
that was estimated in the exposure analysis to the available fish effects data shows that the 
exposure concentration is at least two orders of magnitude below the acute and chronic effects 
data for fish suggesting minimal risk (Figure 5-1).  Acute risk to aquatic invertebrates is also low 
with the range of sensitivities well above the estimated residue in a wetland habitat.  The 25-day 
chronic study with the midge has an effect level below the aquatic residue value while the 
remaining chronic aquatic invertebrate values are well above the instantaneous residue value 
suggesting minimal chronic risk to most aquatic invertebrates.  Exceeding the chronic exposure 
value in the midge study does not imply risk to this group of organisms due to the conservative 
assumptions that were made to calculate an exposure value.  Not all of the material would be 
 
17 
 
expected to become dislodged from the point of application at the same time and simultaneously 
released into a water body.  In addition any exposure that would occur would not be continuous 
over a 25 day period as was done in this study due to spinosad degradation/partitioning in aquatic 
systems.  Degradation would result in a further decrease in risk since the metabolites are less 
toxic than the parent.

systems.  Degradation would result in a further decrease in risk since the metabolites are less 
toxic than the parent.   
 
 
 
 
Figure 5-1.  Aquatic risk characterization for spinosad. 
 
The lack of risk to both aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates ensures that the direct risk to fish is 
minimal and that their prey base would also be at low risk from the proposed applications of 
spinosad. 
 
6.0 UNCERTAINTIES/CUMULATIVE EFFECTS 
 
Uncertainties and cumulative impacts associated with the risk evaluation are qualitatively 
discussed in this section.  
 
Accidental human exposure to spinosad in baits during mixing, loading, and applying may occur 
to handlers when label required PPEs do not function properly. The RTU formulation serves to 
minimize worker exposure as no mixing is required. Surrogate study data available in the PHED 
were used for the accidental exposure rate since chemical-specific data to assess potential 
exposure to occupational pesticide handlers were not available.  The closest surrogate study to 
the spot application of STATICTM spinosad ME is the mixer/loader/applicator, mechanical-
pressurized handgun sprayer scenario for drench/soil directed applications and all formulations, 
except the wettable powder exposure scenario with single layer and no gloves.  However, this 
scenario is more conservative than the spot application scenario for the proposed formulation 
 
18 
 
because more exposure will occur in the mechanical-pressurized handgun sprayer scenario than 
for placement of a single spot
Text Len: 1679
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rench/soil directed applications and all formulations, 
except the wettable powder exposure scenario with single layer and no gloves.  However, this 
scenario is more conservative than the spot application scenario for the proposed formulation 
 
18 
 
because more exposure will occur in the mechanical-pressurized handgun sprayer scenario than 
for placement of a single spot of pesticide.  
 
Uncertainties in the ecological risk assessment sections of this document are similar to those for 
other pesticides and chemicals.  For example the applicability of surrogate laboratory toxicity 
studies to natural ecosystems is an area of uncertainty in ecological risk assessment 
methodology.  The approach in this assessment was to make assumptions regarding exposure 
that were very conservative and designed to account for some of the uncertainty common with 
screening level ecological risk assessments that rely on standardized toxicity data. Other areas of 
potential uncertainty in these types of assessments are with effects data for the metabolites and 
formulated material, however data was available to demonstrate that common metabolites of 
spinosad are less toxic than the parent material.  
 
Another area of uncertainty in this risk assessment is related to the potential for cumulative 
effects.  The potential for cumulative effects can occur through various exposure pathways such 
as 1) repeated exposure to spinosad; 2) co-exposures to other pesticides within the program with 
respect to their toxicity; 3) exposures to other chemicals impacting the toxicity of spinosad; and 
4) exposures to spinosad from other sources. 
 
Spinosad has other labeled food and non-food uses and is currently used in the APHIS Fruit Fly 
Eradication Program as well as other APHIS programs such as the European Grapevine Moth. 
Cumulatively there would be an increase in spinosad

; and 
4) exposures to spinosad from other sources. 
 
Spinosad has other labeled food and non-food uses and is currently used in the APHIS Fruit Fly 
Eradication Program as well as other APHIS programs such as the European Grapevine Moth. 
Cumulatively there would be an increase in spinosad use in relation to other APHIS and non-
APHIS spinosad uses however the effects to human health and the environment are expected to 
be incrementally negligible, and in cases where it is used as a naled replacement, would be 
beneficial. From a human health perspective repeated exposure to workers would not be 
expected to result in significant cumulative effects due to the use of PPE and the very low risk 
that was determined in this risk assessment.  Cumulative effects to the general population are 
also not anticipated since the likelihood of exposure is very low in this program since 
applications are made to non-food items and there is a very low likelihood of any residues in 
drinking water.  A lack of cumulative effects would also be anticipated as it relates to other 
chemicals since the risk to workers and the general population is very low from the proposed use 
of spinosad in the program.          
 
Neither spinosad nor methyl eugenol are among the five common mechanism groups of 
pesticides (Organophosphates, N-methyl Carbamates, Triazines, Chloroacetanilides, and 
Pyrethrins/Pyrethroids).  USEPA defines that common mechanism of toxicity pertains to two or 
more pesticide chemicals or other substances that cause a common toxic effect(s) by the same, or 
essentially the same, sequence of major biochemical events

, N-methyl Carbamates, Triazines, Chloroacetanilides, and 
Pyrethrins/Pyrethroids).  USEPA defines that common mechanism of toxicity pertains to two or 
more pesticide chemicals or other substances that cause a common toxic effect(s) by the same, or 
essentially the same, sequence of major biochemical events (USEPA 2013e) 
 
Cumulative impacts to aquatic and terrestrial nontarget organisms are expected to be negligible. 
The proposed use pattern for this formulation is not expected to result in risk to nontarget 
terrestrial vertebrates from direct effects or through impacts to available prey or habitat.  The 
lack of significant ecological risk from spinosad use in this program would suggest that 
significant cumulative effects to nontarget organisms from other stressors would be 
incrementally minor.  The selective nature of the use of spinosad in the fruit fly program also 
 
19 
 
ensures that any cumulative impacts to beneficial insects from the use of spinosad in this 
program would be minor and pose less risk than the use of naled in the same formulation type.    
 
Water quality data in the United States, including areas where fruit fly program activities may 
occur, show pesticide mixtures to be a common occurrence in surface water with varying 
impacts to aquatic organisms (USGS  2006).  Some of these bodies of water may be listed 
impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act due to pesticides, or some another abiotic 
or biotic stressor.  The impact to water bodies from any spinosad residues that could occur from 
use in the Fruit Fly Eradication Program is expected to be incrementally negligible to water 
bodies that may already be impacted by other contaminants.

impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act due to pesticides, or some another abiotic 
or biotic stressor.  The impact to water bodies from any spinosad residues that could occur from 
use in the Fruit Fly Eradication Program is expected to be incrementally negligible to water 
bodies that may already be impacted by other contaminants. The waxy materials in STATIC™ 
Spinosad ME increase rainfastness of the bait and reduce runoff. The proposed method of 
application mitigates any impacts from drift and makes runoff unlikely so that any residues that 
could potentially occur in water would not be expected to result in impacts to aquatic biota.  The 
impacts of potential mixtures at any concentration are an area of uncertainty due to the large 
number of potential types of chemical mixtures that could occur, and the spatial and temporal 
variability in their occurrence. Spinosad has been shown to have greater than additive effects to 
aquatic invertebrates such as mosquitos however these occur at doses well above those that 
would occur in this program (Darriet and Corbel, 2006).   The low potential for risk to aquatic 
biota from spinosad applications suggests that mixture toxicity would not result in significant 
cumulative effects.

 formulation of 
spinosad in its fruit fly eradication program.  Spinosad is currently used in the program however 
there is a need to develop a new formulation with increased efficacy and as a potential 
replacement for a similar formulation that uses the organophosphate insecticide naled.  The 
proposed formulation STATIC™ Spinosad ME contains the insecticide spinosad, as well as the 
attractant methyl eugenol, which is designed to attract and kill, male fruit flies.   
 
USDA APHIS evaluated the potential human health and ecological risks from the proposed use 
of STATIC™ Spinosad ME in this assessment and determined that the risks to human health and 
the environment are negligible.  The lack of risk to human health and the environment is based 
on the low probability of exposure to human health and the environment and favorable 
environmental fate and effects data.  The method of application for STATIC™ Spinosad ME is 
by hand as dollops or large droplets to sites on telephone poles, light poles, fences, other 
inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs and non-edible foliage. The proposed method of 
application substantially reduces the potential for exposure to human health and the environment, 
such as nontarget fish and wildlife.  Risks to workers and the general population are expected to 
be minimal based on the labeled use, lack of application to food crops, and a favorable toxicity 
profile when considering acute or chronic effects.  Risks to nontarget fish and wildlife are also 
anticipated to be negligible based on the proposed use pattern resulting in a low potential for 
exposure to most taxa.  A favorable environmental fate profile and low toxicity to most nontarget 
organisms further reduces the risk to terrestrial and aquatic animals.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
USDA APHIS is proposing to use a new formulation of spinosad, STATICTM Spinosad ME, in 
its fruit fly eradication program.  This product has been shown to effectively control fruit flies 
and is intended to supplement other uses of spinosad in the program and may reduce the need for 
naled, an organophosphate insecticide, in its male annihilation technique (MAT) applications 
(Vargas et al. 2003, 2009).  USDA APHIS has previously assessed the human health and 
ecological risks of spinosad under different formulations and use patterns however with the 
proposed new formulation there is a need to determine if this specific formulation and use 
pattern will pose a risk beyond what has been determined in previous assessments (USDA 
APHIS1999, 2003).    
 
This human health risk assessment (HHRA) and ecological risk assessment (ERA) provide a 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the potential risks and hazards to human health and 
non-target fish, and wildlife as a result of exposure to spinosad under the proposed bait  
applications of STATIC™ Spinosad ME.

This human health risk assessment (HHRA) and ecological risk assessment (ERA) provide a 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the potential risks and hazards to human health and 
non-target fish, and wildlife as a result of exposure to spinosad under the proposed bait  
applications of STATIC™ Spinosad ME. 
 
The methods used in this HHRA follow standard regulatory guidance and methodologies (NRC 
1983, USEPA 2013a), and generally conform to other Federal agencies such as U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs (USEPA/OPP).  The methods 
used to assess potential ecological risk to nontarget fish and wildlife follow EPA methodologies 
regarding eco-risk assessment, with an emphasis on those used by USEPA/OPP in the pesticide 
registration process.   
 
The following risk assessment is divided into four sections: problem formulation (identifying 
hazard), exposure assessment (identifying potentially exposed populations and determining 
potential exposure pathways for these populations), toxicity assessment (the dose-response 
assessment), and the integration of the exposure and toxicity assessments, or risk 
characterization. 
   
2.0 PROBLEM FORMULATION 
 
Fruit flies in the family Tephritidae are among the most destructive pests of fruits and vegetables 
around the world.  The genera Anastrepha, Bactrocera, and Ceratitis pose the greatest risk to U.S. 
agriculture.  Tephritid fruit flies spend their larval stages feeding and growing in over 400 host 
plants.  Introduction of these pest species into the United States causes economic losses from 
destruction and spoiling of host commodities by larvae, costs associated with

, Bactrocera, and Ceratitis pose the greatest risk to U.S. 
agriculture.  Tephritid fruit flies spend their larval stages feeding and growing in over 400 host 
plants.  Introduction of these pest species into the United States causes economic losses from 
destruction and spoiling of host commodities by larvae, costs associated with implementing 
control measures, and loss of market share due to restrictions on shipment of host commodities.  
The extensive damage and wide host range of tephritid fruit flies become obstacles to 
agricultural diversification and trade when pest fruit fly species become established in these 
areas (USDA APHIS 2013).  
 
Spinosad is a broad spectrum insecticide registered for use on agricultural crops, ornamentals, 
tree farms/plantations, turfgrass, home gardens and lawns (residential use).  It is also registered 
for drywood termiticide use, poultry use, area-wide fruit fly use, post-harvest grain use, larval 
mosquitoes, and as a seed treatment (USEPA 2011).

In the USDA APHIS Fruit Fly Eradication Program, spinosad and the attractant, methyl eugenol, 
are used in combination as a bait to control multiple species of tephritid fruit flies that infest tree, 
vine and vegetable crops.  The bait is a thick yellow-brown liquid with a sweet fruit odor.  Fruit 
flies can detect the bait several yards away from the deposition site.  Through ingestion. spinosad 
over-activates the central nervous system of insects via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

 a thick yellow-brown liquid with a sweet fruit odor.  Fruit 
flies can detect the bait several yards away from the deposition site.  Through ingestion. spinosad 
over-activates the central nervous system of insects via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  
Target insects exhibit tremors, trembling, paralysis and eventual death.  APHIS PPQ proposes to 
use STATICTM Spinosad ME bait for its programs. 
 
The following sections discuss the chemical description and product use of STATICTM Spinosad 
ME; physical and chemical properties; environmental fate; and hazard identification for spinosad 
and methyl eugenol.   
2.1 Chemical Description and Product Use 
 
STATICTM Spinosad ME is an insecticidal bait containing 2% spinosad (active ingredient) and 
51% methyl eugenol (a chemical attractant) dispersed within a waxy formulation carrier 
(SPLATTM).  Spinosad is a mixture of spinosyn A and D (macrocyclic lactones).  The 
formulation is in a ratio of 85:15 of spinosyn A to D.  Spinosad is produced biologically from the 
fermentation culture of the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora spinosa, a bacterial organism 
isolated from soil.  
 
STATICTM Spinosad ME is used for selective attraction and control of male tephritid fruit files 
of the genus Bactrocera (or other fruit fly species which respond to the male specific attractant 
methy eugenol).  The product selectively eliminates male fruit flies from a localized area, which 
disrupts mating leading to decline or local eradication of a fruit fly population.  It is most 
effective when fruit fly populations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ritid fruit files 
of the genus Bactrocera (or other fruit fly species which respond to the male specific attractant 
methy eugenol).  The product selectively eliminates male fruit flies from a localized area, which 
disrupts mating leading to decline or local eradication of a fruit fly population.  It is most 
effective when fruit fly populations are maintained at low levels and males are already scarce.   
 
The preferred application method is as small dollops or large droplets targeted as spot 
applications to stakes, posts, fences, non-crop tree trunks or limbs, artificial targets, or non-edible 
border vegetation surrounding crop fields.  The proposed use of this new formulation is similar 
where it will be applied by hand in dollops to sites on telephone poles, light poles, fences, other 
inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs, non-edible foliage where it won’t be readily 
accessible to the general public.  The application techniques can vary from application of dollops 
using a spatula or other spreading implement to mechanical or pneumatic meter-jet capable of 
delivering large droplets.  Aerial applications are not permitted.   
 
The product comes as a ready-to-use formulation.  The application rates of this formulation for 
spot applications to non-crop surfaces are 3.4 to 6.85 fl oz (0.0045 to 0.009 lb) active ingredient 
(ai) spinosad per acre.   
2.2 Physical and Chemical Properties  
 
Spinosad (technical grade) is a light gray to white crystalline solid with an odor of slightly stale 
water (CDPR 2002).  The chemical structure of spinosad is shown in Figure 2-1.

2.3 Environmental Fate 
 
The environmental fate describes the processes by which spinosad moves and is transformed in 
the environment.  The environmental fate processes include: 1) mobility, persistence, and 
degradation in soil, 2) movement to air, 3) migration potential to groundwater and surface water, 
and 4) plant uptake.   
 
Spinosad persistence in the environment is variable in terrestrial and aquatic systems (Table 2-2) 
(USEPA 1998).  Spinosad is not sensitive to hydrolysis but breaks down rapidly in water in the 
presence of light with reported photolytic half-lives of less than 1 day.  The rapid photolytic 
breakdown of spinosad in laboratory studies has also been confirmed in microcosm studies 
(Cleveland et al. 2002).  Solubility of spinosad in water is pH dependent and is dependent on the 
structurally similar active ingredients.  Solubility for spinosyn A ranges from 290 to 16 mg/L 
with increasing pH, while the solubility for spinosyn D is much less but still pH-dependent with 
values ranging from 28.7 to 0.05 mg/L for pH values between five and nine (Cleveland et al. 
2002).

Degradation of spinosyn A and D in soil is rapid under aerobic conditions suggesting spinosad is 
susceptible to microbial degradation (EPA 1998a, Hale and Portwood 1996).  Spinosad also 
degrades quickly on plant surfaces with reported half-lives ranging from 2.0 to 11.7 days (CDPR 
2002, Sharma et al. 2008). 
 
Spinosad is not considered mobile based on the available soil adsorption (Koc) studies that have 
been conducted on a range of soil types.  Values range from 884 to 145,350, with the lowest 
value occurring in a loamy sand with 1.1 percent organic matter and a cation exchange capacity

(cec) of 1.9, while the highest value is for a silt loam soil with 0.4 percent organic matter and a 
cec of 12.0 (CDPR 2002).  
  
Spinosad is not considered to be volatile based on the vapor pressure for both active ingredients, 
with values of 2.4 x 10-10 mm Hg for spinosyn A and 1.6 x 10-10 mm Hg for spinosyn D 
(Cleveland et al., 2002).  Chemicals with vapor pressure values less that 1 x 10-6 are considered 
nonvolatile (CDPR 2002). 
Methyl eugenol is a volatile compound.  In the atmosphere, methyl eugenol will be degraded by 
reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals.  The half-life for this reaction in air 
is estimated to be 5 hours (Toxnet 2013).  Based upon an estimated Koc of 140, methyl eugenol 
released to soil is expected to have high mobility, and methyl eugenol released to water is 
expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment.  Based upon an estimated 
Henry's Law constant of 5.6 x 10-6 atm-cu m/mole, methyl eugenol in moist soil surface and 
water surface is expected to volatilize.  Dissipation half-lives of 6 and 16 hours (at 32 and 22 deg 
C, respectively) in soil and 6 and 34 hours (at 32 and 22 deg C, respectively) in water have been

 10-6 atm-cu m/mole, methyl eugenol in moist soil surface and 
water surface is expected to volatilize.  Dissipation half-lives of 6 and 16 hours (at 32 and 22 deg 
C, respectively) in soil and 6 and 34 hours (at 32 and 22 deg C, respectively) in water have been 
reported.  Methyl eugenol in water is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due 
to the lack of hydrolysable functional groups (Toxnet 2013).  Modelling predicted half-lives of 
methyl eugenol in soil, water, and sediment were 8 days, 8 days, and 32 days, respectively.  
These predicted half-lives suggested that methyl eugenol is expected to reside mainly in the 
environmental compartment to which it is released (Environment Canada 2010).   
The active ingredients in STATICTM Spinosad ME are applied within a waxy formulation carrier, 
which serves to impart increased residual and rainfastness to the active ingredient and methyl 
eugenol lure.  Therefore, the degradation rates of the active ingredient are lower. 
2.4 Hazard Identification  
 
Spinosad has low acute toxicity and is classified by USEPA as Toxicity Category III (slightly 
toxic with “caution” warning on label) for acute oral and dermal toxicity and Toxicity Category 
IV (Not acutely toxic with no warning on label) for acute inhalation toxicity, primary eye 
irritation, and primary skin irritation (USEPA 2005).  The rat oral median lethal dose (LD50) is 
3,738 mg/kg for males and >5,000 mg/kg for females, whereas the mouse oral LD50 is >5,000 
mg/kg. The

irritation, and primary skin irritation (USEPA 2005).  The rat oral median lethal dose (LD50) is 
3,738 mg/kg for males and >5,000 mg/kg for females, whereas the mouse oral LD50 is >5,000 
mg/kg. The rabbit dermal LD50 is >2,000 mg/kg and the rat inhalation median lethal 
concentration (LC50) is >5.18 mg/l air (USEPA 1998).   
 
In subchronic toxicity studes the primary effects in mouse were increased vacuolation of cells in 
the lymphoid organs, liver, kidney, stomach, female reproductive tract, and epididymis, and less 
severely in the heart, lung, pancreas, adrenal cortex, bone marrow, tongue, pituitary gland, and 
anemia.  Thyroid follicle epithelial cell vacuolation, anemia, multifocal hepatocellular 
granuloma, cardiomyopathy and spleenic histiocytosis were observed in rats.  Microscopic 
changes in a variety of tissues, anemia, and possible liver damage were observed in dogs 
(USEPA 2005).  Spinosad was evaluated in 13-week dietary studies and showed No Observable 
Effect Levels (NOELs) of 4.9 mg/kg/day in dogs, 6 mg/kg/day in mice, and 8.6 mg/kg/day in 
rats. No dermal irritation or systemic toxicity occurred in a 21-day repeated dose dermal toxicity 
study in rabbits at 1,000 mg/kg/day (USEPA 1998).  It is not a dermal sensitizer based on a lack

rats. No dermal irritation or systemic toxicity occurred in a 21-day repeated dose dermal toxicity 
study in rabbits at 1,000 mg/kg/day (USEPA 1998).  It is not a dermal sensitizer based on a lack 
 
6 
 
of toxicity observed at the limit dose in a 21-day dermal toxicity study using rabbits (USEPA 
2005).   
 
Chronic toxicity studies in the dog and rat report NOELs of 2.68 and 2.72 mg/kg/day, 
respectively for male and female dogs, and 2.4 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively for male and 
female rats. 
 
Spinosad is not a neurotoxic agent in acute, subchronic, or chronic toxicity studies.  No 
neurotoxic effects were observed at the limit dose in an acute neurotoxicity study in rats and at 
doses up to 42.7 mg/kg/day in a subchronic neurotoxicity study.  In a chronic feeding study in 
dogs, increases in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglycerides 
levels, and the presence of tissue abnormalities, including vacuolated cell aggregations, arteritis, 
and glandular cell vacuolation (parathyroid) were observed.  In a chronic oral toxicity study in 
rats, vacuolation of thyroid follicular cells, increased absolute, and relative thyroid weights were 
observed.  In mice, rats, and dogs, other organs including liver, kidney, spleen, heart, thyroid, 
and bone marrow (anemia) appeared to be the target organs (USEPA

rats, vacuolation of thyroid follicular cells, increased absolute, and relative thyroid weights were 
observed.  In mice, rats, and dogs, other organs including liver, kidney, spleen, heart, thyroid, 
and bone marrow (anemia) appeared to be the target organs (USEPA 2005).  
 
No developmental effects were observed in the rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies. In a 
2-generation reproduction study in rats, decreased litter size and survival was observed in the 
presence of maternal toxicity (deaths) at the highest dose tested.  However, the maternal and 
offspring toxicity (deaths) indicated no evidence of increased susceptibility in this study (USEPA 
2005). 
 
There were no major differences in the bioavailability, routes or rates of excretion, or 
metabolism following a single low oral dose, single high oral dose, or repeated oral doses in rats.  
Most of the dose (approximately 70-80%) was absorbed.  Approximately 20% of the dose was 
eliminated in the feces which was the major route of excretion.  The excreted metabolites were 
glutathione conjugates of the parent and O-demethylated Factor A.  Metabolites in the tissues 
were the N-and O-demethylated Factor A.  With rapid biliary excretion, metabolites in the bile 
were the glutathione conjugates of parent and N-and O-demethylated forms of Factor D (USEPA 
2005).

Carcinogenicity/Mutagenicity:  
 
Carcinogenic toxicity studies show spinosad is not likely to be carcinogenic (USEPA 1998, Yano 
et al. 2002, Stebbins et al. 2002, USEPA 2005).  It is also negative for mutagenicity in various 
mutagenicity assays.   
 
Endocrine disruption: 
 
A literature search regarding available spinosad toxicity studies show that there was no estrogen 
or thyroid mediated toxicity (USEPA 2005).   
 
Spinosad is not among the group of 58 pesticide active ingredients on the initial list to be 
screened under the EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.  This program determines 
whether certain substances may have an effect in humans or wildlife similar to an effect 
 
7 
 
produced by a “naturally occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effects as the Administrator 
may designate”.  Spinosad is not on the USEPA Draft Second Endocrine Disruptor Screening 
Program (EDSP) List of Chemicals for Tier 1 Screening (USEPA 2010).  USEPA considers that 
the compounds on the list are candidates (at least for screening purposes) under EDSP testing 
based only on their pesticide registration status and/or because such substances may occur in 
sources of drinking water to which a substantial population may be exposed (USEPA 2013b).

sources of drinking water to which a substantial population may be exposed (USEPA 2013b). 
 
Other ingredients: 
 
Methy eugenol is another ingredient in the formulation used as a chemical attractant for fruit 
flies.  Methyl eugenol is a naturally occurring constituent found in a number of plants such as 
nutmeg, pimento, lemongrass, tarragon, basil, star anise and fennel (European Commission 
2001). 
 
Methyl eugenol is considered moderately toxic to mammals with median lethal oral doses of 810 
to 1,560 mg/kg for rats and 540 mg/kg for mice.  The undiluted chemical (98% purity) is not 
considered an eye or a skin irritant (NTP 2000).  Methyl eugenol is considered practically 
nontoxic in dermal or inhalation acute exposures (Beroza et al. 1975).  Longer term studies using 
methyl eugenol have also been conducted using rats and mice.  In a 14-week study, a dose of 0, 
10, 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg methyl eugenol/kg body weight in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose 
were administered to groups of 10 males and 10 females per sex per species by gavage (5 days 
per week) (Abdo et al. 2001).  Methyl eugenol administration to rats induced erythrocyte 
microcytosis, thrombocytosis, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia.  It caused an increase in

do et al. 2001).  Methyl eugenol administration to rats induced erythrocyte 
microcytosis, thrombocytosis, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia.  It caused an increase in 
serum alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities and bile acid 
concentration.  Methyl eugenol also caused an increase in the incidence of hepatocyte cytologic 
alteration, cytomegaly, Kupffer cell pigmentation, mixed foci of cellular alteration and bile duct 
hyperplasia of the liver and atrophy and chronic inflammation of the mucosa of the glandular 
stomach.  In mice, methyl eugenol caused an increase in the incidence of cytologic alteration, 
necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia and subacute inflammation of the liver and atrophy, degeneration, 
necrosis, edema, mitotic alteration, and cystic glands of the fundic region of the glandular 
stomach.  The NOEL of methyl eugenol for both species was estimated at 10 mg/kg (NTP 2013).  
In long-term exposures the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted 2-year studies in rats 
and mice and concluded that there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male and 
female F344/N rats, based on an increase incidence of liver neoplasms and neuroendocrine 
tumors of the glandular stomach in male and female rats, and increased incidence of kidney 
neoplasms, malignant fibroma and fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) in male rats (NTP 2000, 
2013).  Dose rates in both studies ranged from 37 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg with the dose-related

tumors of the glandular stomach in male and female rats, and increased incidence of kidney 
neoplasms, malignant fibroma and fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) in male rats (NTP 2000, 
2013).  Dose rates in both studies ranged from 37 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg with the dose-related 
effects varying based on the endpoint and a NOEL not reported for either test species.  Methyl 
eugenol is not considered to be mutagenic and in metabolism studies has been shown to be 
rapidly eliminated and excreted from human blood serum (NTP 2013, Schecter et al. 2004). 
 
The reported effects of methyl eugenol are at doses above those expected to occur in human 
populations and is reflected in the USEPA’s Tolerance Reassessment Eligibility Document for 
methyl eugenol that concluded "...there is a reasonable certainty that no harm to any population 
or subgroup will result from the dietary and water exposure to methyl eugenol from uses 
specified in the existing exemption for the requirements for tolerance for methyl eugenol under 
 
8 
 
40 CFR §180.1067." (USEPA 2006).  In addition the Food and Drug Admnistration (FDA) 
classifies methyl eugenol as a “Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)” compound suggesting a 
low hazard to human health.

A dose-response assessment evaluates the dose levels (toxicity criteria) for potential human

USEPA established a chronic oral reference dose (RfD) of 0.0268 mg/kg/day for spinosad based 
on chronic toxicity studies with the dog and rat.  This RfD has incorporated a 100-fold safety 
factor to the NOELs (see Section 2.4) found in the chronic dog study to include animal to human 
extrapolation (an uncertainty factor of 10) and sensitive subgroups with a population (an 
uncertainty factor of 10) (USEPA 1998).  For occupational exposure, the RfD is 0.27 mg/kg/day 
because the uncertainty factor of 10 for protection of sensitive subgroups such as infants or 
children is not applicable.  The RfD for occupational exposure of 0.27 mg/kg/day is used for this 
human health risk assessment. 
3.2 Ecological Dose-Response Assessment 
3.2.1 Wild Mammal Toxicity 
 
The acute and chronic toxicity of spinosad to wild mammals is expected to be low from oral, 
dermal and inhalation exposures based on the available data summarized above in the hazard 
identification section of this risk assessment. Using the lowest reported acute LD50 value and the 
lowest subchronic rat NOEL, adjusted LD50 and NOEL values were calculated for different size 
mammals (Table 3-1).  The ranges of different body weights and consumption rates were 
selected to represent mammals, such as the shrew that

 in the hazard 
identification section of this risk assessment. Using the lowest reported acute LD50 value and the 
lowest subchronic rat NOEL, adjusted LD50 and NOEL values were calculated for different size 
mammals (Table 3-1).  The ranges of different body weights and consumption rates were 
selected to represent mammals, such as the shrew that consumes a large percentage of their body 
weight and may receive higher exposure, as well as larger mammals (1 kg) that may consume 
less when compared to the standard laboratory rat, which is used in several of the mammalian 
toxicity studies.  The lowest subchronic value was selected due to the short environmental half-
life of spinosad.  Effects from daily exposure over a 13-week period are not expected but provide 
a conservative estimate of effects.  These values are also lower than any of the developmental 
and reproductive NOEL values that have been determined in previous studies.

Spinosad acute and chronic toxicity to birds is low for both surrogate species that have been 
tested (Table 3-2).  Acute LD50 and LC50 for the mallard and bobwhite quail are greater than the 
highest concentration tested, 1,333 mg/kg and 5,156 parts per million (ppm), respectively (EPA, 
2010).  Chronic toxicity is also low with reproduction NOEC values of 500 ppm for the mallard 
and 550 ppm for the bobwhite quail in 20-week exposure studies.

No reptile toxicity data appears to be available for spinosad.  USEPA/OPP uses the effects data 
for birds to represent sensitivity to reptiles.  There is uncertainty in this assumption; however, 
based on the low toxicity of spinosad to birds and mammals, as well as aquatic vertebrates, 
toxicity to reptiles would also be expected to be low. 
3.2.3 Terrestrial Invertebrate Toxicity 
 
Toxicity to terrestrial invertebrates is variable based on the available toxicity data for pests, 
pollinators, and biocontrol agents.  Honey bees appear to be one of the more sensitive terrestrial 
invertebrates to spinosad, with 48-hour contact LD50 values ranging from 0.0029 to 0.078 µg 
ai/bee and a reported NOEC of 0.0016 µg ai/bee (0.016 µg/g) (

ocontrol agents.  Honey bees appear to be one of the more sensitive terrestrial 
invertebrates to spinosad, with 48-hour contact LD50 values ranging from 0.0029 to 0.078 µg 
ai/bee and a reported NOEC of 0.0016 µg ai/bee (0.016 µg/g) (Mayes et al. 2003).  Toxicity to 
honey bees is similar to other native bees with reported contact LD50 values of 0.058, 0.065, and 
0.078 µg ai/bee for the alfalfa leafcutter bee (Megachile rotundata), alkali bee (Nomia 
melanderi) and honey bee, respectively (Mayer et al., 2001).  Contact toxicity to spinosad 
decreases rapidly after applications are allowed to dry.  Laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies 
have demonstrated that spinosad is nontoxic to bees 3 hours after application (Mayes et al., 
2003).  Studies using honey bees and bumblebees exposed to spinosad residues on alfalfa, 
strawberries, almonds, citrus, and kiwifruit have documented a lack of impacts to pollinators 
when applications are made when bees are not active, and after residues have weathered. 
Toxicity to other nontarget insects ranges from 3.3 to greater than 200 mg/L based on reported 
LC50 values (Thompson et al. 2000, Williams et al. 2003, Penagos et al. 2005, Miles and Eelen 
2006, Semiz et al. 2006).  Within Lepidoptera, sensitivity can vary with effective treatment rates 
ranging from 25 to 360 g/ha (Thompson et al. 2000).  Lepidoptera appear to be less

LC50 values (Thompson et al. 2000, Williams et al. 2003, Penagos et al. 2005, Miles and Eelen 
2006, Semiz et al. 2006).  Within Lepidoptera, sensitivity can vary with effective treatment rates 
ranging from 25 to 360 g/ha (Thompson et al. 2000).  Lepidoptera appear to be less sensitive to 
spinosad compared to pollinators, such as honey bees and bumblebees.  For example, contact 
toxicity of fourth instar Spodoptera littoralis larvae to spinosad is reported as 4.74 µg/g, which is 
lower than the 0.029 µg/g reported for the honey bee (Pineda et al. 2006).   Dietary spinosad 
LC50 values for S. littoralis range from 0.5 to 2.98 ppm.  
Based on field-collected data, there were no effects on abundance and diversity of Lepidoptera, 
Coleoptera, or Hymenoptera when sampled using malaise traps 2 and 6 days after spinosad 
treatment for emerald ash borer (USDA APHIS 2007).  Aerial broadcast applications were made 
to several plots ranging in size from 8 to 20 acres at a rate (0.23 lb ai/ac) which is greater than 
two orders of magnitude above the use rate proposed in the fruit fly program.  Non-target 
terrestrial invertebrate impacts have also been evaluated using this specific combination of 
spinosad and the attractant methyl eugenol.  Methyl eugenol is a naturally occurring chemical 
produced in over 450 plant species with varied effects on terrestrial invertebrates (Tan and 
Nishida 2012).  Stark et al. (2004) demonstrated that contact toxicity

Nishida 2012).  Stark et al. (2004) demonstrated that contact toxicity of spinosad to two 
parasitoids only occurred at levels well above those that would be encountered in any field 
setting.   
3.2.4 Terrestrial Plant Toxicity 
 
No terrestrial phytotoxicity has been noted using spinosad at rates up to 0.18 lb ai/ac (EPA 
1998a).

3.2.5 Aquatic Toxicity 
 
Spinosad has moderate toxicity to fish based on the available toxicity data, with acute toxicity 
values ranging from 4.99 to 30 mg/L in 96-hour exposures (Table 3-4).

A literature review revealed no apparent toxicity data for spinosad on amphibians.  EPA–OPP 
uses fish toxicity data to represent the sensitivity of amphibians which provides uncertainty due 
to potential differences in sensitivities, and differences in exposure pathways between fish and 
adult amphibians.  However, due to the lack of amphibian-related data for spinosad, fish effects 
data will be used as a surrogate and discussed in relation to risk in the below aquatic risk 
characterization section.   
 
Based on the available aquatic toxicity profile, spinosad has variable toxicity to aquatic 
invertebrates (Table 3-5) (EPA 1998a, Stark and Banks 2001,  Cleveland et al. 2001).  Longer 
term studies show that under continuous exposure for 21 days, spinosad has a greater effect on 
the freshwater cladoceran, Daphnia magna.  The same study using pulse doses within a short 
period of time demonstrates the rapid breakdown of spinosad with an approximate tenfold 
decrease in toxicity.  Stark and Vargas (2003) demonstrated demographic effects to D. pulex

Test chambers were renewed every other day for the duration of the study.  In a long-term

when compared to D. magna tested under continuous exposure conditions.

Mosquito species, such as Culex pipiens, Aedes aegypti, and A. albimanus appear to be the most 
sensitive aquatic invertebate taxa to spinosad, while the cladoceran D. magna was the least 
sensitive with a 48-hour EC50 of 14 mg/L (EPA 1998a,  Bond et al. 2004).  Mosquito sensitivity 
was comparable between technical and formulated spinosad based on the available data using 
other spinosad formulations  (Bond et al. 2004, Cetin et al. 2005, Stevens et al. 2005,  Ayesa et 
al. 2006).

al. 2006).  
  
Toxicity to aquatic plants, such as diatoms and algae, range from 0.107 mg/L for the freshwater 
diatom, Navicula pelliculosa, to greater than 105.5 mg/L for green algae based on 5-day 
exposures (EPA 2010).  Toxicity to aquatic macrophytes is based on a 14-day EC50 value for 
duckweed, Lemna gibba, which was reported as 10.6 mg/L. 
 3.2.6 Metabolite and Formulation Toxicity 
 
Available acute and chronic aquatic toxicity data for metabolites of spinosyn A and D 
demonstrate that metabolites are less toxic than the parent material (Table 3-6) (USEPA 2013c).  
The spinosyn A metabolite has a sublethal toxicity value that is more than 160 times below the 
reported spinosad NOEC for D. magna.  The same is true when comparing chronic toxicity 
values for D. magna between the parent and metabolite.  Based on NOEC values from the 
21-day studies, the spinosyn A metabolite is more than 15,000 times less toxic than the parent.  
Similar reductions in toxicity are also observed when comparing spinosad aquatic invertebrate 
toxicity to the primary metabolite for spinosyn D.

No aquatic ecological effects data is available for the proposed formulation however available

 for the proposed formulation however available 
data on other formulations of spinosad, and the other primary product in the formulation, methyl 
eugenol, suggest toxicity will occur primarily through exposure to spinosad.  Methyl eugenol 
comprises 51% of the proposed formulation.  Reported methyl eugenol 96-hour acute aquatic 
toxicity values range from 6.9 mg/L for the rainbow trout and 8.1 mg/L for the bluegill sunfish 
(Beroza et al. 1975).  These values are in the same range of acute toxicity values for fish and 
spinosad however the methyl eugenol toxicity values exceed the solubility for methyl eugenol 
and therefore would not occur in aquatic systems.  Available aquatic invertebrate data is limited 
however median lethality values for various mosquito species exceed 50 mg/L which is well 
above the solubility limit for methyl eugenol (Perumalsamy et al. 2010).  Toxicity to terrestrial 
wildlife is expected to be similar between the formulation and technical active ingredient based 
on the previously discussed acute mammalian formulation data and the technical active 
ingredient. 
 
4.0 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT 
4.1 Human Health Exposure Assessment 
 
Exposure assessment estimates the potential exposure of humans to spinosad.  The exposure 
assessment begins with the use and application method of STATICTM Spinosad ME.  A complete 
exposure pathway for spinosad includes (1) a release from a spinosad source, (2) an exposure 
point where contact can occur, and (3) an exposure route such as ingestion, inhalation, or dermal 
contact by which contact can occur (USEPA 1989).  Exposures for the identified human 
pop

.  A complete 
exposure pathway for spinosad includes (1) a release from a spinosad source, (2) an exposure 
point where contact can occur, and (3) an exposure route such as ingestion, inhalation, or dermal 
contact by which contact can occur (USEPA 1989).  Exposures for the identified human 
populations are evaluated for each identified exposure pathway. 
 
 
 
 
14 
 
4.1.1 Potentially Exposed Human Populations and Complete Exposure Pathways 
 
The STATICTM Spinosad ME formulation is used as a bait (small dollops or large droplets) and 
hand applied using a spatula or other spreading implement, or pneumatic meter-jet capable of 
delivering large droplets.  STATICTM Spinosad ME is expected to be applied to sites higher up 
on telephone poles, light poles, fences, other inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs, 
non-edible foliage where it is not readily accessible to the general public.  Therefore, workers 
(i.e. handlers) in the program are the most likely subgroup that could be exposed to spinosad.  
The potential exposure to workers to spinosad is from mixing (thorough stirring and mixing of 
the formulation is required prior to use although the formulation is ready-to-use) and application 
activities.  Under normal applications, the potential for handlers to be exposed to spinosad is 
minimal from mixing and spot application with adherence to labeled requirements for personal 
protective equipment (PPE) (long-sleeved shirt and long pants, shoes and socks, and chemical-
resistant gloves).  Under the accidental event when PPEs do not function properly, the complete

 normal applications, the potential for handlers to be exposed to spinosad is 
minimal from mixing and spot application with adherence to labeled requirements for personal 
protective equipment (PPE) (long-sleeved shirt and long pants, shoes and socks, and chemical-
resistant gloves).  Under the accidental event when PPEs do not function properly, the complete 
exposure pathway for these workers includes dermal contact and is further evaluated in Section 
6.  Inhalation route is not complete for spinosad because spinosad is not volatile, and exposure 
from the inhalation route is limited for methyl eugenol during stirring and mixing of the waxy 
formulation.  Incidental ingestion route is not complete under the spot application method.   
 
The general public such as residents is not identified as a potentially exposed human population 
because their exposure to spinosad in STATICTM Spinosad ME bait formulation is extremely 
unlikely when the locations of the baits are not readily accessible to the general public.   
 
A complete exposure pathway is not identified for dietary plant consumption or dermal contact 
to plants because the STATICTM Spinosad ME bait is not applied to plants that would be 
harvested for human consumption.  In addition, spinosad degrades quickly on plant surfaces (see 
Section 2.3). 
 
A complete exposure pathway is not identified for the groundwater medium or surface water 
medium based on the specific spot application method required by the label.  Surface runoff via 
rain fall may occur, however, the amount of spinosad from this bait formulation releasing to soil 
is minimal based on the proposed low application rates.  In addition this particular formulation of 
spinosad within a waxy carrier is rain fast and would not be expected to be removed from the

rain fall may occur, however, the amount of spinosad from this bait formulation releasing to soil 
is minimal based on the proposed low application rates.  In addition this particular formulation of 
spinosad within a waxy carrier is rain fast and would not be expected to be removed from the site 
of application until after significant weathering and degradation occurs reducing the amount of 
spinosad available for runoff to receiving water that could serve as a drinking water source.   
 4.1.2 Exposure Evaluation 
 
This section quantitatively evaluates the worker accidental exposures from dermal contact 
pathway while mixing, loading, and applying the spinosad baits.  Under the accidental exposure 
scenario, it assumes that chemical-resistant gloves are broken.    
 
Chemical-specific data to assess potential exposure to occupational pesticide handlers were not 
available.  The estimates of exposure to pesticide handlers are based on surrogate study data 
available in the Pesticide Handlers Exposure Database (PHED) (USEPA 2013d).  The

The unit exposure for the surrogate scenario is 1300 µg/lb ai.  Application rates range from 
0.0045 to 0.009 lb ai/acre.  The following equations are used to estimate the exposure dose of 
dermal contact for workers:   
 
Exposure Dose = Daily Dose Rate/Body Weight 
Daily Dose Rate = Unit Exposure (mg/lb ai) x Application Rate (lb ai/acre) x Area 
Treated (acre/day) 
 
The exposure doses were estimated for the application rates and summarized in Appendix A. 
 
4.2 Ecological Exposure Assessment 
 4.2.1 Terrestrial Exposure Pathway Evaluation 
 
The potential for exposure of nontarget terrestrial vertebrates to the proposed formulation of 
spinosad is minimal through either the dermal, inhalation or dietary routes.  The lack of dietary 
exposure is based on the method of application which will not include objects that would be 
consumed by nontarget vertebrates (ex. light poles, tree trunks).  Dermal exposure would also be 
low and would only occur when a nontarget vertebrate would come into contact with the material 
while moving over an area on a pole or tree where an application was made.  Inhalation exposure 
would also be low due to the method of application and low volatility of spinosad.  There is the 
potential for some inhalation exposure to methyl eugenol due to its volatility however methyl

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 a nontarget vertebrate would come into contact with the material 
while moving over an area on a pole or tree where an application was made.  Inhalation exposure 
would also be low due to the method of application and low volatility of spinosad.  There is the 
potential for some inhalation exposure to methyl eugenol due to its volatility however methyl 
eugenol is a naturally occurring phenylpropanoid compound that is released when plants are 
damaged and its use in this program would not be expected to result in exposures to terrestrial 
vertebrates beyond ambient levels. 
 4.2.2 Aquatic Exposure Pathway Evaluation 
 
Exposure to aquatic biota from the proposed use of spinosad is expected to result in negligible 
residues based on the use pattern and low application rates.  Applications are hand applied to 
specific objects such as light and telephones poles, tree limbs as either large dollops are very 
large droplets that would not be susceptible to drift.  A possible scenario of aquatic exposure 
could occur where a dollop or large droplet becomes dislodged from the site of application after 
it has weathered and washed into a receiving stream.   This scenario would result in negligible 
residues based on conservative estimates of spinosad transport into water bodies.  Assuming the 
maximum application rate for spinosad (0.009 lb ai/ac) is discharged into a water body such as a 
wetland that is one acre in size and six inches deep would result in a spinosad reside of 3.3 µg/L.  
This very conservative assumption assumes all material applied in one acre is available for 
transport and that no degradation would occur.   Residues into other larger bodies of water or 
those where water is running would

wetland that is one acre in size and six inches deep would result in a spinosad reside of 3.3 µg/L.  
This very conservative assumption assumes all material applied in one acre is available for 
transport and that no degradation would occur.   Residues into other larger bodies of water or 
those where water is running would result in substantially lower residues due to the dilution in 
those types of water bodies.

5.0 RISK CHARACTERIZATION 
5.1 Human Health 
 
Risks associated with adverse human health and fish and wildlife are characterized quantitatively 
and qualitatively in this section.  Under the proposed use, STATICTM Spinosad ME baits for spot 
application to eradicate fruit flies poses minimal risk to human health due to limited exposure for 
applicators using appropriate PPE and the low acute toxicity of spinosad to mammals.  
Accidental risk (hazard quotient) was estimated by dividing the exposure doses with the toxicity 
value (RfD) for the handler dermal contact exposure scenario.  The estimated risk for labeled 
application rates is low with hazard quotients three to four orders of magnitude below one 
indicating risk from accidental spinosad exposure is minimal (Appendix A).   
 
The general public is not a concern because STATICTM Spinosad ME will be applied to sites on 
telephone poles, light poles, fences, other inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs and 
non-edible foliage where the material is not readily accessible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

telephone poles, light poles, fences, other inanimate objects, non-crop tree trunks or limbs and 
non-edible foliage where the material is not readily accessible. 
 
5.2 Ecological   
 
Risks to fish and wildlife are anticipated to be minimal based on the favorable toxicity profile for 
spinosad, its environmental fate and the proposed use pattern in the fruit fly program.  Direct risk 
to terrestrial vertebrates from ingestion of the bait is extremely low since applications aren’t 
directed to food items such as seeds, fruits and insects that would contain spinosad residues.  In 
cases where terrestrial vertebrates would consume the bait, they would have to consume many 
times their body weight to receive a dose that could result in any effects which is highly unlikely. 
Risk to food items or shelter required by terrestrial vertebrates would also not be anticipated due 
to the method of application, the selective nature of the bait to certain invertebrates and lack of 
risk to terrestrial or aquatic plants.  There is some risk to certain terrestrial invertebrates that are 
attracted to the bait due to the presence of methyl eugenol, and could receive a lethal dose of 
spinosad, however, based on the selective nature of methyl eugenol and spinosad as well as field 
collected data the impacts would be localized and transient and not anticipated to result in 
population level effects to sensitive taxa including beneficial arthropods. 
 
Aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates are also at low risk from the proposed spinosad 
applications.  The method of application eliminates the potential for off-site drift and runoff and 
would only occur in cases where baits become weathered and fall from where they were applied, 
and then carried to aquatic areas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 arthropods. 
 
Aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates are also at low risk from the proposed spinosad 
applications.  The method of application eliminates the potential for off-site drift and runoff and 
would only occur in cases where baits become weathered and fall from where they were applied, 
and then carried to aquatic areas.  A comparison of the aquatic residue from the wetland habitat 
that was estimated in the exposure analysis to the available fish effects data shows that the 
exposure concentration is at least two orders of magnitude below the acute and chronic effects 
data for fish suggesting minimal risk (Figure 5-1).  Acute risk to aquatic invertebrates is also low 
with the range of sensitivities well above the estimated residue in a wetland habitat.  The 25-day 
chronic study with the midge has an effect level below the aquatic residue value while the 
remaining chronic aquatic invertebrate values are well above the instantaneous residue value 
suggesting minimal chronic risk to most aquatic invertebrates.  Exceeding the chronic exposure 
value in the midge study does not imply risk to this group of organisms due to the conservative 
assumptions that were made to calculate an exposure value.  Not all of the material would be 
 
17 
 
expected to become dislodged from the point of application at the same time and simultaneously 
released into a water body.  In addition any exposure that would occur would not be continuous 
over a 25 day period as was done in this study due to spinosad degradation/partitioning in aquatic 
systems.  Degradation would result in a further decrease in risk since the metabolites are less 
toxic than the parent.

toxic than the parent.   
 
 
 
 
Figure 5-1.  Aquatic risk characterization for spinosad. 
 
The lack of risk to both aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates ensures that the direct risk to fish is 
minimal and that their prey base would also be at low risk from the proposed applications of 
spinosad. 
 
6.0 UNCERTAINTIES/CUMULATIVE EFFECTS 
 
Uncertainties and cumulative impacts associated with the risk evaluation are qualitatively 
discussed in this section.  
 
Accidental human exposure to spinosad in baits during mixing, loading, and applying may occur 
to handlers when label required PPEs do not function properly. The RTU formulation serves to 
minimize worker exposure as no mixing is required. Surrogate study data available in the PHED 
were used for the accidental exposure rate since chemical-specific data to assess potential 
exposure to occupational pesticide handlers were not available.  The closest surrogate study to 
the spot application of STATICTM spinosad ME is the mixer/loader/applicator, mechanical-
pressurized handgun sprayer scenario for drench/soil directed applications and all formulations, 
except the wettable powder exposure scenario with single layer and no gloves.  However, this 
scenario is more conservative than the spot application scenario for the proposed formulation 
 
18 
 
because more exposure will occur in the mechanical-pressurized handgun sprayer scenario than 
for placement of a single spot
Text Len: 1679
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rench/soil directed applications and all formulations, 
except the wettable powder exposure scenario with single layer and no gloves.  However, this 
scenario is more conservative than the spot application scenario for the proposed formulation 
 
18 
 
because more exposure will occur in the mechanical-pressurized handgun sprayer scenario than 
for placement of a single spot of pesticide.  
 
Uncertainties in the ecological risk assessment sections of this document are similar to those for 
other pesticides and chemicals.  For example the applicability of surrogate laboratory toxicity 
studies to natural ecosystems is an area of uncertainty in ecological risk assessment 
methodology.  The approach in this assessment was to make assumptions regarding exposure 
that were very conservative and designed to account for some of the uncertainty common with 
screening level ecological risk assessments that rely on standardized toxicity data. Other areas of 
potential uncertainty in these types of assessments are with effects data for the metabolites and 
formulated material, however data was available to demonstrate that common metabolites of 
spinosad are less toxic than the parent material.  
 
Another area of uncertainty in this risk assessment is related to the potential for cumulative 
effects.  The potential for cumulative effects can occur through various exposure pathways such 
as 1) repeated exposure to spinosad; 2) co-exposures to other pesticides within the program with 
respect to their toxicity; 3) exposures to other chemicals impacting the toxicity of spinosad; and 
4) exposures to spinosad from other sources. 
 
Spinosad has other labeled food and non-food uses and is currently used in the APHIS Fruit Fly 
Eradication Program as well as other APHIS programs such as the European Grapevine Moth. 
Cumulatively there would be an increase in spinosad

; and 
4) exposures to spinosad from other sources. 
 
Spinosad has other labeled food and non-food uses and is currently used in the APHIS Fruit Fly 
Eradication Program as well as other APHIS programs such as the European Grapevine Moth. 
Cumulatively there would be an increase in spinosad use in relation to other APHIS and non-
APHIS spinosad uses however the effects to human health and the environment are expected to 
be incrementally negligible, and in cases where it is used as a naled replacement, would be 
beneficial. From a human health perspective repeated exposure to workers would not be 
expected to result in significant cumulative effects due to the use of PPE and the very low risk 
that was determined in this risk assessment.  Cumulative effects to the general population are 
also not anticipated since the likelihood of exposure is very low in this program since 
applications are made to non-food items and there is a very low likelihood of any residues in 
drinking water.  A lack of cumulative effects would also be anticipated as it relates to other 
chemicals since the risk to workers and the general population is very low from the proposed use 
of spinosad in the program.          
 
Neither spinosad nor methyl eugenol are among the five common mechanism groups of 
pesticides (Organophosphates, N-methyl Carbamates, Triazines, Chloroacetanilides, and 
Pyrethrins/Pyrethroids).  USEPA defines that common mechanism of toxicity pertains to two or 
more pesticide chemicals or other substances that cause a common toxic effect(s) by the same, or 
essentially the same, sequence of major biochemical events

, N-methyl Carbamates, Triazines, Chloroacetanilides, and 
Pyrethrins/Pyrethroids).  USEPA defines that common mechanism of toxicity pertains to two or 
more pesticide chemicals or other substances that cause a common toxic effect(s) by the same, or 
essentially the same, sequence of major biochemical events (USEPA 2013e) 
 
Cumulative impacts to aquatic and terrestrial nontarget organisms are expected to be negligible. 
The proposed use pattern for this formulation is not expected to result in risk to nontarget 
terrestrial vertebrates from direct effects or through impacts to available prey or habitat.  The 
lack of significant ecological risk from spinosad use in this program would suggest that 
significant cumulative effects to nontarget organisms from other stressors would be 
incrementally minor.  The selective nature of the use of spinosad in the fruit fly program also 
 
19 
 
ensures that any cumulative impacts to beneficial insects from the use of spinosad in this 
program would be minor and pose less risk than the use of naled in the same formulation type.    
 
Water quality data in the United States, including areas where fruit fly program activities may 
occur, show pesticide mixtures to be a common occurrence in surface water with varying 
impacts to aquatic organisms (USGS  2006).  Some of these bodies of water may be listed 
impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act due to pesticides, or some another abiotic 
or biotic stressor.  The impact to water bodies from any spinosad residues that could occur from 
use in the Fruit Fly Eradication Program is expected to be incrementally negligible to water 
bodies that may already be impacted by other contaminants.

impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act due to pesticides, or some another abiotic 
or biotic stressor.  The impact to water bodies from any spinosad residues that could occur from 
use in the Fruit Fly Eradication Program is expected to be incrementally negligible to water 
bodies that may already be impacted by other contaminants. The waxy materials in STATIC™ 
Spinosad ME increase rainfastness of the bait and reduce runoff. The proposed method of 
application mitigates any impacts from drift and makes runoff unlikely so that any residues that 
could potentially occur in water would not be expected to result in impacts to aquatic biota.  The 
impacts of potential mixtures at any concentration are an area of uncertainty due to the large 
number of potential types of chemical mixtures that could occur, and the spatial and temporal 
variability in their occurrence. Spinosad has been shown to have greater than additive effects to 
aquatic invertebrates such as mosquitos however these occur at doses well above those that 
would occur in this program (Darriet and Corbel, 2006).   The low potential for risk to aquatic 
biota from spinosad applications suggests that mixture toxicity would not result in significant 
cumulative effects.
