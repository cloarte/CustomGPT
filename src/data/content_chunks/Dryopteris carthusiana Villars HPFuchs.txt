Dryopteris carthusiana(Villars) H.P.Fuchs - Narrow Buckler-fern  -Dryopteridaceae© John Wilde© Ulster Museum© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)This is a species which is very similar in many ways to the Broad Buckler-Fern (D. dilatata) but seems to be rather rarer. It has a narrower leaf profile than the Broad Buckler-Fern, and the leaves grow from a creeping rhizome so that they are not produced in shuttlecock-like clusters. Its typical habitat is wet woodland and fen carr on cut-out bogs. It hybridizes with the Broad Buckler-Fern to give a sterile hybrid:Dryopterisxdeweveri.All names:Dryopteris carthusiana(Villars) H.P.Fuchs;Dryopteris lanceolata-cristata(Hoffm.)
