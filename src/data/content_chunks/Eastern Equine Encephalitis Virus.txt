2019 Summary of Eastern Equine 
Encephalitis Cases in the United States 
January 1 – December 31, 2019 
 
 
This report is a descriptive summary of U.S. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases reported to the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2019. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) branch collaborates with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) and State veterinary and public health officials to facilitate communication about 
arbovirus disease cases in horses and confirm equine cases in each State. CDC collects arbovirus case 
information using its ArboNET reporting system, an electronic surveillance and reporting system used to 
track and report arboviral activity in humans and animals. During the transmission season, VS 
disseminates the equine arbovirus case information to State animal health officials for confirmation and 
posts the number of confirmed cases to the USDA equine information Web site 
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine. This site 
also provides specific case definitions. In this document, ‘reported cases’ of EEE may include 
presumptive positive and confirmed positive cases.   
 
In 2019, 184 equine cases of EEE were reported from 24 States. Figure 1 shows the annual number of 
equine EEE cases reported in the U.S. from 2006 through 2019. Figure 2 shows the number of equine 
EEE cases in each State in 2019, and Table 1 provides the number of cases per county or parish in those 
States in 2019.

The 2019 case count of EEE cases in equids throughout the U.S. did not set a high historical record; 
however, there are several observations surrounding EEE infections that made this year particularly 
interesting for both human medical doctors and veterinarians.  Thirty-eight human cases of EEE with 15 
fatalities were confirmed in 10 States.  This is a record-setting number of human cases, with the next 
highest yearly total of 15 cases recorded in 2012 and an average of 7 EEE cases confirmed annually from 
2009-2018.   
 
Another unexplained yet interesting finding is the number of equine West Nile Virus (WNV) cases 
compared to the number of equine EEE cases in 2019.  Historically, the annual WNV case counts in 
equids have been at least double or more the total number of E

Another unexplained yet interesting finding is the number of equine West Nile Virus (WNV) cases 
compared to the number of equine EEE cases in 2019.  Historically, the annual WNV case counts in 
equids have been at least double or more the total number of EEE case counts.  In 2019, a complete 
reversal of these disease totals occurred, with 90 WNV equine cases recorded compared to 184 EEE 
equine cases. Finally, the number of EEE cases confirmed and reported in alternate and wildlife species 
has not previously been seen at such a high level and in so many different species as during 2019.  
 
When spikes in human cases of EEE occur, causes may include environmental and viral factors, from 
weather and geographic features to new EEE strains infecting migratory birds and circulating among 
them and mosquito populations.1 Like equids, humans are a dead-end host for the virus, which is 
predominantly spread by mosquitoes.  No commercial vaccine is available for people. Thus, EEE 
infection often causes death or leads to significant neurological deficits for survivors, making it one of 
the worst viral encephalitides that people can acquire. 
 
EEE is also a deadly disease in equids, where mortality rates can approach 90 percent in unvaccinated 
animals.  This susceptibility to the virus makes equids a recognized EEE sentinel species for the human 
population. The main public health purpose of confirming and reporting equine EEE cases is to inform 
human surveillance efforts. Because equine commercial vaccines are available and convey good 
protection against EEE infection, reported cases of EEE in equids tend to be in unvaccinated or under-
vaccinated animals.

may explain, in part, why overall numbers of equine EEE cases did not show a similar annual spike as 
reported in humans or additional species.
