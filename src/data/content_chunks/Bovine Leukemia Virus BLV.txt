Bovine Leukosis Virus (BLV) 
on U.S. Dairy Operations, 
2007 
 
In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) 
National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) 
conducted the Dairy 2007 study. In all, 17 of the Nation’s 
major dairy States* participated in the study. These 
States divided into two regions and represented 79.5 
percent of U.S. dairy operations and 82.5 percent of U.S. 
dairy cows participated in the study.  
This information sheet presents and compares data 
on BLV prevalence in U.S. dairy cattle collected during 
Dairy 2007 and during a previous NAHMS dairy study, 
Dairy 1996.  
 
BLV  
 
BLV is a retrovirus that infects dairy and beef cattle’s 
lymphoid tissue, causing malignant lymphoma and 
lymphosarcoma in 1 to 5 percent of infected animals. 
The virus is transmitted to cattle primarily by direct 
exposure with infected blood, saliva, semen, and milk.1 
Most BLV-infected cattle seldom present with clinical 
signs of disease. Signs of infection may include tumors 
in lymphoid tissues, enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, 
decreased milk production, fever, loss of appetite, rear-
limb weakness or paralysis, protruding eyeballs, 
gastrointestinal obstructions, and increased blood 
lymphocytes counts. Because no vaccine is available for 
BLV, virus specific antibodies found in serum or milk

in lymphoid tissues, enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, 
decreased milk production, fever, loss of appetite, rear-
limb weakness or paralysis, protruding eyeballs, 
gastrointestinal obstructions, and increased blood 
lymphocytes counts. Because no vaccine is available for 
BLV, virus specific antibodies found in serum or milk are 
a good indicator of exposure and a practical method for 
disease screening.  
 
Economic impact of BLV on U.S. dairies 
 
Producers can incur economic losses because of 
BLV through cattle deaths, reduced reproductive 
efficiency, increased replacement and veterinary costs, 
and the ineligibility to export live cattle, semen, and ova 
to countries where BLV control efforts are in place.2 3  
A BLV certification program conducted in New York 
indicated that the disease had a significant economic 
impact on operations with high seroprevalence of BLV in 
which morbidity and mortality rates were high due to 
malignant lymphoma. 
  
*States/Regions:  
• West: California, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington 
• East: Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New 
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The association between cattle exposed to BLV and 
herd-level productivity was studied using data from the 
NAHMS Dairy 1996 study.4 This study found that herds 
with test-positive cows produced 218 kg less milk per 
cow, per year than those with no test-positive cows.

BLV prevalence on U.S. dairies, 1996 and 
2007 
  
The Dairy 1996 study was the first statistically based 
study in the United States to provide a baseline 
prevalence of BLV and the measures for controlling it. 
During the study, blood samples from cattle on 1,006 
operations were tested using the Agar Gel Immuno-
diffusion test (AGID). Results showed that 89.0 percent 
of U.S. dairy operations had cattle seropositive for BLV; 
74.8 percent of these operations had an estimated 
within-herd prevalence of 25 percent or higher. Dairy 
operations with fewer than 100 cows had lower 
individual animal prevalences and were less likely to be 
seropositive for BLV than operations with more than 200 
cows. 
As part of the 2007 dairy study, bulk tank milk was 
collected from 534 operations with 30 or more dairy 
cows and tested with an Enzyme Linked-Immunosorbent 
Assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies against 
BLV. Results showed that 83.9 percent of U.S. dairy 
operations were positive for BLV (table 1).

BLV prevalence estimates were also reported by 
region: 78.4 percent of operations in the study’s West 
region and 84.4 percent in the East region tested 
positive for BLV antibodies.  
Only 7.5 percent of all operations had independently 
confirmed the presence of BLV on their premises via 
laboratory testing during the 12 months prior to the Dairy 
2007 interview (table 2). Of these operations, the 
majority (88.5 percent) submitted blood samples for 
disease confirmation. Only 6.3 percent submitted tissues 
for necropsy.

Summary  
 
Although the 1996 and 2007 dairy studies used 
different testing methods (AGID vs. milk ELISA) and 
different samples (serum vs. bulk tank milk), both studies 
suggest that BLV is present on the majority of U.S. dairy 
operations. Different regions were used in the 1996 and 
2007 studies for the geographic distribution of dairy 
operations. For this reason, regional differences in BLV 
herd-level prevalence were not comparable.  
In addition, the Dairy 2007 study found that only 7.5 
percent of operations independently confirmed the 
presence of BLV on their operations via laboratory 
testing. Although no details were available regarding the 
reasons why these operations submitted samples for 
BLV testing, it is possible that they had cattle with clinical 
signs compatible with BLV. The low percentage of 
operations that tested for BLV supports the concept that 
although infection is common, clinical signs of BLV are 
not frequently observed. A lower percentage of small 
operations had antibodies detected than large 
operations. 
The high individual animal prevalence of BLV 
reported in the Dairy 1996 study suggests that testing 
and culling seropositive animals may not be a cost 
effective method to control the disease. Instead, 
preventing disease transmission by implementing 
preventive practices would likely be more cost-effective.

Since the primary route of infection is through contact 
with infected blood, prevention involves eliminating blood 
transmission from cow to cow. Prevention practices 
include using a new needle for each injection, discarding 
or cleaning syringes contaminated with blood, and 
cleaning blood-contaminated equipment such as 
dehorning equipment and tattoo pliers. Additionally, 
feeding calves pasteurized colostrum and milk, and 
using BLV seronegative dams for embryo transfer 
should assist in reducing the incidence of BLV.1
