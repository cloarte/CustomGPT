Shortly after the reports of the new H1N1 virus in North America, H1N1 virus outbreaks were reported on turkey breeder farms in Virginia and California in the United States as well as in Chile, Canada, and France. ARS scientists at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPRL) quickly evaluated the pathogenesis of the new H1N1 virus in bird species to determine the potential risk to the poultry industry. The first step was to evaluate whether current U.S H1N1 swine influenza vaccines can protect pigs from infection with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus circulating in people. This research study also evaluated whether pre-existing titers in pigs previously infected with endemic H1N1 swine influenza viruses circulating in the U.S could protect against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. Second was to address whether meat, blood and tissue from pigs infected with the new 2009 H1N1 Influenza A Virus would be free of infectious virus. Classical swine influenza virus infections are enzootic among pigs in North America. Sporadic cases of human infection with swine influenza virus have been reported in the United States and elsewhere. Worldwide, more than 50 human cases of swine influenza virus infection, mostly due to classical swine influenza virus, have been documented in the past 35 years, with the greatest risk of infection among people with occupational exposure to live pigs.

 influenza virus have been reported in the United States and elsewhere. Worldwide, more than 50 human cases of swine influenza virus infection, mostly due to classical swine influenza virus, have been documented in the past 35 years, with the greatest risk of infection among people with occupational exposure to live pigs. Experts believe pigs can act as a "mixing vessel" for the reassortment of avian, swine and human influenza viruses, and might play an important role in the emergence of novel influenza viruses that could be capable of causing a human pandemic similar to the virus in the current outbreak. ARS Veterinary Medical Officers Amy Vincent and Kelly Lager are leading ARS's swine influenza virus research program Between the 1930s and the 1990s, the most commonly circulating swine influenza virus among pigs-classical swine influenza A, known as H1N1-underwent little change. However, by the late 1990s, multiple strains and subtypes of triple reassortant swine influenza viruses-whose genomes include combinations of avian, human and swine influenza virus gene segments-had emerged and became predominant among North American pigs. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is also a triple reassortent, but its lineage is different than the H1N1 influenza viruses currently circulating in U.S. pigs. Background The genetic makeup of swine influenza viruses is identical to other influenza A viruses and consists of 8 segments of RNA that code for different proteins. Influenza viruses have the ability to exchange these segments, creating new genetically different viruses. Two major surface glycoproteins (proteins with a carbohydrate attached), called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), are how influenza A viruses are identified. These glycoproteins also determine the host range, antigenicity and the pathogenicity of the viruses. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins are important targets for diagnostics and used to designate

 (proteins with a carbohydrate attached), called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), are how influenza A viruses are identified. These glycoproteins also determine the host range, antigenicity and the pathogenicity of the viruses. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins are important targets for diagnostics and used to designate the subtype of the virus. Currently 16 different hemagglutinins and 9 neuraminidases have been identified. The majority of these viral subtypes are found in waterfowl, with only a few combinations being found in humans and swine. Swine influenza virus (SIV) is one of the primary causes of respiratory disease in growing pigs and can lead to major economic losses. Currently, only H1N1, H1N2, and pN2 subtypes are circulating in the U.S. swine population.

Previously, the CDC have reported approximately one case of human infection with a swine influenza virus every one to two years.

Shortly after the reports of the new H1N1 virus in North America, H1N1 virus outbreaks were reported on turkey breeder farms in Virginia and California in the United States as well as in Chile, Canada, and France. ARS scientists at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPRL) quickly evaluated the pathogenesis of the new H1N1 virus in bird species to determine the potential risk to the poultry industry. The first step was to evaluate whether current U.S H1N1 swine influenza vaccines can protect pigs from infection with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus circulating in people. This research study also evaluated whether pre-existing titers in pigs previously infected with endemic H1N1 swine influenza viruses circulating in the U.S could protect against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. Second was to address whether meat, blood and tissue from pigs infected with the new 2009 H1N1 Influenza A Virus would be free of infectious virus. Classical swine influenza virus infections are enzootic among pigs in North America.

 influenza virus have been reported in the United States and elsewhere. Worldwide, more than 50 human cases of swine influenza virus infection, mostly due to classical swine influenza virus, have been documented in the past 35 years, with the greatest risk of infection among people with occupational exposure to live pigs. Experts believe pigs can act as a "mixing vessel" for the reassortment of avian, swine and human influenza viruses, and might play an important role in the emergence of novel influenza viruses that could be capable of causing a human pandemic similar to the virus in the current outbreak. ARS Veterinary Medical Officers Amy Vincent and Kelly Lager are leading ARS's swine influenza virus research program Between the 1930s and the 1990s, the most commonly circulating swine influenza virus among pigs-classical swine influenza A, known as H1N1-underwent little change. However, by the late 1990s, multiple strains and subtypes of triple reassortant swine influenza viruses-whose genomes include combinations of avian, human and swine influenza virus gene segments-had emerged and became predominant among North American pigs. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is also a triple reassortent, but its lineage is different than the H1N1 influenza viruses currently circulating in U.S. pigs. Background The genetic makeup of swine influenza viruses is identical to other influenza A viruses and consists of 8 segments of RNA that code for different proteins. Influenza viruses have the ability to exchange these segments, creating new genetically different viruses. Two major surface glycoproteins (proteins with a carbohydrate attached), called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), are how influenza A viruses are identified. These glycoproteins also determine the host range, antigenicity and the pathogenicity of the viruses.

 (proteins with a carbohydrate attached), called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), are how influenza A viruses are identified. These glycoproteins also determine the host range, antigenicity and the pathogenicity of the viruses. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins are important targets for diagnostics and used to designate the subtype of the virus. Currently 16 different hemagglutinins and 9 neuraminidases have been identified. The majority of these viral subtypes are found in waterfowl, with only a few combinations being found in humans and swine. Swine influenza virus (SIV) is one of the primary causes of respiratory disease in growing pigs and can lead to major economic losses. Currently, only H1N1, H1N2, and pN2 subtypes are circulating in the U.S. swine population. For more information about ARS research on H1N1 (swine) influenza viruses, contact: Cyril Gay, ARS Senior National Program Leader, Animal Health cyril.gay@ars.usda.gov 301-504-4786 Pigs have long been considered a potential source for new and novel influenza viruses that infect humans, as they have receptors on their cells that bind both mammalian and avian influenza viruses, increasing the opportunity for the exchange of genetic segments of the virus. Previously, the CDC have reported approximately one case of human infection with a swine influenza virus every one to two years.
