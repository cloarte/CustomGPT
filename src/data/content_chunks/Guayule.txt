Guayule – pronounced “why-YOO-lee” – 
is a woody desert shrub that grows in the 
southwestern United States.  Mostly 
known as an excellent source of natural 
latex, guayule natural rubber is an 
extremely desirable substitute for tropical 
Hevea tree rubber because it does not 
contain the proteins found in tropical 
rubber that can cause allergic reactions in 
some consumers.  To boot, guayule-based 
products serve as greener, grown in the 
USA substitutes for many synthetic, petro-
leum-based products.
For more than a decade, ARS researchers 
with the Bioproducts Research Unit in 
Albany, CA, have worked to take advan-
tage of these benefits and change our 
costly overreliance on imported rubber 
and petroleum.  
In 2016, the scientists developed an 
improved variety of guayule plant as a 
natural source of tire rubber, optimiz-
ing yield capacity.
Currently, ARS researchers are explor-
ing guayule as a source of inexpensive 
and clean energy, such as converting 
the plant into ethanol and other biofu-
els.  The research so far is promising.
It’s not a stretch to say that guayule 
has the potential to be a super plant 
in the near future!
