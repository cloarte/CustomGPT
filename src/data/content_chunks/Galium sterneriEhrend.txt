It is difficult to spot in the field because it grows alongsideG. saxatilewhich is abundant in the same habitat, but can be distinguished by longer narrower leaves, darker green in colour and recurved small spines to the leaf edges. It tends to prefer edges of ledges but does frequently also occur in grassy places on steep slopes, not necessarily on bare rock. It avoids acidic rock or soil.All names:Galium sterneriEhrend.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
