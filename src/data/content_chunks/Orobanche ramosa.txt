 Invasion: Orobanche ramosaproduces leafless flowering stems, 15-20(-30) cm high, usually very branched, bearing alternate scales, less than 1 cm long. The plant is pale, completely lacking chlorophyll. The base of the stem, below ground, is normally swollen and tuberous. The rest of the stem is usually slender, simple or branched, and pale yellow. Leaves are scale-like. The inflorescence, occupying approximately half the length of the stems, carries many acropetally developing flowers, arranged in spikes or racemes, each subtended by a bract 6-10 mm long with two additional bracteoles, attached to the base of the calyx and of similar length.

The corolla, 10-20 mm long, is hairy, tubular, inflated at the base, with two approximately equal lips, the lower is trilobed. The corolla is whitish below and cream, blue or violet distally (occasionally all white). Filaments are inserted in the corolla tube, 3-6 mm above the base. Stigmas obscurely lobed, whitish. An ovoid-spheroid capsule develops up to 6-10 mm long, the valves free at the apex when ripe, and may contain several hundred seeds, each about 0.2 x 0.4 mm. A single plant carries ten to several hundred flowers and can produce up to a quarter million seeds.O. ramosaseeds have varying shapes and the seed coat has a fibrillar periclinal cell wall (Watts et al., 2024). This description is fromChater and Webb (1972)andWorld Flora Online (2024).O. ramosais also described with some detail inHolm et al. (1997).

 Reproduccion: Genetics The chromosome number of O. ramosa is 2n=24. In addition to the genetic variability, evident from the range of varieties and sub-species noted above, there is variation between morphologically similar populations associated with particular hosts. Brault et al. (2007) demonstrated a significant variation in the virulence of parasites collected from rapeseed, tobacco and hemp in France. This variation suggests a development of host-related pathotypes, which was confirmed by differences in RAPD analysis. Musselman and Parker (1982) showed similar variation in the host preference of forms attacking Solanaceae and lettuce. Microsatellite markers in O. ramosa developed by Corre et al. (2014) are potentially useful for population genetics studies and for elucidating host-associated genetic divergence in the species. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers have also been used to determine the taxonomic relationships among Orobanche species and have demonstrated the close relationship between O. ramosa and O. mutelii ( Sharawy and Karakish, 2015 ). Reproductive Biology When the flowers of O. ramosa open, the mature anthers are already in contact with the stigma, and self-pollination is apparently the norm ( Musselman et al., 1982 ). Seeds are produced in very large numbers, many hundreds per capsule, and may remain viable in the soil for many years, possibly for 10 years or more, and certainly for 5 years in many situations. A detailed study of the reproductive biology of O. ramosa subsp. mutelii [ Orobanche mutelli ] was conducted by Prider (2015) in South Australia.

 the reproductive biology of O. ramosa subsp. mutelii [ Orobanche mutelli ] was conducted by Prider (2015) in South Australia. They found that the key characters contributing to the success of the plant include self-pollination, rapid maturation of the reproductive stages and high seed output. The study emphasizes the importance of vigilance so that plants can be controlled before they set seed. Phenology and Physiology Orobanche ramosa is an obligate parasite, needing to connect to a host root within a few days of germination. The seed is minute (approximately 0.2 x 0.4 mm), from which only the radicle emerges, and this can grow only a few millimetres long. A chemical stimulus is needed to trigger Orobanche germination, normally coming from host roots, therefore, Orobanche normally germinates only when a host root is nearby. A moist environment is required for several days, together with suitable temperatures, before the mature seed is responsive to germination stimulants. This preparatory period is known as conditioning or preconditioning. Conditioned seeds remain responsive to germination stimulants for a limited period, after which secondary dormancy may be induced. Their ability to respond to germination stimuli fades gradually when the seeds dry, and they remain dormant until re-conditioned ( Timko et al., 1989 ; Joel et al., 1995a ). The effects of different temperature and moisture regimes on the germination and viability of O. aegyptiaca have been reported by Kebreab and Murdoch (1999a) . These results are likely to be applicable to O. ramosa . The optimum temperatures for conditioning and germination of O. ramosa are between 18°C and 23°C. On contact with the host root, the haustorium is formed, and intrusive cells penetrate through the cortex to the vascular bundle to establish a connection with the host xylem. The parasite develops

1999a) . These results are likely to be applicable to O. ramosa . The optimum temperatures for conditioning and germination of O. ramosa are between 18°C and 23°C. On contact with the host root, the haustorium is formed, and intrusive cells penetrate through the cortex to the vascular bundle to establish a connection with the host xylem. The parasite develops into a tubercle on root surface, developing to a diameter of 5-20 mm. Secondary roots may develop on the tubercle and make separate contacts with the host root system. After several weeks, the tubercle develops a flowering shoot which emerges above the soil. Díaz et al. (2006) describe six phenological stages: (a) nodule; (b) nodule with initial crown roots; (c) shoot bud already visible; (d) shoot bud and crown root developed; (e) shoot development; and (f) shoot emerged from the soil surface. In Chile, the aerial stage was reached after 550-degree days, and full maturation after 1180-degree days or 132 days after planting. Research suggests that benzoquinones play a role in the induction of haustorium in Orobanche spp. ( Fernández-Aparicio et al., 2021 ). In addition, cytokinins exudated from the host roots play a major role in haustorium formation and aggressiveness of O. ramosa ( Goyet et al., 2017 ). Orobanche spp. depend totally on their hosts for nutrition and draw most of their water from the host root. The effects on the host are generally proportional to the biomass of the parasite, such as the mass of the parasite is reflected in the mass lost by the host crop (e.g. Barker et al., 1996 , working with O. aegyptiaca ). Arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as a model plant system to

The effects on the host are generally proportional to the biomass of the parasite, such as the mass of the parasite is reflected in the mass lost by the host crop (e.g. Barker et al., 1996 , working with O. aegyptiaca ). Arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as a model plant system to study host-pathogen interactions ( Goldwasser et al., 2000 ). For a recent review on the biology of O. ramosa , see Joel et al. (2007) . Associations Soil microbiota influences the interaction between O. ramosa and its host, for example Brassica napus , by altering direct and indirect recognition signals ( Martinez et al., 2022 ). Environmental requirements Research on soil and bioclimatic factors that influence the interaction between host plants and O. ramosa has shown that the level of O. ramosa infestation correlates negatively with the pH and total humidity index, and correlates positively with the organic matter content ( Lyra et al., 2016 ). The same study found that soil and climatic variables together explained 63% of infestation variance. The effects of temperature, oxygen concentration and water potential of the medium on O. ramosa seed germination have been investigated by Gibot-Leclerc et al. (2004) . Laboratory experiments have revealed that seeds of O. ramosa can tolerate temperatures of up to 50°C for 35 days while the air remains dry. When wet, seeds are readily killed at 40°C within a short time ( Drennan and Mohamed-Ahmed, 1992 ). Salinity is another significant factor; salt-treated A. thaliana seedlings have been found to be more sensitive to O. ramosa attachment compared with untreated plants, indicating a positive correlation between salt sensitivity and the ability of O. ramosa to infect A. thaliana plants ( Demirbas et al., 2013 ).

The life cycle of O. ramosa has been compared on two different soils showing that the whole cycle lasts considerably longer (60-65 days) on black gley soil than on red ferralitic soil (40-50 days) ( Gonzalez and Rodriguez, 1981 ).
 Sintomas: Orobanche ramosa does not cause distinctive symptoms but may cause some wilting, yellowing, necrosis of the foliage and a general weakening of the plant, with reduced fruit production.

The corolla, 10-20 mm long, is hairy, tubular, inflated at the base, with two approximately equal lips, the lower is trilobed. The corolla is whitish below and cream, blue or violet distally (occasionally all white). Filaments are inserted in the corolla tube, 3-6 mm above the base. Stigmas obscurely lobed, whitish. An ovoid-spheroid capsule develops up to 6-10 mm long, the valves free at the apex when ripe, and may contain several hundred seeds, each about 0.2 x 0.4 mm. A single plant carries ten to several hundred flowers and can produce up to a quarter million seeds.O. ramosaseeds have varying shapes and the seed coat has a fibrillar periclinal cell wall (Watts et al., 2024). This description is fromChater and Webb (1972)andWorld Flora Online (2024).O. ramosais also described with some detail inHolm et al. (1997).

 Reproduccion: Genetics The chromosome number of O. ramosa is 2n=24. In addition to the genetic variability, evident from the range of varieties and sub-species noted above, there is variation between morphologically similar populations associated with particular hosts. Brault et al. (2007) demonstrated a significant variation in the virulence of parasites collected from rapeseed, tobacco and hemp in France. This variation suggests a development of host-related pathotypes, which was confirmed by differences in RAPD analysis. Musselman and Parker (1982) showed similar variation in the host preference of forms attacking Solanaceae and lettuce. Microsatellite markers in O. ramosa developed by Corre et al. (2014) are potentially useful for population genetics studies and for elucidating host-associated genetic divergence in the species. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers have also been used to determine the taxonomic relationships among Orobanche species and have demonstrated the close relationship between O. ramosa and O. mutelii ( Sharawy and Karakish, 2015 ). Reproductive Biology When the flowers of O. ramosa open, the mature anthers are already in contact with the stigma, and self-pollination is apparently the norm ( Musselman et al., 1982 ). Seeds are produced in very large numbers, many hundreds per capsule, and may remain viable in the soil for many years, possibly for 10 years or more, and certainly for 5 years in many situations. A detailed study of the reproductive biology of O. ramosa subsp. mutelii [ Orobanche mutelli ] was conducted by Prider (2015) in South Australia. They found that the key characters contributing to the success of the plant include self-pollination, rapid maturation of the reproductive stages and high seed output.

 the reproductive biology of O. ramosa subsp. mutelii [ Orobanche mutelli ] was conducted by Prider (2015) in South Australia. They found that the key characters contributing to the success of the plant include self-pollination, rapid maturation of the reproductive stages and high seed output. The study emphasizes the importance of vigilance so that plants can be controlled before they set seed. Phenology and Physiology Orobanche ramosa is an obligate parasite, needing to connect to a host root within a few days of germination. The seed is minute (approximately 0.2 x 0.4 mm), from which only the radicle emerges, and this can grow only a few millimetres long. A chemical stimulus is needed to trigger Orobanche germination, normally coming from host roots, therefore, Orobanche normally germinates only when a host root is nearby. A moist environment is required for several days, together with suitable temperatures, before the mature seed is responsive to germination stimulants. This preparatory period is known as conditioning or preconditioning. Conditioned seeds remain responsive to germination stimulants for a limited period, after which secondary dormancy may be induced. Their ability to respond to germination stimuli fades gradually when the seeds dry, and they remain dormant until re-conditioned ( Timko et al., 1989 ; Joel et al., 1995a ). The effects of different temperature and moisture regimes on the germination and viability of O. aegyptiaca have been reported by Kebreab and Murdoch (1999a) . These results are likely to be applicable to O. ramosa . The optimum temperatures for conditioning and germination of O. ramosa are between 18°C and 23°C. On contact with the host root, the haustorium is formed, and intrusive cells penetrate through the cortex to the vascular bundle to establish a connection with the host xylem. The parasite develops

On contact with the host root, the haustorium is formed, and intrusive cells penetrate through the cortex to the vascular bundle to establish a connection with the host xylem. The parasite develops into a tubercle on root surface, developing to a diameter of 5-20 mm. Secondary roots may develop on the tubercle and make separate contacts with the host root system. After several weeks, the tubercle develops a flowering shoot which emerges above the soil. Díaz et al. (2006) describe six phenological stages: (a) nodule; (b) nodule with initial crown roots; (c) shoot bud already visible; (d) shoot bud and crown root developed; (e) shoot development; and (f) shoot emerged from the soil surface. In Chile, the aerial stage was reached after 550-degree days, and full maturation after 1180-degree days or 132 days after planting. Research suggests that benzoquinones play a role in the induction of haustorium in Orobanche spp. ( Fernández-Aparicio et al., 2021 ). In addition, cytokinins exudated from the host roots play a major role in haustorium formation and aggressiveness of O. ramosa ( Goyet et al., 2017 ). Orobanche spp. depend totally on their hosts for nutrition and draw most of their water from the host root. The effects on the host are generally proportional to the biomass of the parasite, such as the mass of the parasite is reflected in the mass lost by the host crop (e.g. Barker et al., 1996 , working with O. aegyptiaca ). Arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as a model plant system to

Arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as a model plant system to study host-pathogen interactions ( Goldwasser et al., 2000 ). For a recent review on the biology of O. ramosa , see Joel et al. (2007) . Associations Soil microbiota influences the interaction between O. ramosa and its host, for example Brassica napus , by altering direct and indirect recognition signals ( Martinez et al., 2022 ). Environmental requirements Research on soil and bioclimatic factors that influence the interaction between host plants and O. ramosa has shown that the level of O. ramosa infestation correlates negatively with the pH and total humidity index, and correlates positively with the organic matter content ( Lyra et al., 2016 ). The same study found that soil and climatic variables together explained 63% of infestation variance. The effects of temperature, oxygen concentration and water potential of the medium on O. ramosa seed germination have been investigated by Gibot-Leclerc et al. (2004) . Laboratory experiments have revealed that seeds of O. ramosa can tolerate temperatures of up to 50°C for 35 days while the air remains dry. When wet, seeds are readily killed at 40°C within a short time ( Drennan and Mohamed-Ahmed, 1992 ). Salinity is another significant factor; salt-treated A. thaliana seedlings have been found to be more sensitive to O. ramosa attachment compared with untreated plants, indicating a positive correlation between salt sensitivity and the ability of O. ramosa to infect A. thaliana plants ( Demirbas et al., 2013 ).

The life cycle of O. ramosa has been compared on two different soils showing that the whole cycle lasts considerably longer (60-65 days) on black gley soil than on red ferralitic soil (40-50 days) ( Gonzalez and Rodriguez, 1981 ).
 Sintomas: Orobanche ramosa does not cause distinctive symptoms but may cause some wilting, yellowing, necrosis of the foliage and a general weakening of the plant, with reduced fruit production.
