1. Disease Information General Disease and Pathogen Information: As of late March 
2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 per GenoFlu, was detected in milk and 
other bovine-origin samples associated with mild illness in dairy cattle. The virus has 
been characterized as highly pathogenic per cleavage site analysis and bioassay testing 
(IVPI per WOAH), and currently the B3.13 genotype is not significantly different from 
other genotypes affecting wild birds and poultry. Pathways of disease transmission are 
still being investigated and lateral transmission has been documented. The estimated 
herd level incubation period in dairy cattle appears variable, from approximately 12 to 21 
days. The incubation period for cattle is likely multifactorial and should consider route of 
exposure, viral dose, production phase of the animal, and likely other factors that are still 
unknown at this time. The virus is found in high concentrations in milk secretions of 
lactating cattle  
  
1.1 Clinical Signs: Infections of cattle may be asymptomatic (subclinical) or symptomatic 
(clinical) and virus is predominantly found in milk and mammary tissue regardless of 
symptoms. Clinical signs may include a decrease in feed consumption with a 
simultaneous decrease in rumination and rumen motility; respiratory signs including 
clear nasal discharge; and subsequent acute drop in milk production. Additional clinical 
signs may include abnormal tacky or loose feces, lethargy, dehydration, and fever.

 and mammary tissue regardless of 
symptoms. Clinical signs may include a decrease in feed consumption with a 
simultaneous decrease in rumination and rumen motility; respiratory signs including 
clear nasal discharge; and subsequent acute drop in milk production. Additional clinical 
signs may include abnormal tacky or loose feces, lethargy, dehydration, and fever. 
Severely affected cattle may have thicker, concentrated, colostrum-like milk or produce 
no milk at all. Other non-avian species may present as primary respiratory cases or 
with neurologic symptoms. 
 
2. Laboratory Criteria  
For Bovidae species, milk and mammary tissue are the preferred samples from lactating 
animals and deep nasal swabs for non-lactating Bovidae. Respiratory swabs/tissues are 
typical for many mammalian species; brain is recommended for neurologic cases. Other 
sample types include those listed in APHIS surveillance plan guidance. Serology for 
serum and milk may be utilized for some species.  
 
2.1 Agent Isolation and Identification: Detect presence of influenza A virus by: 
 
2.1.1 Preferred samples from live or dead animals are tested by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) assays for influenza A and those targeting H5 2.3.4.4b (subtype 
assays should only be used in conjunction with influenza A detection assays). 
Virus isolation may also be performed.

influenza A antigen test kit (ACIA, approved by USDA); OR 
3.1.3 Detection of influenza A by PCR at a private laboratory where the host species 
virus lineage has been ruled out (e.g. swine lineage H1/H3, equine/canine H3).  
 
3.2 Presumptive Positive Case:  
 
3.2.1 Detection of influenza A by PCR at a NAHLN (National Animal Health 
Laboratory Network) Laboratory where the host species virus lineage has been 
ruled out (e.g. swine lineage H1/H3, equine/canine H3) with or without the 
presence of compatible illness.

3.3 Confirmed Positive Case:  
3.3.1 Identification of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4b at NVSL by molecular assay OR

3.3.1.1 An animal may be excluded as a confirmed case after review of all 
available case information due to:  
•  An alternative diagnosis can explain the illness or detection fully. 2  
• Test result(s) are poorly or not repeatable and resampling is either not 
possible or testing from resampling is negative. 
 
 
 
For guidance on movement regulations please refer to APHIS Requirements and 
Recommendations for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 Virus in Livestock  and 
Herd Status program standards. 
 
1 Confirmation of a dairy herd in a new state by NVSL requires identification of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4b by PCR for 
at least two different gene targets with determination of genotype. 
2 Factors that may be considered when assigning alternate diagnoses include the strength of the epidemiologic 
evidence for HPAI H5 exposure, absence of clinical signs where the potential for environmental contamination 
cannot be ruled out, and the compatibility of the clinical presentation and course of illness for the alternative 
diagnosis.
