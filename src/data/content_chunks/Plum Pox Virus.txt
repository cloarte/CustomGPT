 
 
Case study: Plum Pox Virus 
The National Plant Diagnostic Network 
 
Plum pox virus (PPV) is a pathogen of stone fruits including plum, peach and apricot 
and is a quarantine pathogen.  It was first identified in the United States in 1999 in an 
orchard in Adams County, Pennsylvania and in two locations in Canada in 2000.  The 
USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in cooperation with state 
departments of agriculture initiated yearly surveys for the disease in 2000.   Survey 
programs with no positive identifications usually end after a 5-year period. Because PPV 
can cause significant damage and eventual death to stone fruits, it was decided to 
continue surveying for another year in 2006. The virus was found in two states that year.  
At that time, the pathogen was listed as a select agent. 
This virus was detected in two locations in New York on July 10, 2006.  Three weeks 
later, late in the stone fruit season, it was detected in one location in Michigan.   The 
National Plant Diagnostic Network was able to provide surge capacity to these surveys 
when sample loads increased dramatically in response to these detections in an effort to 
determine the extent of the area affected.  In New York, the Northeast Regional Center 
Laboratory (NEPDN) of the NPDN has conducted the diagnostics for the PPV surveys 
since 2004.  The positive detection in 2006 resulted in a 5-fold increase in samples from 
14,000 samples in previous years to 67,385 samples in 2006.   
In Michigan during 2007, the Michigan Department of Agriculture Laboratory, which 
previously processed all PPV survey samples, requested surge assistance from the

since 2004.  The positive detection in 2006 resulted in a 5-fold increase in samples from

In Michigan during 2007, the Michigan Department of Agriculture Laboratory, which 
previously processed all PPV survey samples, requested surge assistance from the 
Michigan State University North Central Plant Diagnostic Network Regional Center 
Laboratory (NCPDN).  The NCPDN laboratory at MSU was able to process 33,344 
Michigan samples during the 10-week surge.  
The success of this surge support in Michigan and New York was due to the ability of 
the NPDN laboratories to quickly identify and train additional workers who could assist 
in the data entry, and PCR and ELISA diagnostic procedures approved by APHIS.  
Additionally, the NPDN had the needed equipment, supplies, protocols, permits and 
infrastructure in place before the first detections. In Michigan, none of the samples tested 
were positive for PPV, allowing the Michigan Department of Agriculture and APHIS to 
focus their resources on higher priority presumptive positive samples from other states.  
However, in New York additional positives have been found and researchers are 
conducting additional testing.  Michigan has not detected PPV again since 2006.
