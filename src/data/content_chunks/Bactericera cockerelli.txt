 Invasion: Bactericera cockerelliis a polyvoltine species, having more than one generation per year (Burckhardt and Lauterer, 1997). The adults are small, measuring about 2.5-2.75 mm long. The adults generally resemble tiny cicadas, largely because they hold their wings angled and roof-like over their body.B. cockerelliadults possess two pairs of clear wings; the front wings bear conspicuous veins and are considerably larger than the hind wings. The antennae are moderately long, extending almost half the length of the body. The overall body colour ranges from pale green at emergence to dark green or brown within 2-3 days, and eventually becomes grey or black thereafter. Prominent white or yellow lines are found on the head and thorax, and dorsal whitish bands are located on the first and terminal abdominal segments. These white markings are spot characteristics of the psyllid, particularly the broad, transverse white band on the first abdominal segment and the inverted ‘V’-shaped white mark on the last abdominal segment (Pletsch, 1947;Wallis, 1955), along with the raised white line around the circumference of the head. Adults are active in contrast to the largely sedentary nymphal stages. The adults readily jump when disturbed. Their flying capability, especially over long distances, has been controversial for a long time. Research has shown active flying over long distances or seasonal migration is very likely not occurring (Nelson et al., 2014); overwintering populations have been found on natural vegetation (Jensen et al., 2012;Horton et al., 2015) and molecular diagnostics identified genetic differences between populations (Liu et al., 2006;Swisher et al., 2012; 2014

 Reproduccion: Outbreaks of B. cockerelli in Baja California and coastal California led to the discovery that potato psyllid in those regions is genetically distinct from psyllids in southern Texas and eastern Mexico, which suggests there exists two different potato psyllid biotypes, referred to elsewhere as ‘western’ and ‘central’ biotypes ( Liu et al., 2006 ; Jackson et al., 2009 ). The western biotype differs from southern Texas populations in several life history traits ( Liu and Trumble, 2007 ). In New Zealand ( Thompson et al., 2015 ), Western Australia ( https://news.perth.media/2018/02/02/research-indicates-promising-tpp-control-growers/ ) and Norfolk Island ( Thomas et al., 2017 ), the western biotype is present. Following the 2011 reports of zebra chip in Idaho, Oregon and Washington ( Crosslin et al., 2012a , b; Munyaneza, 2012 ), a genetic study by Swisher et al. (2012) , using high resolution melting analysis of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I-like gene of B. cockerelli , led to the identification of a third biotype (referred to as ‘northwestern haplotype

 ( Crosslin et al., 2012a , b; Munyaneza, 2012 ), a genetic study by Swisher et al. (2012) , using high resolution melting analysis of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I-like gene of B. cockerelli , led to the identification of a third biotype (referred to as ‘northwestern haplotype’), so far known only from the Northwest Pacific. This northwestern potato psyllid biotype is genetically different from the central and western biotypes ( Swisher et al., 2012 ). In addition, a recent study by Swisher et al. (2014) identified a fourth biotype of the psyllid, which appears to be distributed in New Mexico and parts of Colorado and referred to as a ‘southwestern haplotype’. Furthermore, potato psyllids in Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua were identified as the central haplotype ( Swisher et al., 2013a ). In an effort to identify and develop a sex pheromone and other attractants that can be used to develop improved integrated pest management programmes for B. cockerelli , its reproductive biology and the role of chemical signals in sex attraction were studied by Guédot et al. (2010; 2012). It was determined for the first time that the potato psyllid possesses a female-produced pheromone that attracts males ( Guédot et al., 2010 ). Guédot et al. (2012) also showed that adult potato psyllids reach reproductive maturity within 48 h post-eclosion, with females being mature on the day of eclosion and males at 1 day post-eclosion. In addition, oviposition generally began 2 days after mating but was delayed when females mated within 2 days post-eclosion. Seven-day fecundity was lower in ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’

 post-eclosion, with females being mature on the day of eclosion and males at 1 day post-eclosion. In addition, oviposition generally began 2 days after mating but was delayed when females mated within 2 days post-eclosion. Seven-day fecundity was lower in ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’ infected B. cockerelli than in ‘ Ca . L. solanacearum’ free psyllids ( Nachappa et al., 2012 ). Optimum psyllid development occurs at approximately 27°C, whereas oviposition, hatching and survival are reduced at 32°C and cease at 35°C ( List, 1939 ; Pletsch, 1947 ; Wallis, 1955 ; Abdullah, 2008 ; Yang and Liu, 2009 ; Yang et al., 2010a ). Total development time was not affected by infection with ‘ Ca . L. solanacearum’ ( Nachappa et al., 2012 ), and may be affected by host plant ( Yang and Liu, 2009 ). A single generation may be completed in 3 to 5 weeks, depending on temperature. The number of generations varies considerably among the geographic regions, usually ranging from three to seven. However, once psyllids colonize an area, prolonged oviposition causes the generations to overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between generations ( Pletsch, 1947 ; Wallis, 1955 ; Munyaneza et al., 2009a ). Both adults and nymphs are very cold tolerant, with nymphs surviving temporary exposure to temperatures of -15°C and 50% of adults surviving exposure to -10°C for over 24 h ( Henne et al., 2010a ; Whipple et al., 2012 ). Longevity of B. cockerelli is on average 16-18 days under field conditions ( Yang et al., 2013 ). Longevity is affected by their

Longevity of B. cockerelli is on average 16-18 days under field conditions ( Yang et al., 2013 ). Longevity is affected by their ‘ Ca . L. solanacearum’ status ( Nachappa et al., 2012 ). ‘ Candidatus Carsonella ruddii’, the obligate and primary endosymbiont of psyllids, has been confirmed in B. cockerelli ( Nachappa et al., 2011 ; Hail et al., 2012 ). Besides ‘ Ca. L. solanacearum’, several other secondary endosymbionts associated with the potato psyllid have recently been reported, including the bacteria Wolbachia , Acinetobacter , Methylibium , Rhizobium , Gordonia , Mycobacterium and Xanthomonas ( Nachappa et al., 2011 ; Hail et al., 2012 ; Arp et al., 2014 ). Little information is available on the interactions and symbiont relationship between these microorganisms and the potato psyllid. Weather is an important element governing the biology of B. cockerelli and its damage potential; B. cockerelli seems to be adapted for warm, but not hot, temperatures. Cool weather, or at least the absence of elevated temperatures, has been associated with outbreaks of this insect ( Pletsch, 1947 ; Wallis, 1955 ; Capinera, 2001 ; Cranshaw, 2001 ).

More recently, this psyllid has been found to be associated with the bacterium ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’ ( Hansen et al., 2008 ; Liefting et al., 2009b ; Secor et al., 2009 ), haplotype A and B specifically (see the datasheet on ‘ Ca. L. solanacearum’ for details).
 Organos afectados: Capsicum (peppers), Solanaceae, Main, Mauchline and Stannard (2013)
 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics Outbreaks of B. cockerelli in Baja California and coastal California led to the discovery that potato psyllid in those regions is genetically distinct from psyllids in southern Texas and eastern Mexico, which suggests there exists two different potato psyllid biotypes, referred to elsewhere as ‘western’ and ‘central’ biotypes ( Liu et al., 2006 ; Jackson et al., 2009 ). The western biotype differs from southern Texas populations in several life history traits ( Liu and Trumble, 2007 ). In New Zealand ( Thompson et al., 2015 ), Western Australia ( https://news.perth.media/2018/02/02/research-indicates-promising-tpp-control-growers/ ) and Norfolk Island ( Thomas et al., 2017 ), the western biotype is present. Following the 2011 reports of zebra chip in Idaho, Oregon and Washington ( Crosslin et al., 2012a , b; Munyaneza, 2012

Following the 2011 reports of zebra chip in Idaho, Oregon and Washington ( Crosslin et al., 2012a , b; Munyaneza, 2012 ), a genetic study by Swisher et al. (2012) , using high resolution melting analysis of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I-like gene of B. cockerelli , led to the identification of a third biotype (referred to as ‘northwestern haplotype’), so far known only from the Northwest Pacific. This northwestern potato psyllid biotype is genetically different from the central and western biotypes ( Swisher et al., 2012 ). In addition, a recent study by Swisher et al. (2014) identified a fourth biotype of the psyllid, which appears to be distributed in New Mexico and parts of Colorado and referred to as a ‘southwestern haplotype’. Furthermore, potato psyllids in Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua were identified as the central haplotype ( Swisher et al., 2013a ). Reproductive Biology In an effort to identify and develop a sex pheromone and other attractants that can be used to develop improved integrated pest management programmes for B. cockerelli , its reproductive biology and the role of chemical signals in sex attraction were studied by Guédot et al. (2010; 2012). It was determined for the first time that the potato psyllid possesses a female-produced pheromone that attracts males ( Guédot et al., 2010 ). Guédot et al. (2012) also showed that adult potato psyllids reach reproductive maturity within 48 h post-eclosion, with females being mature on the day of

dot et al. (2010; 2012). It was determined for the first time that the potato psyllid possesses a female-produced pheromone that attracts males ( Guédot et al., 2010 ). Guédot et al. (2012) also showed that adult potato psyllids reach reproductive maturity within 48 h post-eclosion, with females being mature on the day of eclosion and males at 1 day post-eclosion. In addition, oviposition generally began 2 days after mating but was delayed when females mated within 2 days post-eclosion. Seven-day fecundity was lower in ‘ Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’ infected B. cockerelli than in ‘ Ca . L. solanacearum’ free psyllids ( Nachappa et al., 2012 ). Optimum psyllid development occurs at approximately 27°C, whereas oviposition, hatching and survival are reduced at 32°C and cease at 35°C ( List, 1939 ; Pletsch, 1947 ; Wallis, 1955 ; Abdullah, 2008 ; Yang and Liu, 2009 ; Yang et al., 2010a ). Total development time was not affected by infection with ‘ Ca . L. solanacearum’ ( Nachappa et al., 2012 ), and may be affected by host plant ( Yang and Liu, 2009 ). A single generation may be completed in 3 to 5 weeks, depending on temperature. The number of generations varies considerably among the geographic regions, usually ranging from three to seven. However, once psyllids colonize an area, prolonged oviposition causes the generations to overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between generations ( Pletsch, 1947 ; Wallis, 1955 ; Munyaneza et al., 2009a ). Both adults and nymphs are very cold tolerant, with nymphs surviving temporary exposure to temperatures of -15

However, once psyllids colonize an area, prolonged oviposition causes the generations to overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between generations ( Pletsch, 1947 ; Wallis, 1955 ; Munyaneza et al., 2009a ). Both adults and nymphs are very cold tolerant, with nymphs surviving temporary exposure to temperatures of -15°C and 50% of adults surviving exposure to -10°C for over 24 h ( Henne et al., 2010a ; Whipple et al., 2012 ). Physiology and Phenology Longevity Longevity of B. cockerelli is on average 16-18 days under field conditions ( Yang et al., 2013 ). Longevity is affected by their ‘ Ca . L. solanacearum’ status ( Nachappa et al., 2012 ). Associations ‘ Candidatus Carsonella ruddii’, the obligate and primary endosymbiont of psyllids, has been confirmed in B. cockerelli ( Nachappa et al., 2011 ; Hail et al., 2012 ). Besides ‘ Ca. L. solanacearum’, several other secondary endosymbionts associated with the potato psyllid have recently been reported, including the bacteria Wolbachia , Acinetobacter , Methylibium , Rhizobium , Gordonia , Mycobacterium and Xanthomonas ( Nachappa et al., 2011 ; Hail et al., 2012 ; Arp et al., 2014 ). Little information is available on the interactions and symbiont relationship between these microorganisms and the potato psyllid.
