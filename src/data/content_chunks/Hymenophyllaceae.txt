, subtropical, and temperate regions of both the Old and New Worlds; seven genera and 50 species (six endemic) in China.Traditionally, only two genera-Hymenophyllumwith bivalved involucres andTrichomanesLinnaeus with tubular involucres-have been recognized in this family. This scheme was expanded by Morton (Contr. U.S. Natl. Herb. 29: 139-202. 1968) who hierarchically placed many subgenera, sections, and subsections under two larger genera,HymenophyllumandTrichomanes, and recognized four monotypic genera,CardiomanesMorton,SerpyllopsisMorton,HymenoglossumMorton, andRosenstockiaMorton, all of which have specialized fronds. Conversely, Copeland (Gen. Fil. 31-44. 1947) split the family into 34 genera, basing his work on herbarium specimens as well as his field observations of Asian material. Taking into account these past studies plus recent investigations including molecular data, Ebihara et al. (Blumea 51: 221-280. 2006) proposed a modern scheme of classification on which the system of this treatise is based.Ching Ren-chang, Fu Shu-hsia, Wang Chu-hao & Shing Gung-hsia. 1959.
