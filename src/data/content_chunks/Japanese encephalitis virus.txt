• There was a significant change in the
di
stribution of JEV last year in Australia, with
a geographic expansion from the northern tip
of the country to four southern states.
• JEV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to
F
laviviridae, the same family as West Nile
v
irus, Yellow fever, Murray Valley encephalitis
virus, and Saint Louis encephalitis.  There is
one serotype and five genotypes.12,13
• G
lobally, JEV has been detected in 30
species of mosquitoes belonging to the
gener
a Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres,
Coquillettidia, Culex, and Mansonia. 13, 14
• T
he primary mosquito JEV vectors are Culex
tritaeniorhynchus (in Asia) and Culex
annulirostris (in Australia). 14
• C
ulex pipiens, Culex quinquefasciatus, and
A
edes japonicus, native U.S. mosquito
s
pecies, may be important vectors if JEV
w
ere introduced into the United States.6,14, 18
• JEV is a zoonotic vector-borne disease that
can affect multiple mammalian and bird
s
pecies including pigs, horses, donkeys,
cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, egrets,
her
ons as well as reptiles, amphibians, and
hum
ans.5
• During the 2021-2022 season, pigs on more
than 79 swine farms across four Australian
s
tates (South Australia, Victoria, New South
Wales, and Queensland) were impacted by

ans.5
• During the 2021-2022 season, pigs on more
than 79 swine farms across four Australian
s
tates (South Australia, Victoria, New South
Wales, and Queensland) were impacted by
JEV; over 40 JEV human infections led to
s
even deaths. 7, 9, 20, 22, 27
• J
EV was detected for the first time
during the 2022-2023 season in New
South Wales in November 2022.11
• J
EV is found throughout Asia,
Australia, and Western Pacific Islands;
however, Australia observed a
geographic spread of JEV last year.5,12
    Concerns for US Animal Health 
• J
EV would have a major impact to
livestock health, trade, and production
as well as public health.10
• P
otential pathways into the United
States are through the introduction of
i
nfected mosquitoes and migratory
waterbirds and globalized livestock
trade.4,10, 17
•
Competent mosquito vectors and hosts
are present in the United States. It has
been demonstrated that North
American domestic pigs are susceptible
t
o JEV infections.16, 17
• J
EV primarily affects pigs and horses
with between 50 to 70% reproductive
losses and low mortality in adult pigs,
piglets experiencing up to 100%
mortality: and encephalitis in horses with
a 0.3% to 30% mortality rate.5, 9, 10, 12, 14
•
Animals infected with JEV, other than
pigs and birds, may exhibit clinical
signs, but are considered dead-end

piglets experiencing up to 100%
mortality: and encephalitis in horses with
a 0.3% to 30% mortality rate.5, 9, 10, 12, 14
•
Animals infected with JEV, other than
pigs and birds, may exhibit clinical
signs, but are considered dead-end
hosts where they do not have a high
enough viremia for mosquitoes to pick
up the virus and transmit to another
host.11
• J
EV control options include treating
inf
ected animals, chemical control of
vector species, and landscape
modifications such as screening barns
to reduce vector contact. 5,18
Emerging Risk Notice   
May 2023  
Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) 
 
 
 
 
Epidemiology 
 
Distribution 
 
• JEV is distributed throughout Indonesia, 
Thailand, Cambodia, Korea, Japan, India, 
Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, China, Taiwan, 
Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, 
Bangladesh, Pakistan, and northern 
Australia. It has never been detected in the 
United States.3, 12 
 
Hosts  
Wildlife Hosts 
 
• Ardeid birds (e.g., herons, egrets; natural 
reservoirs), can maintain high JEV viremia 
levels that infect mosquitoes in both rural and 
urban areas. 1,2, 8,5 
 
• There are at least 90 different bird species 
that may be involved in the transmission of 
JEV.  They have a lifelong immunity to the 
virus after the initial viral infection.6 
 
• JEV has been detected in feral sw

urban areas. 1,2, 8,5 
 
• There are at least 90 different bird species 
that may be involved in the transmission of 
JEV.  They have a lifelong immunity to the 
virus after the initial viral infection.6 
 
• JEV has been detected in feral swine in 
Australia in Victoria Daly, Litchfield, Tiwi 
islands, West Arnhem, Marrakai-Dougalis 
Daly areas. They can maintain high JEV 
viremia levels that can infect mosquitoes 9,10, 21 
 
Domestic Hosts  
Swine 
 
• Domestic pigs (amplifying hosts) can maintain 
high JEV viremia levels that infect mosquitoes in 
both agricultural and metropolitan areas. 1,2, 8,5 
 
• Swine symptoms include fetal abnormalities 
and abortions including mummified and 
stillborn fetuses, weakness with neurological 
signs, boar infertility, fluid retention, and 
congested testicles. 10,14, 18 
 
• Reproductive loss in domestic swine can be 
from 50 to 70% with negligible mortality in 
adult swine.5 
 
 
• High viral titers in swine can last 2 to 4 
days. Clinical symptoms can develop in 
as few as 3 days. Direct transmission via 
nasal shedding of live virus secretions 
between pigs has been demonstrated. 
Infected pigs that survive have a long-
lasting immunity to the virus.6, 14, 15 
 
• Viral transmission from pig to pig via 
genetic materials (e.g., semen) is rare.10

between pigs has been demonstrated. 
Infected pigs that survive have a long-

• Viral transmission from pig to pig via 
genetic materials (e.g., semen) is rare.10 
 
• JEV can be detected in boar semen.18 
 
Equines 
• Horses are dead end hosts not capable of 
transmitting virus to mosquitoes or other 
animals.10 
 
• Incubation period is 4 to 14 days in horses.  
 
• Horse symptoms include fever, jaundice, 
lethargy, anorexia, and neurological signs 
may include incoordination, impaired 
vision, difficulty swallowing.10 
 
• Horses may recover in 2 to 3 days.  In a 
severe JEV infection, horses may display 
high fevers, sweating, wandering, 
aggressive behavior, blindness, and 
muscle tremors. Severe JEV infections 
can result in coma and death. These 
symptoms are indistinguishable from 
West Nile virus (WNV) and other 
encephalitic diseases. 11, 18 
 
• JEV isolations from horses have been 
reported in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
and India.12 
 
• There have been no confirmed cases of 
JEV in horses in Australia as of the 
publication of this notice, but there have 
been cases where the combination of 
clinical signs and test results suggest that 
JEV was possibly the cause of disease.11

JEV was possibly the cause of disease.11 
 
 
•  
 
 
 
 
• A 2003 to 2004 serological study completed in 
Nepal found JEV sero-prevalence in domestic 
pigs (48.11%), in ducks (26.79%), and in 
horses (50%).15 
 
Cattle  
 
• Rare JEV clinical cases have been reported in 
cattle showing neurological signs, fever, 
depression, decreased appetite and, in some 
cases, death.5 
 
Vectors  
• Highly competent mosquito species for JEV 
transmission are Aedes albopictus, Aedes 
vexans, Aedes vigilax, Anopheles tessellatus, 
Armigeres subalbatus Culex annulus, Culex 
annulirostris (main vector in Australia), Culex 
bitaeniorhynchus, Culex fuscocephala, Culex 
gelidus, Culex pipiens, Culex pipiens pallens, 
Culex pseudovishnui, Culex quinquefasciatus, 
Culex sitiens, Culex tarsalis, Culex 
tritaeniorhynchus, and Culex vishnui 14

nigromaculis, Ochlerotatus japonicus, Aedes 
albopictus, Aedes japonicus, Aedes vexans, 
Anopheles spp. and Mansonia uniformis.6, 18 
 
• Vertical transmission occurs between mosquitoes 
and their offspring and may be a mechanism that 
allows for JEV survival through the winter 
months.6 
 
• JEV has been isolated from Culicoides species 
in China.5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pathways

months.6 
 
• JEV has been isolated from Culicoides species 
in China.5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pathways  
• Geographic expansion of JEV is likely 
due to human and pig population 
growth, and changes in land use that 
may support habitats that are preferred 
by both bird and mosquito species.2 
 
• Introductory pathways to other regions may 
include bird migration, accidental 
transportation of mosquito vectors, human 
movement, and international travel.2, 9 
 
• JEV infected mosquito vectors are most 
likely to enter the United States via 
aircraft or cargo ships based on a 
qualitative risk assessment completed in 
2018; followed by the authors’ 2019 
quantitative assessment, which 
determined the higher risk for infected 
mosquitoes to enter the United States is 
via aircraft. 13,19 
 
Diagnostic Testing  
• RT-PCR particularly on central nervous 
system tissue or fetal tissues. JEV is 
rarely isolated or detected by PCR in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain tissue in 
horses can be used for RT-PCR.23, 24,25 
 
• Swine samples can include fetal tissues, 
fresh brain, tonsil, spleen, blood, or 
serum. Equine can include fresh brain, 
CSF, blood, or serum. Isolation/detection 
of JEV in horses is usually very low so 
serology can be used to detect 
antibodies. Currently, the diagnosis of 
JEV in pigs can be based on virus 
isolation of central nervous system 
tissues; viral RNA detection in

 can include fresh brain, 
CSF, blood, or serum. Isolation/detection 
of JEV in horses is usually very low so 
serology can be used to detect 
antibodies. Currently, the diagnosis of 
JEV in pigs can be based on virus 
isolation of central nervous system 
tissues; viral RNA detection in samples 
such as blood, brain, and CSF; and/or via 
the detection of JEV specific antibodies in 
CSF or serum. In horses, the specimens 
collected for virus isolation or detection 
(nucleic acid or antigen) are portions of 
the corpus striatum, cortex, or thalamus 
of the brain.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood and spinal cord samples can also be 
used. Due to the short viremia associated 
with JEV infection (4-5 days) there is a short 
window for virus detection by PCR in blood 
and serum samples. 5, 26 
 
• Pigs seroconvert prior to onset of 
reproduction signs. High antibody titers in 
these animals in a single serum sample can 
be indicative of JEV infection. Detection of 
specific IgM and IgG in equine cerebrospinal 
fluid or serum may be suggestive of a current 
JEV infection.5 
 
• The collection of oral/nasal secretion samples 
from domestic pigs using cotton ropes may be 
a method to detect JEV positive pigs and 
appropriate for JEV surveillance in a region. 
JEV detection in oronasal secretions has 
potential veterinary diagnostic applications.17

• Samples are to be submitted to the National 
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). The 
NVSL Diagnostic Virology Laboratory (DVL) in 
Ames, IA maintains diagnostics for other 
flaviviruses, including West Nile Virus. The 
NVSL Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic 
Laboratory (FADDL) at Plum Island, NY is 
evaluating front-line molecular and 
confirmatory diagnostic methods. 
 
Treatment 
• There are no specific treatments for infected 
animals beyond treatment for symptoms.5, 18 
 
• Live and inactivated vaccines are available for 
swine and inactivated vaccine for horses; 
however, no licensed vaccine is available in 
the United States. 2,5 
 
Prevention 
• Vaccination of equine and swine in endemic 
areas may be effective. 17, 18 
 
• P yrethroids, organophosphates, and 
carbamates can be used for chemical control 
of adult mosquitoes.5,18  
 
 
• Landscape modifications may also reduce 
exposure to mosquito bites such as stabling 
animals in screened barns, insecticide 
treated mosquito nets, elimination of waterin 
outside water-holding containers, and 
installation of fans in barns. 5,18

•
Animals infected with JEV, other than
pigs and birds, may exhibit clinical
signs, but are considered dead-end
hosts where they do not have a high
enough viremia for mosquitoes to pick
up the virus and transmit to another
host.11
• J
EV control options include treating
inf
ected animals, chemical control of
vector species, and landscape
modifications such as screening barns
to reduce vector contact. 5,18
Emerging Risk Notice   
May 2023  
Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) 
 
 
 
 
Epidemiology 
 
Distribution 
 
• JEV is distributed throughout Indonesia, 
Thailand, Cambodia, Korea, Japan, India, 
Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, China, Taiwan, 
Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, 
Bangladesh, Pakistan, and northern 
Australia. It has never been detected in the 
United States.3, 12 
 
Hosts  
Wildlife Hosts 
 
• Ardeid birds (e.g., herons, egrets; natural 
reservoirs), can maintain high JEV viremia 
levels that infect mosquitoes in both rural and 
urban areas. 1,2, 8,5 
 
• There are at least 90 different bird species 
that may be involved in the transmission of 
JEV.  They have a lifelong immunity to the 
virus after the initial viral infection.6 
 
• JEV has been detected in feral sw

levels that infect mosquitoes in both rural and 
urban areas. 1,2, 8,5 
 
• There are at least 90 different bird species 
that may be involved in the transmission of 
JEV.  They have a lifelong immunity to the 
virus after the initial viral infection.6 
 
• JEV has been detected in feral swine in 
Australia in Victoria Daly, Litchfield, Tiwi 
islands, West Arnhem, Marrakai-Dougalis 
Daly areas. They can maintain high JEV 
viremia levels that can infect mosquitoes 9,10, 21 
 
Domestic Hosts  
Swine 
 
• Domestic pigs (amplifying hosts) can maintain 
high JEV viremia levels that infect mosquitoes in 
both agricultural and metropolitan areas. 1,2, 8,5 
 
• Swine symptoms include fetal abnormalities 
and abortions including mummified and 
stillborn fetuses, weakness with neurological 
signs, boar infertility, fluid retention, and 
congested testicles. 10,14, 18 
 
• Reproductive loss in domestic swine can be 
from 50 to 70% with negligible mortality in 
adult swine.5 
 
 
• High viral titers in swine can last 2 to 4 
days. Clinical symptoms can develop in 
as few as 3 days. Direct transmission via 
nasal shedding of live virus secretions 
between pigs has been demonstrated. 
Infected pigs that survive have a long-
lasting immunity to the virus.6, 14, 15 
 
• Viral transmission from pig to pig via 
genetic materials (e.g., semen) is rare.10 
 
• JEV can

between pigs has been demonstrated. 
Infected pigs that survive have a long-
lasting immunity to the virus.6, 14, 15 
 
• Viral transmission from pig to pig via 
genetic materials (e.g., semen) is rare.10 
 
• JEV can be detected in boar semen.18 
 
Equines 
• Horses are dead end hosts not capable of 
transmitting virus to mosquitoes or other 
animals.10 
 
• Incubation period is 4 to 14 days in horses.  
 
• Horse symptoms include fever, jaundice, 
lethargy, anorexia, and neurological signs 
may include incoordination, impaired 
vision, difficulty swallowing.10 
 
• Horses may recover in 2 to 3 days.  In a 
severe JEV infection, horses may display 
high fevers, sweating, wandering, 
aggressive behavior, blindness, and 
muscle tremors. Severe JEV infections 
can result in coma and death. These 
symptoms are indistinguishable from 
West Nile virus (WNV) and other 
encephalitic diseases. 11, 18 
 
• JEV isolations from horses have been 
reported in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
and India.12 
 
• There have been no confirmed cases of 
JEV in horses in Australia as of the 
publication of this notice, but there have 
been cases where the combination of 
clinical signs and test results suggest that 
JEV was possibly the cause of disease.11

JEV was possibly the cause of disease.11 
 
 
•  
 
 
 
 
• A 2003 to 2004 serological study completed in 
Nepal found JEV sero-prevalence in domestic 
pigs (48.11%), in ducks (26.79%), and in 
horses (50%).15 
 
Cattle  
 
• Rare JEV clinical cases have been reported in 
cattle showing neurological signs, fever, 
depression, decreased appetite and, in some 
cases, death.5 
 
Vectors  
• Highly competent mosquito species for JEV 
transmission are Aedes albopictus, Aedes 
vexans, Aedes vigilax, Anopheles tessellatus, 
Armigeres subalbatus Culex annulus, Culex 
annulirostris (main vector in Australia), Culex 
bitaeniorhynchus, Culex fuscocephala, Culex 
gelidus, Culex pipiens, Culex pipiens pallens, 
Culex pseudovishnui, Culex quinquefasciatus, 
Culex sitiens, Culex tarsalis, Culex 
tritaeniorhynchus, and Culex vishnui 14

JEV competent are Culex tritaeniorhynchus, 
Culex tarsalis, Culex annulirostris, Culex gelidus, 
Culex fuscocephala, Culex vishnui, Culex 
bitaeniorhynchus, Culex pseudovishnui, Culex 
whitmorei, Culex sitiens, Culex pipiens molestus, 
Culex pipiens pipiens, Culex quinquefasciatus, 
Culex salinarius, Culex nigripalpus, Culiseta 
inornata, Ochlerotatus dorasalis, Ochlerotatus 
nigromaculis, Ochlerotatus japonicus, Aedes 
albopictus, Aedes japonicus, Aedes vexans, 
Anopheles spp. and Mansonia uniformis.6, 18 
 
• Vertical transmission occurs between mosquitoes 
and their offspring and may be a mechanism that 
allows for JEV survival through the winter 
months.6 
 
• JEV has been isolated from Culicoides species 
in China.5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pathways

• JEV has been isolated from Culicoides species 
in China.5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pathways  
• Geographic expansion of JEV is likely 
due to human and pig population 
growth, and changes in land use that 
may support habitats that are preferred 
by both bird and mosquito species.2 
 
• Introductory pathways to other regions may 
include bird migration, accidental 
transportation of mosquito vectors, human 
movement, and international travel.2, 9 
 
• JEV infected mosquito vectors are most 
likely to enter the United States via 
aircraft or cargo ships based on a 
qualitative risk assessment completed in 
2018; followed by the authors’ 2019 
quantitative assessment, which 
determined the higher risk for infected 
mosquitoes to enter the United States is 
via aircraft. 13,19 
 
Diagnostic Testing  
• RT-PCR particularly on central nervous 
system tissue or fetal tissues. JEV is 
rarely isolated or detected by PCR in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain tissue in 
horses can be used for RT-PCR.23, 24,25 
 
• Swine samples can include fetal tissues, 
fresh brain, tonsil, spleen, blood, or 
serum. Equine can include fresh brain, 
CSF, blood, or serum. Isolation/detection 
of JEV in horses is usually very low so 
serology can be used to detect 
antibodies. Currently, the diagnosis of 
JEV in pigs can be based on virus 
isolation of central nervous system 
tissues; viral RNA detection in

 can include fresh brain, 
CSF, blood, or serum. Isolation/detection 
of JEV in horses is usually very low so 
serology can be used to detect 
antibodies. Currently, the diagnosis of 
JEV in pigs can be based on virus 
isolation of central nervous system 
tissues; viral RNA detection in samples 
such as blood, brain, and CSF; and/or via 
the detection of JEV specific antibodies in 
CSF or serum. In horses, the specimens 
collected for virus isolation or detection 
(nucleic acid or antigen) are portions of 
the corpus striatum, cortex, or thalamus 
of the brain.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood and spinal cord samples can also be 
used. Due to the short viremia associated 
with JEV infection (4-5 days) there is a short 
window for virus detection by PCR in blood 
and serum samples. 5, 26 
 
• Pigs seroconvert prior to onset of 
reproduction signs. High antibody titers in 
these animals in a single serum sample can 
be indicative of JEV infection. Detection of 
specific IgM and IgG in equine cerebrospinal 
fluid or serum may be suggestive of a current 
JEV infection.5 
 
• The collection of oral/nasal secretion samples 
from domestic pigs using cotton ropes may be 
a method to detect JEV positive pigs and 
appropriate for JEV surveillance in a region. 
JEV detection in oronasal secretions has 
potential veterinary diagnostic applications.17

Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL

JEV detection in oronasal secretions has 
potential veterinary diagnostic applications.17 
 
• Samples are to be submitted to the National 
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). The 
NVSL Diagnostic Virology Laboratory (DVL) in 
Ames, IA maintains diagnostics for other 
flaviviruses, including West Nile Virus. The 
NVSL Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic 
Laboratory (FADDL) at Plum Island, NY is 
evaluating front-line molecular and 
confirmatory diagnostic methods. 
 
Treatment 
• There are no specific treatments for infected 
animals beyond treatment for symptoms.5, 18 
 
• Live and inactivated vaccines are available for 
swine and inactivated vaccine for horses; 
however, no licensed vaccine is available in 
the United States. 2,5 
 
Prevention 
• Vaccination of equine and swine in endemic 
areas may be effective. 17, 18 
 
• P yrethroids, organophosphates, and 
carbamates can be used for chemical control 
of adult mosquitoes.5,18  
 
 
• Landscape modifications may also reduce 
exposure to mosquito bites such as stabling 
animals in screened barns, insecticide 
treated mosquito nets, elimination of waterin 
outside water-holding containers, and 
installation of fans in barns. 5,18
