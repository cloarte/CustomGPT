POLYGONUM AVICULARE L. Family: Polygonaceae Common name: Knot grass Eco& Biol. Perennial. Roots: A tap root, penetrating deep. Stem: upto 100 cm tall, numerous, horny branched, semi-spreading, almost like a bush near maturity, almost spherical, hairless or sometimes short hairs along ribs. Leaves: oblong, linear, lanceolate, pointed on both sides, sometimes short hairs, 5-12 cm long, 7- 25 mm wide. Inflorescence: raceme but looks like loose panicle, seeds - a nut, 4-7 mm long. Propagation by seed. Flowering time: July - August Distribution: Common weed in steppe zone of Mongolia, both in cropped and uncropped areas. Closely related weeds: P. valerii A. Skvorts. and P. alpinum All. Both species are shorter than P. divaricatum Control measures: More competitive at later stages of crop growth. Integration of herbicides, nutrient management and timely irrigation is necessary for long season control in cereals.
