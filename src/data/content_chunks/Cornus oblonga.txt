Inflorescence cymose, panicles or heads; involucral bracts herbaceous, petaloid or absent. Flowers uni or bisexual, regular. Sepals 4-5, united, adnate to the ovary, valvate. Petals 4-5, imbricate or valvate. Stamens same in number as the petals, both inserted around a disc, the stamens alternating with the petals. Ovary (1-)2(-4)-locular, syncarpous, inferior; stigma capitate or 2-4-fid; single ovule in each locule. Fruit a drupe, 2-seeded, free or united in a syncarp. A family of 14 genera and about 90 species, mostly tropical and temperate in distribution, especially in N. America and Asia, rare in Africa and S. America. Represented in Pakistan by 1 genus. Alangium, previously included under Cornaceae, is now placed in a unigeneric family, Alangiaceae, differing from Cornaceae in its 1-seeded fruit, bitegmic seeds, articulated pedicels and subulate bracts.Acknowledgements: We are grateful to the United States Department of Agriculture for financing this research under P.L. 480.
