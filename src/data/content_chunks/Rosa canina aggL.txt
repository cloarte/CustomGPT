Rosa canina agg.L.agg. - Dog Rose  -Rosaceae© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)Dog roses are a group of closely related, similar-looking species and hybrids which are very common in hedgerows, scrub and heath across lowland Northern Ireland. They come into flower in the second half of summer, and the flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, are succeeded by the familiar red, globose, fruits called rose-hips.The commonest species in the group is probablyRosa caninaitself, but many shrubs show evidence of hybridisation withR. caesia, for example in having obvious wine-red colouring to the stems (pureR. caninalacks this). The distinctions that separateR. caesiafromR. caninasensu stricto are summarised on theRosa caesiapage.All names:Rosa canina agg.L.agg.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
