The dorsal oesophageal gland cell extends along the length of the basal oesophageal bulb on the dorsal side and the anterior half of the ventral side. The cell has a system of six ducts formed by deep infolds of the limiting cell membrane. Two ducts extend almost the entire length of the bulb on the dorsal side and four extend half-way on the ventral side (Robertson and Wyss, 1979). Ovaries paired, opposed, reflexed. Z-organ absent.

 Reproduccion: Life cycle All stages occur in soil as migratory root ectoparasites. Reproduction is by meiotic parthenogenesis (n=10) and a single juvenile is capable of raising a population ( Dalmasso and Younes, 1969 ; Dalmasso, 1970). The life cycle has been studied by Radewald and Raski (1962) and Fisher and Raski (1967) . Eggs hatch in 6-8 days and the first moult occurs outside the egg 24-48 h after emergence. Second, third and fourth moults occur at 6-day intervals thereafter; the complete life cycle taking 22-27 days at 24°C in California, USA ( Radewald and Raski, 1962 ). In Israel, however, 7-9 months are required for the completion of the life cycle at 20-23°C and 3-5 months at 28°C on a suitable host such as Vitis vinifera, Urtica uren

In Israel, however, 7-9 months are required for the completion of the life cycle at 20-23°C and 3-5 months at 28°C on a suitable host such as Vitis vinifera, Urtica urens or Citrus aurantium ( Cohn and Mordechai, 1969 ). X. index completes embryogenic development in 10-12 days at 24±2°C. Shortly before hatching, activity is resumed and is accompanied by an evident flexibility of the egg membrane ( Vovlas and Larizza, 1994 ). In Cypriot vineyards X. index completes one generation per year in coastal plains but requires a longer period in the mountainous area, at an altitude of 950 m. Egg laying in the coastal plain occurred from early May to early July and in the mountainous region from late May to the end of July. At both sites, soil temperature at the initiation of egg laying ranged between 16.5 and 19°C, and the maximum numbers of females occurred immediately prior to initiation of egg laying. Its life cycle in Central Spain takes 6-8 weeks to complete. X. index was found in 14% of all vineyards and in 50% of vineyards infected with grapevine fanleaf nepovirus ( Arias and Fresno, 1994 ). In southern Australian vineyards, X. index completed one life cycle a year. Greatest numbers were found at a depth of 15 cm ( Harris, 1978 ). In Sardinian vineyards in Italy, the life cycle from gravid female to adult lasts 12-14 months, and ovulation occurs principally in spring/summer but to a lesser extent also in autumn.

, 1978 ). In Sardinian vineyards in Italy, the life cycle from gravid female to adult lasts 12-14 months, and ovulation occurs principally in spring/summer but to a lesser extent also in autumn. Juvenile forms comprised 50-65% of the population. Total population levels fluctuated at 16-18-month intervals, but there were also annual fluctuations with major increments in autumn and minor ones in spring, usually corresponding to increases in numbers of first-stage juveniles ( Prota and Garau, 1973 ). In experiments performed at 20.5 to 22.5°C in Sardinia, Italy, young females of X. index on Ficus carica produced first-stage juveniles, some already moulting on the 40th day. Third- and fourth-stage juveniles were found 60 and 100 days, respectively, after inoculation; the first young females, still moulting, were present on the 120th day. Another population of X. index from Apulia under similar conditions produced the first new generation females about 63 days after inoculation. This population increased 60-fold in 2.5 months and each female was estimated to lay 25-45 eggs in 9-10 weeks ( Prota et al., 1977 ). Feeding All stages feed ectoparasitically on roots. Juveniles have a large replacement odontostyle in the anterior part of the oesophagus which does not prevent feeding. Feeding is described by Fisher and Raski (1967) . X. index feeds on a column of meristematic cells in root tips and causes gall formation. Extensive terminal root galls due to its feeding were observed on figs in France (Dalmasso, 1970a). Feeding along the roots of grapevine, nettle (Urtica urens) and Bidens tripartita, with no immediate change in the shape of roots, was noticed in Israel ( Cohn, 1970 ). The terminal

 root tips and causes gall formation. Extensive terminal root galls due to its feeding were observed on figs in France (Dalmasso, 1970a). Feeding along the roots of grapevine, nettle (Urtica urens) and Bidens tripartita, with no immediate change in the shape of roots, was noticed in Israel ( Cohn, 1970 ). The terminal root galls have multinucleate and metabolically highly active cells which provide a long-lasting food reservoir for the nematode. The nematode feeds on a cell for a few minutes, then moves into successive deeper layers. The secretion of the dorsal oesophageal gland, which is injected into the cell through the hollow needle-like stylet, quickly degrades the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell which become liquified in about 1 min. Then the basal muscular bulb of the oesophagus is used as a pump for food ingestion which lasts for 2 min ( Wyss, 1987 ). A film on feeding (in German) is available from Institut fur den Wissenschaftlichen Film, Gottingen, Germany (see Wyss, 1977b). At the feeding site, the plant develops galling with multinucleate giant cells which provide a continuous supply of food for the parasite. Multinucleate giant cell formation is a parasitic adaptation which appears to be a precondition for a successful host-parasite relationship. Single females produced many eggs when feeding on galled root tips of fig seedlings, but not when feeding was confined to root tips of tomato seedlings, which responded only with a slight swelling and necrotic cells ( Wyss, 1978 ). The feeding of X. index on grapevine roots begins by the perforation of the cell wall by a twisting action of the odontostyle. Soon after perforation, rhythmic contractions of the basal oesophageal bulb

 when feeding was confined to root tips of tomato seedlings, which responded only with a slight swelling and necrotic cells ( Wyss, 1978 ). The feeding of X. index on grapevine roots begins by the perforation of the cell wall by a twisting action of the odontostyle. Soon after perforation, rhythmic contractions of the basal oesophageal bulb occur at a rate of about 70 contractions/0.5 min. On each contraction the bulb is stretched and the oesophageal lumen is dilated. Upon muscular relaxation the bulb shortens again and the lumen narrows from front to back, thus forcing food into the intestine. Pumping is usually intermittent. The length of time nematodes stay at one feeding site can vary from several minutes to several days ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ). Females and larvae of X. index usually fed gregariously at galled root tips of Ficus carica. Egg production of females feeding at the root gall varied between 55 and 118 under non-sterile conditions, and was less in aseptic culture. A minimum of 77 days elapsed between oviposition and the last moult giving the young female (Wyss, 1977a). Population dynamics and host-parasite relationships In an Italian vineyard, populations of X. index were smaller in November and February and largest during the summer; gravid females were seen only in July ( Amici, 1967 ). Light- and medium-textured soils were preferred, as is a pH of 6.5-7.5 ( Prota, 1970 ). However, it did well in heavy soils in Israel, with quicker population build-up and shorter duration of life cycle, as the temperature was increased from 16-28°C (Cohn and Mordechai, 1970). In England, X. index had its maximum population in autumn and minimum in spring; peak egg-laying took place

5-7.5 ( Prota, 1970 ). However, it did well in heavy soils in Israel, with quicker population build-up and shorter duration of life cycle, as the temperature was increased from 16-28°C (Cohn and Mordechai, 1970). In England, X. index had its maximum population in autumn and minimum in spring; peak egg-laying took place during summer ( Cotten et al., 1971 ). Populations of X. index in grapevine fields infected with grapevine fanleaf nepovirus in the Champagne vine-growing region of France were assessed by Esmenjaud et al. (1992) . The lowest nematode count was observed between 0 and 25 cm in the field with the highest clay content (Mesnil), and between 0 and 40 cm in the two fields with sandier soil textures. The highest nematode count (5-120 individuals per kg fine soil) was detected in the 55-70 cm horizon of the Mesnil field, and below 90 cm in the chalk parent rock for the two other fields. In south-eastern France, X. index prevails in heavy soils, the oldest vineyards and vineyards planted in fields which were formerly cultivated with vines. It is found up to 1.5 m deep but is more abundant between 20 and 60 cm. These observations explain the inefficiency of nematicide treatments in controlling X. index; better results are obtained by keeping the soil free of vine for at least 6 years ( Scotto La Massese et al., 1988 ). In 1972, 75% of vines on the Kurgan-Tyubinsk plantation in Tadzhikistan were infected with X. index. The nematodes were present in the soil throughout the year but showed three peaks of occurrence: in April (172 nematodes per 75 square centimetre soil sample), August (91 nematodes per sample) and November (128 nematodes per sample)

, 75% of vines on the Kurgan-Tyubinsk plantation in Tadzhikistan were infected with X. index. The nematodes were present in the soil throughout the year but showed three peaks of occurrence: in April (172 nematodes per 75 square centimetre soil sample), August (91 nematodes per sample) and November (128 nematodes per sample) ( Kankina, 1976 , 1977). Survival In moist sterile soil without a food source, X. index died out after 9-10 months ( Raski and Hewitt, 1960 ; Taylor and Raski, 1964 ). It can survive winter temperatures in England including freezing ( Cotten et al., 1971 ). It is reported to have survived for 4.5 years in soil after grapevine host plants (but not the roots) were removed ( Raski et al., 1965 ). X. index survived for 69 days under a wide range of soil temperatures and moisture levels. Nematodes survived storage in soil at 37 and -11°C, but 45 and -22°C were lethal; few survived in either saturated soil or soil held at less than 74% RH ( Harris, 1979 ). Raski and Hewitt (1960) noted that under starving conditions, X. index retained the ability to transmit grapevine fanleaf nepovirus for up to 9 months. The virus did not affect the rate of reproduction of X. index but did improve its survival rate during starvation ( Das and Raski, 1969 ). The virus did not persist through the egg; juveniles lost the ability to transmit the virus at moulting, and had to feed again to acquire the virus ( Taylor and Raski, 1964 ). Interaction with other nematodes Inoculation of Thompson Seedless grapevine with 500 X. index and Pratylenchus vulnus, alone or in combination, suppressed vine shoot and root growth under glasshouse conditions.

 ability to transmit the virus at moulting, and had to feed again to acquire the virus ( Taylor and Raski, 1964 ). Interaction with other nematodes Inoculation of Thompson Seedless grapevine with 500 X. index and Pratylenchus vulnus, alone or in combination, suppressed vine shoot and root growth under glasshouse conditions. P. vulnus caused greater stunting of Thompson Seedless grapevine roots than X. index. Each nematode species inhibited top growth about equally. Concomitant inoculations caused greater stunting of tops and roots than did inoculations of either nematode species alone ( Pinochet et al., 1976 ). Interactions with other species The demonstration by Hewitt et al. (1958) that X. index transmits Grapevine fanleaf virus in Californian vineyards was the first experimental proof of the role of nematodes in virus transmission. The virus is not carried by the nematode as a contaminant, but it has intimate association with the oesophageal lining of the nematode. The specific retention of virus particles within their vector nematodes may involve molecular recognition at their point of contact ( Brown and Trudgill, 1997 ). Robertson and Henry (1986) observed that a carbohydrate layer discontinuously lined the lumens of the odontophore and oesophagus of X. diversicaudatum and that particles of nepovirus were seen attached only at those carbohydrate regions. In France, X. index has been recorded as a vector of courtnoue disease of grapevine ( Boubals et al., 1971 ), and as transmitting virus causing 'dégénérescence infectieuse' [infective degeneration] disease in grapevines ( Vuittenez and Legin, 1964 ; see also Martelli and Raski, 1963 for Italy; Dalmasso and Cuany, 1969 for Algeria; and Dalmasso

e disease of grapevine ( Boubals et al., 1971 ), and as transmitting virus causing 'dégénérescence infectieuse' [infective degeneration] disease in grapevines ( Vuittenez and Legin, 1964 ; see also Martelli and Raski, 1963 for Italy; Dalmasso and Cuany, 1969 for Algeria; and Dalmasso, 1970b for France). The distribution and role of X. index and Xiphinema italiae in transmitting Grapevine fanleaf virus in vineyards in mediterranean France is discussed by Dalmasso et al. (1972) . Grapevine yellow mosaic virus [ Grapevine fanleaf virus ] is transmitted by X. index in Chile ( González and Valenzuela, 1968 ) as well as in Hungary (Martelli and Sárospataki, 1969). In trials in Hungary, both 'yellow mosaic' and Grapevine chrome mosaic virus were transmitted to healthy grapevines by the larvae and females of X. index ( Mali et al., 1975 ); both viruses were also transmitted to Chenopodium quinoa , Phaseolus vulgaris and Gomphrena globosa . This is the first record of X. index as a transmitter of Grapevine chrome mosaic virus (Mali, 1977). In southern Italy, Grapevine fanleaf virus was associated only with X. index and was never detected in, nor transmitted by, Xiphinema italiae , X. pachtaicum , Longidorus apulus or Longidorus euonymus ( Catalano et al., 1992 ). Fanleaf and yellow mosaic virus particles were found in the odontophore and oesophageal lumen but not in the odontostyle of X. index . This distribution is discussed in relation to the different charges on the stomodeal cuticle due to their embryological origin and reinforces the concept of a division of the st

onymus ( Catalano et al., 1992 ). Fanleaf and yellow mosaic virus particles were found in the odontophore and oesophageal lumen but not in the odontostyle of X. index . This distribution is discussed in relation to the different charges on the stomodeal cuticle due to their embryological origin and reinforces the concept of a division of the stoma into oesophastome and cheilostome ( Raski et al., 1973 ). It was shown experimentally that X. index transmitted grapevine yellow mosaic virus [ Grapevine fanleaf virus ] to healthy plants ( Vanek et al., 1972 ). Thirty-one grapevine rootstocks were used to test for reproduction, root feeding symptoms and transmission of grapevine fanleaf nepovirus by a South African population of X. index . Grapevine fanleaf virus was transmitted within 4 months to the roots and systemically spread within 6 months to the leaves of all the rootstocks tested ( Malan and Meyer, 1993 ). In a sample grapevine population, increased acquisition access feeding time by X. index caused an increase in the number of plants subsequently becoming infected by Grapevine fanleaf virus ( Alfaro and Goheen, 1974 ). When fed upon Grapevine fanleaf virus -infected Chenopodium quinoa , X. index acquired the virus but did not transmit it to C. quinoa , although it did transmit the nepovirus to the grapevine ( Trudgill and Brown, 1980 ). Evidence suggests that the X. index - Grapevine fanleaf virus association probably evolved elsewhere and was imported to the Americas with grapevines ( Halbrendt, 1993 ). High concentrations of Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the pseudocoelom of X. index and in root tissue taken from the grapevines showing yellows disease in the Rhine, Moselle, and Saar wine-growing regions of Germany.

 association probably evolved elsewhere and was imported to the Americas with grapevines ( Halbrendt, 1993 ). High concentrations of Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the pseudocoelom of X. index and in root tissue taken from the grapevines showing yellows disease in the Rhine, Moselle, and Saar wine-growing regions of Germany. Dividing stages of the Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the nematode, indicating a close relationship and a possible vector role; this appears to be the first report of Rickettsia -like organisms in a nematode ( Rumbos et al., 1977 ; Sikora and Rumbos, 1977 ).
 Sintomas: Attacked grapevine roots turn brown and swell at the tips (form terminal galls). Heavily parasitized roots of grapevines and roses had breaks in the cortex and appeared darker; in grapevines, Cohn and Orion (1970) observed the development of a layer of phellogen tissue three to five cell layers from the feeding site, which gradually enlarged to encircle the entire cross section. Epidermal and outer cortical cells collapse at feeding sites and show necrosis. In growing roots, multinucleate cells, which are considerably enlarged and contain dense cytoplasm, are formed beneath the layer of necrotic cells ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ). Root-tip cells of Vitis vinifera and Ficus carica fed on directly by X. index are necrotic, contain coagulated cytoplasm and disorganized nuclei, and show a marked affinity for stains ( Lehmann et al., 1978 ) (see Diagnostic Methods).

Another population of X. index from Apulia under similar conditions produced the first new generation females about 63 days after inoculation. This population increased 60-fold in 2.5 months and each female was estimated to lay 25-45 eggs in 9-10 weeks ( Prota et al., 1977 ). Feeding All stages feed ectoparasitically on roots. Juveniles have a large replacement odontostyle in the anterior part of the oesophagus which does not prevent feeding. Feeding is described by Fisher and Raski (1967) .

Single females produced many eggs when feeding on galled root tips of fig seedlings, but not when feeding was confined to root tips of tomato seedlings, which responded only with a slight swelling and necrotic cells ( Wyss, 1978 ). The feeding of X. index on grapevine roots begins by the perforation of the cell wall by a twisting action of the odontostyle. Soon after perforation, rhythmic contractions of the basal oesophageal bulb occur at a rate of about 70 contractions/0.5 min. On each contraction the bulb is stretched and the oesophageal lumen is dilated. Upon muscular relaxation the bulb shortens again and the lumen narrows from front to back, thus forcing food into the intestine. Pumping is usually intermittent. The length of time nematodes stay at one feeding site can vary from several minutes to several days ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ).

The length of time nematodes stay at one feeding site can vary from several minutes to several days ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ). Females and larvae of X. index usually fed gregariously at galled root tips of Ficus carica. Egg production of females feeding at the root gall varied between 55 and 118 under non-sterile conditions, and was less in aseptic culture. A minimum of 77 days elapsed between oviposition and the last moult giving the young female (Wyss, 1977a). Population dynamics and host-parasite relationships In an Italian vineyard, populations of X. index were smaller in November and February and largest during the summer; gravid females were seen only in July ( Amici, 1967 ). Light- and medium-textured soils were preferred, as is a pH of 6.5-7.5 ( Prota, 1970 ). However, it did well in heavy soils in Israel, with quicker population build-up and shorter duration of life cycle, as the temperature was increased from 16-28°C (Cohn and Mordechai, 1970). In England, X. index had its maximum population in autumn and minimum in spring; peak egg-laying took place during summer ( Cotten et al., 1971 ). Populations of X. index in grapevine fields infected with grapevine fanleaf nepovirus in the Champagne vine-growing region of France were assessed by Esmenjaud et al. (1992) . The lowest nematode count was observed between 0 and 25 cm in the field with the highest clay content (Mesnil), and between 0 and 40 cm in the two fields with sandier soil textures.

The lowest nematode count was observed between 0 and 25 cm in the field with the highest clay content (Mesnil), and between 0 and 40 cm in the two fields with sandier soil textures. The highest nematode count (5-120 individuals per kg fine soil) was detected in the 55-70 cm horizon of the Mesnil field, and below 90 cm in the chalk parent rock for the two other fields. In south-eastern France, X. index prevails in heavy soils, the oldest vineyards and vineyards planted in fields which were formerly cultivated with vines. It is found up to 1.5 m deep but is more abundant between 20 and 60 cm. These observations explain the inefficiency of nematicide treatments in controlling X. index; better results are obtained by keeping the soil free of vine for at least 6 years ( Scotto La Massese et al., 1988 ). In 1972, 75% of vines on the Kurgan-Tyubinsk plantation in Tadzhikistan were infected with X. index. The nematodes were present in the soil throughout the year but showed three peaks of occurrence: in April (172 nematodes per 75 square centimetre soil sample), August (91 nematodes per sample) and November (128 nematodes per sample) ( Kankina, 1976 , 1977). Survival In moist sterile soil without a food source, X. index died out after 9-10 months ( Raski and Hewitt, 1960 ; Taylor and Raski, 1964 ). It can survive winter temperatures in England including freezing ( Cotten et al., 1971 ). It is reported to have survived for 4.5 years in soil after grapevine host plants (but not the roots) were removed ( Raski et al., 1965 ).

It is reported to have survived for 4.5 years in soil after grapevine host plants (but not the roots) were removed ( Raski et al., 1965 ). X. index survived for 69 days under a wide range of soil temperatures and moisture levels. Nematodes survived storage in soil at 37 and -11°C, but 45 and -22°C were lethal; few survived in either saturated soil or soil held at less than 74% RH ( Harris, 1979 ). Raski and Hewitt (1960) noted that under starving conditions, X. index retained the ability to transmit grapevine fanleaf nepovirus for up to 9 months. The virus did not affect the rate of reproduction of X. index but did improve its survival rate during starvation ( Das and Raski, 1969 ). The virus did not persist through the egg; juveniles lost the ability to transmit the virus at moulting, and had to feed again to acquire the virus ( Taylor and Raski, 1964 ). Interaction with other nematodes Inoculation of Thompson Seedless grapevine with 500 X. index and Pratylenchus vulnus, alone or in combination, suppressed vine shoot and root growth under glasshouse conditions. P. vulnus caused greater stunting of Thompson Seedless grapevine roots than X. index. Each nematode species inhibited top growth about equally. Concomitant inoculations caused greater stunting of tops and roots than did inoculations of either nematode species alone ( Pinochet et al., 1976 ).

(1958) that X. index transmits Grapevine fanleaf virus in Californian vineyards was the first experimental proof of the role of nematodes in virus transmission. The virus is not carried by the nematode as a contaminant, but it has intimate association with the oesophageal lining of the nematode. The specific retention of virus particles within their vector nematodes may involve molecular recognition at their point of contact ( Brown and Trudgill, 1997 ). Robertson and Henry (1986) observed that a carbohydrate layer discontinuously lined the lumens of the odontophore and oesophagus of X. diversicaudatum and that particles of nepovirus were seen attached only at those carbohydrate regions. In France, X. index has been recorded as a vector of courtnoue disease of grapevine ( Boubals et al., 1971 ), and as transmitting virus causing 'dégénérescence infectieuse' [infective degeneration] disease in grapevines ( Vuittenez and Legin, 1964 ; see also Martelli and Raski, 1963 for Italy; Dalmasso and Cuany, 1969 for Algeria; and Dalmasso, 1970b for France). The distribution and role of X. index and Xiphinema italiae in transmitting Grapevine fanleaf virus in vineyards in mediterranean France is discussed by Dalmasso et al. (1972) . Grapevine yellow mosaic virus [ Grapevine fanleaf virus ] is transmitted by X. index in Chile ( González and Valenzuela, 1968 ) as well as in Hungary (Martelli and Sárospataki, 1969).

 et al. (1972) . Grapevine yellow mosaic virus [ Grapevine fanleaf virus ] is transmitted by X. index in Chile ( González and Valenzuela, 1968 ) as well as in Hungary (Martelli and Sárospataki, 1969). In trials in Hungary, both 'yellow mosaic' and Grapevine chrome mosaic virus were transmitted to healthy grapevines by the larvae and females of X. index ( Mali et al., 1975 ); both viruses were also transmitted to Chenopodium quinoa , Phaseolus vulgaris and Gomphrena globosa . This is the first record of X. index as a transmitter of Grapevine chrome mosaic virus (Mali, 1977). In southern Italy, Grapevine fanleaf virus was associated only with X. index and was never detected in, nor transmitted by, Xiphinema italiae , X. pachtaicum , Longidorus apulus or Longidorus euonymus ( Catalano et al., 1992 ). Fanleaf and yellow mosaic virus particles were found in the odontophore and oesophageal lumen but not in the odontostyle of X. index . This distribution is discussed in relation to the different charges on the stomodeal cuticle due to their embryological origin and reinforces the concept of a division of the stoma into oesophastome and cheilostome ( Raski et al., 1973 ). It was shown experimentally that X. index transmitted grapevine yellow mosaic virus [ Grapevine fanleaf virus ] to healthy plants ( Vanek et al., 1972 ). Thirty-one grapevine rootstocks were used to test for reproduction, root feeding symptoms and transmission of grapevine fanleaf nepovirus by a South African population of X. index . Grapevine fanleaf virus was transmitted within 4 months to the roots and systemically spread within 6 months to the leaves of all the rootstocks tested ( Mal

 ] to healthy plants ( Vanek et al., 1972 ). Thirty-one grapevine rootstocks were used to test for reproduction, root feeding symptoms and transmission of grapevine fanleaf nepovirus by a South African population of X. index . Grapevine fanleaf virus was transmitted within 4 months to the roots and systemically spread within 6 months to the leaves of all the rootstocks tested ( Malan and Meyer, 1993 ). In a sample grapevine population, increased acquisition access feeding time by X. index caused an increase in the number of plants subsequently becoming infected by Grapevine fanleaf virus ( Alfaro and Goheen, 1974 ). When fed upon Grapevine fanleaf virus -infected Chenopodium quinoa , X. index acquired the virus but did not transmit it to C. quinoa , although it did transmit the nepovirus to the grapevine ( Trudgill and Brown, 1980 ). Evidence suggests that the X. index - Grapevine fanleaf virus association probably evolved elsewhere and was imported to the Americas with grapevines ( Halbrendt, 1993 ). High concentrations of Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the pseudocoelom of X. index and in root tissue taken from the grapevines showing yellows disease in the Rhine, Moselle, and Saar wine-growing regions of Germany. Dividing stages of the Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the nematode, indicating a close relationship and a possible vector role; this appears to be the first report of Rickettsia -like organisms in a nematode ( Rumbos et al., 1977 ; Sikora and Rumbos, 1977 ).

 Reproduccion: Life cycle All stages occur in soil as migratory root ectoparasites. Reproduction is by meiotic parthenogenesis (n=10) and a single juvenile is capable of raising a population ( Dalmasso and Younes, 1969 ; Dalmasso, 1970). The life cycle has been studied by Radewald and Raski (1962) and Fisher and Raski (1967) . Eggs hatch in 6-8 days and the first moult occurs outside the egg 24-48 h after emergence. Second, third and fourth moults occur at 6-day intervals thereafter; the complete life cycle taking 22-27 days at 24°C in California, USA ( Radewald and Raski, 1962 ). In Israel, however, 7-9 months are required for the completion of the life cycle at 20-23°C and 3-5 months at 28°C on a suitable host such as Vitis vinifera, Urtica uren

In Israel, however, 7-9 months are required for the completion of the life cycle at 20-23°C and 3-5 months at 28°C on a suitable host such as Vitis vinifera, Urtica urens or Citrus aurantium ( Cohn and Mordechai, 1969 ). X. index completes embryogenic development in 10-12 days at 24±2°C. Shortly before hatching, activity is resumed and is accompanied by an evident flexibility of the egg membrane ( Vovlas and Larizza, 1994 ). In Cypriot vineyards X. index completes one generation per year in coastal plains but requires a longer period in the mountainous area, at an altitude of 950 m. Egg laying in the coastal plain occurred from early May to early July and in the mountainous region from late May to the end of July. At both sites, soil temperature at the initiation of egg laying ranged between 16.5 and 19°C, and the maximum numbers of females occurred immediately prior to initiation of egg laying. Its life cycle in Central Spain takes 6-8 weeks to complete. X. index was found in 14% of all vineyards and in 50% of vineyards infected with grapevine fanleaf nepovirus ( Arias and Fresno, 1994 ). In southern Australian vineyards, X. index completed one life cycle a year. Greatest numbers were found at a depth of 15 cm ( Harris, 1978 ). In Sardinian vineyards in Italy, the life cycle from gravid female to adult lasts 12-14 months, and ovulation occurs principally in spring/summer but to a lesser extent also in autumn. Juvenile forms comprised 50-65% of the population. Total population levels fluctuated at 16-18-month intervals, but there were also annual fluctuations with major increments in

, 1978 ). In Sardinian vineyards in Italy, the life cycle from gravid female to adult lasts 12-14 months, and ovulation occurs principally in spring/summer but to a lesser extent also in autumn. Juvenile forms comprised 50-65% of the population. Total population levels fluctuated at 16-18-month intervals, but there were also annual fluctuations with major increments in autumn and minor ones in spring, usually corresponding to increases in numbers of first-stage juveniles ( Prota and Garau, 1973 ). In experiments performed at 20.5 to 22.5°C in Sardinia, Italy, young females of X. index on Ficus carica produced first-stage juveniles, some already moulting on the 40th day. Third- and fourth-stage juveniles were found 60 and 100 days, respectively, after inoculation; the first young females, still moulting, were present on the 120th day. Another population of X. index from Apulia under similar conditions produced the first new generation females about 63 days after inoculation. This population increased 60-fold in 2.5 months and each female was estimated to lay 25-45 eggs in 9-10 weeks ( Prota et al., 1977 ). Feeding All stages feed ectoparasitically on roots. Juveniles have a large replacement odontostyle in the anterior part of the oesophagus which does not prevent feeding. Feeding is described by Fisher and Raski (1967) . X. index feeds on a column of meristematic cells in root tips and causes gall formation. Extensive terminal root galls due to its feeding were observed on figs in France (Dalmasso, 1970a). Feeding along the roots of grapevine, nettle (Urtica urens) and Bidens tripartita, with no immediate change in the shape of roots, was noticed in Israel ( Cohn, 1970 ). The terminal

Feeding along the roots of grapevine, nettle (Urtica urens) and Bidens tripartita, with no immediate change in the shape of roots, was noticed in Israel ( Cohn, 1970 ). The terminal root galls have multinucleate and metabolically highly active cells which provide a long-lasting food reservoir for the nematode. The nematode feeds on a cell for a few minutes, then moves into successive deeper layers. The secretion of the dorsal oesophageal gland, which is injected into the cell through the hollow needle-like stylet, quickly degrades the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell which become liquified in about 1 min. Then the basal muscular bulb of the oesophagus is used as a pump for food ingestion which lasts for 2 min ( Wyss, 1987 ). A film on feeding (in German) is available from Institut fur den Wissenschaftlichen Film, Gottingen, Germany (see Wyss, 1977b). At the feeding site, the plant develops galling with multinucleate giant cells which provide a continuous supply of food for the parasite. Multinucleate giant cell formation is a parasitic adaptation which appears to be a precondition for a successful host-parasite relationship. Single females produced many eggs when feeding on galled root tips of fig seedlings, but not when feeding was confined to root tips of tomato seedlings, which responded only with a slight swelling and necrotic cells ( Wyss, 1978 ).

Soon after perforation, rhythmic contractions of the basal oesophageal bulb occur at a rate of about 70 contractions/0.5 min. On each contraction the bulb is stretched and the oesophageal lumen is dilated. Upon muscular relaxation the bulb shortens again and the lumen narrows from front to back, thus forcing food into the intestine. Pumping is usually intermittent. The length of time nematodes stay at one feeding site can vary from several minutes to several days ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ). Females and larvae of X. index usually fed gregariously at galled root tips of Ficus carica. Egg production of females feeding at the root gall varied between 55 and 118 under non-sterile conditions, and was less in aseptic culture.

In France, X. index has been recorded as a vector of courtnoue disease of grapevine ( Boubals et al., 1971 ), and as transmitting virus causing 'dégénérescence infectieuse' [infective degeneration] disease in grapevines ( Vuittenez and Legin, 1964 ; see also Martelli and Raski, 1963 for Italy; Dalmasso and Cuany, 1969 for Algeria; and Dalmasso

The distribution and role of X. index and Xiphinema italiae in transmitting Grapevine fanleaf virus in vineyards in mediterranean France is discussed by Dalmasso et al. (1972) . Grapevine yellow mosaic virus [ Grapevine fanleaf virus ] is transmitted by X. index in Chile ( González and Valenzuela, 1968 ) as well as in Hungary (Martelli and Sárospataki, 1969). In trials in Hungary, both 'yellow mosaic' and Grapevine chrome mosaic virus were transmitted to healthy grapevines by the larvae and females of X. index ( Mali et al., 1975 ); both viruses were also transmitted to Chenopodium quinoa , Phaseolus vulgaris and Gomphrena globosa . This is the first record of X. index as a transmitter of Grapevine chrome mosaic virus (Mali, 1977). In southern Italy, Grapevine fanleaf virus was associated only with X. index and was never detected in, nor transmitted by, Xiphinema italiae , X. pachtaicum , Longidorus apulus or Longidorus euonymus ( Catalano et al., 1992 ). Fanleaf and yellow mosaic virus particles were found in the odontophore and oesophageal lumen but not in the odontostyle of X. index .

onymus ( Catalano et al., 1992 ). Fanleaf and yellow mosaic virus particles were found in the odontophore and oesophageal lumen but not in the odontostyle of X. index . This distribution is discussed in relation to the different charges on the stomodeal cuticle due to their embryological origin and reinforces the concept of a division of the stoma into oesophastome and cheilostome ( Raski et al., 1973 ). It was shown experimentally that X. index transmitted grapevine yellow mosaic virus [ Grapevine fanleaf virus ] to healthy plants ( Vanek et al., 1972 ). Thirty-one grapevine rootstocks were used to test for reproduction, root feeding symptoms and transmission of grapevine fanleaf nepovirus by a South African population of X. index . Grapevine fanleaf virus was transmitted within 4 months to the roots and systemically spread within 6 months to the leaves of all the rootstocks tested ( Malan and Meyer, 1993 ). In a sample grapevine population, increased acquisition access feeding time by X. index caused an increase in the number of plants subsequently becoming infected by Grapevine fanleaf virus ( Alfaro and Goheen, 1974 ). When fed upon Grapevine fanleaf virus -infected Chenopodium quinoa , X. index acquired the virus but did not transmit it to C. quinoa , although it did transmit the nepovirus to the grapevine ( Trudgill and Brown, 1980 ). Evidence suggests that the X. index - Grapevine fanleaf virus association probably evolved elsewhere and was imported to the Americas with grapevines ( Halbrendt, 1993 ). High concentrations of Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the pseudocoelom of X. index and in root tissue taken from the grapevines showing yellows disease in the Rhine, Moselle, and Saar wine-growing regions of Germany.

 association probably evolved elsewhere and was imported to the Americas with grapevines ( Halbrendt, 1993 ). High concentrations of Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the pseudocoelom of X. index and in root tissue taken from the grapevines showing yellows disease in the Rhine, Moselle, and Saar wine-growing regions of Germany. Dividing stages of the Rickettsia -like organisms were found in the nematode, indicating a close relationship and a possible vector role; this appears to be the first report of Rickettsia -like organisms in a nematode ( Rumbos et al., 1977 ; Sikora and Rumbos, 1977 ).
 Sintomas: Attacked grapevine roots turn brown and swell at the tips (form terminal galls). Heavily parasitized roots of grapevines and roses had breaks in the cortex and appeared darker; in grapevines, Cohn and Orion (1970) observed the development of a layer of phellogen tissue three to five cell layers from the feeding site, which gradually enlarged to encircle the entire cross section. Epidermal and outer cortical cells collapse at feeding sites and show necrosis. In growing roots, multinucleate cells, which are considerably enlarged and contain dense cytoplasm, are formed beneath the layer of necrotic cells ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ). Root-tip cells of Vitis vinifera and Ficus carica fed on directly by X. index are necrotic, contain coagulated cytoplasm and disorganized nuclei, and show a marked affinity for stains ( Lehmann et al., 1978 ) (see Diagnostic Methods).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Life cycle All stages occur in soil as migratory root ectoparasites. Reproduction is by meiotic parthenogenesis (n=10) and a single juvenile is capable of raising a population ( Dalmasso and Younes, 1969 ; Dalmasso, 1970). The life cycle has been studied by Radewald and Raski (1962) and Fisher and Raski (1967) . Eggs hatch in 6-8 days and the first moult occurs outside the egg 24-48 h after emergence. Second, third and fourth moults occur at 6-day intervals thereafter; the complete life cycle taking 22-27 days at 24°C in California, USA ( Radewald and Raski, 1962 ). In Israel, however, 7-9 months are required for the completion of the life cycle at 20-23°C and 3-5 months at 28°C on a suitable host such as Vitis vinifera, Urtica urens or Citrus aurantium ( Cohn and Mordechai, 1969 ). X. index completes embryogenic development in 10-12 days at 24±2°C. Shortly before hatching, activity is resumed and is accompanied by an evident flexibility of the egg membrane ( Vovlas and Larizza, 1994 ). In Cypriot vineyards X. index completes one generation per year in coastal plains but requires a longer period in the mountainous area, at an altitude of 950 m. Egg laying in the coastal plain occurred from early May to early July and in the mountainous region from late May to the end

 resumed and is accompanied by an evident flexibility of the egg membrane ( Vovlas and Larizza, 1994 ). In Cypriot vineyards X. index completes one generation per year in coastal plains but requires a longer period in the mountainous area, at an altitude of 950 m. Egg laying in the coastal plain occurred from early May to early July and in the mountainous region from late May to the end of July. At both sites, soil temperature at the initiation of egg laying ranged between 16.5 and 19°C, and the maximum numbers of females occurred immediately prior to initiation of egg laying. Its life cycle in Central Spain takes 6-8 weeks to complete. X. index was found in 14% of all vineyards and in 50% of vineyards infected with grapevine fanleaf nepovirus ( Arias and Fresno, 1994 ). In southern Australian vineyards, X. index completed one life cycle a year. Greatest numbers were found at a depth of 15 cm ( Harris, 1978 ). In Sardinian vineyards in Italy, the life cycle from gravid female to adult lasts 12-14 months, and ovulation occurs principally in spring/summer but to a lesser extent also in autumn. Juvenile forms comprised 50-65% of the population. Total population levels fluctuated at 16-18-month intervals, but there were also annual fluctuations with major increments in autumn and minor ones in spring, usually corresponding to increases in numbers of first-stage juveniles ( Prota and Garau, 1973 ). In experiments performed at 20.5 to 22.5°C in Sardinia, Italy, young females of X. index on Ficus carica produced first-stage juveniles, some already moulting on the 40th day. Third- and fourth-stage juveniles were found 60 and 100 days, respectively, after inoculation; the first young females, still moulting, were present on the 120th day. Another population of X. index from Apulia under

inia, Italy, young females of X. index on Ficus carica produced first-stage juveniles, some already moulting on the 40th day. Third- and fourth-stage juveniles were found 60 and 100 days, respectively, after inoculation; the first young females, still moulting, were present on the 120th day. Another population of X. index from Apulia under similar conditions produced the first new generation females about 63 days after inoculation. This population increased 60-fold in 2.5 months and each female was estimated to lay 25-45 eggs in 9-10 weeks ( Prota et al., 1977 ). Feeding All stages feed ectoparasitically on roots. Juveniles have a large replacement odontostyle in the anterior part of the oesophagus which does not prevent feeding. Feeding is described by Fisher and Raski (1967) . X. index feeds on a column of meristematic cells in root tips and causes gall formation. Extensive terminal root galls due to its feeding were observed on figs in France (Dalmasso, 1970a). Feeding along the roots of grapevine, nettle (Urtica urens) and Bidens tripartita, with no immediate change in the shape of roots, was noticed in Israel ( Cohn, 1970 ). The terminal root galls have multinucleate and metabolically highly active cells which provide a long-lasting food reservoir for the nematode. The nematode feeds on a cell for a few minutes, then moves into successive deeper layers. The secretion of the dorsal oesophageal gland, which is injected into the cell through the hollow needle-like stylet, quickly degrades the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell which become liquified in about 1 min. Then the basal muscular bulb of the oesophagus is used as a pump for food ingestion which lasts for 2 min (

 moves into successive deeper layers. The secretion of the dorsal oesophageal gland, which is injected into the cell through the hollow needle-like stylet, quickly degrades the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell which become liquified in about 1 min. Then the basal muscular bulb of the oesophagus is used as a pump for food ingestion which lasts for 2 min ( Wyss, 1987 ). A film on feeding (in German) is available from Institut fur den Wissenschaftlichen Film, Gottingen, Germany (see Wyss, 1977b). At the feeding site, the plant develops galling with multinucleate giant cells which provide a continuous supply of food for the parasite. Multinucleate giant cell formation is a parasitic adaptation which appears to be a precondition for a successful host-parasite relationship. Single females produced many eggs when feeding on galled root tips of fig seedlings, but not when feeding was confined to root tips of tomato seedlings, which responded only with a slight swelling and necrotic cells ( Wyss, 1978 ). The feeding of X. index on grapevine roots begins by the perforation of the cell wall by a twisting action of the odontostyle. Soon after perforation, rhythmic contractions of the basal oesophageal bulb occur at a rate of about 70 contractions/0.5 min. On each contraction the bulb is stretched and the oesophageal lumen is dilated. Upon muscular relaxation the bulb shortens again and the lumen narrows from front to back, thus forcing food into the intestine. Pumping is usually intermittent. The length of time nematodes stay at one feeding site can vary from several minutes to several days ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ). Females and larvae of X. index usually fed gregariously at galled root tips of Ficus carica. Egg production

 again and the lumen narrows from front to back, thus forcing food into the intestine. Pumping is usually intermittent. The length of time nematodes stay at one feeding site can vary from several minutes to several days ( Weischer and Wyss, 1976 ). Females and larvae of X. index usually fed gregariously at galled root tips of Ficus carica. Egg production of females feeding at the root gall varied between 55 and 118 under non-sterile conditions, and was less in aseptic culture. A minimum of 77 days elapsed between oviposition and the last moult giving the young female (Wyss, 1977a). Population dynamics and host-parasite relationships In an Italian vineyard, populations of X. index were smaller in November and February and largest during the summer; gravid females were seen only in July ( Amici, 1967 ). Light- and medium-textured soils were preferred, as is a pH of 6.5-7.5 ( Prota, 1970 ). However, it did well in heavy soils in Israel, with quicker population build-up and shorter duration of life cycle, as the temperature was increased from 16-28°C (Cohn and Mordechai, 1970). In England, X. index had its maximum population in autumn and minimum in spring; peak egg-laying took place during summer ( Cotten et al., 1971 ). Populations of X. index in grapevine fields infected with grapevine fanleaf nepovirus in the Champagne vine-growing region of France were assessed by Esmenjaud et al. (1992) . The lowest nematode count was observed between 0 and 25 cm in the field with the highest clay content (Mesnil), and between 0 and 40 cm in the two fields with sandier soil textures. The highest nematode count (5-120 individuals per kg fine soil) was detected in the 55-70 cm horizon of the

 Esmenjaud et al. (1992) . The lowest nematode count was observed between 0 and 25 cm in the field with the highest clay content (Mesnil), and between 0 and 40 cm in the two fields with sandier soil textures. The highest nematode count (5-120 individuals per kg fine soil) was detected in the 55-70 cm horizon of the Mesnil field, and below 90 cm in the chalk parent rock for the two other fields. In south-eastern France, X. index prevails in heavy soils, the oldest vineyards and vineyards planted in fields which were formerly cultivated with vines. It is found up to 1.5 m deep but is more abundant between 20 and 60 cm. These observations explain the inefficiency of nematicide treatments in controlling X. index; better results are obtained by keeping the soil free of vine for at least 6 years ( Scotto La Massese et al., 1988 ). In 1972, 75% of vines on the Kurgan-Tyubinsk plantation in Tadzhikistan were infected with X. index. The nematodes were present in the soil throughout the year but showed three peaks of occurrence: in April (172 nematodes per 75 square centimetre soil sample), August (91 nematodes per sample) and November (128 nematodes per sample) ( Kankina, 1976 , 1977). Survival In moist sterile soil without a food source, X. index died out after 9-10 months ( Raski and Hewitt, 1960 ; Taylor and Raski, 1964 ). It can survive winter temperatures in England including freezing ( Cotten et al., 1971 ). It is reported to have survived for 4.5 years in soil after grapevine host plants (but not the roots) were removed ( Raski et al., 1965 ).

It is reported to have survived for 4.5 years in soil after grapevine host plants (but not the roots) were removed ( Raski et al., 1965 ). X. index survived for 69 days under a wide range of soil temperatures and moisture levels. Nematodes survived storage in soil at 37 and -11°C, but 45 and -22°C were lethal; few survived in either saturated soil or soil held at less than 74% RH ( Harris, 1979 ). Raski and Hewitt (1960) noted that under starving conditions, X. index retained the ability to transmit grapevine fanleaf nepovirus for up to 9 months. The virus did not affect the rate of reproduction of X. index but did improve its survival rate during starvation ( Das and Raski, 1969 ). The virus did not persist through the egg; juveniles lost the ability to transmit the virus at moulting, and had to feed again to acquire the virus ( Taylor and Raski, 1964 ). Interaction with other nematodes Inoculation of Thompson Seedless grapevine with 500 X. index and Pratylenchus vulnus, alone or in combination, suppressed vine shoot and root growth under glasshouse conditions. P. vulnus caused greater stunting of Thompson Seedless grapevine roots than X. index. Each nematode species inhibited top growth about equally. Concomitant inoculations caused greater stunting of tops and roots than did inoculations of either nematode species alone ( Pinochet et al., 1976 ). Interactions with other species The demonstration by Hewitt et al. (1958) that X. index transmits Grapevine fanleaf virus in Californian vineyards was the first experimental proof of the role of nematodes in virus transmission.

(1958) that X. index transmits Grapevine fanleaf virus in Californian vineyards was the first experimental proof of the role of nematodes in virus transmission. The virus is not carried by the nematode as a contaminant, but it has intimate association with the oesophageal lining of the nematode. The specific retention of virus particles within their vector nematodes may involve molecular recognition at their point of contact ( Brown and Trudgill, 1997 ). Robertson and Henry (1986) observed that a carbohydrate layer discontinuously lined the lumens of the odontophore and oesophagus of X. diversicaudatum and that particles of nepovirus were seen attached only at those carbohydrate regions.

The distribution and role of X. index and Xiphinema italiae in transmitting Grapevine fanleaf virus in vineyards in mediterranean France is discussed by Dalmasso et al. (1972) .
