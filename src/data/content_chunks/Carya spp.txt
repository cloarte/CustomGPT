81-2022: Emergency measures to manage Xylella fastidiosa within Carya species imported as seed for sowing
18 May 2022
Who does this notice affect?
This notice is of interest to importers of Carya species imported as seed for sowing, and their customs brokers.
What will be changing?
As advised through Industry Advice Notice 79-2022, the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (the department) outlined that new biosecurity emergency measures will be implemented to manage the newly identified risk of seed transmission of the plant pathogenic bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa through Carya spp. seed for sowing.
Phase 1 of the new biosecurity seed measures will commence on 20 May 2022, and the following requirements will apply:
an import permit is required to import the following seed species imported for sowing purposes:
Carya alba
Carya aquatica
Carya buckleyi
Carya buckleyi var. villosa
Carya cordiformis
Carya glabra
Carya illinoensis
Carya illinoinensis
Carya laciniosa
Importers may initiate an import permit application, through the ‘Apply for an import permit’ button located in the import conditions of the ‘Carya spp. as seed for sowing’ BICON case.
To manage the risk of Xylella, imported seed must be grown and disease screened for a minimum of 12 months, at the Australian Government post-entry quarantine (PEQ) facility at Mickleham, Victoria. Before release from biosecurity control, the plants must be tested and found free from Xylella species.
All other import conditions will continue to apply, including mandatory phosphine or cold treatment to mitigate the risk of insect pests.
The above requirements will apply to all synonyms and sub-ordinate taxa

The above requirements will apply to all synonyms and sub-ordinate taxa of affected species.
What are the next steps?
The department will continue to monitor new evidence and assess the need to broaden Xylella risk management measures to additional seed or nut pathways.
Any additional measures will be notified to affected stakeholders.
Keep updated by subscribing to relevant BICON cases, using these instructions.
