Capitula homogamous, bisexual, rarely unisexual in dioecious plants, persistent, solitary or several at end of stem and branches. Involucre surrounded by spiny ± divided bracts dissimilar from phyllaries. Phyllaries imbricate, undivided. Receptacle with scales and sometimes bristles, rarely naked. Florets numerous. Corolla actinomorphic, 5-lobed. Stamen filaments glabrous; anther sagittate, base caudate; connective with a sterile apical appendage. Style branches coherent, short, ± truncate. Achene covered with dense long straight appressed hairs, lacking apical rim surrounding pappus insertion. Pappus elements of one or two types of plumose or scabrid bristles, inserted directly on upper edge of achene, not surrounded by a rim.Five genera and ca. 70 species: N Africa, Asia, Europe; three genera and six species (two endemic) in China.1Inner phyllaries longer than florets, with a scarious and colored distal portion spreading when dry.11Carlina+Inner phyllaries shorter than florets, erect and lacking a colored distal portion(2)2(1)Most leaves cauline; florets bisexual; receptacle covered with scales.12Atractylodes+All leaves in a basal tuft; florets unisexual, plants dioecious; receptacle naked.13TugarinoviaLower TaxaAtractylodesCandolleCarlinaLinnaeusTugarinoviaIljinRelated ObjectsCarlineae
