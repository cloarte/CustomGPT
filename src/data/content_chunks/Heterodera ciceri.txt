 Reproduccion: The nematode survives in the soil as a cyst in the absence of host plants or during unsuitable environmental conditions. It normally develops from winter to spring, but on the Anatolian Plateau in Turkey it also develops through the summer. When a host plant is sown, usually from late autumn to early spring, the nematode is stimulated to hatch by root exudates. Second stage juveniles, emerging from eggs contained within cysts, are the only infective stage; they migrate in the soil and when a root is encountered they penetrate near the tip and move within it for a few mm. They then insert their heads in the vascular cylinder, become sedentary and stimulate the formation of syncytial cells around their cephalic region on which they feed. The nematode then undergoes three moults becoming third and fourth stage juveniles and then adults. The life span of the different stages is greatly influenced by environmental conditions. After fertilisation, the female produces a small egg sac, made of a gelatinous matrix, and starts to produce eggs. All eggs are retained within the female body and very occasionally a few (1-2) are laid in the egg sac. When females are old or environmental conditions become unsuitable (temperature around 30°C, low soil moisture content, host plant senescing), the female turns into a cyst by thickening its cuticle, which also becomes brown, and thus protects the eggs contained inside.

 within the female body and very occasionally a few (1-2) are laid in the egg sac. When females are old or environmental conditions become unsuitable (temperature around 30°C, low soil moisture content, host plant senescing), the female turns into a cyst by thickening its cuticle, which also becomes brown, and thus protects the eggs contained inside. Eggs undergo embryogenic development and second stage juveniles remain coiled inside the egg shell. Cysts detach easily from the roots and persist in the soil. Eggs can remain viable in cysts for several years (5-10).The formation of syncytial cells is a prerequisite for nematode development; these cells number only a few (2-3) and are small 5-6 days after nematode invasion, but increase in number (7-10) and grow 20 days later, thus occupying nearly the entire vascular area. This results in a disruption of xylem and phloem elements and an impairment of root function. The distal portion of the root may also die.Sexual dimorphism is evident in the fourth stage and is pronounced in adults. Juvenile females remain sedentary as they moult, becoming more and more swollen until they are lemon-shaped. Fourth stage, or adult females rupture the root cortex and become externally visible. Males are sedentary and endoparasitic until the fourth juvenile stage and then become free living in the soil as adults.Eggs do not become dormant or go through a stage of diapause ( Greco et al., 1992b ). The highest rate of hatching occurs when the temperature is 15-25°C, whilst hatching is nil at 5 or 30°C and negligible at 10°C. A few juveniles can emerge from eggs contained inside females. Penetration of second stage juveniles within chickpea roots occurs equally well at 10 and 25°C. At 8°C juveniles also invade the roots but

A few juveniles can emerge from eggs contained inside females. Penetration of second stage juveniles within chickpea roots occurs equally well at 10 and 25°C. At 8°C juveniles also invade the roots but they do not develop further. Minimum basal temperature for development is 10°C, while at 30°C root invasion by juveniles is suppressed (Kaloshian et al., 1986a).At 20°C, the day degrees required to reach different developmental stages within roots of chickpea are 80, 120, 180, 190 and 370 for third and fourth stage juveniles, adults, eggs and cyst formation, respectively. First and second stage juveniles are visible within the eggs after 15 and 17 days from their formation, respectively (Kaloshian et al., 1986b).Under field conditions in Syria, females can be seen by mid March or April on the roots of winter and spring-sown chickpea, respectively. Cysts develop by early or late April. By harvest (early-mid June), most of the eggs within cysts are embrionated ( Greco et al., 1988 ). On the Anatolian Plateau females and cysts can be found in July. Maximum nematode reproduction rates of about 250 and 75 on winter and spring chickpea, respectively, have been observed in microplots ( Greco et al., 1988 ; 1993) and of 17, after an initial population density of 2 eggs/g soil under field conditions ( Saxena et al., 1992 ).

A decline in the number of nematode eggs in the soil in the range of 33-50% was observed after 7 months in the absence of host plants. Generally, the nematode develops only one generation on spring chickpea, while there is evidence of a second generation, comprising a small proportion of the offspring of the first generation which occurs on winter chickpea and lentil sown in fields infested with <2 eggs/g soil.Spread of H. ciceri may occur only by movement of infested roots or soil.
 Sintomas: SYMPTOMS - DESCRIPTIONThe major symptoms on the roots of chickpea are the presence of white and yellow females at the flowering to early podding stage and of brown cysts at later stages (late podding to senescence). At earlier plant stages and in the case of heavy infestations, small necrotic spots (2-3 mm long and 0.5 mm wide), caused by juvenile penetration, appear longitudinally on the roots, from the centre of which the fourth and adult stage of the nematode will protrude. Rhizobium nodulation of heavily infested roots is reduced.Symptoms on aerial plant parts are not specific; they are those characteristic of a plant whose root system is damaged so that water and nutrient uptake is impaired. Plants with severely infested roots are stunted, yellowish, senesce earlier and have limited number of flowers and pods, which may be empty. The severity of these symptoms is correlated with intensity of the population density of the nematode in the soil and generally infestations become obvious from early flowering onwards.

 within the female body and very occasionally a few (1-2) are laid in the egg sac. When females are old or environmental conditions become unsuitable (temperature around 30°C, low soil moisture content, host plant senescing), the female turns into a cyst by thickening its cuticle, which also becomes brown, and thus protects the eggs contained inside. Eggs undergo embryogenic development and second stage juveniles remain coiled inside the egg shell. Cysts detach easily from the roots and persist in the soil. Eggs can remain viable in cysts for several years (5-10).The formation of syncytial cells is a prerequisite for nematode development; these cells number only a few (2-3) and are small 5-6 days after nematode invasion, but increase in number (7-10) and grow 20 days later, thus occupying nearly the entire vascular area. This results in a disruption of xylem and phloem elements and an impairment of root function. The distal portion of the root may also die.Sexual dimorphism is evident in the fourth stage and is pronounced in adults. Juvenile females remain sedentary as they moult, becoming more and more swollen until they are lemon-shaped. Fourth stage, or adult females rupture the root cortex and become externally visible. Males are sedentary and endoparasitic until the fourth juvenile stage and then become free living in the soil as adults.Eggs do not become dormant or go through a stage of diapause ( Greco et al., 1992b ). The highest rate of hatching occurs when the temperature is 15-25°C, whilst hatching is nil at 5 or 30°C and negligible at 10°C. A few juveniles can emerge from eggs contained inside females. Penetration of second stage juveniles within chickpea roots occurs equally well at 10 and 25°C. At 8°C juveniles also invade the roots but

A few juveniles can emerge from eggs contained inside females. Penetration of second stage juveniles within chickpea roots occurs equally well at 10 and 25°C. At 8°C juveniles also invade the roots but they do not develop further. Minimum basal temperature for development is 10°C, while at 30°C root invasion by juveniles is suppressed (Kaloshian et al., 1986a).At 20°C, the day degrees required to reach different developmental stages within roots of chickpea are 80, 120, 180, 190 and 370 for third and fourth stage juveniles, adults, eggs and cyst formation, respectively. First and second stage juveniles are visible within the eggs after 15 and 17 days from their formation, respectively (Kaloshian et al., 1986b).Under field conditions in Syria, females can be seen by mid March or April on the roots of winter and spring-sown chickpea, respectively. Cysts develop by early or late April. By harvest (early-mid June), most of the eggs within cysts are embrionated ( Greco et al., 1988 ). On the Anatolian Plateau females and cysts can be found in July. Maximum nematode reproduction rates of about 250 and 75 on winter and spring chickpea, respectively, have been observed in microplots ( Greco et al., 1988 ; 1993) and of 17, after an initial population density of 2 eggs/g soil under field conditions ( Saxena et al., 1992 ). A decline in the number of nematode eggs in the soil in the range of 33-50% was observed after 7 months in the absence of host plants.

A decline in the number of nematode eggs in the soil in the range of 33-50% was observed after 7 months in the absence of host plants. Generally, the nematode develops only one generation on spring chickpea, while there is evidence of a second generation, comprising a small proportion of the offspring of the first generation which occurs on winter chickpea and lentil sown in fields infested with <2 eggs/g soil.Spread of H. ciceri may occur only by movement of infested roots or soil.
 Sintomas: SYMPTOMS - DESCRIPTIONThe major symptoms on the roots of chickpea are the presence of white and yellow females at the flowering to early podding stage and of brown cysts at later stages (late podding to senescence). At earlier plant stages and in the case of heavy infestations, small necrotic spots (2-3 mm long and 0.5 mm wide), caused by juvenile penetration, appear longitudinally on the roots, from the centre of which the fourth and adult stage of the nematode will protrude. Rhizobium nodulation of heavily infested roots is reduced.Symptoms on aerial plant parts are not specific; they are those characteristic of a plant whose root system is damaged so that water and nutrient uptake is impaired. Plants with severely infested roots are stunted, yellowish, senesce earlier and have limited number of flowers and pods, which may be empty. The severity of these symptoms is correlated with intensity of the population density of the nematode in the soil and generally infestations become obvious from early flowering onwards.

 Organos afectados: Cicer, Fabaceae, Wild host, 
 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology The nematode survives in the soil as a cyst in the absence of host plants or during unsuitable environmental conditions. It normally develops from winter to spring, but on the Anatolian Plateau in Turkey it also develops through the summer. When a host plant is sown, usually from late autumn to early spring, the nematode is stimulated to hatch by root exudates. Second stage juveniles, emerging from eggs contained within cysts, are the only infective stage; they migrate in the soil and when a root is encountered they penetrate near the tip and move within it for a few mm. They then insert their heads in the vascular cylinder, become sedentary and stimulate the formation of syncytial cells around their cephalic region on which they feed. The nematode then undergoes three moults becoming third and fourth stage juveniles and then adults. The life span of the different stages is greatly influenced by environmental conditions. After fertilisation, the female produces a small egg sac, made of a gelatinous matrix, and starts to produce eggs. All eggs are retained within the female body and very occasionally a few (1-2) are laid in the egg sac. When females are old or environmental conditions become unsuitable (temperature around 30°C, low soil moisture content, host plant senescing), the female turns into a cyst by thickening its cuticle, which also becomes brown, and thus protects the eggs contained inside.
