Plant Notes:  River Birch is a native deciduous tree in the Birch family (Betulaceae). It can be found throughout Alabama. River Birch occurs on the banks of streams and rivers and in floodplain forests. It is a medium sized tree reaching heights of 70-95 feet. The trunks are often several, forming clumps. The bark is thin, reddish to creamy white, papery, and peeling in large sheets. Twigs are glabrous to sparsely pubescent with scattered tiny resinous glands. The leaves are alternate, petiolate, rhombic to ovate in outline, doubly serrate, and pubescent. The leaves have scattered tiny resinous glands on the lower surface. The leaves turn a light-yellow color before falling in the autumn. Flowers are produced in unisexual catkins on the same tree. Male catkins are pendant, and yellowish-green in color. They are produced before or as the leaves emerge. Female catkins are erect, globose, and green in color. The fruit is a winged nutlet. River Birch is commonly available in the nursery trade. It is a popular ornamental for its papery bark. It prefers a site in full sun with moist, acidic, fertile soils, but can grow on drier sites. Several cultivars are available.--A. Diamond  ;
