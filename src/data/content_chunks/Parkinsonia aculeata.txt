 Invasion: Parkinsonia aculeatais a shrubby tree, growing to a height of 4-10 m. Lone trees or well-spaced trees may be unbranched to 1-1.5 m with a well-developed bole up to 30 cm diameter, but it is common to find low-branched or multi-stemmed individuals. Trunk fissured, black-brown. Smaller branches and shoots green. Branches prominently armed. Leaves bi-pinnate. Petiole and primary rachis reduced, 10-30 mm long, and stoutly spinescent.

Leaves bi-pinnate. Petiole and primary rachis reduced, 10-30 mm long, and stoutly spinescent. Secondary rachis, 1-3 pairs congested at the base of the primary rachis, 18-40 cm long, flattened, and bearing 25-60 pairs of tiny, weakly-mucronate obovate-elliptic leaflets which are often deciduous. Paired stipules spinescent. Inflorescences racemose, 4-20 cm long, on short, actively growing axillary shoots. Pedicels 1.5-2 cm long, proximally jointed. Flower petals 5, yellow, clawed banner petal 9-13 mm long, flecked with orange, turning deep orange-brown and folding forwards post-pollination. Calyx lobes obovate-lanceolate, reflexed. Fruits (legumes) indehiscent, orange-brown glabrous pods, subterete, constricted and flattened between seeds. Seeds 2-8 per pod, 8-11 mm long, dark and light brown or grey mottled.

 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for P. aculeata is 2 n = 28. The conservation status of the species, in terms of interspecific variation, has not been examined. The establishment of extensive weedy populations, ready regeneration from seed or coppice stumps, and abundance in its putative range suggests that the species is not at risk ( Stewart et al., 1992 ). Natural hybrids have been described between P. aculeata and Cercidium praecox , a thorny arid zone species with a disjunct distribution spanning the arid regions of tropical and subtropical North and South America ( Carter, 1974a ; Hawkins, 1996 ). The hybrids, which are unarmed, have been identified as a potential new agroforestry species ( Hughes, 1989 ), although they may pose a novel and significant threat of weediness. Hybrids are known to often display increased weedy tendencies ( Abbott, 1992 ), so novel hybrids of Parkinsonia should be utilized with particular care or avoided. Parkinsonia aculeata begins to flower and fruit 5 to 6 years after planting. Many slightly bean-like, fragrant yellow flowers are borne on panicles of slender stalks throughout the year. Flowers are hermaphroditic and visited and pollinated by large and small bees. Flowering in P. aculeata occurs in the second or third growth season ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). In Central America, peak flowering is from February to March, with sporadic flowering thereafter. Flowering is somewhat later in Mexico and the southern USA, with peak flowering occurring between April and May. In India, flowering is in April and May, with sporadic flowering almost throughout the year ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ).

 is from February to March, with sporadic flowering thereafter. Flowering is somewhat later in Mexico and the southern USA, with peak flowering occurring between April and May. In India, flowering is in April and May, with sporadic flowering almost throughout the year ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). In Australia, plants usually flower in May or June but, as elsewhere, sporadic flowering can occur throughout the year ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). Leaflets may be partially or completely deciduous in the dry season, but the phyllodial secondary rachises are persistent. Propagation of P. aculeata is generally by seed and seeding is prolific, though pods are indehiscent. Mahmoud and El-Sheikh (1981) noted two types of seed: light seeds which are water permeable and germinate freely, and dark seeds which appear to have a harder seed coat and require pre-treatment. Seedlings germinate over a wide temperature range, varying from continuous exposure to temperatures between 15° and 35°C to alternating temperature regimes of 20°/10°C, 25°/15°C and 30°/20°C ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). Propagation is also reported by (root or shoot) cuttings or air-layering ( Singh, 1989 ). Parkinsonia aculeata does not fix nitrogen and thus has no association with Rhizobia ( Sprent, 1987 ). It is found in similar vegetation associations through Central America and northern South America, often with Acacia spp. (e.g. A. farnesiana in Central America and the USA), Caesalpinia spp., Capparis spp., Cercidium spp., Leucaena spp. and Prosopis spp. ( Pasiecznik et al., 2001 ).

Parkinsonia aculeata is tolerant of a wide range of soil and climate types. It may be assumed that triggers for invasion would include flooding, which would spread seed widely and provide improved conditions for establishment. This species is extremely hardy and thrives in moist and semi-arid environments, surviving seasonal flooding and a dry season of greater than 8 months duration. A mean annual rainfall between 250 mm and 1000 mm is tolerated; though the species is most valuable in dry areas and may exhibit weedy tendencies where mean annual rainfall exceeds 500 mm (Hocking, 1993; Luna, 1996 ). Temperatures as high as 48°C and mild frosts are tolerated, although die-back occurs after intense or extended frosts (Hocking, 1993). Seedlings tolerate a wide range of soil pH, from 3 to 11 ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ) and moderate to excessively saline soils ( Webb et al., 1984 ; Singh, 1989 ; Luna, 1996 ). Although many authors suggest that P. aculeata will not tolerate waterlogging ( Webb et al., 1984 ; Singh, 1989 ; Luna, 1996 ), it is known to favour seasonally flooded sites which other species are less able to tolerate ( Miller and Pickering, 1980 ; Hughes, 1989 ; Killeen et al., 1993 ). Although the natural distribution of P. aculeata is arguably limited to seasonally flooded black cotton vertisols ( Hughes, 1989 ), tolerance of soil types is wide.

In India, flowering is in April and May, with sporadic flowering almost throughout the year ( Troup and Joshi, 1983 ). In Australia, plants usually flower in May or June but, as elsewhere, sporadic flowering can occur throughout the year ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). Leaflets may be partially or completely deciduous in the dry season, but the phyllodial secondary rachises are persistent. Activity Patterns Propagation of P. aculeata is generally by seed and seeding is prolific, though pods are indehiscent. Mahmoud and El-Sheikh (1981) noted two types of seed: light seeds which are water permeable and germinate freely, and dark seeds which appear to have a harder seed coat and require pre-treatment. Seedlings germinate over a wide temperature range, varying from continuous exposure to temperatures between 15° and 35°C to alternating temperature regimes of 20°/10°C, 25°/15°C and 30°/20°C ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). Propagation is also reported by (root or shoot) cutt

 and require pre-treatment. Seedlings germinate over a wide temperature range, varying from continuous exposure to temperatures between 15° and 35°C to alternating temperature regimes of 20°/10°C, 25°/15°C and 30°/20°C ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ). Propagation is also reported by (root or shoot) cuttings or air-layering ( Singh, 1989 ). Associations Parkinsonia aculeata does not fix nitrogen and thus has no association with Rhizobia ( Sprent, 1987 ). It is found in similar vegetation associations through Central America and northern South America, often with Acacia spp. (e.g. A. farnesiana in Central America and the USA), Caesalpinia spp., Capparis spp., Cercidium spp., Leucaena spp. and Prosopis spp. ( Pasiecznik et al., 2001 ). Environmental Requirements Parkinsonia aculeata is tolerant of a wide range of soil and climate types. It may be assumed that triggers for invasion would include flooding, which would spread seed widely and provide improved conditions for establishment. This species is extremely hardy and thrives in moist and semi-arid environments, surviving seasonal flooding and a dry season of greater than 8 months duration. A mean annual rainfall between 250 mm and 1000 mm is tolerated; though the species is most valuable in dry areas and may exhibit weedy tendencies where mean annual rainfall exceeds 500 mm (Hocking, 1993; Luna, 1996 ). Temperatures as high as 48°C and mild frosts are tolerated, although die-back occurs after intense or extended frosts (Hocking, 1993). Seedlings tolerate a wide range of soil pH, from 3 to 11 ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ) and moderate to excessively saline soils ( Webb et al., 1984 ; Singh, 1989 ; Luna, 1996 ).

atures as high as 48°C and mild frosts are tolerated, although die-back occurs after intense or extended frosts (Hocking, 1993). Seedlings tolerate a wide range of soil pH, from 3 to 11 ( Parsons and Cuthbertson, 1992 ) and moderate to excessively saline soils ( Webb et al., 1984 ; Singh, 1989 ; Luna, 1996 ). Although many authors suggest that P. aculeata will not tolerate waterlogging ( Webb et al., 1984 ; Singh, 1989 ; Luna, 1996 ), it is known to favour seasonally flooded sites which other species are less able to tolerate ( Miller and Pickering, 1980 ; Hughes, 1989 ; Killeen et al., 1993 ). Although the natural distribution of P. aculeata is arguably limited to seasonally flooded black cotton vertisols ( Hughes, 1989 ), tolerance of soil types is wide. Good growth has been reported from shallow and skeletal soils, gravelly, rocky gullies and hillsides and deeper loamy valley soils (Hocking, 1993). The use of P. aculeata as a soil-binding species for sandy sites has been reported ( Abohassan and Rudolph, 1978 ; Mahmoud and El-Sheikh, 1981 ; Troup and Joshi, 1983 ).
