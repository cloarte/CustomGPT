Understanding the DEEP Process
-
Deregulation Evaluation of Established Pests
• A mechanism for PPQ to evaluate pests that are: 
– Quarantine at U.S. port(s) of entry (POE) but no longer 
meet the IPPC definition of a quarantine pest
• Pest is established in U.S.
• Pest is not under federal official control
What Is The Purpose Of DEEP?
• ‘Deregulation’ through DEEP means changing the pest 
status from quarantine to non-quarantine at U.S. POE

• Remove entry requirements for pests that APHIS no 
longer considers a risk
Cost savings for containing, eradicating, excluding pests
What Are The Benefits Of DEEP?
3
• Removal of unnecessary import requirements 
Harmonization of foreign and domestic requirements → 
actions at U.S. POE are consistent with those taken 
domestically
Facilitation of safe and           
fair trade
1. Current port policy is quarantine for all or some of the U.S.
*a pest’s regulatory status may vary with POE policy (ex: quarantine for 
U.S. mainland, but non-quarantine for HI, PR, and/or other territories).
2. Pest is established in one or more U.S. states/territories 
where it is considered quarantine at the associated POE
3. Pest has been in the U.S. for a long period of time, usually 5 
years or more and not under official control

When Does A Pest Qualify For DEEP?
Agriotes lineatus (Lined Click Beetle) 
• Evaluation by S&T-PPRA (Plant Pest Risk Analysis) 
• Analysis considers the following:
• What is the global distribution of the pest?
• What is the host range and biology of the pest?
• Where is the pest distributed in the U.S.?
• How long has the pest been in the U.S.?
• What economic/environmental damage does the pest currently 
cause in the U.S.? 
• What potential future damage may the pest cause in new areas?
• How feasible (technically, economically) is a federal                
official control program?
How Is A Pest Evaluated through DEEP?
• Provides recommendation to change the pest status from 
quarantine to non-quarantine for all or a part of the U.S., if:
• The pest does not have the potential for significant impacts, or 
• Eradication and/or containment is not feasible 
• Assesses if federal official control is warranted and 
provides justification for changing PPQ port policy
What Does The DEEP Report Do?
• APHIS no longer takes regulatory action on these pests at specified POE
– Consistent with U.S. trade policy and fulfills international agreements 
while promoting safe trade
• APHIS continues successful collaboration with the National Plant Board 
(NPB) by presenting DEEP pests for consultation twice a year 
– States may petition for a Federally Recognized

What Impact Does DEEP Have?

Pests Submitted for 
DEEP consideration 
(PPRA, EDP, NIS…)
S&T-PPRA 
completes 
DEEP Reports
EDP-PER submits 
DEEP Reports for 
internal review (EDP, 
PEIP , PIM)
Pest Remains
Quarantine
EDP-PER submits DEEP reports 
to NPB/States for Consultation 
(60-day comment period)
*Includes last 5 years of POE 
interceptions for each pest
Further consultation
