Introduction 
On October 19, 2013, the American Association of Equine Practitioners Foundation (AAEP) and 
the United States Animal Health Association (USAHA) Committee on Infectious Diseases of Horses 
(IDOHC) sponsored an Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) Workshop. The workshop identified a need 
for regulatory consensus on case definition, outbreak definition, quarantine parameters, 
diagnostic testing and biosecurity practices for Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy 
incidents. USAHA IDOHC established an EHV-1 subcommittee to develop a consensus document 
related to the EHV-1 regulatory mitigation.  
This document represents an updated version of the original guideline developed by the 
subcommittee. (Updated in January 2018). 
The EHV-1 Subcommittee members participating in updating this document included:

During Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) incidents, the state animal health 
officials’ (SAHO) goal is to prevent the spread of the disease agent, specifically Equine Herpesvirus- 
1. Science-based disease control protocols, adapted to the specific incident, control disease 
spread while ensuring compliance and minimizing the impact on equine movement. There is no 
single protocol that can be applied to all EHM incidents as there are multiple factors that must be 
considered when determining the optimal disease containment response. This guidance

IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  6 
Revised January 2018 
DEFINITIONS 
Assumption: The definitions are intended to be utilized during an EHM incident. The document is 
based on diagnosis or suspicion of one or more Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) 
cases. 
EHM Incident: Detection of one or more confirmed cases of EHM, and where there is confirmation 
of disease agent spread or evidence of potential for disease transmission from an EHM confirmed 
case to additional horses in a population. 
Index Definitions: 
 
1.  Confirmed Index EHM Case: A horse displaying signs of central nervous system (CNS) 
dysfunction, including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or 
urinary bladder atony, with evidence of infection with any strain of EHV -1 based on virus isolation 
and /or PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens. If the horse dies

function, including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or 
urinary bladder atony, with evidence of infection with any strain of EHV -1 based on virus isolation 
and /or PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens. If the horse dies 
or is euthanized, the case can be confirmed based on histological evidence and detection and/or 
demonstration of EHV-1 in CNS tissues collected at necropsy. 
2.  Suspect Index EHM Case: Highly suggestive EHM case, defined as a horse displaying signs of 
central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, 
weakness, recumbency and/or urinary bladder atony which may have been preceded by fever, 
respiratory signs and/or abortion in horses on the premises.  
3.  Index EHM Premises: The premises on which the index EHM case has occurred. 
4.  Index Point of Exposure: Initial site of exposure to EHV-1 for the confirmed index EHM case 
and/or suspect index EHM case as determined by an epidemiologic investigation. In cases of 
presumed reactivation of latent virus, a point of exposure for the index case does not exist. 
Subsequent Definitions: 
 
1. Exposed horse: A horse with direct or indirect contact with the EHM confirmed index case 
within the 14 days preceding the onset of neurologic signs or a horse that potentially had direct 
or indirect contact with horses at the point of exposure of the index case within the preceding 
14 days. (For details on exposure risk, see investigation section). 
 
2. Suspect EHV-1
Text Len: 1568
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 with direct or indirect contact with the EHM confirmed index case 
within the 14 days preceding the onset of neurologic signs or a horse that potentially had direct 
or indirect contact with horses at the point of exposure of the index case within the preceding 
14 days. (For details on exposure risk, see investigation section). 
 
2. Suspect EHV-1 case: An exposed horse that shows no neurologic signs but displays some of the 
clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection; these may include fever (rectal temperature 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  7 
Revised January 2018 
greater than 101.5°F), limb edema, abortion or nasal discharge during the 14 days after initial 
exposure to a confirmed EHM case. 
 
3. Confirmed EHV-1 case: A horse that is showing no neurologic signs but tests positive for EHV-1 
by virus isolation and/or PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/ nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) or 
fetal tissue specimens along with clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection, such as fever, 
limb edema, abortion or nasal discharge. If the horse dies or is euthanized, the case may be 
confirmed based on histological evidence and detection and/or demonstration of EHV-1 in 
tissues collected at necropsy.  
 
4. Suspect EHM case: An exposed horse that develops neurologic signs suggestive of EHM, 
including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary 
bladder atony during the 14 days prior to the index EHM case developing clinical signs and/or 14 
days after the last potential

4. Suspect EHM case: An exposed horse that develops neurologic signs suggestive of EHM, 
including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary 
bladder atony during the 14 days prior to the index EHM case developing clinical signs and/or 14 
days after the last potential exposure to the confirmed EHM case. 
 
5. Confirmed EHM case: A horse which is positive for any strain of EHV-1 by virus isolation and /or 
PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens along with the 
presence of clinical signs consistent with EHM. If the horse dies or is euthanized, the presence of 
histological lesions and/or demonstration of EHV-1 in the CNS tissues collected at necropsy is 
confirmatory of a diagnosis. 
 
6. Non-clinical test positive case: An exposed horse that is not exhibiting clinical signs (afebrile, 
non-neurologic) but tests positive for any strain of EHV-1 by virus isolation and/or PCR testing of 
nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens.  
 
a. Note: during any given incident some horses may start in this category before 
developing neurologic signs and subsequently being confirmed as an EHM case 
after they develop neurologic signs. 
 
7. EHM Premises: A premises where a confirmed or suspect case of EHM currently resides or a 
premise where an EHM case resided within the preceding 14 days. 
 
8. Fever: Body temperature of 101.5° F or greater.

8. Fever: Body temperature of 101.5° F or greater.  
 
9. Afebrile: Body temperature of less than 101.5° F in a monitored horse.  
 
10. Monitored horse: A horse that is being evaluated for any evidence of clinical signs consistent 
with EHV-1 infection.  A monitored horse should have the body temperature determined at

least twice a day e.g. morning and evening in order to detect a fever and it should be examined 
for any neurologic signs.  A horse cannot be considered to be truly monitored for EHV-1 induced 
fever if it has been treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) within the 
previous 24 hours. 
 
11. ORF: Open Reading Frame 
 
12. SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism 
 
13. PPE (Personal Protective Equipment):  Any protective clothing, garment, footwear or equipment 
designed to protect the wearer from direct exposure to infectious agents. Proper use and 
disposal of these garments will reduce the spread of infectious agents. 
 
14. EHV-1 “A” strain: Any strain of EHV-1 having the SNP genetic marker ORF 30 A2254 genotype. 
(Previously referred to as wild strain or non-neuropathogenic strain).

14. EHV-1 “A” strain: Any strain of EHV-1 having the SNP genetic marker ORF 30 A2254 genotype. 
(Previously referred to as wild strain or non-neuropathogenic strain). 
 
15. *EHV-1 “G” strain: Any strain of EHV-1 having the SNP genetic marker ORF 30 G2254 genotype. 
(Previously referred to as mutated or neuropathogenic strain). 
 
* Strains of EHV-1 having this genotype have on occasion been associated with severe 
outbreaks of EHM.  In clinical trials, such stains have been associated with a higher level of 
viremia than strains with the ORF 30 A2254 genotype.  Strains of the EHV-1 with the ORF 
30 G2254 genotype have also been referred to as mutant strains of EHV-1. This is a 
misleading term since such strains of EHV-1 were detected in archival samples from the 
1970’s and accordingly they should not be referred to as newly mutated forms of EHV-1.  
 
16. Exposed premises: The physical location where an index case or an EHV-1 exposed horse has 
been in the previous 14 days, to include but not limited to pastures, event venues, training 
facilities, and breeding facilities. Note: The extent of the area of premises exposed needs to be 
based on a thorough epidemiologic evaluation.

facilities, and breeding facilities. Note: The extent of the area of premises exposed needs to be 
based on a thorough epidemiologic evaluation. 
NOTE:  
Non-neuropathogenic or wild strain of EHV-1: Any strain of EHV-1 with the ORF 30 A2254 genotype.  
Neuropathogenic or mutant strain of EHV-1: Any strain of EHV-1 with the ORF 30 G2254 genotype.  
“Non-neuropthogenic EHV-1 strain” and “neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain”; are terms that lead to 
confusion since both strains have the potential to cause EHM. In an outbreak environment knowing 
which strain is present does not necessarily change what needs to be done to control/mitigate the 
situation.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING 
Serologic Testing 
Due to the likelihood of widespread exposure to EHV-1 and the common practice of vaccination of 
the general equine population against this virus infection, serologic testing at a single point in time 
is uninformative and of very limited diagnostic value. The serologic test readily available in the 
United States is the virus neutralization test (VNT); some other countries however, have the 
availability to use the complement fixation test (CFT) which can be used to detect recent exposure 
to EHV-1. Serologic testing, namely using the VNT, which demonstrates seroconversion or a four-
fold or greater increase in serum antibody titers between samples collected 10- 21 days apart,

 (VNT); some other countries however, have the 
availability to use the complement fixation test (CFT) which can be used to detect recent exposure 
to EHV-1. Serologic testing, namely using the VNT, which demonstrates seroconversion or a four-
fold or greater increase in serum antibody titers between samples collected 10- 21 days apart, 
provides presumptive evidence of recent EHV-1 infection assuming EHV-1 vaccination has not taken 
place just prior to or during that time period. EHV neutralizing tests (VNT) do not distinguish 
between EHV-1 and EHV-4 antibodies. 
However, type specific ELISA tests based on a portion of the glycoprotein G of each virus have been 
developed. The CFT and ELISA type specific antibody detection tests are not currently available at 
diagnostic laboratories in North America. 
Virus Detection 
Virus isolation is considered the gold standard for confirmatory laboratory diagnosis of EHV-1 
infection, although the time required to obtain a positive result limits its value for outbreak 
management. Virus identification of EHV-1 by isolation from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs or 
buffy coat samples is confirmatory evidence of a diagnosis of EHM in a horse with compatible 
clinical signs. 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the diagnostic test of choice due to its high 
analytical sensitivity and specificity and rapid turn-around time. Positive PCR results can be 
obtained when virus isolation is negative due to sub-detectable levels of infectious virus, 
inactivated virus or presence of viral nucleic acid. PCR tests carried out simultaneously on both 
nasal secretions and buffy coat samples are useful in establishing the stage of infection in an 
animal.

 and specificity and rapid turn-around time. Positive PCR results can be 
obtained when virus isolation is negative due to sub-detectable levels of infectious virus, 
inactivated virus or presence of viral nucleic acid. PCR tests carried out simultaneously on both 
nasal secretions and buffy coat samples are useful in establishing the stage of infection in an 
animal. Quantitation of genomic DNA level is used as a guide in assessing the potential of a horse 
with nasal shedding EHV-1 to transmit infection. Viremia is the presence of virus (intact and 
regarded as infectious) in the bloodstream. Although viremia is an essential component in the 
pathogenesis of EHM, some studies have failed to show that the level of viremia is directly 
correlated with level of risk for development of EHM. Other studies have shown correlation of a 
high level of viremia with more severe CNS diseases. While the level of virus detected by PCR 
indicate the presence or absence of viral DNA in the specimen tested, at this time that level of virus 
has not been correlated with the severity of clinical presentation and cannot be used to predict

clinical outcome. The lack of standardization of test methods between laboratories and the lack of 
standardized use of quality assurance controls amongst laboratories remain an ongoing challenge in 
test interpretation. 
Note: Virus isolation is optimized when samples are collected and shipped the same day and are 
received by the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.

Note: Virus isolation is optimized when samples are collected and shipped the same day and are 
received by the laboratory within 24 hours of collection. 
Recently, antiviral drugs have been used by some for the treatment of EHM cases. Currently, there 
is ongoing research regarding the use of antiviral drugs for treatment of neurologic cases and even 
prevention of EHV-1 infection in exposed horses. Theoretically, use of antivirals could alter level of 
viremia and viral shedding and thereby have an impact on test results. However, at this time there 
is not enough science based literature available to determine the impact of the use of antiviral 
drugs on the level and duration of viremia and nasal shedding of virus. Still, it should be considered 
during the evaluation of test results, therefore it is important that the submitter record treatment 
with antiviral drugs on the submission form. 
Types of PCR tests 
• Conventional/Standard PCR: The amplified DNA is detected at the end of the test 
procedure. This test is of more limited sensitivity and is non-quantitative. 
• Nested PCR: Two sets of primers are used in two successive PCRs. The amplified DNA 
fragments are used in a second PCR for identification. It is a very sensitive assay but is 
associated with the risk of cross-contamination between samples. 
• Real Time PCR: the amplified DNA is detected as the reaction progresses. More sensitive, 
specific, rapid and reliable than conventional PCR. This test allows for determination of the 
amount of viral nucleic acid in the sample being tested.

amount of viral nucleic acid in the sample being tested. 
EHV-1 PCR Tests 
The glycoprotein B gene PCR assay is often used as a screening test to detect EHV-1; a positive test 
indicates EHV-1 infection. However, this test cannot differentiate EHV-1 G strains (previously 
referred to as mutant strain) from the EHV-1 A strains (previously referred to as wild strain). 
Subsequent subtyping based on the DNA polymerase gene assay, which targets the single 
nucleotide polymorphism at position 2254 of the virus open reading frame 30 which encodes for 
the catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase gene, can differentiate G and A virus strains. Some 
laboratories may only use the DNA polymerase gene assay for screening for EHV-1 infection.

Characteristics of an Ideal PCR Protocol 
Consider these characteristics of PCR assays when choosing the most appropriate type of test to 
meet your needs and that are consistent with the reason for testing in your situation: 
1. Sensitivity: Does the assay have a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of EHV- 
1? Is strain typing necessary? Certain highly sensitive PCR assays can differentiate EHV-1 G 
strains (previously referred to as mutant strains) from EHV-1 A strains (previously referred 
to as wild stains) in a sample. 
2. Timeliness: Can the laboratory provide timely results necessary for confirmation of 
infection? Assay results can be available

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
? Certain highly sensitive PCR assays can differentiate EHV-1 G 
strains (previously referred to as mutant strains) from EHV-1 A strains (previously referred 
to as wild stains) in a sample. 
2. Timeliness: Can the laboratory provide timely results necessary for confirmation of 
infection? Assay results can be available within 12 hours of sample receipt at some 
laboratories. 
3. Quantitative Load: Can the assay provide quantitative results? Will quantitative results be 
useful in the epidemiologic investigation or disease control efforts? A quantitative PCR 
assay can provide quantitation of viral DNA in a specimen. 
Additional considerations when choosing an appropriate laboratory for sample testing: 
1. Turn-around Time: Can the laboratory provide a rapid turnaround time? A laboratory 
which can provide timely reports to the practitioner is beneficial. 
2. Laboratory Assistance: Does the laboratory have readily available personnel to assist with 
interpretation of test results? A more detailed understanding of a positive or negative test 
result can assist in the implementation of appropriate biosecurity and infection control 
measures. 
3. State Animal Health Official Acceptance: Will the state animal health official accept the 
results from the laboratory being considered for sample submission? Some animal health 
officials require that official test results be provided by specified laboratories and may 
require additional sample types to be collected and tested, such as collection and testing 
a different source of sample from a previously tested horse, e.g. blood versus nasal swab 
or sampling of additional horses in an incident.

Recent EHV-1 PCR Ring Trial Study  
Abstract from 2014 USAHA IDOHC Meeting, San Diego, CA -
http://usaha.org/Committees/InfectiousDiseasesOfHorses.aspx 
 
“In 2013, the USDA-APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) and American Association 
of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD) conducted a joint inter-laboratory comparison 
(ring trial) of equine herpesvirus type 1 (nEHV-1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in an 
effort to standardize testing methodology for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) 
carried out at state/university/provincial diagnostic facilities in North America. 
A total of 28 state diagnostic facilities from the USA and Canada evaluated a ring test “panel” of 
field EHV isolates. The 28 participating laboratories used 38 different procedures (some laboratories 
tested by multiple procedures) based upon modifications of 10 peer-reviewed published methods 
for EHV-1 PCR. Two genes were utilized as PCR targets, the EHV-1 glycoprotein B gene, and the EHV-
1 ORF 30, viral DNA polymerase gene. Glycoprotein B gene- based PCR assays, which are 
fundamentally designed as screening assays that detect wild-type (wt-EHV-1) and neuropathogenic 
(nEHV-1)strains, were used by 15 participating

coprotein B gene, and the EHV-
1 ORF 30, viral DNA polymerase gene. Glycoprotein B gene- based PCR assays, which are 
fundamentally designed as screening assays that detect wild-type (wt-EHV-1) and neuropathogenic 
(nEHV-1)strains, were used by 15 participating laboratories and had excellent diagnostic sensitivity 
for both wt-EHV-1 (100%; 30/30 samples identified   correctly), and nEHV-1 (98.8%; 89/90 samples 
identified correctly), as well as excellent diagnostic specificity (98.3%; 59/60 non-EHV-1 samples 
identified correctly). As predicted, none of the glycoprotein B gene-based assays differentiated wt-
EHV-1 from nEHV-1 and as such serve as excellent diagnostic tools to identify EHV-1 infected horses 
from non-EHV-1 infected horses but do not identify nEHV-1 specifically. ORF 30 (viral DNA 
polymerase) gene-based PCR assay had more variable results from testing of the ring trial samples. 
Three published ORF 30 A/G 2254 assays: 1) Allen et al, 2007, 2) Pusterla et al, 2009, and 3) Smith et 
al, 2012), which differentiate wt-EHV-1 from nEHV-1 by detecting the A2254 (wt-EHV-1) or G2254 
(nEHV-1) polymorphism, were used by 21 participating laboratories. The three assays had 
diagnostic sensitivity (based upon correct identification of nEHV-1 samples) of 93.1% (67/72

The diagnostic specificity (based upon correct identification of non-nEHV-1 samples) was 88.9% 
(64/72 samples, Allen 2007), 72.2% (26/36 samples, Pusterla 2009), and 100% (18/18 samples,

Considerations when using PCR testing for EHV-1 
1. Testing horses with clinical signs: 
Horses with high fevers and/or other clinical signs including coughing or mild nasal 
discharge, or abortion, with or without neurologic signs, should be tested for EHV-1 by PCR, 
preferably by real time or nested PCR, if other possible causes for these signs are not 
apparent. 
2. Screening of clinically normal horses with a link to an EHV outbreak: 
The use of testing for EHV-1 in horses that are clinically normal but that have some link to an 
EHV outbreak will be discussed later. 
3. Screening of horses in the general population: 
Historically the EHV-1 test has been performed on horses as a screening test for entry to 
events and as a requirement for entry to boarding facilities or as part

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 for EHV-1 in horses that are clinically normal but that have some link to an 
EHV outbreak will be discussed later. 
3. Screening of horses in the general population: 
Historically the EHV-1 test has been performed on horses as a screening test for entry to 
events and as a requirement for entry to boarding facilities or as part of a purchase 
examination. It is not recommended that testing as described above (screening of horses in 
the general population) be performed.  Since EHV-1 is considered to be endemic in most 
horse populations and detection of the virus in nasal secretions is likely a transient 
occurrence that results in an undefinable risk for spread of disease. 
 
Necropsy of Suspect EHM Horses 
A necropsy provides an important means of confirming the presence of EHV-1 neurologic disease. 
EHM is not a zoonotic disease but consideration should be given to other diseases with the 
potential for zoonotic implications such as rabies. Thus, it is important to use appropriate biosafety 
measures during necropsy examination. It is important to necropsy suspect EHV-1 cases as there 
are documented cases of suspect EHM horses with negative ante-mortem EHV-1 test results on

neurologic disease on necropsy examination. 
Therefore, necropsy examination of a horse with neurologic disease that dies or has to be 
euthanized is recommended. To ensure appropriate samples are taken at necropsy, individuals are 
reminded to alert the pathologist of the suspect EHM status of the case and provide the neurologic 
history on the laboratory submission forms.  
Appropriate Timing of Sample Collection 
Correct selection of horses for sampling within an affected group is vital to gain the best- quality 
information for the epidemiologic investigation and disease control efforts. Samples collected 
represent a single point in time, as viral shedding changes over the course of the infection. Viral 
shedding from the respiratory tract of adult horses is detectable typically for less than 10 days and 
may be intermittent. The optimal window for nasal swab sampling is at the onset of clinical signs. In 
some situations, where initial testing was negative for EHV-1 but EHV infection is suspected as the

cause of disease, it is recommended to repeat sampling within 2 to 4 days of onset of clinical signs. 
The amount of EHV-1 DNA detected in nasal swabs varies from horse to horse and over the course 
of disease in a given animal and does not necessarily correlate with the severity of disease.

Recommended Horses to Test during an EHM Incident 
1. Suspect Index EHM Horses: Highly suggestive EHM case, defined as a horse displaying 
signs of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, including but not limited to hindlimb 
incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary bladder atony which may or may 
not have been preceded by fever, respiratory signs and/or abortion in other horses on the 
premises. 
 
2. Suspect EHM Horses: An exposed horse displaying signs suggestive of EHM including, but 
not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary bladder 
atony during the 14 days prior to the index EHM case developing clinical signs and/or 14 
days after last potential exposure to a confirmed EHM case. 
 
3. Suspect EHV-1 Horses: An exposed horse that shows no neurologic signs, but displays 
some of the clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection; these may include fever (rectal 
temperature greater than 101.5 degrees F), limb edema, abortion, or nasal discharge 
during the 14 days after initial exposure to a confirmed EHM case. Testing of these horses 
is recommended but not necessary as long as the index EHM case has been confirmed. 
Horses not tested will remain suspects and should NOT be included in the confirmed case 
count. 
4. Testing of Non-clinical E

 limb edema, abortion, or nasal discharge 
during the 14 days after initial exposure to a confirmed EHM case. Testing of these horses 
is recommended but not necessary as long as the index EHM case has been confirmed. 
Horses not tested will remain suspects and should NOT be included in the confirmed case 
count. 
4. Testing of Non-clinical EHV-1 Horses: A decision to test these horses for disease 
investigation or quarantine release purposes must be carefully considered. Non-clinical 
horses can be shedders of EHV-1 virus. Specific recommendations regarding the risk these 
horses pose is lacking in the scientific literature. If performed, a planned response to test-
positive non-clinical horses should be established prior to testing such horses. 
NOTE: There is no indication to test horses not epidemiologically linked to the disease 
investigation or generally as a part of the quarantine procedure.

Factors Impacting Decision to Test Exposed Horses 
NOTE: If tests are planned, a plan of how to handle the test results must be determined in 
advance. 
1. Testing of exposed horses may not be required by regulatory officials if: 
a. There is an ability to mitigate further exposure risk by immediate removal of the 
EHM horse or adequate isolation and biosecurity practices of the EHM horse   from 
all other horses on the premises; 
b. There are no additional clinical cases detected during the 21 day period after initial

c. Epidemiologic investigation provides confidence in owner/ management 
monitoring of the situation through demonstration of twice daily body temperature 
logs, daily clinical assessments, and observance of strict isolation protocols for sick 
horses for the duration of the quarantine. 
 
2. Testing of exposed horses may be required by regulatory officials if: 
a. Premises management fails to adequately isolate the index EHM case within 12 
hours of detection. This will result in continued exposure risk to horses on the 
premises; 
-OR- 
b. There are exposed horses on premises without adequate isolation from clinical 
horses. Testing may be necessary to determine disease risk;

c. Epidemiologic investigation reveals evidence of poor compliance including but not 
limited to lack of twice daily body temperature monitoring of potentially exposed 
horses, failure to isolate sick horses, and/or continued sharing of equipment 
between sick and other horses.

EHV-1 PCR Test Interpretation of a Clinical Horse* 
NOTE: A positive PCR test on a nasopharyngeal/nasal swab sample does NOT necessarily equate 
to presence of infective virus. 
• A positive EHV-1 result from a buffy coat sample indicates viremia and an active infection. 
• A negative EHV-1 test result on a buffy coat sample indicates the absence of detectable 
EHV-1 viremia at the time of sampling. 
• A positive EHV-1 test result from a nasal swab sample should be interpreted as detection 
of EHV-1 DNA in the nasal secretions. EHV-1 DNA can be detected during and subsequent 
to the period of shedding infective virus. Quantitative PCR (i.e. real-time

iremia at the time of sampling. 
• A positive EHV-1 test result from a nasal swab sample should be interpreted as detection 
of EHV-1 DNA in the nasal secretions. EHV-1 DNA can be detected during and subsequent 
to the period of shedding infective virus. Quantitative PCR (i.e. real-time PCR) may provide 
more information about the risk of virus transmission by the sampled horse. 
•  A negative EHV-1 test result on a nasal swab indicates the absence of detectable virus 
shedding at the time of sampling; provided appropriate sample collection, sample handling 
prior to shipment and sample shipping protocols were followed. 
*Interpretation of the PCR test in the non-clinical animal is similar to the clinical animal, however 
the implications of the transmission risk is unknown at this time. 
 
Recommended Protocols for Sample Collection 
These are current recommendations: 
1. Make contact with the laboratory where samples are to be submitted to obtain supplies 
(swabs and transport medium) and laboratory specific sampling and shipping protocols. 
2. Be sure to avoid cross contamination by wearing a new pair of examination gloves to collect 
samples from each horse and perform hand hygiene between horses sampled. Barrier 
precautions such as wearing disposable gown or coveralls and boot/shoe covers should be 
observed. These should be changed when sampling horses of different disease status e.g. 
clinical cases versus potentially exposed horses. 
3. If a chain over the nose or a twitch is used to restrain a horse, it must be washed and 
disinfected between horses. 
4. A dedicated halter and lead should be used for each horse or these items washed and 
disinfected between individual animals.

disinfected between horses. 
4. A dedicated halter and lead should be used for each horse or these items washed and 
disinfected between individual animals. 
5. Nasal swabs should be collected using Dacron tipped swab (Synthetic) with plastic shaft 
(Don’t use wooden shaft or cotton tipped swabs) 
6. Insert the swab at least 5 inches into the nasal passage and leave swab against the nasal 
mucosa for a minimum of 15 seconds before withdrawal. 
7. Remove and place swab in a sterile tube (no anticoagulant or gel) or preferably in a tube with 
viral transport medium. To prevent over-dilution of the sample less than 2 ml of transport 
fluid should be utilized. Label sample according to laboratory instructions. 
8. Collect 10ml of whole blood in EDTA (purple top tube) and label sample with animal 
name and date and time of collection. Do not send serum for PCR testing. 
9. Keep samples cool (refrigerator/ice pack) but not frozen and ship nasal swabs and whole 
blood samples overnight to laboratory. 
10. Consider direct communication with the laboratory to expedite obtaining results in the most 
timely manner.

QUARANTINE PLACEMENT 
Overview 
There is no universal quarantine protocol that can be applied to all EHM incidents as there are 
multiple factors that must be considered when determining the optimal disease containment 
response. A disease transmission risk assessment is the critical first step in determining the extent 
of a quarantine. Once EHM is confirmed, in those states with quarantine authority, a quarantine 
should be applied in all situations. Additionally, risk assessment identifies specific factors that will 
need to be addressed in establishing the quarantine(s) parameters and required biosecurity 
measures on operations with exposed horses. 
 
In preparation for a disease incident, any equine event or large equine facility should identify an 
appropriate isolation area(s) for clinical and /or exposed animals. Isolation areas on site and off site 
should be identified in advance, including medical facilities with appropriate isolation areas where 
clinical cases could be referred for medical treatment. It cannot be overstated the importance of 
this preplanning preparation. 
 
In dealing with EHM incidents, state animal health officials may issue quarantines to prevent the 
spread of the disease agent, specifically EHV- 1. Science- based criteria for quarantine protocols 
adapted to the specific incident, control disease spread while increasing compliance and minimizing 
the impact on equine movement. Historically, quarantine issuance is by the state veterinary 
authority or horse racing boards. However, in some EHM incidents voluntary quarantine actions are 
taken by private farms, public or private facilities, veterinary teaching hospitals and private 
practitioners for the purpose of controlling the disease.  
Some states have the authority to place “hold” or “stop movement” orders

 issuance is by the state veterinary 
authority or horse racing boards. However, in some EHM incidents voluntary quarantine actions are 
taken by private farms, public or private facilities, veterinary teaching hospitals and private 
practitioners for the purpose of controlling the disease.  
Some states have the authority to place “hold” or “stop movement” orders which may be imposed 
while gathering epidemiological data to determine the necessity and proper placement of a 
quarantine. 
 
Before implementing a quarantine, the criteria for quarantine release need to be established. To 
ensure compliance and to determine the effectiveness of disease control measures, the quarantine-
issuing authority should arrange for a regulatory official or their designee to monitor the situation 
through periodic on-site visits to the premises. Disease transmission, as evidenced by newly 
identified clinical cases, would warrant modification of the quarantine-site biosecurity protocols. 
Additionally, if spread occurs beyond the initial quarantine sites, then additional regulatory 
authorities may need to be contacted and the quarantine may need to be extended or applied to 
additional sites.

Impact of Quarantine on the Equine Industry 
Compliance and cooperation from individuals and the equine industry is essential if EHM is to be 
successfully controlled. The potential impact of any quarantine on the equine industry or individuals 
needs to be balanced with the goal of disease containment. Business continuity must be taken into 
consideration to ensure the equine industry can be supported through an EHM incident. Issuance of 
an extended quarantine period on multiple premises with a low risk of disease development may be 
considered an excessive burden and may be unnecessary for effective disease containment.

an extended quarantine period on multiple premises with a low risk of disease development may be 
considered an excessive burden and may be unnecessary for effective disease containment. 
Situational awareness and science-based disease prevention guidance from animal health officials 
will garner increased confidence among industry stakeholders and will serve to increase compliance 
and implementation of voluntary disease control measures. 
 
Issuance of a Quarantine 
The scope of any premises based quarantine that is to be implemented should be based on the 
results of the risk assessment following the identification of a suspect or confirmed index EHM 
case(s). It may include any of the following scenarios:   
1) Only the suspect index or confirmed index EHM horse is quarantined;  
2) The suspect index or confirmed index EHM horse and horses with high risk of exposure on index 
EHM premises are quarantined;  
3) All horses on the EHM index premises are quarantined;   
4) Entire index premises and horses with high risk of exposure that are located on other than the 
index premises are quarantined; and  
5) An epidemiologically linked non-clinical test positive case is quarantined.   
 
EHV-1 Risk Assessment for Purposes of Determining Scope of Quarantine 
EHV-1 is spread by direct horse to horse contact as well as indirectly by virus-contaminated fomites 
and personnel. The most common route of exposure is through the respiratory tract via aerosolized 
droplets from the respiratory tract secretions of a virus shedding horse.

1 Risk Assessment for Purposes of Determining Scope of Quarantine 
EHV-1 is spread by direct horse to horse contact as well as indirectly by virus-contaminated fomites 
and personnel. The most common route of exposure is through the respiratory tract via aerosolized 
droplets from the respiratory tract secretions of a virus shedding horse. 
 
Infection can also occur by oral or nasal exposure to virus contaminated surfaces. Examples include 
hands, clothing, and equipment such as wipe rags, buckets, water sources, feeders, stall surfaces 
and tack. Clinically affected horses should be assumed to be contagious, particularly with respect to 
respiratory secretions, for at least 14 days. Aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and placental fluids 
also contain large quantities of infective virus and thus pose a particularly high disease transmission 
risk. 
 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  20 
Revised January 2018 
An assessment is critical in order to identify current disease agent transmission risk factors on an 
affected premises. Identifying the risks for disease agent transmission can assist in determining the 
required quarantine protocols. 
1. STEP 1: Assessment of Risk Associated with the Index EHM Case: At the time of the initial 
testing, the contagious nature of the index EHM horse should be evaluated in terms of 
potential for shedding EHV-1 and potential spread of virus from this horse to other horses 
(exposure risk to other horses). 
a. Potential to Shed EHV-1: A PCR test result from a horse’s nasopharyngeal/nasal 
swab that the laboratory indicates correlates with a high viral load categorizes that 
horse as a high risk for transmission of EHV-1 to
Text Len: 1698
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 from this horse to other horses 
(exposure risk to other horses). 
a. Potential to Shed EHV-1: A PCR test result from a horse’s nasopharyngeal/nasal 
swab that the laboratory indicates correlates with a high viral load categorizes that 
horse as a high risk for transmission of EHV-1 to other horses. A clinical EHV- 1 or 
EHM horse with this finding would pose a significant risk of virus shedding into the 
environment. 
 
b. Assessment of the Potential of an EHM Horse to Expose Other Horses: A clinical 
EHV-1 or EHM case which remains on the premises poses significant risk of 
exposure to other equids on the property as it continues to shed virus. A clinical 
EHM horse that is euthanized, appropriately removed, or isolated at onset of 
neurologic signs represents less disease exposure risk to the herd as the source of 
virus has been removed. Appropriate isolation includes restricted access to other 
horses (a minimum of 30 feet, recognizing the distance may need to be greater 
depending upon ventilation, air movement, barn/stall design and other biosecurity 
factors), avoiding the sharing of equipment and/or personnel and utilization of 
protective barrier precautions. A clinical EHM case that is down and thrashing in a 
stall poses a significant virus transmission risk as it requires additional personnel for 
its management compared to a non-neurologic horse and has the potential for 
hyperventilation; all of which may result in a potentially higher risk of 
contamination of the environment. Direct or indirect contact between horses, 
treatment personnel or fomites increases the potential exposure of other horses to 
EHV-1.

its management compared to a non-neurologic horse and has the potential for 
hyperventilation; all of which may result in a potentially higher risk of 
contamination of the environment. Direct or indirect contact between horses, 
treatment personnel or fomites increases the potential exposure of other horses to 
EHV-1. 
 
A Quarantine Risk Assessment Chart assists in determining level of risk posed by the 
index case (See Appendix). A quarantine restricted to the index horse may be 
sufficient, if the index horse poses a low risk of viral shedding and/or is 
appropriately isolated from other horses on the premises. A more extensive 
premises level quarantine may be warranted if the index horse demonstrates a high 
level of viral shedding and has extensive direct and/or indirect contact with other 
horses on the Index EHM premises. 
 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  21 
Revised January 2018 
2. STEP 2: Assessment of Exposure Risk within the Herd: At the time of initial confirmation 
of the index EHM case, the rest of the herd should be classified according to the degree of 
exposure and their ability to transmit virus within the herd. Animals exposed to a large 
amount of the virus are more likely to succumb to infection and/or pose a transmission 
risk to other horses on the premises. These higher risk animals may warrant quarantine 
and monitoring for fever or other clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection. 
 
a. Degree of Exposure to EHM Case: An exposed horse is one which is likely to have 
had direct or indirect contact with an EHM case (this includes shared transport 
exposure) within the previous 14 days. Highest risk animals are those with direct 
nose to nose contact with the
Text Len: 1732
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 other clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection. 
 
a. Degree of Exposure to EHM Case: An exposed horse is one which is likely to have 
had direct or indirect contact with an EHM case (this includes shared transport 
exposure) within the previous 14 days. Highest risk animals are those with direct 
nose to nose contact with the EHM case during the peak shedding period which is 
defined as the 7-day period before or after the onset of clinical signs. Moderate risk 
horses are those sharing a common air space of the clinical case or those, 
equipment, or personnel with direct contact with the EHM case. Animals on the 
premises with limited indirect or direct exposure to the index horse would be 
considered a low/negligible risk for exposure and may not warrant any quarantine 
action. Determining the level of exposure assists in deciding the scope of the 
quarantine to be applied. (See Appendix: Exposure Risk Assessment) 
 
b. Degree of Biosecurity in Place Prior to and at Time of Detection of Index Case: 
Disease risk cannot be completely eliminated at most equine premises, as equine 
premises are seldom managed as a closed facility. An evaluation of current 
management practices will help identify potential biosecurity risks to be addressed 
in the quarantine. Areas to be evaluated include management practices, horse 
stalls, isolation area, wash stalls, commingling areas, equipment handling, transport 
vehicles, and hay and other feed storage facilities. Premises with minimal 
biosecurity protocols in place are more likely to have disease transmission and thus 
warrant a more restrictive quarantine than a premises with a high level of 
biosecurity practices. The degree and level of commonly practiced/everyday

ling areas, equipment handling, transport 
vehicles, and hay and other feed storage facilities. Premises with minimal 
biosecurity protocols in place are more likely to have disease transmission and thus 
warrant a more restrictive quarantine than a premises with a high level of 
biosecurity practices. The degree and level of commonly practiced/everyday 
biosecurity measures will significantly impact disease exposure risk on any given 
premises. Movement of personnel such as veterinarians, farriers, visitors, feed and 
bedding deliverers, and stall cleaners between areas where horses are housed 
constitute a potential risk of disease agent transmission. Therefore, the potential 
spread of EHV-1 due to these movements should be evaluated. A Biosecurity Risk 
Assessment determines the level of risk posed by current biosecurity practices on 
the premises. (See  Appendix: Sample Assessment Form)

c. Degree of Disease Agent Transmission: As the disease incident progresses, the 
situation should be evaluated to determine the level of disease agent transmission. 
Exposed horses on the premises may succumb to disease and present an additional 
disease transmission risk. Evaluate subsequent cases to determine potential time of 
exposure. Modify existing quarantine protocols if disease spread is evidenced by 
new cases with clinical disease after quarantine placement.

d. Assessment of Transmission via Testing at Onset of Investigation: There is a lack 
of consensus among regulatory veterinarians on the appropriateness of testing 
non-clinical exposed horses in an EHM incident. If testing of exposed non-clinical 
horses is being considered, then the response to a positive test result should be 
decided before initiating the testing. Non-clinical EHV-1 infected horses based on 
nasal swab and/or buffy coat testing, currently represent a non- quantifiable but 
potential risk of transmitting virus to horses to which they are exposed. As a 
precaution to minimize the risk of virus spread in any given EHM incident, non-
clinical exposed EHV-1 test positive horses should be isolated from non-clinical test 
negative and untested exposed horses.

QUARANTINE RELEASE 
Overview 
During Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) incidents, the quarantine issuing authority 
(typically the state animal health officials or horse racing authority) issue quarantines and 
subsequent releases to help prevent the spread of EHV-1. However, in some EHM incidents, 
voluntary quarantine actions are taken by private farms, public or private entities, veterinary 
teaching hospitals, horse racing authorities or private practitioners. Criteria for implementing a 
quarantine and for quarantine release should be established and each incident assessed based on 
predetermined guidelines. It must be emphasized that there is no single quarantine

-1. However, in some EHM incidents, 
voluntary quarantine actions are taken by private farms, public or private entities, veterinary 
teaching hospitals, horse racing authorities or private practitioners. Criteria for implementing a 
quarantine and for quarantine release should be established and each incident assessed based on 
predetermined guidelines. It must be emphasized that there is no single quarantine release 
protocol that is applicable to all EHM incidents. When striving for optimal disease containment, 
multiple factors must be considered based on the risk assessment performed when placing the 
quarantine. 
 
Clinically affected horses should be assumed to be contagious, particularly via the respiratory route, 
for at least 14 days. Minimal monitoring or quarantine of exposed horses should be for a minimum 
of 14 days after removal and isolation of the EHM horse. Quarantines can be amended to release 
subpopulations of animals earlier if epidemiologic investigation, biosecurity assessment and/or, the 
results of diagnostic testing deem the risk is minimal from the release of a horse or group of horses. 
 
Assessment of the level of clinical disease and the potential for disease spread on the premises is 
critical in determining whether quarantine release is warranted. Release of the quarantine can be 
based on the clinical disease status of the horses on the premises and on the outcome of diagnostic 
testing. 
 
21 Day Quarantine Release without Testing 
Release of quarantine shall be based on limiting the potential for spread of the disease agent. 
Immediate removal or appropriate isolation of EHM case(s) decreases the risk of virus transmission 
and spread within the population at potential risk of exposure. Appropriate isolation includes 
restricted access to other horses (a minimum of 30 feet, recognizing it may be greater depending

Immediate removal or appropriate isolation of EHM case(s) decreases the risk of virus transmission 
and spread within the population at potential risk of exposure. Appropriate isolation includes 
restricted access to other horses (a minimum of 30 feet, recognizing it may be greater depending 
upon ventilation, air movement, barn/stall design and other biosecurity factors), avoiding the 
sharing of equipment or personnel and utilization of protective barrier precautions. Diagnostic 
testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs can help provide evidence of the risk of disease spread 
within an exposed population. However, financial constraints and the challenges of scientifically 
based interpretation of risk when dealing with a test positive non-clinical horses limit the benefits 
of diagnostic testing. Accordingly, quarantine release without testing can be an option and is based 
on the clinical disease status on the premises. Any additional horses developing clinical signs 
compatible with EHV-1 infection and diagnosed within the 14 days post strict isolation or removal

of an EHM case may be indicative of disease spread on the premises. Strict isolation of EHV-1 
clinical cases must include absolutely no horse to horse contact, no sharing of any equipment, strict 
adherence to footwear disinfection at entry/exit to stabling area and use of disposable coveralls 
and gloves. 
 
Quarantine release is recommended, if adequate biosecurity and monitoring has been maintained 
and if no new clinical cases (EHM or EHV-1 cases) are identified in the 21 days from the date of 
removal of the EHM case(s) or 21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case placed in isolation

Quarantine release is recommended, if adequate biosecurity and monitoring has been maintained 
and if no new clinical cases (EHM or EHV-1 cases) are identified in the 21 days from the date of 
removal of the EHM case(s) or 21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case placed in isolation 
or the 21 days from the onset of clinical signs in the last neurologic horse placed in isolation on the 
premises. Monitoring of the exposed population for any clinical signs compatible with EHV-1 
infection includes twice daily temperature monitoring and direct observation for compatible clinical 
signs. Any horses subsequently displaying compatible clinical signs of EHV-1 infection including but 
not limited to fever should be immediately isolated and it should be assumed this is a new EHV-1 
case, unless diagnostic testing rules out EHV-1 infection and another non-contagious cause of fever 
is found the countdown clock for quarantine release should begin again at 21 days. 
 
Note, a 14 day quarantine release for exposed horses may be considered when there is immediate 
removal (within 12 hours) of the index EHM case and there is evidence of limited potential for 
disease agent spread due to adequate biosecurity and monitoring of horses. 
 
Quarantine Release with Testing 
Testing of clinical horses for release of quarantine may shorten the quarantine period. Testing only

 an individual horse on the day of sampling. Positive results could reflect 
reactivation of latent infection or recent exposure. A positive EHV-1 test results warrants further 
investigation to determine if further virus spread is occurring on a premises. If virus spread is 
evident, the quarantine should remain in place. Negative test results from nasal swab and buffy 
coat samples may warrant release of the quarantine. Exposed and clinical horses may be tested 14- 
21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case or from the onset of signs in the last neurologic 
horse in assessing the infection status of a premises. 
 
There is a lack of consensus among regulatory veterinarians on the appropriateness of testing 
exposed non-clinical horses. The interpretation of such results based on existing scientific risk 
assessments is problematic. This is because the non-clinical horses that tests positive for EHV-1 on 
nasopharyngeal swab and/or buffy coat, currently represents a non-quantifiable but potential risk 
of transmitting virus to other horses to which it is exposed. 
 
As a precaution and to minimize the risk of disease spread in any given EHM incident, any EHV-1 
test positive horse should be isolated from test negative and non-clinical exposed horses.

 Testing Results for Quarantine Modification or Release 
1. Testing of Confirmed EHV-1 Clinical Horses: A confirmed EHM case or EHV-1 case with two 
subsequent PCR negative nasal swab and/or buffy coat samples obtained 7 days apart is 
considered to pose a minimal disease transmission risk, thus quarantine release is 
recommended. Note, a minimum of 14 days under quarantine is recommended. 
2. Testing of Exposed Non- Clinical Horses: There is a lack of consensus among regulatory 
veterinarians on the appropriateness of testing these non-clinical exposed horses. Testing of 
exposed horses 14 to 21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case or from the onset 
of the last neurologic signs in a horse may be utilized to assess infection status among 
horses on the premises. Any virus positive horse(s) should be promptly removed from the 
group and isolated until confirmed negative on nasal swab and buffy coat PCR testing, or in 
the absence of testing, an adequate period in quarantine before release. As for the 
remaining animals in the exposed group, the clock has to be reset in terms of the period 
they are held in quarantine since one or more of them may have been exposed to the virus 
and may become a shedder.

EHM INVESTIGATION GUIDELINES 
 
Introduction 
In preparation for an EHM investigation, review the biosecurity and diagnostic testing 
recommendations in previous sections of this document.  
When conducting an EHM incident investigation it is helpful to first identify the five “W’s”: which, 
what, where, when, and why?  
• Which is the suspect EHM horse? The age, breed, use, EHV-1 vaccination status and clinical 
signs are important details to record.  
• What is the clinical presentation, the status of the diagnostic testing and physical 
examination? What is the disease agent? The diagnostic test results are essential in 
confirming an EHM diagnosis and determining the case designation category.  
• Where is the EHM horse currently located and where has it recently been? The location of 
the index horse at time of diagnosis and all locations of the index horse for the two weeks 
prior to onset of clinical signs are critical components to the investigation.  
• When did the initial clinical sign(s) appear? Determination of disease onset or exposure date 
is critical to evaluating risks to exposed horses.  
• Why did this/these horse(s) succumb to the disease? Researchers are trying to determine 
why some horses become neurologic while others exposed to EHV-1 don’t. Thus the 
epidemiologic investigation and data collection for all confirmed cases is critical.  
 
Once the basic information on the index horse or the affected animals is obtained, the objective of 
the investigation is to identify the disease transmission risk factors on the premises, so that they 
can be targeted in any control and prevention plan. The most common transmission route is via the

epidemiologic investigation and data collection for all confirmed cases is critical.  
 
Once the basic information on the index horse or the affected animals is obtained, the objective of 
the investigation is to identify the disease transmission risk factors on the premises, so that they 
can be targeted in any control and prevention plan. The most common transmission route is via the 
respiratory tract by aerosolized droplets of respiratory secretions. Infection is spread by direct 
horse-to-horse contact, as well as indirectly by contaminated surfaces or objects including 
personnel. Environmental transmission of the disease agent of primary concern during an outbreak 
can occur especially when horses are kept in close confinement. Environmental persistence of the 
EHV-1 virus is estimated to be less than 7 days under most conditions with a maximum 
environmental survival of 30 days. Once the EHM incident investigation identifies the risk factors 
for exposure, control measures must be implemented to 1.) Limit the extent of spread and possibly, 
severity of clinical disease on the premises and 2.) Limit the spread of disease to adjacent or 
exposed premises. (See Appendix: EHM Case Investigation Form and Exposed/Trace Horse 
Investigation Form.)

5. Utilize premises biosecurity assessment to identify biosecurity risks to be addressed in 
quarantine.  
6. Be knowledgeable of relevant local, state or other authority jurisdictions and any reporting 
obligations.  
7. Initiate control and prevention measures based on assessment to prevent spread of disease 
agent.  
8. Provide general biosecurity recommendations to the exposed and quarantined premises.  
9. Complete and report all information to appropriate authorities or designated points of 
contact for the incident (where should the report(s) be sent).  
10. Identify and investigate trace-outs and trace-ins of exposed horses to determine appropriate 
regulatory action.

Revised January 2018 
GENERAL BIOSECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EHM EXPOSED AND 
QUARANTINED PREMISES 
1. Isolate any clinical cases as soon as they are identified 
a. Isolation is critical to controlling disease. Ideally, at the onset of suspicion of a 
compatible clinical sign of EHV -1 infection, isolate the affected horse a minimum of 30 
feet from all other horses and potentially further depending on multiple factors 
previously described in these guidelines. Appropriate diagnostics should be utilized to 
determine cause of compatible clinical signs. (For sample collection and diagnostics 
selection see Diagnostic Testing section of this document) 
b. Restrict contact with horses to those designated personnel. If possible, assign specific 
personnel to work on positive or suspect cases. Ideally, these designated individuals 
should not handle any other horses on the property. 
c. Place a footwear disinfectant station and hand sanitizer outside each isolation stall. 
Provide disposable gloves for designated personnel to wear when handling EHV-1 test 
positive or suspect EHV-1/EHM horses. 
d. Restrict access to the isolation area to essential personnel and the isolated animals. 
e. Handle isolated horses last; personnel handling isolated horses should not be handling 
other horses without changing clothes. Provide disposable coveralls for use if a change 
of clothes is not feasible when entering and exiting the isolation area. 
f. Clean and disinfect the stabling area where the EHV-1 test positive or suspect EHV- 
1/EHM horse has been. 
 
2. Quarantine 
a. Quarantine of the premises means that there should be no horse movement on or off 
the premises

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 clothes is not feasible when entering and exiting the isolation area. 
f. Clean and disinfect the stabling area where the EHV-1 test positive or suspect EHV- 
1/EHM horse has been. 
 
2. Quarantine 
a. Quarantine of the premises means that there should be no horse movement on or off 
the premises. 
b. Post signage regarding quarantine and biosecurity measures in common areas, such as 
on the notice board outside the office, near restrooms and at entry areas to each barn. 
c. Communicate the current quarantine situation to all horse owners and trainers at the 
facility. 
d. Limit premises access to essential personnel and vehicles and monitor perimeter of the 
premises for non-authorized entries. 
 
3. Monitor all horses on premises 
a. Obtain and record the body temperatures of all horses on the premises twice daily. 
Ideally obtain horse’s body temperature first thing in the morning and last thing in the 
evening and before administering medications which may decrease the body 
temperature. 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  29 
Revised January 2018 
b. Report a fever (any temperature of 101.5°F or greater) to a veterinarian for follow up 
collection of nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs and blood to test for EHV-1. 
c. Monitor all horses for clinical signs compatible with EHV-1 infection, which include 
ocular or nasal discharge, limb edema, abortion and neurologic signs such as unsteady 
gait, weakness, urine dribbling, lack of tail tone and recumbency. Report the observation 
of any of these signs to the veterinarian designated for follow up collection of

gait, weakness, urine dribbling, lack of tail tone and recumbency. Report the observation 
of any of these signs to the veterinarian designated for follow up collection of 
nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs and blood sampling to test for EHV-1. 
 
4. Restrict human, pet and vehicle traffic from exposed-horse areas 
a. Restrict personnel access to only those necessary for the care of the exposed horses. 
b. Do not permit dogs in horse areas. Dogs have the potential to carry the virus from one 
area to another on their body. 
c. Restrict vehicle traffic including feed/supply delivery vehicles, from entering horse 
stabling areas.  Designate an area where vehicles should be parked away from the stable 
area. 
d. For extended quarantine situations, farriers and other service provider personnel should 
take appropriate biosecurity measures as outlined in this section to reduce risk of 
spreading the virus. 
 
5. Limit direct horse-to-horse contact 
a. Limit potential horse contact in common areas, such as wash stalls, aisle ways and 
arenas. 
b. Limit potential horse-to-horse contact when possible by closing upper stall doors or 
installing a physical barrier to restrict horses from extending their heads into the aisle 
ways. 
 
6. Limit stress to horses 
a. An EHV-1 exposed horse may potentially be incubating the virus. With stress, an exposed 
horse has a higher likelihood of developing clinical disease and shedding a significant 
amount of virus from the respiratory tract. 
b. Any decision

 to restrict horses from extending their heads into the aisle 
ways. 
 
6. Limit stress to horses 
a. An EHV-1 exposed horse may potentially be incubating the virus. With stress, an exposed 
horse has a higher likelihood of developing clinical disease and shedding a significant 
amount of virus from the respiratory tract. 
b. Any decision regarding management of exposed horses should balance the need to 
contain the disease agent spread with the stress that would occur based on 
management imposed on exposed horses. For example, at race tracks exercise of 
exposed but non-clinical horses is allowed after all other horses have trained and been 
removed from the track since regular exercise of race horses is very important to their 
wellbeing.

7. Eliminate sharing of equipment and personnel 
a. Clean and disinfect all brushes, halters, cross ties, lead ropes and tack which have 
previously been shared. 
b. Avoid use of common halters, cross ties, lead ropes, wipe rags, sponges and tack. Use 
individual equipment for each horse; avoid sharing equipment. 
c. If equipment must be shared, clean and disinfect all equipment before and after each 
use. This includes feed buckets and other feeding and stall cleaning utensils. 
d. Avoid tying horses to fences or tie rails. 
e. Avoid possible viral contamination of water buckets by not allowing the hose to enter or 
contact the bucket when filling the bucket with water. 
f. Designate traffic pattern for wheeled vehicles (i.e. tractors, gators, wheelbarrow etc.) 
used for handling hay, feed, shavings or supplies to limit disease

e. Avoid possible viral contamination of water buckets by not allowing the hose to enter or 
contact the bucket when filling the bucket with water. 
f. Designate traffic pattern for wheeled vehicles (i.e. tractors, gators, wheelbarrow etc.) 
used for handling hay, feed, shavings or supplies to limit disease spread. 
8. Clean and Disinfect 
a. Clean all barn, other stabling, trailer, or other equine contact surfaces thoroughly, 
removing all organic matter (dirt, nasal secretions, uneaten feed, manure, etc.) before 
applying a disinfectant. It is important to remember that organic material decreases the 
effectiveness of the disinfectant, especially if 10% bleach is used as the disinfectant. 
b. Clean all shared equipment and shared areas to remove dirt and manure before 
application of a disinfectant.  
c. Completely clean and disinfect the stall surfaces of the known-infected horse and any 
equipment and objects that may be contaminated. Properly dispose of potentially 
contaminated materials generated by the cleaning and disinfection process. 
 
9. Use footwear disinfectant, hand sanitizer   
a. Place footwear disinfection stations and hand sanitizers at other strategic locations, 
throughout the barn areas and encourage their use. 
b. Encourage regular cleaning of footwear disinfection stations and ensure use of 
footwear disinfection stations upon entry and exit of infected animal stalls. 
c. Routinely clean footwear disinfection stations to avoid buildup of organic material, 
such as dirt and manure, which may inactivate the disinfectant. 
d. Assign a person to monitor the footwear disinfection station and promptly clean and 
replenish the disinfectant as needed.

10.  Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Isolated Horses (an excellent training module 
on PPE for veterinarians can be accessed at the following link—module #10): 
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/ct_aast 
a. Assign a person knowledgeable on infection disease protocols to oversee isolated sick 
horse stabling.  This person shall ensure proper donning and doffing of PPE.  
b.  Reusable coveralls should be clean upon entry into isolated stabling and should be used 
for a single designated animal. Re-use of coveralls should be permitted provided there is 
limited contamination of outer surface.  
c.  Disposable coveralls should only be used for handling one infected horse and can be re-
used provided they have limited amount of contamination and are stored in a manner to 
prevent virus spread.  
d. Coveralls being reused should be stored properly to limit contamination and transfer of 
virus.  
e. Disposable coveralls should be dedicated to one individual and not shared amongst 
personnel.  
f. Outerwear should be donned in a manner which prevents contamination of inner or 
outer surfaces. Ideally,

d. Coveralls being reused should be stored properly to limit contamination and transfer of 
virus.  
e. Disposable coveralls should be dedicated to one individual and not shared amongst 
personnel.  
f. Outerwear should be donned in a manner which prevents contamination of inner or 
outer surfaces. Ideally, outwear should be donned in a clean dry ground surface (i.e. 
pavement). 
g. Excessively soiled or ripped disposable coveralls should be properly disposed to limit 
virus spread.  
h. For specifics regarding PPE supplies, please see attached chart on the following page. 
 
11. Bedding from isolated horses. Soiled bedding can contain infectious virus. 
a. Dedicated cleaning equipment should be maintained for each stall/horse. 
b. Disposal of soiled bedding should be handled in such a manner as to limit 
access/exposure to other horses, barns and structures on the premises. 
NOTE: 
Isolation of all mules away from horses may be an important strategy in EHV-1 disease control 
during an EHM incident. Recent scientific studies have investigated the role of mules as silent 
shedders of EHV-1 during an EHM incident. During a 2011 EHV-1 disease investigation involving 
mules and horses in California, high viral nasal shedding and viremia was detected in some of the 
asymptomatic mules. It is important to note that the detection of EHV-1 in asymptomatic mule 
samples indicates their susceptibility to infection and their potential role in virus spread.

EHM INCIDENT COMMUNICATION  
Overview 
Equine Herpesvirus- 1 neurologic disease or equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is a 
topic about which a great deal of information/misinformation continues to be posted on websites, 
blogs, Facebook postings, Twitter and Instagram. With the increasing popularity of social media, the 
need for timely and accurate communication during any EHV-1 incident is critical. Stakeholders 
have recognized the need for accurate, clear, consistent information in order to make well informed 
decisions about equine health management. When factual information is lacking, misinformation 
can spread quickly creating unnecessary anxiety among equine owners and others in the industry. 
For successful communications during an EHM incident, media training for individuals involved in 
EHV-1 messaging is strongly recommended. Risk communications training provides insight into the 
key W’s that need to be addressed in disease incident communications. 
 
It is recommended that state animal health officials should establish a communication plan for an 
EHM incident well in advance of the incident. Appropriate contacts with industry, other state 
equine officials and federal resources should be made prior to the event of an incident. Drafting 
content for webpages, alerts and printed outreach materials prior to an incident will facilitate 
timely dissemination of accurate and useful information during the incident. State animal health 
officials should explore all modes of communication and utilize effective resources for 
communicating information. 
 
To Whom to Communicate?

 animal health 
officials should explore all modes of communication and utilize effective resources for 
communicating information. 
 
To Whom to Communicate? 
Initial communication during an EHM incident starts with the index premises. To encourage 
cooperation of all parties at the onset of the incident, face-to-face meetings between the facility 
owner(s), event manager(s), and horse owners/trainers on facilities with multiple horse owners 
such as boarding facilities or racetracks, practicing veterinarians and the state animal health official 
are highly recommended. Inclusion of the regulatory officials in the communication process helps to 
give the perspective of “we are in it together” for the welfare of the horse and the industry. All 
communication should target those impacted by the EHM incident, such as the individual horse 
owners, whose concern may be centered on how the disease occurrence affects their horse(s) and 
the economic impact from possible animal losses and restrictions on movement. 
 
Once communications have taken place with the responsible person(s) on the index premises, 
information should be more widely disseminated to the equine industry at large to include but not 
limited to contacting the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) 
(www.equinediseasecc.org).

Delay in communications will allow time for rumors to develop and spread. It is recommended that 
state animal health officials develop a communication network for dissemination of equine disease 
alert information within their states. Some states have successfully used email lists to distribute and 
alert key equine industry representatives and equine practitioners in the state. Those alerted 
should in turn disseminate the information to their respective constituents. An email notification 
system ensures a reliable source is providing a consistent message for the state. In addition to email 
alters, state animal health webpages and social media sites can host the most current factual 
information. States with large event facilities should consider a notification system for event 
facilities including race tracks.

Timeliness of communication is critical. However, it is essential to first consider the need to 
communicate the information. For example, a single horse out on pasture that has never left the 
premises and has no potential to expose another horse may not warrant communication to the 
entire equine industry as there is minimal risk outside of the horse’s index premises. However, a 
horse displaying neurologic signs five days after participating at a large national horse show along 
with a history of a fever preceding the development of neurologic signs, that has been confirmed 
positive test for EHV-1, presents a significant risk and warrants widespread dissemination of 
information on the status of the situation. 
 
It is recommended that communications with the industry occur within 24 hours of the initial 
investigation and confirmation of the EHM case. States with experience in communicating EHM 
incidents have cautioned others that communicating about a suspect but not yet confirmed case of 
EHM may be premature as

 risk and warrants widespread dissemination of 
information on the status of the situation. 
 
It is recommended that communications with the industry occur within 24 hours of the initial 
investigation and confirmation of the EHM case. States with experience in communicating EHM 
incidents have cautioned others that communicating about a suspect but not yet confirmed case of 
EHM may be premature as there are many differential diagnoses for a previously febrile horse that 
is now exhibiting neurologic signs. Therefore, it is recommended that only confirmed case 
information be disseminated to the industry. Where a rampant rumor mill situation exists, state 
animal health official action to clearly communicate the status of the situation is necessary. The 
state animal health official may want to acknowledge that an investigation is ongoing but that no 
cases of EHM have as of yet been confirmed and indicate when further information will be made 
available. 
What to Communicate? 
The key to communication is providing factual information that addresses the concerns of the 
industry. Do not speculate. The outreach to affected premises should include specific biosecurity 
recommendations and quarantine parameters. Owners of all identified exposed horses should be 
provided a temperature monitoring log for tracking twice daily temperatures and any other clinical 
signs. 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  35

There are multiple different stakeholders in equine disease communication. Generally equine 
stakeholders want to know if a particular EHM incident can impact them. For example, the 
individual horse owner is concerned about risk to his/her horse, the show manager is concerned 
about risk to their event, and the equine practitioner is concerned about risk to the health of the 
horses in their practice area. Each individual utilizes the information available to assess risk as it

 want to know if a particular EHM incident can impact them. For example, the 
individual horse owner is concerned about risk to his/her horse, the show manager is concerned 
about risk to their event, and the equine practitioner is concerned about risk to the health of the 
horses in their practice area. Each individual utilizes the information available to assess risk as it 
pertains to them and their role in an incident. The critical information state animal health official 
can provide to the stakeholders includes: how many horses are affected, the population of horses 
affected, potential exposures, and the measures implemented to limit the disease spread. This 
information can be in the form of social media alerts, webpage updates and printed outreach 
materials. State animal health officials are urged to place information on their department’s 
website.  
 
State animal health officials, the AAEP and the AHC have developed a plan for a National Equine 
Disease Communication Center to assist dissemination of factual current information at 
www.equinediseasecc.org. The EDCC has been designed to become the central “go-to” source for 
information about equine infectious diseases that pose a threat to the horse industry and the 
website is intended to be a central communication resource for the equine industry to provide 
current, factual information regarding ongoing outbreaks in all fifty states.

EHV-1 VACCINATION 
 
Overview 
Currently available vaccines against EHV-1 provide some protection against the respiratory and 
abortion forms of the disease but fail to protect against EHM.  Unfortunately, there is insufficient 
data to make scientifically sound vaccination recommendations. The following summary 
information is offered for your consideration. 
 
During a presentation at the EHV workshop held at USAHA in 2013 
(http://www.usaha.org/upload/Committee/InfectiousHorses/report-hd-2013.pdf, a speaker 
indicated that there is scant scientific evidence of efficacy of any of the available vaccines against 
EHV- 1 neurologic disease.

During a presentation at the EHV workshop held at USAHA in 2013 
(http://www.usaha.org/upload/Committee/InfectiousHorses/report-hd-2013.pdf, a speaker 
indicated that there is scant scientific evidence of efficacy of any of the available vaccines against 
EHV- 1 neurologic disease. The critical event in the pathology of neurologic disease is endothelial 
vasculitis and thrombosis in the central nervous system. There is little evidence that vaccination 
with any available product prevents or decreases either event. Also mentioned were two peer 
reviewed publications that actually showed there may be an association of recent or frequent 
vaccination of horses against EHV-1 with an increased risk for development of EHM during EHV-1 
outbreaks. 
 
Vaccination of competitive horses with EHV-1 products is common. For example: The USEF 
currently requires horses over 7 months of age to be vaccinated for EHV within six months prior to 
entering the grounds or stable areas of their sanctioned events. A number of racing jurisdictions 
have similar requirements. The current AAEP vaccination guidelines recommend vaccination for 
EHV every 6 months for: animals on facilities with frequent horse movement, show and 
performance horses, racetracks and other high risk environments and horses less than 5 years of 
age. 
 
EHV-1 Vaccination Considerations 
Several EHV-1 vaccines currently marketed in North America carry a label claim for the control of 
respiratory disease induced by EHV-1 and EHV-4. These are multi-component inactivated vaccines 
specifically (as of January 2018) Prestige® (Merck), Calvenza®, Vetera (Boehringer Ingelheim

respiratory disease induced by EHV-1 and EHV-4. These are multi-component inactivated vaccines 
specifically (as of January 2018) Prestige® (Merck), Calvenza®, Vetera (Boehringer Ingelheim 
Vetmedica) and Fluvac Innovator® (Zoetis) and the single antigen modified live vaccine Rhinomune® 
(Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica). Additionally, there are two EHV-1 inactivated vaccines licensed 
for the prevention of abortion and respiratory disease; these vaccines are Pneumabort-K® (Zoetis) 
and Prodigy® (Merck). There are currently no EHV-1 vaccines licensed to prevent EHM. 
 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  39 
Revised January 2018 
It has been suggested that some EHV vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of EHV-1 in outbreak 
situations by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and thus dissemination of virus. For this reason, some 
experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. 
Based upon the current available literature, the vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal 
shedding and viremia of the neuro virulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of 
abortion (Pneumabort-K® & Prodigy®), the MLV vaccine (Rhinomune®) and another inactivated 
vaccine for prevention of respiratory disease (Calvenza®)

vaccine for prevention of respiratory disease (Calvenza®) 
 
It is recognized that in an outbreak situation, some veterinarians, owners and/or trainers may elect 
to vaccinate horses on the premises. Thoughtful consideration should be given before this activity is 
initiated. If this approach is pursued, it is important to understand the following: 
1. There are no EHV-1 vaccines currently licensed to prevent EHM. 
2. Only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated and protection against 
clinical EHM should not be an expectation. 
3. A certain percent of vaccinated animals will respond with a low grade fever, lethargy 
and/or injection site discomfort for anywhere from 24 -72 hours (or longer) post 
vaccination. These fevers can exceed 101.5° F. 
4. Horses with post-vaccination fevers can increase the number of animals meeting 
isolation, monitoring and testing requirements and increase the cost of outbreak 
management. 
5. The current/previous vaccination status of each animal should be obtained and 
evaluated as part of this decision process. 
6. Vaccination should not be considered a substitute for or equivalent to implementation 
of good biosecurity measures.

Introduction 
On October 19, 2013, the American Association of Equine Practitioners Foundation (AAEP) and 
the United States Animal Health Association (USAHA) Committee on Infectious Diseases of Horses 
(IDOHC) sponsored an Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) Workshop. The workshop identified a need 
for regulatory consensus on case definition, outbreak definition, quarantine parameters, 
diagnostic testing and biosecurity practices for Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy 
incidents. USAHA IDOHC established an EHV-1 subcommittee to develop a consensus document 
related to the EHV-1 regulatory mitigation.  
This document represents an updated version of the original guideline developed by the 
subcommittee. (Updated in January 2018).

During Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) incidents, the state animal health 
officials’ (SAHO) goal is to prevent the spread of the disease agent, specifically Equine Herpesvirus- 
1. Science-based disease control protocols, adapted to the specific incident, control disease 
spread while ensuring compliance and minimizing the impact on equine movement. There is no 
single protocol that can be applied to all EHM incidents as there are multiple factors that must be 
considered when determining the optimal disease containment response. This guidance

Revised January 2018 
DEFINITIONS 
Assumption: The definitions are intended to be utilized during an EHM incident. The document is 
based on diagnosis or suspicion of one or more Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) 
cases. 
EHM Incident: Detection of one or more confirmed cases of EHM, and where there is confirmation 
of disease agent spread or evidence of potential for disease transmission from an EHM confirmed 
case to additional horses in a population. 
Index Definitions: 
 
1.  Confirmed Index EHM Case: A horse displaying signs of central nervous system (CNS) 
dysfunction, including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or 
urinary bladder atony, with evidence of infection with any strain of EHV -1 based on virus isolation 
and /or PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens. If the horse dies

function, including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or 
urinary bladder atony, with evidence of infection with any strain of EHV -1 based on virus isolation 
and /or PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens. If the horse dies 
or is euthanized, the case can be confirmed based on histological evidence and detection and/or 
demonstration of EHV-1 in CNS tissues collected at necropsy. 
2.  Suspect Index EHM Case: Highly suggestive EHM case, defined as a horse displaying signs of 
central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, 
weakness, recumbency and/or urinary bladder atony which may have been preceded by fever, 
respiratory signs and/or abortion in horses on the premises.  
3.  Index EHM Premises: The premises on which the index EHM case has occurred. 
4.  Index Point of Exposure: Initial site of exposure to EHV-1 for the confirmed index EHM case 
and/or suspect index EHM case as determined by an epidemiologic investigation. In cases of 
presumed reactivation of latent virus, a point of exposure for the index case does not exist. 
Subsequent Definitions: 
 
1. Exposed horse: A horse with direct or indirect contact with the EHM confirmed index case 
within the 14 days preceding the onset of neurologic signs or a horse that potentially had direct 
or indirect contact with horses at the point of exposure of the index case within the preceding 
14 days. (For details on exposure risk, see investigation section). 
 
2. Suspect EHV-1

 with direct or indirect contact with the EHM confirmed index case 
within the 14 days preceding the onset of neurologic signs or a horse that potentially had direct 
or indirect contact with horses at the point of exposure of the index case within the preceding 
14 days. (For details on exposure risk, see investigation section). 
 
2. Suspect EHV-1 case: An exposed horse that shows no neurologic signs but displays some of the 
clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection; these may include fever (rectal temperature 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  7 
Revised January 2018 
greater than 101.5°F), limb edema, abortion or nasal discharge during the 14 days after initial 
exposure to a confirmed EHM case. 
 
3. Confirmed EHV-1 case: A horse that is showing no neurologic signs but tests positive for EHV-1 
by virus isolation and/or PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/ nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) or 
fetal tissue specimens along with clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection, such as fever, 
limb edema, abortion or nasal discharge. If the horse dies or is euthanized, the case may be 
confirmed based on histological evidence and detection and/or demonstration of EHV-1 in 
tissues collected at necropsy.  
 
4. Suspect EHM case: An exposed horse that develops neurologic signs suggestive of EHM, 
including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary 
bladder atony during the 14 days prior to the index EHM case developing clinical signs and/or 14 
days after the last potential

4. Suspect EHM case: An exposed horse that develops neurologic signs suggestive of EHM, 
including but not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary 
bladder atony during the 14 days prior to the index EHM case developing clinical signs and/or 14 
days after the last potential exposure to the confirmed EHM case. 
 
5. Confirmed EHM case: A horse which is positive for any strain of EHV-1 by virus isolation and /or 
PCR testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens along with the 
presence of clinical signs consistent with EHM. If the horse dies or is euthanized, the presence of 
histological lesions and/or demonstration of EHV-1 in the CNS tissues collected at necropsy is 
confirmatory of a diagnosis. 
 
6. Non-clinical test positive case: An exposed horse that is not exhibiting clinical signs (afebrile, 
non-neurologic) but tests positive for any strain of EHV-1 by virus isolation and/or PCR testing of 
nasopharyngeal/nasal swab or blood (buffy coat) specimens.  
 
a. Note: during any given incident some horses may start in this category before 
developing neurologic signs and subsequently being confirmed as an EHM case 
after they develop neurologic signs. 
 
7. EHM Premises: A premises where a confirmed or suspect case of EHM currently resides or a 
premise where an EHM case resided within the preceding 14 days.

9. Afebrile: Body temperature of less than 101.5° F in a monitored horse.  
 
10. Monitored horse: A horse that is being evaluated for any evidence of clinical signs consistent 
with EHV-1 infection.  A monitored horse should have the body temperature determined at

least twice a day e.g. morning and evening in order to detect a fever and it should be examined 
for any neurologic signs.  A horse cannot be considered to be truly monitored for EHV-1 induced 
fever if it has been treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) within the 
previous 24 hours. 
 
11. ORF: Open Reading Frame 
 
12. SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism 
 
13. PPE (Personal Protective Equipment):  Any protective clothing, garment, footwear or equipment 
designed to protect the wearer from direct exposure to infectious agents. Proper use and 
disposal of these garments will reduce the spread of infectious agents. 
 
14. EHV-1 “A” strain: Any strain of EHV-1 having the SNP genetic marker ORF 30 A2254 genotype. 
(Previously referred to as wild strain or non-neuropathogenic strain).

14. EHV-1 “A” strain: Any strain of EHV-1 having the SNP genetic marker ORF 30 A2254 genotype. 
(Previously referred to as wild strain or non-neuropathogenic strain). 
 
15. *EHV-1 “G” strain: Any strain of EHV-1 having the SNP genetic marker ORF 30 G2254 genotype. 
(Previously referred to as mutated or neuropathogenic strain). 
 
* Strains of EHV-1 having this genotype have on occasion been associated with severe 
outbreaks of EHM.  In clinical trials, such stains have been associated with a higher level of 
viremia than strains with the ORF 30 A2254 genotype.  Strains of the EHV-1 with the ORF 
30 G2254 genotype have also been referred to as mutant strains of EHV-1. This is a 
misleading term since such strains of EHV-1 were detected in archival samples from the 
1970’s and accordingly they should not be referred to as newly mutated forms of EHV-1.  
 
16. Exposed premises: The physical location where an index case or an EHV-1 exposed horse has 
been in the previous 14 days, to include but not limited to pastures, event venues, training 
facilities, and breeding facilities. Note: The extent of the area of premises exposed needs to be 
based on a thorough epidemiologic evaluation.

based on a thorough epidemiologic evaluation. 
NOTE:  
Non-neuropathogenic or wild strain of EHV-1: Any strain of EHV-1 with the ORF 30 A2254 genotype.  
Neuropathogenic or mutant strain of EHV-1: Any strain of EHV-1 with the ORF 30 G2254 genotype.  
“Non-neuropthogenic EHV-1 strain” and “neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain”; are terms that lead to 
confusion since both strains have the potential to cause EHM. In an outbreak environment knowing 
which strain is present does not necessarily change what needs to be done to control/mitigate the 
situation.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING 
Serologic Testing 
Due to the likelihood of widespread exposure to EHV-1 and the common practice of vaccination of 
the general equine population against this virus infection, serologic testing at a single point in time 
is uninformative and of very limited diagnostic value. The serologic test readily available in the 
United States is the virus neutralization test (VNT); some other countries however, have the 
availability to use the complement fixation test (CFT) which can be used to detect recent exposure 
to EHV-1. Serologic testing, namely using the VNT, which demonstrates seroconversion or a four-
fold or greater increase in serum antibody titers between samples collected 10- 21 days apart,

 (VNT); some other countries however, have the 
availability to use the complement fixation test (CFT) which can be used to detect recent exposure 
to EHV-1. Serologic testing, namely using the VNT, which demonstrates seroconversion or a four-
fold or greater increase in serum antibody titers between samples collected 10- 21 days apart, 
provides presumptive evidence of recent EHV-1 infection assuming EHV-1 vaccination has not taken 
place just prior to or during that time period. EHV neutralizing tests (VNT) do not distinguish 
between EHV-1 and EHV-4 antibodies. 
However, type specific ELISA tests based on a portion of the glycoprotein G of each virus have been 
developed. The CFT and ELISA type specific antibody detection tests are not currently available at 
diagnostic laboratories in North America. 
Virus Detection 
Virus isolation is considered the gold standard for confirmatory laboratory diagnosis of EHV-1 
infection, although the time required to obtain a positive result limits its value for outbreak 
management. Virus identification of EHV-1 by isolation from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs or 
buffy coat samples is confirmatory evidence of a diagnosis of EHM in a horse with compatible 
clinical signs. 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the diagnostic test of choice due to its high 
analytical sensitivity and specificity and rapid turn-around time. Positive PCR results can be 
obtained when virus isolation is negative due to sub-detectable levels of infectious virus, 
inactivated virus or presence of viral nucleic acid. PCR tests carried out simultaneously on both 
nasal secretions and buffy coat samples are useful in establishing the stage of infection in an 
animal.

 and specificity and rapid turn-around time. Positive PCR results can be 
obtained when virus isolation is negative due to sub-detectable levels of infectious virus, 
inactivated virus or presence of viral nucleic acid. PCR tests carried out simultaneously on both 
nasal secretions and buffy coat samples are useful in establishing the stage of infection in an 
animal. Quantitation of genomic DNA level is used as a guide in assessing the potential of a horse 
with nasal shedding EHV-1 to transmit infection. Viremia is the presence of virus (intact and 
regarded as infectious) in the bloodstream. Although viremia is an essential component in the 
pathogenesis of EHM, some studies have failed to show that the level of viremia is directly 
correlated with level of risk for development of EHM. Other studies have shown correlation of a 
high level of viremia with more severe CNS diseases. While the level of virus detected by PCR 
indicate the presence or absence of viral DNA in the specimen tested, at this time that level of virus 
has not been correlated with the severity of clinical presentation and cannot be used to predict

clinical outcome. The lack of standardization of test methods between laboratories and the lack of 
standardized use of quality assurance controls amongst laboratories remain an ongoing challenge in 
test interpretation. 
Note: Virus isolation is optimized when samples are collected and shipped the same day and are 
received by the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.

Note: Virus isolation is optimized when samples are collected and shipped the same day and are 
received by the laboratory within 24 hours of collection. 
Recently, antiviral drugs have been used by some for the treatment of EHM cases. Currently, there 
is ongoing research regarding the use of antiviral drugs for treatment of neurologic cases and even 
prevention of EHV-1 infection in exposed horses. Theoretically, use of antivirals could alter level of 
viremia and viral shedding and thereby have an impact on test results. However, at this time there 
is not enough science based literature available to determine the impact of the use of antiviral 
drugs on the level and duration of viremia and nasal shedding of virus. Still, it should be considered 
during the evaluation of test results, therefore it is important that the submitter record treatment 
with antiviral drugs on the submission form. 
Types of PCR tests 
• Conventional/Standard PCR: The amplified DNA is detected at the end of the test 
procedure. This test is of more limited sensitivity and is non-quantitative. 
• Nested PCR: Two sets of primers are used in two successive PCRs. The amplified DNA 
fragments are used in a second PCR for identification. It is a very sensitive assay but is 
associated with the risk of cross-contamination between samples. 
• Real Time PCR: the amplified DNA is detected as the reaction progresses. More sensitive, 
specific, rapid and reliable than conventional PCR. This test allows for determination of the 
amount of viral nucleic acid in the sample being tested.

amount of viral nucleic acid in the sample being tested. 
EHV-1 PCR Tests 
The glycoprotein B gene PCR assay is often used as a screening test to detect EHV-1; a positive test 
indicates EHV-1 infection. However, this test cannot differentiate EHV-1 G strains (previously 
referred to as mutant strain) from the EHV-1 A strains (previously referred to as wild strain). 
Subsequent subtyping based on the DNA polymerase gene assay, which targets the single 
nucleotide polymorphism at position 2254 of the virus open reading frame 30 which encodes for 
the catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase gene, can differentiate G and A virus strains. Some 
laboratories may only use the DNA polymerase gene assay for screening for EHV-1 infection.

Characteristics of an Ideal PCR Protocol 
Consider these characteristics of PCR assays when choosing the most appropriate type of test to 
meet your needs and that are consistent with the reason for testing in your situation: 
1. Sensitivity: Does the assay have a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of EHV- 
1? Is strain typing necessary? Certain highly sensitive PCR assays can differentiate EHV-1 G 
strains (previously referred to as mutant strains) from EHV-1 A strains (previously referred 
to as wild stains) in a sample. 
2. Timeliness: Can the laboratory provide timely results necessary for confirmation of 
infection? Assay results can be available

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
? Certain highly sensitive PCR assays can differentiate EHV-1 G 
strains (previously referred to as mutant strains) from EHV-1 A strains (previously referred 
to as wild stains) in a sample. 
2. Timeliness: Can the laboratory provide timely results necessary for confirmation of 
infection? Assay results can be available within 12 hours of sample receipt at some 
laboratories. 
3. Quantitative Load: Can the assay provide quantitative results? Will quantitative results be 
useful in the epidemiologic investigation or disease control efforts? A quantitative PCR 
assay can provide quantitation of viral DNA in a specimen. 
Additional considerations when choosing an appropriate laboratory for sample testing: 
1. Turn-around Time: Can the laboratory provide a rapid turnaround time? A laboratory 
which can provide timely reports to the practitioner is beneficial. 
2. Laboratory Assistance: Does the laboratory have readily available personnel to assist with 
interpretation of test results? A more detailed understanding of a positive or negative test 
result can assist in the implementation of appropriate biosecurity and infection control 
measures. 
3. State Animal Health Official Acceptance: Will the state animal health official accept the 
results from the laboratory being considered for sample submission? Some animal health 
officials require that official test results be provided by specified laboratories and may 
require additional sample types to be collected and tested, such as collection and testing 
a different source of sample from a previously tested horse, e.g. blood versus nasal swab 
or sampling of additional horses in an incident.

Abstract from 2014 USAHA IDOHC Meeting, San Diego, CA -
http://usaha.org/Committees/InfectiousDiseasesOfHorses.aspx 
 
“In 2013, the USDA-APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) and American Association 
of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD) conducted a joint inter-laboratory comparison 
(ring trial) of equine herpesvirus type 1 (nEHV-1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in an 
effort to standardize testing methodology for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) 
carried out at state/university/provincial diagnostic facilities in North America. 
A total of 28 state diagnostic facilities from the USA and Canada evaluated a ring test “panel” of 
field EHV isolates. The 28 participating laboratories used 38 different procedures (some laboratories 
tested by multiple procedures) based upon modifications of 10 peer-reviewed published methods 
for EHV-1 PCR. Two genes were utilized as PCR targets, the EHV-1 glycoprotein B gene, and the EHV-
1 ORF 30, viral DNA polymerase gene. Glycoprotein B gene- based PCR assays, which are 
fundamentally designed as screening assays that detect wild-type (wt-EHV-1) and neuropathogenic 
(nEHV-1)strains, were used by 15 participating

coprotein B gene, and the EHV-
1 ORF 30, viral DNA polymerase gene. Glycoprotein B gene- based PCR assays, which are 
fundamentally designed as screening assays that detect wild-type (wt-EHV-1) and neuropathogenic 
(nEHV-1)strains, were used by 15 participating laboratories and had excellent diagnostic sensitivity 
for both wt-EHV-1 (100%; 30/30 samples identified   correctly), and nEHV-1 (98.8%; 89/90 samples 
identified correctly), as well as excellent diagnostic specificity (98.3%; 59/60 non-EHV-1 samples 
identified correctly). As predicted, none of the glycoprotein B gene-based assays differentiated wt-
EHV-1 from nEHV-1 and as such serve as excellent diagnostic tools to identify EHV-1 infected horses 
from non-EHV-1 infected horses but do not identify nEHV-1 specifically. ORF 30 (viral DNA 
polymerase) gene-based PCR assay had more variable results from testing of the ring trial samples. 
Three published ORF 30 A/G 2254 assays: 1) Allen et al, 2007, 2) Pusterla et al, 2009, and 3) Smith et 
al, 2012), which differentiate wt-EHV-1 from nEHV-1 by detecting the A2254 (wt-EHV-1) or G2254 
(nEHV-1) polymorphism, were used by 21 participating laboratories. The three assays had 
diagnostic sensitivity (based upon correct identification of nEHV-1 samples) of 93.1% (67/72 
samples, Allen 2007), 100% (36/36 samples, Puster

The diagnostic specificity (based upon correct identification of non-nEHV-1 samples) was 88.9% 
(64/72 samples, Allen 2007), 72.2% (26/36 samples, Pusterla 2009), and 100% (18/18 samples, 
Smith 2013).”

Considerations when using PCR testing for EHV-1 
1. Testing horses with clinical signs: 
Horses with high fevers and/or other clinical signs including coughing or mild nasal 
discharge, or abortion, with or without neurologic signs, should be tested for EHV-1 by PCR, 
preferably by real time or nested PCR, if other possible causes for these signs are not 
apparent. 
2. Screening of clinically normal horses with a link to an EHV outbreak: 
The use of testing for EHV-1 in horses that are clinically normal but that have some link to an 
EHV outbreak will be discussed later. 
3. Screening of horses in the general population: 
Historically the EHV-1 test has been performed on horses as a screening test for entry to 
events and as a requirement for entry to boarding facilities or as part

 for EHV-1 in horses that are clinically normal but that have some link to an 
EHV outbreak will be discussed later. 
3. Screening of horses in the general population: 
Historically the EHV-1 test has been performed on horses as a screening test for entry to 
events and as a requirement for entry to boarding facilities or as part of a purchase 
examination. It is not recommended that testing as described above (screening of horses in 
the general population) be performed.  Since EHV-1 is considered to be endemic in most 
horse populations and detection of the virus in nasal secretions is likely a transient 
occurrence that results in an undefinable risk for spread of disease. 
 
Necropsy of Suspect EHM Horses 
A necropsy provides an important means of confirming the presence of EHV-1 neurologic disease. 
EHM is not a zoonotic disease but consideration should be given to other diseases with the 
potential for zoonotic implications such as rabies. Thus, it is important to use appropriate biosafety 
measures during necropsy examination. It is important to necropsy suspect EHV-1 cases as there 
are documented cases of suspect EHM horses with negative ante-mortem EHV-1 test results on 
nasopharyngeal/nasal swab and buffy coat samples that were confirmed positive for EHV-1 related 
neurologic disease on necropsy examination. 
Therefore, necropsy examination of a horse with neurologic disease that dies or has to be 
euthanized is recommended. To ensure appropriate samples are taken at necropsy, individuals are 
reminded to alert the pathologist of the suspect EHM status of the case and provide the neurologic

neurologic disease on necropsy examination. 
Therefore, necropsy examination of a horse with neurologic disease that dies or has to be 
euthanized is recommended. To ensure appropriate samples are taken at necropsy, individuals are 
reminded to alert the pathologist of the suspect EHM status of the case and provide the neurologic 
history on the laboratory submission forms.  
Appropriate Timing of Sample Collection 
Correct selection of horses for sampling within an affected group is vital to gain the best- quality 
information for the epidemiologic investigation and disease control efforts. Samples collected 
represent a single point in time, as viral shedding changes over the course of the infection. Viral 
shedding from the respiratory tract of adult horses is detectable typically for less than 10 days and 
may be intermittent. The optimal window for nasal swab sampling is at the onset of clinical signs. In 
some situations, where initial testing was negative for EHV-1 but EHV infection is suspected as the 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  14 
Revised January 2018 
cause of disease, it is recommended to repeat sampling within 2 to 4 days of onset of clinical signs. 
The amount of EHV-1 DNA detected in nasal swabs varies from horse to horse and over the course 
of disease in a given animal and does not necessarily correlate with the severity of disease.

Recommended Horses to Test during an EHM Incident 
1. Suspect Index EHM Horses: Highly suggestive EHM case, defined as a horse displaying 
signs of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, including but not limited to hindlimb 
incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary bladder atony which may or may 
not have been preceded by fever, respiratory signs and/or abortion in other horses on the 
premises. 
 
2. Suspect EHM Horses: An exposed horse displaying signs suggestive of EHM including, but 
not limited to hindlimb incoordination, weakness, recumbency and/or urinary bladder 
atony during the 14 days prior to the index EHM case developing clinical signs and/or 14 
days after last potential exposure to a confirmed EHM case. 
 
3. Suspect EHV-1 Horses: An exposed horse that shows no neurologic signs, but displays 
some of the clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection; these may include fever (rectal 
temperature greater than 101.5 degrees F), limb edema, abortion, or nasal discharge 
during the 14 days after initial exposure to a confirmed EHM case. Testing of these horses 
is recommended but not necessary as long as the index EHM case has been confirmed. 
Horses not tested will remain suspects and should NOT be included in the confirmed case 
count. 
4. Testing of Non-clinical E

 limb edema, abortion, or nasal discharge 
during the 14 days after initial exposure to a confirmed EHM case. Testing of these horses 
is recommended but not necessary as long as the index EHM case has been confirmed. 
Horses not tested will remain suspects and should NOT be included in the confirmed case 
count. 
4. Testing of Non-clinical EHV-1 Horses: A decision to test these horses for disease 
investigation or quarantine release purposes must be carefully considered. Non-clinical 
horses can be shedders of EHV-1 virus. Specific recommendations regarding the risk these 
horses pose is lacking in the scientific literature. If performed, a planned response to test-
positive non-clinical horses should be established prior to testing such horses. 
NOTE: There is no indication to test horses not epidemiologically linked to the disease 
investigation or generally as a part of the quarantine procedure.

Factors Impacting Decision to Test Exposed Horses 
NOTE: If tests are planned, a plan of how to handle the test results must be determined in 
advance. 
1. Testing of exposed horses may not be required by regulatory officials if: 
a. There is an ability to mitigate further exposure risk by immediate removal of the 
EHM horse or adequate isolation and biosecurity practices of the EHM horse   from 
all other horses on the premises; 
b. There are no additional clinical cases detected during the 21 day period after initial 
exposure to the index EHM case. Thus, no evidence of disease transmission; and,

EHM horse or adequate isolation and biosecurity practices of the EHM horse   from 
all other horses on the premises; 
b. There are no additional clinical cases detected during the 21 day period after initial 
exposure to the index EHM case. Thus, no evidence of disease transmission; and, 
c. Epidemiologic investigation provides confidence in owner/ management 
monitoring of the situation through demonstration of twice daily body temperature 
logs, daily clinical assessments, and observance of strict isolation protocols for sick 
horses for the duration of the quarantine. 
 
2. Testing of exposed horses may be required by regulatory officials if: 
a. Premises management fails to adequately isolate the index EHM case within 12 
hours of detection. This will result in continued exposure risk to horses on the 
premises; 
-OR- 
b. There are exposed horses on premises without adequate isolation from clinical 
horses. Testing may be necessary to determine disease risk; 
                                                        -OR- 
c. Epidemiologic investigation reveals evidence of poor compliance including but not 
limited to lack of twice daily body temperature monitoring of potentially exposed 
horses, failure to isolate sick horses, and/or continued sharing of equipment 
between sick and other horses.

EHV-1 PCR Test Interpretation of a Clinical Horse* 
NOTE: A positive PCR test on a nasopharyngeal/nasal swab sample does NOT necessarily equate 
to presence of infective virus. 
• A positive EHV-1 result from a buffy coat sample indicates viremia and an active infection. 
• A negative EHV-1 test result on a buffy coat sample indicates the absence of detectable 
EHV-1 viremia at the time of sampling. 
• A positive EHV-1 test result from a nasal swab sample should be interpreted as detection 
of EHV-1 DNA in the nasal secretions. EHV-1 DNA can be detected during and subsequent 
to the period of shedding infective virus. Quantitative PCR (i.e. real-time

iremia at the time of sampling. 
• A positive EHV-1 test result from a nasal swab sample should be interpreted as detection 
of EHV-1 DNA in the nasal secretions. EHV-1 DNA can be detected during and subsequent 
to the period of shedding infective virus. Quantitative PCR (i.e. real-time PCR) may provide 
more information about the risk of virus transmission by the sampled horse. 
•  A negative EHV-1 test result on a nasal swab indicates the absence of detectable virus 
shedding at the time of sampling; provided appropriate sample collection, sample handling 
prior to shipment and sample shipping protocols were followed. 
*Interpretation of the PCR test in the non-clinical animal is similar to the clinical animal, however 
the implications of the transmission risk is unknown at this time. 
 
Recommended Protocols for Sample Collection 
These are current recommendations: 
1. Make contact with the laboratory where samples are to be submitted to obtain supplies 
(swabs and transport medium) and laboratory specific sampling and shipping protocols. 
2. Be sure to avoid cross contamination by wearing a new pair of examination gloves to collect 
samples from each horse and perform hand hygiene between horses sampled. Barrier 
precautions such as wearing disposable gown or coveralls and boot/shoe covers should be 
observed. These should be changed when sampling horses of different disease status e.g. 
clinical cases versus potentially exposed horses. 
3. If a chain over the nose or a twitch is used to restrain a horse, it must be washed and 
disinfected between horses. 
4. A dedicated halter and lead should be used for each horse or these items washed and 
disinfected between individual animals. 
5. Nasal swabs

3. If a chain over the nose or a twitch is used to restrain a horse, it must be washed and 
disinfected between horses. 
4. A dedicated halter and lead should be used for each horse or these items washed and 
disinfected between individual animals. 
5. Nasal swabs should be collected using Dacron tipped swab (Synthetic) with plastic shaft 
(Don’t use wooden shaft or cotton tipped swabs) 
6. Insert the swab at least 5 inches into the nasal passage and leave swab against the nasal 
mucosa for a minimum of 15 seconds before withdrawal. 
7. Remove and place swab in a sterile tube (no anticoagulant or gel) or preferably in a tube with 
viral transport medium. To prevent over-dilution of the sample less than 2 ml of transport 
fluid should be utilized. Label sample according to laboratory instructions. 
8. Collect 10ml of whole blood in EDTA (purple top tube) and label sample with animal 
name and date and time of collection. Do not send serum for PCR testing. 
9. Keep samples cool (refrigerator/ice pack) but not frozen and ship nasal swabs and whole 
blood samples overnight to laboratory. 
10. Consider direct communication with the laboratory to expedite obtaining results in the most 
timely manner.

QUARANTINE PLACEMENT 
Overview 
There is no universal quarantine protocol that can be applied to all EHM incidents as there are 
multiple factors that must be considered when determining the optimal disease containment 
response. A disease transmission risk assessment is the critical first step in determining the extent 
of a quarantine. Once EHM is confirmed, in those states with quarantine authority, a quarantine 
should be applied in all situations. Additionally, risk assessment identifies specific factors that will 
need to be addressed in establishing the quarantine(s) parameters and required biosecurity 
measures on operations with exposed horses. 
 
In preparation for a disease incident, any equine event or large equine facility should identify an 
appropriate isolation area(s) for clinical and /or exposed animals. Isolation areas on site and off site 
should be identified in advance, including medical facilities with appropriate isolation areas where 
clinical cases could be referred for medical treatment. It cannot be overstated the importance of 
this preplanning preparation. 
 
In dealing with EHM incidents, state animal health officials may issue quarantines to prevent the 
spread of the disease agent, specifically EHV- 1. Science- based criteria for quarantine protocols 
adapted to the specific incident, control disease spread while increasing compliance and minimizing 
the impact on equine movement. Historically, quarantine issuance is by the state veterinary 
authority or horse racing boards. However, in some EHM incidents voluntary quarantine actions are 
taken by private farms, public or private facilities, veterinary teaching hospitals and private 
practitioners for the purpose of controlling the disease.  
Some states have the authority to place “hold” or “stop movement” orders

 issuance is by the state veterinary 
authority or horse racing boards. However, in some EHM incidents voluntary quarantine actions are 
taken by private farms, public or private facilities, veterinary teaching hospitals and private 
practitioners for the purpose of controlling the disease.  
Some states have the authority to place “hold” or “stop movement” orders which may be imposed 
while gathering epidemiological data to determine the necessity and proper placement of a 
quarantine. 
 
Before implementing a quarantine, the criteria for quarantine release need to be established. To 
ensure compliance and to determine the effectiveness of disease control measures, the quarantine-
issuing authority should arrange for a regulatory official or their designee to monitor the situation 
through periodic on-site visits to the premises. Disease transmission, as evidenced by newly 
identified clinical cases, would warrant modification of the quarantine-site biosecurity protocols. 
Additionally, if spread occurs beyond the initial quarantine sites, then additional regulatory 
authorities may need to be contacted and the quarantine may need to be extended or applied to 
additional sites.

Impact of Quarantine on the Equine Industry 
Compliance and cooperation from individuals and the equine industry is essential if EHM is to be 
successfully controlled. The potential impact of any quarantine on the equine industry or individuals 
needs to be balanced with the goal of disease containment. Business continuity must be taken into 
consideration to ensure the equine industry can be supported through an EHM incident. Issuance of 
an extended quarantine period on multiple premises with a low risk of disease development may be 
considered an excessive burden and may be unnecessary for effective disease containment.

 industry or individuals 
needs to be balanced with the goal of disease containment. Business continuity must be taken into 
consideration to ensure the equine industry can be supported through an EHM incident. Issuance of 
an extended quarantine period on multiple premises with a low risk of disease development may be 
considered an excessive burden and may be unnecessary for effective disease containment. 
Situational awareness and science-based disease prevention guidance from animal health officials 
will garner increased confidence among industry stakeholders and will serve to increase compliance 
and implementation of voluntary disease control measures. 
 
Issuance of a Quarantine 
The scope of any premises based quarantine that is to be implemented should be based on the 
results of the risk assessment following the identification of a suspect or confirmed index EHM 
case(s). It may include any of the following scenarios:   
1) Only the suspect index or confirmed index EHM horse is quarantined;  
2) The suspect index or confirmed index EHM horse and horses with high risk of exposure on index 
EHM premises are quarantined;  
3) All horses on the EHM index premises are quarantined;   
4) Entire index premises and horses with high risk of exposure that are located on other than the 
index premises are quarantined; and  
5) An epidemiologically linked non-clinical test positive case is quarantined.   
 
EHV-1 Risk Assessment for Purposes of Determining Scope of Quarantine 
EHV-1 is spread by direct horse to horse contact as well as indirectly by virus-contaminated fomites 
and personnel. The most common route of exposure is through the respiratory tract via aerosolized 
droplets from the respiratory tract secretions of a virus shedding horse.

1 Risk Assessment for Purposes of Determining Scope of Quarantine 
EHV-1 is spread by direct horse to horse contact as well as indirectly by virus-contaminated fomites 
and personnel. The most common route of exposure is through the respiratory tract via aerosolized 
droplets from the respiratory tract secretions of a virus shedding horse. 
 
Infection can also occur by oral or nasal exposure to virus contaminated surfaces. Examples include 
hands, clothing, and equipment such as wipe rags, buckets, water sources, feeders, stall surfaces 
and tack. Clinically affected horses should be assumed to be contagious, particularly with respect to 
respiratory secretions, for at least 14 days. Aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and placental fluids 
also contain large quantities of infective virus and thus pose a particularly high disease transmission 
risk. 
 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  20 
Revised January 2018 
An assessment is critical in order to identify current disease agent transmission risk factors on an 
affected premises. Identifying the risks for disease agent transmission can assist in determining the 
required quarantine protocols. 
1. STEP 1: Assessment of Risk Associated with the Index EHM Case: At the time of the initial 
testing, the contagious nature of the index EHM horse should be evaluated in terms of 
potential for shedding EHV-1 and potential spread of virus from this horse to other horses 
(exposure risk to other horses). 
a. Potential to Shed EHV-1: A PCR test result from a horse’s nasopharyngeal/nasal 
swab that the laboratory indicates correlates with a high viral load categorizes that 
horse as a high risk for transmission of EHV-1 to
Text Len: 1698
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 from this horse to other horses 
(exposure risk to other horses). 
a. Potential to Shed EHV-1: A PCR test result from a horse’s nasopharyngeal/nasal 
swab that the laboratory indicates correlates with a high viral load categorizes that 
horse as a high risk for transmission of EHV-1 to other horses. A clinical EHV- 1 or 
EHM horse with this finding would pose a significant risk of virus shedding into the 
environment. 
 
b. Assessment of the Potential of an EHM Horse to Expose Other Horses: A clinical 
EHV-1 or EHM case which remains on the premises poses significant risk of 
exposure to other equids on the property as it continues to shed virus. A clinical 
EHM horse that is euthanized, appropriately removed, or isolated at onset of 
neurologic signs represents less disease exposure risk to the herd as the source of 
virus has been removed. Appropriate isolation includes restricted access to other 
horses (a minimum of 30 feet, recognizing the distance may need to be greater 
depending upon ventilation, air movement, barn/stall design and other biosecurity 
factors), avoiding the sharing of equipment and/or personnel and utilization of 
protective barrier precautions. A clinical EHM case that is down and thrashing in a 
stall poses a significant virus transmission risk as it requires additional personnel for 
its management compared to a non-neurologic horse and has the potential for 
hyperventilation; all of which may result in a potentially higher risk of 
contamination of the environment. Direct or indirect contact between horses, 
treatment personnel or fomites increases the potential exposure of other horses to 
EHV-1.

its management compared to a non-neurologic horse and has the potential for 
hyperventilation; all of which may result in a potentially higher risk of 
contamination of the environment. Direct or indirect contact between horses, 
treatment personnel or fomites increases the potential exposure of other horses to 
EHV-1. 
 
A Quarantine Risk Assessment Chart assists in determining level of risk posed by the 
index case (See Appendix). A quarantine restricted to the index horse may be 
sufficient, if the index horse poses a low risk of viral shedding and/or is 
appropriately isolated from other horses on the premises. A more extensive 
premises level quarantine may be warranted if the index horse demonstrates a high 
level of viral shedding and has extensive direct and/or indirect contact with other 
horses on the Index EHM premises. 
 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  21 
Revised January 2018 
2. STEP 2: Assessment of Exposure Risk within the Herd: At the time of initial confirmation 
of the index EHM case, the rest of the herd should be classified according to the degree of 
exposure and their ability to transmit virus within the herd. Animals exposed to a large 
amount of the virus are more likely to succumb to infection and/or pose a transmission 
risk to other horses on the premises. These higher risk animals may warrant quarantine 
and monitoring for fever or other clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection. 
 
a. Degree of Exposure to EHM Case: An exposed horse is one which is likely to have 
had direct or indirect contact with an EHM case (this includes shared transport 
exposure) within the previous 14 days. Highest risk animals are those with direct 
nose to nose contact with the
Text Len: 1732
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 other clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection. 
 
a. Degree of Exposure to EHM Case: An exposed horse is one which is likely to have 
had direct or indirect contact with an EHM case (this includes shared transport 
exposure) within the previous 14 days. Highest risk animals are those with direct 
nose to nose contact with the EHM case during the peak shedding period which is 
defined as the 7-day period before or after the onset of clinical signs. Moderate risk 
horses are those sharing a common air space of the clinical case or those, 
equipment, or personnel with direct contact with the EHM case. Animals on the 
premises with limited indirect or direct exposure to the index horse would be 
considered a low/negligible risk for exposure and may not warrant any quarantine 
action. Determining the level of exposure assists in deciding the scope of the 
quarantine to be applied. (See Appendix: Exposure Risk Assessment) 
 
b. Degree of Biosecurity in Place Prior to and at Time of Detection of Index Case: 
Disease risk cannot be completely eliminated at most equine premises, as equine 
premises are seldom managed as a closed facility. An evaluation of current 
management practices will help identify potential biosecurity risks to be addressed 
in the quarantine. Areas to be evaluated include management practices, horse 
stalls, isolation area, wash stalls, commingling areas, equipment handling, transport 
vehicles, and hay and other feed storage facilities. Premises with minimal 
biosecurity protocols in place are more likely to have disease transmission and thus 
warrant a more restrictive quarantine than a premises with a high level of 
biosecurity practices. The degree and level of commonly practiced/everyday

ling areas, equipment handling, transport 
vehicles, and hay and other feed storage facilities. Premises with minimal 
biosecurity protocols in place are more likely to have disease transmission and thus 
warrant a more restrictive quarantine than a premises with a high level of 
biosecurity practices. The degree and level of commonly practiced/everyday 
biosecurity measures will significantly impact disease exposure risk on any given 
premises. Movement of personnel such as veterinarians, farriers, visitors, feed and 
bedding deliverers, and stall cleaners between areas where horses are housed 
constitute a potential risk of disease agent transmission. Therefore, the potential 
spread of EHV-1 due to these movements should be evaluated. A Biosecurity Risk 
Assessment determines the level of risk posed by current biosecurity practices on 
the premises. (See  Appendix: Sample Assessment Form)

c. Degree of Disease Agent Transmission: As the disease incident progresses, the 
situation should be evaluated to determine the level of disease agent transmission. 
Exposed horses on the premises may succumb to disease and present an additional 
disease transmission risk. Evaluate subsequent cases to determine potential time of 
exposure. Modify existing quarantine protocols if disease spread is evidenced by 
new cases with clinical disease after quarantine placement.

of consensus among regulatory veterinarians on the appropriateness of testing 
non-clinical exposed horses in an EHM incident. If testing of exposed non-clinical 
horses is being considered, then the response to a positive test result should be 
decided before initiating the testing. Non-clinical EHV-1 infected horses based on 
nasal swab and/or buffy coat testing, currently represent a non- quantifiable but 
potential risk of transmitting virus to horses to which they are exposed. As a 
precaution to minimize the risk of virus spread in any given EHM incident, non-
clinical exposed EHV-1 test positive horses should be isolated from non-clinical test 
negative and untested exposed horses.

QUARANTINE RELEASE 
Overview 
During Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) incidents, the quarantine issuing authority 
(typically the state animal health officials or horse racing authority) issue quarantines and 
subsequent releases to help prevent the spread of EHV-1. However, in some EHM incidents, 
voluntary quarantine actions are taken by private farms, public or private entities, veterinary 
teaching hospitals, horse racing authorities or private practitioners. Criteria for implementing a 
quarantine and for quarantine release should be established and each incident assessed based on 
predetermined guidelines. It must be emphasized that there is no single quarantine

-1. However, in some EHM incidents, 
voluntary quarantine actions are taken by private farms, public or private entities, veterinary 
teaching hospitals, horse racing authorities or private practitioners. Criteria for implementing a 
quarantine and for quarantine release should be established and each incident assessed based on 
predetermined guidelines. It must be emphasized that there is no single quarantine release 
protocol that is applicable to all EHM incidents. When striving for optimal disease containment, 
multiple factors must be considered based on the risk assessment performed when placing the 
quarantine. 
 
Clinically affected horses should be assumed to be contagious, particularly via the respiratory route, 
for at least 14 days. Minimal monitoring or quarantine of exposed horses should be for a minimum 
of 14 days after removal and isolation of the EHM horse. Quarantines can be amended to release 
subpopulations of animals earlier if epidemiologic investigation, biosecurity assessment and/or, the 
results of diagnostic testing deem the risk is minimal from the release of a horse or group of horses. 
 
Assessment of the level of clinical disease and the potential for disease spread on the premises is 
critical in determining whether quarantine release is warranted. Release of the quarantine can be 
based on the clinical disease status of the horses on the premises and on the outcome of diagnostic 
testing. 
 
21 Day Quarantine Release without Testing 
Release of quarantine shall be based on limiting the potential for spread of the disease agent. 
Immediate removal or appropriate isolation of EHM case(s) decreases the risk of virus transmission 
and spread within the population at potential risk of exposure. Appropriate isolation includes 
restricted access to other horses (a minimum of 30 feet, recognizing it may be greater depending 
upon ventilation, air movement, barn/stall design and other bi

 for spread of the disease agent. 
Immediate removal or appropriate isolation of EHM case(s) decreases the risk of virus transmission 
and spread within the population at potential risk of exposure. Appropriate isolation includes 
restricted access to other horses (a minimum of 30 feet, recognizing it may be greater depending 
upon ventilation, air movement, barn/stall design and other biosecurity factors), avoiding the 
sharing of equipment or personnel and utilization of protective barrier precautions. Diagnostic 
testing of nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs can help provide evidence of the risk of disease spread 
within an exposed population. However, financial constraints and the challenges of scientifically 
based interpretation of risk when dealing with a test positive non-clinical horses limit the benefits 
of diagnostic testing. Accordingly, quarantine release without testing can be an option and is based 
on the clinical disease status on the premises. Any additional horses developing clinical signs 
compatible with EHV-1 infection and diagnosed within the 14 days post strict isolation or removal

of an EHM case may be indicative of disease spread on the premises. Strict isolation of EHV-1 
clinical cases must include absolutely no horse to horse contact, no sharing of any equipment, strict 
adherence to footwear disinfection at entry/exit to stabling area and use of disposable coveralls 
and gloves. 
 
Quarantine release is recommended, if adequate biosecurity and monitoring has been maintained 
and if no new clinical cases (EHM or EHV-1 cases) are identified in the 21 days from the date of 
removal of the EHM case(s) or 21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case placed in isolation 
or

Quarantine release is recommended, if adequate biosecurity and monitoring has been maintained 
and if no new clinical cases (EHM or EHV-1 cases) are identified in the 21 days from the date of 
removal of the EHM case(s) or 21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case placed in isolation 
or the 21 days from the onset of clinical signs in the last neurologic horse placed in isolation on the 
premises. Monitoring of the exposed population for any clinical signs compatible with EHV-1 
infection includes twice daily temperature monitoring and direct observation for compatible clinical 
signs. Any horses subsequently displaying compatible clinical signs of EHV-1 infection including but 
not limited to fever should be immediately isolated and it should be assumed this is a new EHV-1 
case, unless diagnostic testing rules out EHV-1 infection and another non-contagious cause of fever 
is found the countdown clock for quarantine release should begin again at 21 days. 
 
Note, a 14 day quarantine release for exposed horses may be considered when there is immediate 
removal (within 12 hours) of the index EHM case and there is evidence of limited potential for 
disease agent spread due to adequate biosecurity and monitoring of horses. 
 
Quarantine Release with Testing 
Testing of clinical horses for release of quarantine may shorten the quarantine period. Testing only 
reflects the status of an individual horse on the day of sampling. Positive results could reflect 
reactivation of latent infection or recent exposure. A positive EHV-1 test results warrants further 
investigation to determine if further virus spread is occurring on a premises. If virus spread is 
evident, the quarantine should remain in place. Negative test results from nasal swab and buffy 
coat

 an individual horse on the day of sampling. Positive results could reflect 
reactivation of latent infection or recent exposure. A positive EHV-1 test results warrants further 
investigation to determine if further virus spread is occurring on a premises. If virus spread is 
evident, the quarantine should remain in place. Negative test results from nasal swab and buffy 
coat samples may warrant release of the quarantine. Exposed and clinical horses may be tested 14- 
21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case or from the onset of signs in the last neurologic 
horse in assessing the infection status of a premises. 
 
There is a lack of consensus among regulatory veterinarians on the appropriateness of testing 
exposed non-clinical horses. The interpretation of such results based on existing scientific risk 
assessments is problematic. This is because the non-clinical horses that tests positive for EHV-1 on 
nasopharyngeal swab and/or buffy coat, currently represents a non-quantifiable but potential risk 
of transmitting virus to other horses to which it is exposed. 
 
As a precaution and to minimize the risk of disease spread in any given EHM incident, any EHV-1 
test positive horse should be isolated from test negative and non-clinical exposed horses.

Utilization of Testing Results for Quarantine Modification or Release 
1. Testing of Confirmed EHV-1 Clinical Horses: A confirmed EHM case or EHV-1 case with two 
subsequent PCR negative nasal swab and/or buffy coat samples obtained 7 days apart is

 Testing Results for Quarantine Modification or Release 
1. Testing of Confirmed EHV-1 Clinical Horses: A confirmed EHM case or EHV-1 case with two 
subsequent PCR negative nasal swab and/or buffy coat samples obtained 7 days apart is 
considered to pose a minimal disease transmission risk, thus quarantine release is 
recommended. Note, a minimum of 14 days under quarantine is recommended. 
2. Testing of Exposed Non- Clinical Horses: There is a lack of consensus among regulatory 
veterinarians on the appropriateness of testing these non-clinical exposed horses. Testing of 
exposed horses 14 to 21 days from the resolution of the last febrile case or from the onset 
of the last neurologic signs in a horse may be utilized to assess infection status among 
horses on the premises. Any virus positive horse(s) should be promptly removed from the 
group and isolated until confirmed negative on nasal swab and buffy coat PCR testing, or in 
the absence of testing, an adequate period in quarantine before release. As for the 
remaining animals in the exposed group, the clock has to be reset in terms of the period 
they are held in quarantine since one or more of them may have been exposed to the virus 
and may become a shedder.

EHM INVESTIGATION GUIDELINES 
 
Introduction 
In preparation for an EHM investigation, review the biosecurity and diagnostic testing 
recommendations in previous sections of this document.  
When conducting an EHM incident investigation it is helpful to first identify the five “W’s”: which, 
what, where, when, and why?  
• Which is the suspect EHM horse? The age, breed, use, EHV-1 vaccination status and clinical 
signs are important details to record.  
• What is the clinical presentation, the status of the diagnostic testing and physical 
examination? What is the disease agent? The diagnostic test results are essential in 
confirming an EHM diagnosis and determining the case designation category.  
• Where is the EHM horse currently located and where has it recently been? The location of 
the index horse at time of diagnosis and all locations of the index horse for the two weeks 
prior to onset of clinical signs are critical components to the investigation.  
• When did the initial clinical sign(s) appear? Determination of disease onset or exposure date 
is critical to evaluating risks to exposed horses.  
• Why did this/these horse(s) succumb to the disease? Researchers are trying to determine 
why some horses become neurologic while others exposed to EHV-1 don’t. Thus the 
epidemiologic investigation and data collection for all confirmed cases is critical.  
 
Once the basic information on the index horse or the affected animals is obtained, the objective of 
the investigation is to identify the disease transmission risk factors on the premises, so that they 
can be targeted in any control and prevention plan. The most common transmission route is via the

epidemiologic investigation and data collection for all confirmed cases is critical.  
 
Once the basic information on the index horse or the affected animals is obtained, the objective of 
the investigation is to identify the disease transmission risk factors on the premises, so that they 
can be targeted in any control and prevention plan. The most common transmission route is via the 
respiratory tract by aerosolized droplets of respiratory secretions. Infection is spread by direct 
horse-to-horse contact, as well as indirectly by contaminated surfaces or objects including 
personnel. Environmental transmission of the disease agent of primary concern during an outbreak 
can occur especially when horses are kept in close confinement. Environmental persistence of the 
EHV-1 virus is estimated to be less than 7 days under most conditions with a maximum 
environmental survival of 30 days. Once the EHM incident investigation identifies the risk factors 
for exposure, control measures must be implemented to 1.) Limit the extent of spread and possibly, 
severity of clinical disease on the premises and 2.) Limit the spread of disease to adjacent or 
exposed premises. (See Appendix: EHM Case Investigation Form and Exposed/Trace Horse 
Investigation Form.)

Revised January 2018 
GENERAL BIOSECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EHM EXPOSED AND 
QUARANTINED PREMISES 
1. Isolate any clinical cases as soon as they are identified 
a. Isolation is critical to controlling disease. Ideally, at the onset of suspicion of a 
compatible clinical sign of EHV -1 infection, isolate the affected horse a minimum of 30 
feet from all other horses and potentially further depending on multiple factors 
previously described in these guidelines. Appropriate diagnostics should be utilized to 
determine cause of compatible clinical signs. (For sample collection and diagnostics 
selection see Diagnostic Testing section of this document) 
b. Restrict contact with horses to those designated personnel. If possible, assign specific 
personnel to work on positive or suspect cases. Ideally, these designated individuals 
should not handle any other horses on the property. 
c. Place a footwear disinfectant station and hand sanitizer outside each isolation stall. 
Provide disposable gloves for designated personnel to wear when handling EHV-1 test 
positive or suspect EHV-1/EHM horses. 
d. Restrict access to the isolation area to essential personnel and the isolated animals. 
e. Handle isolated horses last; personnel handling isolated horses should not be handling 
other horses without changing clothes. Provide disposable coveralls for use if a change 
of clothes is not feasible when entering and exiting the isolation area. 
f. Clean and disinfect the stabling area where the EHV-1 test positive or suspect EHV- 
1/EHM horse has been. 
 
2. Quarantine 
a. Quarantine of the premises means that there should be no horse movement on or off 
the premises

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 clothes is not feasible when entering and exiting the isolation area. 
f. Clean and disinfect the stabling area where the EHV-1 test positive or suspect EHV- 
1/EHM horse has been. 
 
2. Quarantine 
a. Quarantine of the premises means that there should be no horse movement on or off 
the premises. 
b. Post signage regarding quarantine and biosecurity measures in common areas, such as 
on the notice board outside the office, near restrooms and at entry areas to each barn. 
c. Communicate the current quarantine situation to all horse owners and trainers at the 
facility. 
d. Limit premises access to essential personnel and vehicles and monitor perimeter of the 
premises for non-authorized entries. 
 
3. Monitor all horses on premises 
a. Obtain and record the body temperatures of all horses on the premises twice daily. 
Ideally obtain horse’s body temperature first thing in the morning and last thing in the 
evening and before administering medications which may decrease the body 
temperature. 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  29 
Revised January 2018 
b. Report a fever (any temperature of 101.5°F or greater) to a veterinarian for follow up 
collection of nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs and blood to test for EHV-1. 
c. Monitor all horses for clinical signs compatible with EHV-1 infection, which include 
ocular or nasal discharge, limb edema, abortion and neurologic signs such as unsteady 
gait, weakness, urine dribbling, lack of tail tone and recumbency. Report the observation 
of any of these signs to the veterinarian designated for follow up collection of

gait, weakness, urine dribbling, lack of tail tone and recumbency. Report the observation 
of any of these signs to the veterinarian designated for follow up collection of 
nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs and blood sampling to test for EHV-1. 
 
4. Restrict human, pet and vehicle traffic from exposed-horse areas 
a. Restrict personnel access to only those necessary for the care of the exposed horses. 
b. Do not permit dogs in horse areas. Dogs have the potential to carry the virus from one 
area to another on their body. 
c. Restrict vehicle traffic including feed/supply delivery vehicles, from entering horse 
stabling areas.  Designate an area where vehicles should be parked away from the stable 
area. 
d. For extended quarantine situations, farriers and other service provider personnel should 
take appropriate biosecurity measures as outlined in this section to reduce risk of 
spreading the virus. 
 
5. Limit direct horse-to-horse contact 
a. Limit potential horse contact in common areas, such as wash stalls, aisle ways and 
arenas. 
b. Limit potential horse-to-horse contact when possible by closing upper stall doors or 
installing a physical barrier to restrict horses from extending their heads into the aisle 
ways. 
 
6. Limit stress to horses 
a. An EHV-1 exposed horse may potentially be incubating the virus. With stress, an exposed 
horse has a higher likelihood of developing clinical disease and shedding a significant 
amount of virus from the respiratory tract. 
b. Any decision

 to restrict horses from extending their heads into the aisle 
ways. 
 
6. Limit stress to horses 
a. An EHV-1 exposed horse may potentially be incubating the virus. With stress, an exposed 
horse has a higher likelihood of developing clinical disease and shedding a significant 
amount of virus from the respiratory tract. 
b. Any decision regarding management of exposed horses should balance the need to 
contain the disease agent spread with the stress that would occur based on 
management imposed on exposed horses. For example, at race tracks exercise of 
exposed but non-clinical horses is allowed after all other horses have trained and been 
removed from the track since regular exercise of race horses is very important to their 
wellbeing. 
 
 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  30 
Revised January 2018 
7. Eliminate sharing of equipment and personnel 
a. Clean and disinfect all brushes, halters, cross ties, lead ropes and tack which have 
previously been shared. 
b. Avoid use of common halters, cross ties, lead ropes, wipe rags, sponges and tack. Use 
individual equipment for each horse; avoid sharing equipment. 
c. If equipment must be shared, clean and disinfect all equipment before and after each 
use. This includes feed buckets and other feeding and stall cleaning utensils. 
d. Avoid tying horses to fences or tie rails. 
e. Avoid possible viral contamination of water buckets by not allowing the hose to enter or 
contact the bucket when filling the bucket with water. 
f. Designate traffic pattern for wheeled vehicles (i.e. tractors, gators, wheelbarrow etc.) 
used for handling hay, feed, shavings or supplies to limit disease

 or tie rails. 
e. Avoid possible viral contamination of water buckets by not allowing the hose to enter or 
contact the bucket when filling the bucket with water. 
f. Designate traffic pattern for wheeled vehicles (i.e. tractors, gators, wheelbarrow etc.) 
used for handling hay, feed, shavings or supplies to limit disease spread. 
8. Clean and Disinfect 
a. Clean all barn, other stabling, trailer, or other equine contact surfaces thoroughly, 
removing all organic matter (dirt, nasal secretions, uneaten feed, manure, etc.) before 
applying a disinfectant. It is important to remember that organic material decreases the 
effectiveness of the disinfectant, especially if 10% bleach is used as the disinfectant. 
b. Clean all shared equipment and shared areas to remove dirt and manure before 
application of a disinfectant.  
c. Completely clean and disinfect the stall surfaces of the known-infected horse and any 
equipment and objects that may be contaminated. Properly dispose of potentially 
contaminated materials generated by the cleaning and disinfection process. 
 
9. Use footwear disinfectant, hand sanitizer   
a. Place footwear disinfection stations and hand sanitizers at other strategic locations, 
throughout the barn areas and encourage their use. 
b. Encourage regular cleaning of footwear disinfection stations and ensure use of 
footwear disinfection stations upon entry and exit of infected animal stalls. 
c. Routinely clean footwear disinfection stations to avoid buildup of organic material, 
such as dirt and manure, which may inactivate the disinfectant. 
d. Assign a person to monitor the footwear disinfection station and promptly clean and 
replenish the disinfectant as needed.

10.  Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Isolated Horses (an excellent training module 
on PPE for veterinarians can be accessed at the following link—module #10): 
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/ct_aast 
a. Assign a person knowledgeable on infection disease protocols to oversee isolated sick 
horse stabling.  This person shall ensure proper donning and doffing of PPE.  
b.  Reusable coveralls should be clean upon entry into isolated stabling and should be used 
for a single designated animal. Re-use of coveralls should be permitted provided there is 
limited contamination of outer surface.  
c.  Disposable coveralls should only be used for handling one infected horse and can be re-
used provided they have limited amount of contamination and are stored in a manner to 
prevent virus spread.  
d. Coveralls being reused should be stored properly to limit contamination and transfer of 
virus.  
e. Disposable coveralls should be dedicated to one individual and not shared amongst 
personnel.  
f. Outerwear should be donned in a manner which prevents contamination of inner or 
outer surfaces. Ideally,

d. Coveralls being reused should be stored properly to limit contamination and transfer of 
virus.  
e. Disposable coveralls should be dedicated to one individual and not shared amongst 
personnel.  
f. Outerwear should be donned in a manner which prevents contamination of inner or 
outer surfaces. Ideally, outwear should be donned in a clean dry ground surface (i.e. 
pavement). 
g. Excessively soiled or ripped disposable coveralls should be properly disposed to limit 
virus spread.  
h. For specifics regarding PPE supplies, please see attached chart on the following page. 
 
11. Bedding from isolated horses. Soiled bedding can contain infectious virus. 
a. Dedicated cleaning equipment should be maintained for each stall/horse. 
b. Disposal of soiled bedding should be handled in such a manner as to limit 
access/exposure to other horses, barns and structures on the premises. 
NOTE: 
Isolation of all mules away from horses may be an important strategy in EHV-1 disease control 
during an EHM incident. Recent scientific studies have investigated the role of mules as silent 
shedders of EHV-1 during an EHM incident. During a 2011 EHV-1 disease investigation involving 
mules and horses in California, high viral nasal shedding and viremia was detected in some of the 
asymptomatic mules. It is important to note that the detection of EHV-1 in asymptomatic mule 
samples indicates their susceptibility to infection and their potential role in virus spread.

EHM INCIDENT COMMUNICATION  
Overview 
Equine Herpesvirus- 1 neurologic disease or equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is a 
topic about which a great deal of information/misinformation continues to be posted on websites, 
blogs, Facebook postings, Twitter and Instagram. With the increasing popularity of social media, the 
need for timely and accurate communication during any EHV-1 incident is critical. Stakeholders 
have recognized the need for accurate, clear, consistent information in order to make well informed 
decisions about equine health management. When factual information is lacking, misinformation 
can spread quickly creating unnecessary anxiety among equine owners and others in the industry. 
For successful communications during an EHM incident, media training for individuals involved in 
EHV-1 messaging is strongly recommended. Risk communications training provides insight into the 
key W’s that need to be addressed in disease incident communications. 
 
It is recommended that state animal health officials should establish a communication plan for an 
EHM incident well in advance of the incident. Appropriate contacts with industry, other state 
equine officials and federal resources should be made prior to the event of an incident. Drafting 
content for webpages, alerts and printed outreach materials prior to an incident will facilitate 
timely dissemination of accurate and useful information during the incident. State animal health 
officials should explore all modes of communication and utilize effective resources for 
communicating information. 
 
To Whom to Communicate? 
Initial communication during an EHM incident starts with the index premises. To encourage 
cooperation of all parties at the onset of the incident, face-to-face meetings between the facility 
owner(s),

 animal health 
officials should explore all modes of communication and utilize effective resources for 
communicating information. 
 
To Whom to Communicate? 
Initial communication during an EHM incident starts with the index premises. To encourage 
cooperation of all parties at the onset of the incident, face-to-face meetings between the facility 
owner(s), event manager(s), and horse owners/trainers on facilities with multiple horse owners 
such as boarding facilities or racetracks, practicing veterinarians and the state animal health official 
are highly recommended. Inclusion of the regulatory officials in the communication process helps to 
give the perspective of “we are in it together” for the welfare of the horse and the industry. All 
communication should target those impacted by the EHM incident, such as the individual horse 
owners, whose concern may be centered on how the disease occurrence affects their horse(s) and 
the economic impact from possible animal losses and restrictions on movement. 
 
Once communications have taken place with the responsible person(s) on the index premises, 
information should be more widely disseminated to the equine industry at large to include but not 
limited to contacting the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) 
(www.equinediseasecc.org).

 when a quarantine was instituted as well as follow 
up information as to when the quarantine was lifted.) 
 
Delay in communications will allow time for rumors to develop and spread. It is recommended that 
state animal health officials develop a communication network for dissemination of equine disease 
alert information within their states. Some states have successfully used email lists to distribute and 
alert key equine industry representatives and equine practitioners in the state. Those alerted 
should in turn disseminate the information to their respective constituents. An email notification 
system ensures a reliable source is providing a consistent message for the state. In addition to email 
alters, state animal health webpages and social media sites can host the most current factual 
information. States with large event facilities should consider a notification system for event 
facilities including race tracks. 
When to Communicate? 
Timeliness of communication is critical. However, it is essential to first consider the need to 
communicate the information. For example, a single horse out on pasture that has never left the 
premises and has no potential to expose another horse may not warrant communication to the 
entire equine industry as there is minimal risk outside of the horse’s index premises. However, a 
horse displaying neurologic signs five days after participating at a large national horse show along 
with a history of a fever preceding the development of neurologic signs, that has been confirmed 
positive test for EHV-1, presents a significant risk and warrants widespread dissemination of 
information on the status of the situation. 
 
It is recommended that communications with the industry occur within 24 hours of the initial 
investigation and confirmation of the EHM case. States with experience in communicating EHM 
incidents have cautioned others that communicating about a suspect but not yet confirmed case of 
EHM may be premature as

 risk and warrants widespread dissemination of 
information on the status of the situation. 
 
It is recommended that communications with the industry occur within 24 hours of the initial 
investigation and confirmation of the EHM case. States with experience in communicating EHM 
incidents have cautioned others that communicating about a suspect but not yet confirmed case of 
EHM may be premature as there are many differential diagnoses for a previously febrile horse that 
is now exhibiting neurologic signs. Therefore, it is recommended that only confirmed case 
information be disseminated to the industry. Where a rampant rumor mill situation exists, state 
animal health official action to clearly communicate the status of the situation is necessary. The 
state animal health official may want to acknowledge that an investigation is ongoing but that no 
cases of EHM have as of yet been confirmed and indicate when further information will be made 
available. 
What to Communicate? 
The key to communication is providing factual information that addresses the concerns of the 
industry. Do not speculate. The outreach to affected premises should include specific biosecurity 
recommendations and quarantine parameters. Owners of all identified exposed horses should be 
provided a temperature monitoring log for tracking twice daily temperatures and any other clinical 
signs.

There are multiple different stakeholders in equine disease communication. Generally equine 
stakeholders want to know if a particular EHM incident can impact them. For example, the 
individual horse owner is concerned about risk to his/her horse, the show manager is concerned 
about risk to their event, and the equine practitioner is concerned about risk to the health of the 
horses in their practice area. Each individual utilizes the information available to assess risk as it

 want to know if a particular EHM incident can impact them. For example, the 
individual horse owner is concerned about risk to his/her horse, the show manager is concerned 
about risk to their event, and the equine practitioner is concerned about risk to the health of the 
horses in their practice area. Each individual utilizes the information available to assess risk as it 
pertains to them and their role in an incident. The critical information state animal health official 
can provide to the stakeholders includes: how many horses are affected, the population of horses 
affected, potential exposures, and the measures implemented to limit the disease spread. This 
information can be in the form of social media alerts, webpage updates and printed outreach 
materials. State animal health officials are urged to place information on their department’s 
website.  
 
State animal health officials, the AAEP and the AHC have developed a plan for a National Equine 
Disease Communication Center to assist dissemination of factual current information at 
www.equinediseasecc.org. The EDCC has been designed to become the central “go-to” source for 
information about equine infectious diseases that pose a threat to the horse industry and the 
website is intended to be a central communication resource for the equine industry to provide 
current, factual information regarding ongoing outbreaks in all fifty states.

EHV-1 VACCINATION 
 
Overview 
Currently available vaccines against EHV-1 provide some protection against the respiratory and 
abortion forms of the disease but fail to protect against EHM.  Unfortunately, there is insufficient 
data to make scientifically sound vaccination recommendations. The following summary 
information is offered for your consideration. 
 
During a presentation at the EHV workshop held at USAHA in 2013 
(http://www.usaha.org/upload/Committee/InfectiousHorses/report-hd-2013.pdf, a speaker 
indicated that there is scant scientific evidence of efficacy of any of the available vaccines against 
EHV- 1 neurologic disease.

During a presentation at the EHV workshop held at USAHA in 2013 
(http://www.usaha.org/upload/Committee/InfectiousHorses/report-hd-2013.pdf, a speaker 
indicated that there is scant scientific evidence of efficacy of any of the available vaccines against 
EHV- 1 neurologic disease. The critical event in the pathology of neurologic disease is endothelial 
vasculitis and thrombosis in the central nervous system. There is little evidence that vaccination 
with any available product prevents or decreases either event. Also mentioned were two peer 
reviewed publications that actually showed there may be an association of recent or frequent 
vaccination of horses against EHV-1 with an increased risk for development of EHM during EHV-1 
outbreaks. 
 
Vaccination of competitive horses with EHV-1 products is common. For example: The USEF 
currently requires horses over 7 months of age to be vaccinated for EHV within six months prior to 
entering the grounds or stable areas of their sanctioned events. A number of racing jurisdictions 
have similar requirements. The current AAEP vaccination guidelines recommend vaccination for 
EHV every 6 months for: animals on facilities with frequent horse movement, show and 
performance horses, racetracks and other high risk environments and horses less than 5 years of 
age. 
 
EHV-1 Vaccination Considerations 
Several EHV-1 vaccines currently marketed in North America carry a label claim for the control of 
respiratory disease induced by EHV-1 and EHV-4. These are multi-component inactivated vaccines 
specifically (as of January 2018) Prestige® (Merck), Calvenza®, Vetera (Boehringer Ingelheim

respiratory disease induced by EHV-1 and EHV-4. These are multi-component inactivated vaccines 
specifically (as of January 2018) Prestige® (Merck), Calvenza®, Vetera (Boehringer Ingelheim 
Vetmedica) and Fluvac Innovator® (Zoetis) and the single antigen modified live vaccine Rhinomune® 
(Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica). Additionally, there are two EHV-1 inactivated vaccines licensed 
for the prevention of abortion and respiratory disease; these vaccines are Pneumabort-K® (Zoetis) 
and Prodigy® (Merck). There are currently no EHV-1 vaccines licensed to prevent EHM. 
 
 
 
  
IDOHC EHM Incident Guidance Document  39 
Revised January 2018 
It has been suggested that some EHV vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of EHV-1 in outbreak 
situations by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and thus dissemination of virus. For this reason, some 
experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. 
Based upon the current available literature, the vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal 
shedding and viremia of the neuro virulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of 
abortion (Pneumabort-K® & Prodigy®), the MLV vaccine (Rhinomune®) and another inactivated 
vaccine for prevention of respiratory disease (Calvenza®)

vaccine for prevention of respiratory disease (Calvenza®) 
 
It is recognized that in an outbreak situation, some veterinarians, owners and/or trainers may elect 
to vaccinate horses on the premises. Thoughtful consideration should be given before this activity is 
initiated. If this approach is pursued, it is important to understand the following: 
1. There are no EHV-1 vaccines currently licensed to prevent EHM. 
2. Only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated and protection against 
clinical EHM should not be an expectation. 
3. A certain percent of vaccinated animals will respond with a low grade fever, lethargy 
and/or injection site discomfort for anywhere from 24 -72 hours (or longer) post 
vaccination. These fevers can exceed 101.5° F. 
4. Horses with post-vaccination fevers can increase the number of animals meeting 
isolation, monitoring and testing requirements and increase the cost of outbreak 
management. 
5. The current/previous vaccination status of each animal should be obtained and 
evaluated as part of this decision process. 
6. Vaccination should not be considered a substitute for or equivalent to implementation 
of good biosecurity measures.

• Restrict vehicle 
traffic from horse 
stabling area. 
• Limit potential horse 
contact in common 
areas such as wash 
stalls, aisle ways, tie 
rails, and arenas.
• Avoid tying horses to 
fences or in close 
proximity to each 
other.
• Limit exposure to 
respiratory secretions 
from horses that are 
heavy breathing 
during/after exercise
 
• Avoid use of communal water 
troughs
• Clean and disinfect all brushes, 
halter, cross ties, lead ropes and 
tack which have been previously 
shared
• Use individual equipment for 
each horse to avoid sharing.
• If equipment must be shared 
then clean and disinfect before 
and after each use.
• Do not allow the hose to enter or 
contact bucket when filling water 
buckets. 
• Clean all surfaces of 
dirt and manure before 
applying disinfectant 
(example: 10% bleach 
solution) Optimal to 
wash with soap and 
water then disinfect. 
• Completely clean and 
disinfect the stall of 
clinical  horses and 
contaminated 
equipment.
• Proper disposal of 
potentially 
contaminated materials
Isolation Parameters
• Isolate clinical cases at least 30 feet from all other horses. 
• Restrict access to designated individual to care for isolated case (Ideally, should not handle 
other animals on the property. If handle other horses on premises handle isolated horses last.)
• Place footbath and hand sanitizer outside each isolation stall and require use.
• Wear disposable gloves when handling isolated horses.
• Utilize disposable coveralls, foot wear
