Introduction
Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious disease of equids caused by the equine
arteritis virus (EAV).  Although typically not life-threatening to otherwise healthy adult
horses, EVA is of special concern because it can result in abortion in pregnant mares,
illness and death in young foals, and establishment of the carrier state in stallions.
Despite the presence of EAV in many equine populations throughout the world, its
prevalence in any particular country can vary widely depending upon breed.
Notwithstanding the global distribution of the causal virus, confirmed outbreaks of EVA
are reported infrequently.
Ever since the 1984 epidemic on a considerable number of thoroughbred breeding
farms in Kentucky, EVA has significantly impacted international trade in horses and

 many equine populations throughout the world, its
prevalence in any particular country can vary widely depending upon breed.
Notwithstanding the global distribution of the causal virus, confirmed outbreaks of EVA
are reported infrequently.
Ever since the 1984 epidemic on a considerable number of thoroughbred breeding
farms in Kentucky, EVA has significantly impacted international trade in horses and
equine semen.  The import control policies of most countries currently deny entry to
carrier stallions and EAV-infective semen because of the associated disease risks.
Currently, the United States is the only major horse-breeding country without an import
control policy for EVA.
Traditionally, the U.S. horse industry has attached relatively little significance to this
disease.  Efforts to achieve a greater level of control over dissemination of EAV within
the country’s equine population have been hampered by insufficient awareness of the
disease and its potential economic consequences among many within the Nation’s
horse industry.  This was clearly revealed from the findings of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring Systems’ Equine ’98 Study.  A
high percentage of individuals responding to that survey had little if any knowledge
about EVA and even less about the reasons or methods for controlling it.
Another finding of major importance to emerge from that study was the very low
seroprevalence of EAV infection in most U.S. horses.  Because they have never been
exposed to the virus, the vast majority of the Nation’s horse population could therefore
be considered completely susceptible to natural infection.
Although the international movement of horses has increased over the past 30–40
years, trade in both horses and semen has accelerated considerably during the past
decade as a result of changing economic trends in the horse industry worldwide

  Because they have never been
exposed to the virus, the vast majority of the Nation’s horse population could therefore
be considered completely susceptible to natural infection.
Although the international movement of horses has increased over the past 30–40
years, trade in both horses and semen has accelerated considerably during the past
decade as a result of changing economic trends in the horse industry worldwide.  The
absence of any restrictions on the import of carrier stallions or EAV-infective semen
into the United States has greatly increased both the likelihood of the virus’ becoming
more widely disseminated in the Nation’s equine population and the risk of economi-
cally damaging outbreaks of EVA.  This trend has been amply borne out by instances
in which imported carrier stallions or infective semen has been responsible for signifi-
cant outbreaks of EVA, including abortion in mares and mortality in young foals.  Such
importations not only augment the number of carrier stallions in the breeding popula-
tion at large but also  increase the potential for disease outbreaks through the introduc-
tion of more highly virulent strains of EAV previously exotic to the country.
This publication, “Equine Viral Arteritis:  Uniform Methods and Rules” (UM&R), con-
tains minimum standards for detecting, controlling, and preventing EVA as well as
minimum EVA requirements for the intrastate and interstate movement of equines.

Virus isolation test
Part II—Recommended Procedures (Minimum Requirements)
Laboratory tests to detect EAV or EAV antibody should be conducted according to the
methods for international trade prescribed by the OIE.  These methods are published
in the chapter on EVA in the current OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines.  The manual is available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_summry.htm>.
USDA–APHIS–VS maintains a list of laboratories approved to conduct serological
testing for EAV.  The proficiency of approved laboratories is subjected to periodic
evaluation by NVSL.  The current list of approved laboratories can be viewed at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nvsl/labcertification.htm>.
1.  Collecting samples—Serum samples are examined for the presence of antibodies

 by NVSL.  The current list of approved laboratories can be viewed at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nvsl/labcertification.htm>.
1.  Collecting samples—Serum samples are examined for the presence of antibodies
to EAV in a VN test.  Clean, nonhemolyzed, separated serum is required.  Blood
samples should be collected into a Vacutainer® tube without anticoagulant.
Following clot formation, the blood collection tube should be centrifuged and the
serum transferred to a new sterile tube.  Serum must be shipped to the testing
laboratory on ice packs.
2.  Supporting documentation needed—The purpose for testing (e.g., diagnostic,
surveillance, prevaccination) and a clinical history, including EVA vaccination status
and vaccination dates, must be provided to the testing laboratory.  A single serum
sample is sufficient to screen for the presence of EAV antibodies in a healthy horse.
A VN titer of 1:4 or greater is considered positive for EAV serum antibodies.
When samples are submitted for diagnostic purposes, paired sera are required.
The first sample is collected as early in the clinical course of the infection as
possible, and the second sample is collected 14–21 days after the first.  The two
samples are examined together in the same VN test.  Demonstration of
seroconversion or a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between the first and
second sample is significant and confirmatory of recent infection.
3.  Repeating blood collection—Occasionally, sera will be encountered that cause
nonspecific toxic changes to the cell monolayers.  These changes can interfere with
interpretation of VN results at the lower serum dilutions.  In cases where the
problem
Text Len: 1676
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 in antibody titer between the first and
second sample is significant and confirmatory of recent infection.
3.  Repeating blood collection—Occasionally, sera will be encountered that cause
nonspecific toxic changes to the cell monolayers.  These changes can interfere with
interpretation of VN results at the lower serum dilutions.  In cases where the
problem cannot be overcome by the laboratory, it may be necessary to repeat blood
collection from the horse in question and submit the new serum sample to the
testing laboratory.  The test setup schedule of the laboratory determines the turn
around time for receiving VN test results, which is normally 5–7 days.
1.  OIE reference laboratory—Isolation of EAV in cell culture is a specialized
procedure.  Attempts to perform this test should be limited to veterinary diagnostic
laboratories with experience and expertise in working with EAV.  The OIE reference
laboratory for EVA in North America is under the direction of Dr. Peter J. Timoney.  It
is located at the Department of Veterinary Science, 108 Gluck Equine Research
Center, Lexington, KY 40546–0099.  [Telephone:  (859) 257–4757, ext. 81085;
Fax:  (859) 257–8542; E-mail:  ptimoney@uky.edu).]  Laboratories wishing to
provide virus isolation for EAV are urged to contact Dr. Timoney or Dr. William

2.  Maximizing accuracy—To maximize the accuracy of attempted virus isolation, care
must be taken in sample selection and handling during shipment to the laboratory.
Submitters should contact the receiving veterinary diagnostic laboratory to
coordinate sample selection, handling and processing, and expedient shipment of
samples collected for EAV isolation attempts.  For example, use of heparin is
contraindicated when collecting whole blood samples as is the use of disinfectants
in cleansing the external genitalia of stallions before collecting a semen sample.  In
conjunction with attempted virus isolation, the EAV serostatus of each horse being
tested for virus should be determined (see the section entitled “Serology” above).
3.  Virus isolation samples—In the case of suspected outbreaks of EVA, samples for
virus isolation include nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs immersed in virus
transport media, unclotted blood using EDTA or sodium citrate as an anticoagulant,
and semen from stallions considered to be possible carriers of the virus.  When EVA
is suspected as a cause of mortality, a variety of tissues collected at necropsy
should be examined.  It is advisable to consult OIE in determining what tissues
should be sampled.  In instances of suspected EVA abortion, fetal and placental
fluids and tissues should be submitted.
4.  Semen samples—To determine the virus-shedding status of seropositive stallions,
the sperm-rich fraction of semen must be submitted.

should be examined.  It is advisable to consult OIE in determining what tissues
should be sampled.  In instances of suspected EVA abortion, fetal and placental
fluids and tissues should be submitted.
4.  Semen samples—To determine the virus-shedding status of seropositive stallions,
the sperm-rich fraction of semen must be submitted.  Semen from at least two
ejaculates should be submitted for evaluation.  The preferred sample size is
5–10 mL of unextended raw semen.  Less preferable is 5–10 mL of extended fresh
cooled semen.  When frozen semen is the only sample available, at least two straws
per ejaculate should be submitted to the laboratory.  Virus isolation attempts may
require more than one cell-culture passage.  The normal turnaround time for EAV
isolation testing is 10–14 days.
1.  Test before breeding—Before being used for breeding, stallions should have a blood
sample collected and tested for antibodies to EAV.  Stallions that are seronegative
should be vaccinated with an approved EVA vaccine.  EVA-vaccinated stallions
should not be exposed to EAV-infected animals and should not be used for breeding
within 28 days after their initial vaccination.  Stallions should be annually
revaccinated against EVA.
2.  Seropositive stallions—It is recommended that the following procedures be followed
when stallions test positive for antibodies to EAV.
a.  If the stallion’s owner can document that the animal was seronegative for
antibodies to EAV before being vaccinated for EVA, the procedures listed under
E.1 should be followed.  A valid EVA vaccination certificate is needed to
document the stallion’s negative prevaccination antibody status.
b.

AV.
a.  If the stallion’s owner can document that the animal was seronegative for
antibodies to EAV before being vaccinated for EVA, the procedures listed under
E.1 should be followed.  A valid EVA vaccination certificate is needed to
document the stallion’s negative prevaccination antibody status.
b.  If the stallion’s owner cannot document that an antibody titer to EAV was the
result of vaccination, one of the two procedures listed below should be followed.
E. Testing Procedures
12
(1)  Breed the stallion to two mares that are negative for EAV antibodies.  Test
mares must be tested approximately 28 days after breeding for the presence
of antibodies to EAV.  A negative test result on the two test mares will qualify
the stallion for breeding.  The stallion will be classified as a seropositive
nonshedding stallion.
Or:
(2)  Collect semen from the stallion and submit it to a laboratory approved for the
isolation of EAV.  A negative virus isolation result qualifies the stallion for
breeding.  The stallion will be classified as a seropositive nonshedding
stallion.  This stallion will be eligible for EVA vaccination and should be
annually vaccinated against the disease.
c.  The farm’s veterinarian must document all vaccinations and submit an EVA
 vaccination certificate to the State Veterinarian within 7 days of the vaccination
 date.
(1) Before a stallion receives its first EVA vaccination, a blood sample must be
collected, either very shortly prior to or at the time of vaccination.
(2) A stallion’s prior EVA test history will establish how the EVA UM&R will be
applied in determining the stallion

collected, either very shortly prior to or at the time of vaccination.
(2) A stallion’s prior EVA test history will establish how the EVA UM&R will be
applied in determining the stallion’s breeding status.
d.  When a shedding stallion is approved for breeding by the State
 Veterinarian, the procedures listed next should be followed.
(1) The owner or agent of a mare booked to a carrier stallion, or seeking such a
booking, must be notified in writing by the stallion’s owner or agent that the
animal is classified as a carrier of EAV.   A written copy of the booking
confirmation must be sent to the State Veterinarian.
(2) The carrier stallion must be housed, handled, and bred in a facility isolated
from noncarrier stallions.
(3) A carrier stallion can be bred to a mare that was vaccinated against EVA at
least 21 days before breeding or that has an antibody titer to EAV from
previous natural exposure to the virus.
(4) A carrier stallion can be bred to a seronegative mare that can be kept in total
isolation from other seronegative equines for 3 to 4 weeks after breeding.
(5)  A mare with clinical signs of EVA should not be bred until it has been
               documented that she is seropositive for antibodies to EAV.

1.  Notification of State Veterinarian—When an EVA outbreak is suspected, the farm or
attending veterinarian should immediately contact the State Veterinarian.  In
jurisdictions where EVA is not a reportable disease, a self-imposed quarantine
should be implemented immediately on the affected premises to restrict further
spread of the infection.
2.  Farm outbreaks—For a quarantine to be maximally effective, immediate restrictions
must be imposed on the movement of all horses associated with the premises.
Take these actions as soon as you suspect an outbreak:
a.  Promptly isolate all affected horses.
b.  Notify the farm or attending veterinarian immediately.
c.  In consultation with the farm or attending veterinarian, seek laboratory
confirmation of a diagnosis as soon as possible.
d.  In the case of abortion or death in a newborn foal, place the placenta, fetus, or
 foal in a leakproof bag, keep cold (not frozen), and dispatch to the nearest
 qualified diagnostic laboratory.
e.  Disinfect the stall, any equipment, or other potentially contaminated facilities
 using a phenolic disinfectant.  After treatment with disinfectant, dispose of any
 bedding by composting in an area away from other horses.
f.   Using the antiseptic recommended by the farm or attending veterinarian, wash
down the hindquarters and tail of any mare that has aborted and isolate her from
other horses for 4 weeks.
g.  Restrict movement of horses onto and off the affected premises.
h.  Suspend breeding and training operations until the outbreak is over and notify
 owners of mares on the affected premises

g.  Restrict movement of horses onto and off the affected premises.
h.  Suspend breeding and training operations until the outbreak is over and notify
 owners of mares on the affected premises.  Mares affected with EVA can be
 safely bred later in the same breeding season once they have fully recovered
 from the disease and once the outbreak has run its course.
i.   Monitor horses at weekly intervals to check for any additional spread of the virus.
 If no further clinical cases of EVA or serologically confirmed cases of infection
 have occurred for 3 consecutive weeks, the outbreak can be considered over,
 and all movement restrictions can be lifted.
j.   Vaccinate all at-risk horses.
3.  Racetrack outbreaks—Measures to be taken in the event of an EVA outbreak at
a racetrack, equestrian event, or horse show are broadly similar to those
recommended for dealing with an outbreak on a breeding farm.  Major emphasis
should be placed on isolating animals, restricting movement in and out of the

facility, and vaccinating all at-risk animals at the earliest opportunity.  However, EVA
outbreaks at racetracks may involve conflicting interests.  Measures to restrict the
spread of infection at such venues often interfere with racing and frequently do not
find favor with track management, trainers, and owners.  In addition to the steps
outlined for farm outbreaks, implement these specific measures as soon as an EVA
outbreak is suspected at a racetrack:
a.  Isolate all affected horses.
b.Prohibit the movement of horses between barns that have housed affected

 with racing and frequently do not
find favor with track management, trainers, and owners.  In addition to the steps
outlined for farm outbreaks, implement these specific measures as soon as an EVA
outbreak is suspected at a racetrack:
a.  Isolate all affected horses.
b.Prohibit the movement of horses between barns that have housed affected
horses.
c.Restrict the movement of horses stabled in such barns other than for racing or
training.
d.  Establish temporary, sanitized stabling facilities for ship-ins.
e.  Require that a health certificate accompany all horses coming to the track.
f.  Require a 48-hour departure slip from the State Veterinarian and require the
certifying veterinarian to contact the jurisdiction of the horse’s destination for
approval to return home.
1.  Vaccine—It has been possible to develop effective programs for the prevention and
control of EVA based on the known characteristics of the causal agent and
epidemiology of the disease.  This infection can be controlled by minimizing or
eliminating direct or indirect contact with various secretions, excretions, or tissues of
infected horses.  An important adjunct to the success of existing EVA control
programs is the availability of a safe and effective vaccine against the disease
(ARVAC®, Ft. Dodge Animal Health).
2.  Nonbreeding farm settings—The goal of current control programs is to restrict the
dissemination of EAV in breeding horse populations in order to prevent outbreaks of
EVA-related abortion or illness and death in young foals and establishment of the
carrier state in stallions and postpubertal colts.  Even though EAV has sometimes

dissemination of EAV in breeding horse populations in order to prevent outbreaks of
EVA-related abortion or illness and death in young foals and establishment of the
carrier state in stallions and postpubertal colts.  Even though EAV has sometimes
been known to cause widespread outbreaks of disease at venues such as race
tracks, horse shows, sales, and equestrian events, currently there are no control
programs specifically directed at preventing the spread of the virus in nonbreeding
farm settings.

G.  Control Procedures
3.  Specific measures—Critical to the effectiveness of EVA prevention and control
programs is the observance of sound management practices that can help minimize
the risk of spreading this and various other equine infectious diseases.  All control
programs developed so far highlight the uniquely important role of the carrier
stallion in the epidemiology of EVA.  Such animals are the primary reservoir of the
virus and serve as long-term sources of infection, transmitting EAV to susceptible
mares either through natural cover or by artificial insemination.  The following
specific preventive measures can help minimize the spread of EAV in breeding
horse populations:
a.  Isolate all new arrivals and horses returning from other farms, sales, or race
 tracks for 3 to 4 weeks.
b.  If at all possible, segregate pregnant mares from other horses and maintain
 mares in small groups based on anticipated foaling dates until they have foaled.
c.  Before each breeding season, blood-test all new breeding stallions for the
 presence of antibodies to EAV.
d.  Have the semen of any antibody-positive, nonvaccinated stallion laboratory-
 tested to identify any carrier animals.
e.  Annually vaccinate all noncarrier breeding stallions at least 4 weeks before the
 start of each breeding season.
f

 each breeding season, blood-test all new breeding stallions for the
 presence of antibodies to EAV.
d.  Have the semen of any antibody-positive, nonvaccinated stallion laboratory-
 tested to identify any carrier animals.
e.  Annually vaccinate all noncarrier breeding stallions at least 4 weeks before the
 start of each breeding season.
f.   Physically isolate any EAV-carrier stallions.
g.  Observe strict hygienic precautions when breeding or collecting semen from
 carrier stallions to avoid the risk of inadvertent transfer of infection through
 indirect contact with virus-contaminated objects.
h.  Restrict breeding EAV-carrier stallions to vaccinated mares or mares that have
 previously tested positive for naturally acquired antibodies to the virus.
i.   Vaccinate EAV antibody-negative mares against EVA at least 3 weeks before
 breeding to a known carrier stallion or with virus-infective semen.
j.   For 3 weeks after they have been bred to a carrier stallion, isolate mares
 vaccinated for the first time against EVA from all but known EAV antibody-
 positive horses.  It is especially important to avoid contact between such mares
     and other pregnant mares to which the virus can be spread by the respiratory
 route.
k.  In breeds or areas in which there is a high prevalence of EAV infection, vaccinate
all immature male foals between 6 and 12 months of age against EVA as advised
by your veterinarian.  If implemented over a period of years, such a program of
targeted vaccination would greatly reduce the number of carrier stallions and
largely eliminate the primary reservoir of EAV.

l.  Determine the infectivity status of semen used for artificial insemination,

cover to a carrier stallion.
4.  Voluntary protocol available—A voluntary, industry-driven protocol to assist
breeders in preventing the spread of EVA was developed by a working group
convened by the AHC in 1996.  The guidelines, released in August 1997, were
widely endorsed and are available at the Council’s Web site:
 <http://www.horsecouncil.org>.  Click on the Equine Health Advisory box.
5.  Vaccination debate—Because outbreaks of EVA are sporadic and infrequent in
settings such as racetracks, horse shows, sales, and veterinary clinics, it is
debatable whether a more widespread policy of vaccination against EVA would be
justified.  Implementation of such a program of prophylactic vaccination would have
repercussions on international trade with certain countries that currently debar the
import of horses seropositive for antibodies to EAV.
1.  Official health certificate—Equines entering a State from another State or from
another country should be accompanied by an official health certificate stating that
they are free from clinical signs of an infectious disease (which by inference
includes EVA).

another country should be accompanied by an official health certificate stating that
they are free from clinical signs of an infectious disease (which by inference
includes EVA).
2.  Seropositive stallions or EAV-infective semen—Breeding stallions and equine
semen entering a State from another State or another country should be tested for
EAV within 90 days of entry.  This means that stallions must be tested serologically,
and seropostive stallions must have their semen tested by virus isolation.  Carrier
stallions (those in which EAV has been isolated from their semen) and EAV-infective
semen must be certified.  These results appear as a certifying statement—
written on the health certificate—that the consignee has been advised and
consents to the shipment.  Vaccinated mares can be bred to infected stallions
or inseminated with semen from an infected stallion.
3.  Permit—All carrier stallions and EAV-infective semen entering a State should  be
moved only on a permit issued by the State Veterinarian.  All parties associated with
the movement of carrier stallions and EAV-infective semen into or within the State
should be made aware that these animals may be subject to quarantine at any time.
4.  Regulations—States should develop regulations allowing for the interstate
movement of carrier stallions and EAV-infected semen.

distribute other available educational material such as EVA breeding guidelines
(AAEP or AHC) and the USDA video and CD on EVA; distribute information on
testing, laboratories, and testing protocols; and invite speakers to annual meetings
and breeders’ group meetings to explain the disease and answer questions.

by encouraging
a.  Testing of breeding stock to determine immune status;

c.  Vaccinating seronegative stallions, mares, and immature colts; and
d.  Properly using and managing carrier stallions.
4.  Raising awareness—Breed registries should raise awareness and foster discussion
about EVA by
a.  Encouraging open dialog between stallion and mare owners;
b.  Encouraging buyers of imported stallions to test before or at the time of import to
 identify carrier stallions;
c.  Encouraging buyers of domestic stallions to test them as part of the prepurchase
 examination;
d.  Encouraging mare owners to ask stallion owners about the stallion’s EVA status
 before breeding; and
18
e.  Reducing the stigma attached to EVA by emphasizing that the disease is
 manageable, that it can be prevented through a vaccination program, and that
 carrier stallions can be used safely.
5.  Testing—Breed registries should require mandatory testing of all breeding stallions
as a condition of registration. Although voluntary adherence to breeding guidelines
is helpful and desirable, it will not solve all of the problems. A registry can prevent
many problems by using its influence and control over the registration process to
require testing as a condition of registration.  This eliminates any singling out of
carrier stallions and tends to discourage deception. In particular, breed registries
should take these actions:
a.  Publish the EVA status of all active breeding stallions.  On the basis of test
 results, status categories would include (1) serologically negative,
 (2) serologically positive but negative for virus in the semen (nonshedder),

Introduction
Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious disease of equids caused by the equine
arteritis virus (EAV).  Although typically not life-threatening to otherwise healthy adult
horses, EVA is of special concern because it can result in abortion in pregnant mares,
illness and death in young foals, and establishment of the carrier state in stallions.
Despite the presence of EAV in many equine populations throughout the world, its
prevalence in any particular country can vary widely depending upon breed.
Notwithstanding the global distribution of the causal virus, confirmed outbreaks of EVA
are reported infrequently.
Ever since the 1984 epidemic on a considerable number of thoroughbred breeding
farms in Kentucky, EVA has significantly impacted international trade in horses and

 many equine populations throughout the world, its
prevalence in any particular country can vary widely depending upon breed.
Notwithstanding the global distribution of the causal virus, confirmed outbreaks of EVA
are reported infrequently.
Ever since the 1984 epidemic on a considerable number of thoroughbred breeding
farms in Kentucky, EVA has significantly impacted international trade in horses and
equine semen.  The import control policies of most countries currently deny entry to
carrier stallions and EAV-infective semen because of the associated disease risks.
Currently, the United States is the only major horse-breeding country without an import
control policy for EVA.
Traditionally, the U.S. horse industry has attached relatively little significance to this
disease.  Efforts to achieve a greater level of control over dissemination of EAV within
the country’s equine population have been hampered by insufficient awareness of the
disease and its potential economic consequences among many within the Nation’s
horse industry.  This was clearly revealed from the findings of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring Systems’ Equine ’98 Study.  A
high percentage of individuals responding to that survey had little if any knowledge
about EVA and even less about the reasons or methods for controlling it.
Another finding of major importance to emerge from that study was the very low
seroprevalence of EAV infection in most U.S. horses.  Because they have never been
exposed to the virus, the vast majority of the Nation’s horse population could therefore
be considered completely susceptible to natural infection.
Although the international movement of horses has increased over the past 30–40
years, trade in both horses and semen has accelerated considerably during the past
decade as a result of changing economic trends in the horse industry worldwide

  Because they have never been
exposed to the virus, the vast majority of the Nation’s horse population could therefore
be considered completely susceptible to natural infection.
Although the international movement of horses has increased over the past 30–40
years, trade in both horses and semen has accelerated considerably during the past
decade as a result of changing economic trends in the horse industry worldwide.  The
absence of any restrictions on the import of carrier stallions or EAV-infective semen
into the United States has greatly increased both the likelihood of the virus’ becoming
more widely disseminated in the Nation’s equine population and the risk of economi-
cally damaging outbreaks of EVA.  This trend has been amply borne out by instances
in which imported carrier stallions or infective semen has been responsible for signifi-
cant outbreaks of EVA, including abortion in mares and mortality in young foals.  Such
importations not only augment the number of carrier stallions in the breeding popula-
tion at large but also  increase the potential for disease outbreaks through the introduc-
tion of more highly virulent strains of EAV previously exotic to the country.
This publication, “Equine Viral Arteritis:  Uniform Methods and Rules” (UM&R), con-
tains minimum standards for detecting, controlling, and preventing EVA as well as
minimum EVA requirements for the intrastate and interstate movement of equines.

Part II—Recommended Procedures (Minimum Requirements)
Laboratory tests to detect EAV or EAV antibody should be conducted according to the
methods for international trade prescribed by the OIE.  These methods are published
in the chapter on EVA in the current OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines.  The manual is available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_summry.htm>.
USDA–APHIS–VS maintains a list of laboratories approved to conduct serological
testing for EAV.  The proficiency of approved laboratories is subjected to periodic
evaluation by NVSL.  The current list of approved laboratories can be viewed at

to EAV in a VN test.  Clean, nonhemolyzed, separated serum is required.  Blood
samples should be collected into a Vacutainer® tube without anticoagulant.
Following clot formation, the blood collection tube should be centrifuged and the
serum transferred to a new sterile tube.  Serum must be shipped to the testing
laboratory on ice packs.
2.  Supporting documentation needed—The purpose for testing (e.g., diagnostic,
surveillance, prevaccination) and a clinical history, including EVA vaccination status
and vaccination dates, must be provided to the testing laboratory.  A single serum
sample is sufficient to screen for the presence of EAV antibodies in a healthy horse.
A VN titer of 1:4 or greater is considered positive for EAV serum antibodies.
When samples are submitted for diagnostic purposes, paired sera are required.
The first sample is collected as early in the clinical course of the infection as
possible, and the second sample is collected 14–21 days after the first.  The two
samples are examined together in the same VN test.  Demonstration of
seroconversion or a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between the first and
second sample is significant and confirmatory of recent infection.
3.  Repeating blood collection—Occasionally, sera will be encountered that cause
nonspecific toxic changes to the cell monolayers.  These changes can interfere with
interpretation of VN results at the lower serum dilutions.  In cases where the

 in antibody titer between the first and
second sample is significant and confirmatory of recent infection.
3.  Repeating blood collection—Occasionally, sera will be encountered that cause
nonspecific toxic changes to the cell monolayers.  These changes can interfere with
interpretation of VN results at the lower serum dilutions.  In cases where the
problem cannot be overcome by the laboratory, it may be necessary to repeat blood
collection from the horse in question and submit the new serum sample to the
testing laboratory.  The test setup schedule of the laboratory determines the turn
around time for receiving VN test results, which is normally 5–7 days.
1.  OIE reference laboratory—Isolation of EAV in cell culture is a specialized
procedure.  Attempts to perform this test should be limited to veterinary diagnostic
laboratories with experience and expertise in working with EAV.  The OIE reference
laboratory for EVA in North America is under the direction of Dr. Peter J. Timoney.  It
is located at the Department of Veterinary Science, 108 Gluck Equine Research
Center, Lexington, KY 40546–0099.  [Telephone:  (859) 257–4757, ext. 81085;
Fax:  (859) 257–8542; E-mail:  ptimoney@uky.edu).]  Laboratories wishing to
provide virus isolation for EAV are urged to contact Dr. Timoney or Dr. William
McCollum to obtain a panel of semen samples for evaluation and to confirm their
competency in the isolation of EAV.

2.  Maximizing accuracy—To maximize the accuracy of attempted virus isolation, care
must be taken in sample selection and handling during shipment to the laboratory.
Submitters should contact the receiving veterinary diagnostic laboratory to
coordinate sample selection, handling and processing, and expedient shipment of
samples collected for EAV isolation attempts.  For example, use of heparin is
contraindicated when collecting whole blood samples as is the use of disinfectants
in cleansing the external genitalia of stallions before collecting a semen sample.  In
conjunction with attempted virus isolation, the EAV serostatus of each horse being
tested for virus should be determined (see the section entitled “Serology” above).
3.  Virus isolation samples—In the case of suspected outbreaks of EVA, samples for
virus isolation include nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs immersed in virus
transport media, unclotted blood using EDTA or sodium citrate as an anticoagulant,
and semen from stallions considered to be possible carriers of the virus.  When EVA
is suspected as a cause of mortality, a variety of tissues collected at necropsy
should be examined.  It is advisable to consult OIE in determining what tissues
should be sampled.  In instances of suspected EVA abortion, fetal and placental
fluids and tissues should be submitted.
4.  Semen samples—To determine the virus-shedding status of seropositive stallions,
the sperm-rich fraction of semen must be submitted.

should be examined.  It is advisable to consult OIE in determining what tissues
should be sampled.  In instances of suspected EVA abortion, fetal and placental
fluids and tissues should be submitted.
4.  Semen samples—To determine the virus-shedding status of seropositive stallions,
the sperm-rich fraction of semen must be submitted.  Semen from at least two
ejaculates should be submitted for evaluation.  The preferred sample size is
5–10 mL of unextended raw semen.  Less preferable is 5–10 mL of extended fresh
cooled semen.  When frozen semen is the only sample available, at least two straws
per ejaculate should be submitted to the laboratory.  Virus isolation attempts may
require more than one cell-culture passage.  The normal turnaround time for EAV
isolation testing is 10–14 days.
1.  Test before breeding—Before being used for breeding, stallions should have a blood
sample collected and tested for antibodies to EAV.  Stallions that are seronegative
should be vaccinated with an approved EVA vaccine.  EVA-vaccinated stallions
should not be exposed to EAV-infected animals and should not be used for breeding
within 28 days after their initial vaccination.  Stallions should be annually
revaccinated against EVA.
2.  Seropositive stallions—It is recommended that the following procedures be followed
when stallions test positive for antibodies to EAV.
a.  If the stallion’s owner can document that the animal was seronegative for
antibodies to EAV before being vaccinated for EVA, the procedures listed under
E.1 should be followed.  A valid EVA vaccination certificate is needed to
document the stallion’s negative prevaccination antibody status.

a.  If the stallion’s owner can document that the animal was seronegative for
antibodies to EAV before being vaccinated for EVA, the procedures listed under
E.1 should be followed.  A valid EVA vaccination certificate is needed to
document the stallion’s negative prevaccination antibody status.
b.  If the stallion’s owner cannot document that an antibody titer to EAV was the
result of vaccination, one of the two procedures listed below should be followed.
E. Testing Procedures
12
(1)  Breed the stallion to two mares that are negative for EAV antibodies.  Test
mares must be tested approximately 28 days after breeding for the presence
of antibodies to EAV.  A negative test result on the two test mares will qualify
the stallion for breeding.  The stallion will be classified as a seropositive
nonshedding stallion.
Or:
(2)  Collect semen from the stallion and submit it to a laboratory approved for the
isolation of EAV.  A negative virus isolation result qualifies the stallion for
breeding.  The stallion will be classified as a seropositive nonshedding
stallion.  This stallion will be eligible for EVA vaccination and should be
annually vaccinated against the disease.
c.  The farm’s veterinarian must document all vaccinations and submit an EVA
 vaccination certificate to the State Veterinarian within 7 days of the vaccination
 date.
(1) Before a stallion receives its first EVA vaccination, a blood sample must be
collected, either very shortly prior to or at the time of vaccination.
(2) A stallion’s prior EVA test history will establish how the EVA UM&R will be
applied in determining the stallion

(1) Before a stallion receives its first EVA vaccination, a blood sample must be
collected, either very shortly prior to or at the time of vaccination.
(2) A stallion’s prior EVA test history will establish how the EVA UM&R will be
applied in determining the stallion’s breeding status.
d.  When a shedding stallion is approved for breeding by the State
 Veterinarian, the procedures listed next should be followed.
(1) The owner or agent of a mare booked to a carrier stallion, or seeking such a
booking, must be notified in writing by the stallion’s owner or agent that the
animal is classified as a carrier of EAV.   A written copy of the booking
confirmation must be sent to the State Veterinarian.
(2) The carrier stallion must be housed, handled, and bred in a facility isolated
from noncarrier stallions.
(3) A carrier stallion can be bred to a mare that was vaccinated against EVA at
least 21 days before breeding or that has an antibody titer to EAV from
previous natural exposure to the virus.
(4) A carrier stallion can be bred to a seronegative mare that can be kept in total
isolation from other seronegative equines for 3 to 4 weeks after breeding.
(5)  A mare with clinical signs of EVA should not be bred until it has been
               documented that she is seropositive for antibodies to EAV.

1.  Notification of State Veterinarian—When an EVA outbreak is suspected, the farm or
attending veterinarian should immediately contact the State Veterinarian.

1.  Notification of State Veterinarian—When an EVA outbreak is suspected, the farm or
attending veterinarian should immediately contact the State Veterinarian.  In
jurisdictions where EVA is not a reportable disease, a self-imposed quarantine
should be implemented immediately on the affected premises to restrict further
spread of the infection.
2.  Farm outbreaks—For a quarantine to be maximally effective, immediate restrictions
must be imposed on the movement of all horses associated with the premises.
Take these actions as soon as you suspect an outbreak:
a.  Promptly isolate all affected horses.
b.  Notify the farm or attending veterinarian immediately.
c.  In consultation with the farm or attending veterinarian, seek laboratory
confirmation of a diagnosis as soon as possible.
d.  In the case of abortion or death in a newborn foal, place the placenta, fetus, or
 foal in a leakproof bag, keep cold (not frozen), and dispatch to the nearest
 qualified diagnostic laboratory.
e.  Disinfect the stall, any equipment, or other potentially contaminated facilities
 using a phenolic disinfectant.  After treatment with disinfectant, dispose of any
 bedding by composting in an area away from other horses.
f.   Using the antiseptic recommended by the farm or attending veterinarian, wash
down the hindquarters and tail of any mare that has aborted and isolate her from
other horses for 4 weeks.
g.  Restrict movement of horses onto and off the affected premises.
h.  Suspend breeding and training operations until the outbreak is over and notify
 owners of mares on the affected premises

 Using the antiseptic recommended by the farm or attending veterinarian, wash
down the hindquarters and tail of any mare that has aborted and isolate her from
other horses for 4 weeks.
g.  Restrict movement of horses onto and off the affected premises.
h.  Suspend breeding and training operations until the outbreak is over and notify
 owners of mares on the affected premises.  Mares affected with EVA can be
 safely bred later in the same breeding season once they have fully recovered
 from the disease and once the outbreak has run its course.
i.   Monitor horses at weekly intervals to check for any additional spread of the virus.
 If no further clinical cases of EVA or serologically confirmed cases of infection
 have occurred for 3 consecutive weeks, the outbreak can be considered over,
 and all movement restrictions can be lifted.
j.   Vaccinate all at-risk horses.
3.  Racetrack outbreaks—Measures to be taken in the event of an EVA outbreak at
a racetrack, equestrian event, or horse show are broadly similar to those
recommended for dealing with an outbreak on a breeding farm.  Major emphasis
should be placed on isolating animals, restricting movement in and out of the

facility, and vaccinating all at-risk animals at the earliest opportunity.  However, EVA
outbreaks at racetracks may involve conflicting interests.  Measures to restrict the
spread of infection at such venues often interfere with racing and frequently do not
find favor with track management, trainers, and owners.  In addition to the steps
outlined for farm outbreaks, implement these specific measures as soon as an EVA
outbreak is suspected at a racetrack:
a.  Isolate all affected horses.

outlined for farm outbreaks, implement these specific measures as soon as an EVA
outbreak is suspected at a racetrack:
a.  Isolate all affected horses.
b.Prohibit the movement of horses between barns that have housed affected
horses.
c.Restrict the movement of horses stabled in such barns other than for racing or
training.
d.  Establish temporary, sanitized stabling facilities for ship-ins.
e.  Require that a health certificate accompany all horses coming to the track.
f.  Require a 48-hour departure slip from the State Veterinarian and require the
certifying veterinarian to contact the jurisdiction of the horse’s destination for
approval to return home.
1.  Vaccine—It has been possible to develop effective programs for the prevention and
control of EVA based on the known characteristics of the causal agent and
epidemiology of the disease.  This infection can be controlled by minimizing or
eliminating direct or indirect contact with various secretions, excretions, or tissues of
infected horses.  An important adjunct to the success of existing EVA control
programs is the availability of a safe and effective vaccine against the disease
(ARVAC®, Ft. Dodge Animal Health).
2.  Nonbreeding farm settings—The goal of current control programs is to restrict the
dissemination of EAV in breeding horse populations in order to prevent outbreaks of
EVA-related abortion or illness and death in young foals and establishment of the
carrier state in stallions and postpubertal colts.  Even though EAV has sometimes
been known to cause widespread outbreaks of disease at venues such as race
tracks, horse shows, sales, and equest

dissemination of EAV in breeding horse populations in order to prevent outbreaks of
EVA-related abortion or illness and death in young foals and establishment of the
carrier state in stallions and postpubertal colts.  Even though EAV has sometimes
been known to cause widespread outbreaks of disease at venues such as race
tracks, horse shows, sales, and equestrian events, currently there are no control
programs specifically directed at preventing the spread of the virus in nonbreeding
farm settings.
15
G.  Control Procedures
3.  Specific measures—Critical to the effectiveness of EVA prevention and control
programs is the observance of sound management practices that can help minimize
the risk of spreading this and various other equine infectious diseases.  All control
programs developed so far highlight the uniquely important role of the carrier
stallion in the epidemiology of EVA.  Such animals are the primary reservoir of the
virus and serve as long-term sources of infection, transmitting EAV to susceptible
mares either through natural cover or by artificial insemination.  The following
specific preventive measures can help minimize the spread of EAV in breeding
horse populations:
a.  Isolate all new arrivals and horses returning from other farms, sales, or race
 tracks for 3 to 4 weeks.
b.  If at all possible, segregate pregnant mares from other horses and maintain
 mares in small groups based on anticipated foaling dates until they have foaled.
c.  Before each breeding season, blood-test all new breeding stallions for the
 presence of antibodies to EAV.
d.  Have the semen of any antibody-positive, nonvaccinated stallion laboratory-
 tested to identify any carrier animals.
e.  Annually vaccinate all noncarrier breeding stallions at least 4 weeks before the
 start of each breeding season.
f

 each breeding season, blood-test all new breeding stallions for the
 presence of antibodies to EAV.
d.  Have the semen of any antibody-positive, nonvaccinated stallion laboratory-
 tested to identify any carrier animals.
e.  Annually vaccinate all noncarrier breeding stallions at least 4 weeks before the
 start of each breeding season.
f.   Physically isolate any EAV-carrier stallions.
g.  Observe strict hygienic precautions when breeding or collecting semen from
 carrier stallions to avoid the risk of inadvertent transfer of infection through
 indirect contact with virus-contaminated objects.
h.  Restrict breeding EAV-carrier stallions to vaccinated mares or mares that have
 previously tested positive for naturally acquired antibodies to the virus.
i.   Vaccinate EAV antibody-negative mares against EVA at least 3 weeks before
 breeding to a known carrier stallion or with virus-infective semen.
j.   For 3 weeks after they have been bred to a carrier stallion, isolate mares
 vaccinated for the first time against EVA from all but known EAV antibody-
 positive horses.  It is especially important to avoid contact between such mares
     and other pregnant mares to which the virus can be spread by the respiratory
 route.
k.  In breeds or areas in which there is a high prevalence of EAV infection, vaccinate
all immature male foals between 6 and 12 months of age against EVA as advised
by your veterinarian.  If implemented over a period of years, such a program of
targeted vaccination would greatly reduce the number of carrier stallions and
largely eliminate the primary reservoir of EAV.

16
H. Movement of Stal-

l.  Determine the infectivity status of semen used for artificial insemination,
especially if imported from abroad.  When breeding mares with EAV-infective
semen, adopt the same precautions as recommended for mares bred by natural
cover to a carrier stallion.
4.  Voluntary protocol available—A voluntary, industry-driven protocol to assist
breeders in preventing the spread of EVA was developed by a working group
convened by the AHC in 1996.  The guidelines, released in August 1997, were
widely endorsed and are available at the Council’s Web site:
 <http://www.horsecouncil.org>.  Click on the Equine Health Advisory box.
5.  Vaccination debate—Because outbreaks of EVA are sporadic and infrequent in
settings such as racetracks, horse shows, sales, and veterinary clinics, it is
debatable whether a more widespread policy of vaccination against EVA would be
justified.  Implementation of such a program of prophylactic vaccination would have
repercussions on international trade with certain countries that currently debar the
import of horses seropositive for antibodies to EAV.
1.  Official health certificate—Equines entering a State from another State or from
another country should be accompanied by an official health certificate stating that
they are free from clinical signs of an infectious disease (which by inference
includes EVA).

1.  Official health certificate—Equines entering a State from another State or from
another country should be accompanied by an official health certificate stating that
they are free from clinical signs of an infectious disease (which by inference
includes EVA).
2.  Seropositive stallions or EAV-infective semen—Breeding stallions and equine
semen entering a State from another State or another country should be tested for
EAV within 90 days of entry.  This means that stallions must be tested serologically,
and seropostive stallions must have their semen tested by virus isolation.  Carrier
stallions (those in which EAV has been isolated from their semen) and EAV-infective
semen must be certified.  These results appear as a certifying statement—
written on the health certificate—that the consignee has been advised and
consents to the shipment.  Vaccinated mares can be bred to infected stallions
or inseminated with semen from an infected stallion.
3.  Permit—All carrier stallions and EAV-infective semen entering a State should  be
moved only on a permit issued by the State Veterinarian.  All parties associated with
the movement of carrier stallions and EAV-infective semen into or within the State
should be made aware that these animals may be subject to quarantine at any time.
4.  Regulations—States should develop regulations allowing for the interstate
movement of carrier stallions and EAV-infected semen.
1.  EVA education:  publication of articles—Breed registries should take a leadership
role in educating their members about EAV.  Breed registries should publish articles

e.  Educate mare owners to ask stallion owners about the EVA status of their
 stallions;
f.   Educate prospective stallion buyers to ask for EVA testing at the time of
 purchase; and
g.  Explain how to prevent the carrier state in stallions.
2.  EVA education:  additional avenues—Breed registries should also publicize and
distribute other available educational material such as EVA breeding guidelines
(AAEP or AHC) and the USDA video and CD on EVA; distribute information on
testing, laboratories, and testing protocols; and invite speakers to annual meetings
and breeders’ group meetings to explain the disease and answer questions.
3.  Safe breeding practices—Breed registries should promote safe breeding practices
by encouraging
a.  Testing of breeding stock to determine immune status;
b.  Vaccinating to control and eliminate EVA;
c.  Vaccinating seronegative stallions, mares, and immature colts; and
d.  Properly using and managing carrier stallions.
4.  Raising awareness—Breed regist

b.  Vaccinating to control and eliminate EVA;
c.  Vaccinating seronegative stallions, mares, and immature colts; and
d.  Properly using and managing carrier stallions.
4.  Raising awareness—Breed registries should raise awareness and foster discussion
about EVA by
a.  Encouraging open dialog between stallion and mare owners;
b.  Encouraging buyers of imported stallions to test before or at the time of import to
 identify carrier stallions;
c.  Encouraging buyers of domestic stallions to test them as part of the prepurchase
 examination;
d.  Encouraging mare owners to ask stallion owners about the stallion’s EVA status
 before breeding; and
18
e.  Reducing the stigma attached to EVA by emphasizing that the disease is
 manageable, that it can be prevented through a vaccination program, and that
 carrier stallions can be used safely.
5.  Testing—Breed registries should require mandatory testing of all breeding stallions
as a condition of registration. Although voluntary adherence to breeding guidelines
is helpful and desirable, it will not solve all of the problems. A registry can prevent
many problems by using its influence and control over the registration process to
require testing as a condition of registration.  This eliminates any singling out of
carrier stallions and tends to discourage deception. In particular, breed registries
should take these actions:
a.  Publish the EVA status of all active breeding stallions.  On the basis of test
 results, status categories would include (1) serologically negative,
 (2) serologically positive but negative for virus in the semen (nonshedder),

 results, status categories would include (1) serologically negative,
 (2) serologically positive but negative for virus in the semen (nonshedder),
 (3) serologically positive and positive for virus in the semen (carrier), and
 (4) serologically negative and subsequently vaccinated annually.
b.  Require annual testing of all nonvaccinated stallions.
c.  Recommend vaccination for all nonshedding stallions (after proof of negative
 test).
d.  In the case of vaccinated stallions, require proof of annual vaccination booster
 for all active breeding stallions.
e.  Keep a list of which stallions recognized by the registry are EAV-carrier
 stallions.
f.   Notify mare owners of carrier stallions through publications or in response to
 direct inquiry.
6.  Developing regulations—Breed registries should work with local horse groups and
government authorities to develop State, national, and import regulations.
