 Invasion: In Australia,C. equisetifoliasubsp.equisetifoliais mainly a small tree, 8-16 m tall, in contrast to populations in South-East Asia where the tree may attain heights of 35 m with diameters to 50 cm. The subsp.incanais typically a small tree and may be reduced to only a large shrub 6-10 m tall on poor sites. Form in wild populations is very variable, varying from crooked, low branching trees on exposed sea shores, to straight-stemmed forest trees in more sheltered situations. Crowns are finely branched. The bark is light grey-brown, smooth on small trunks, becoming rough and thick furrowed on older trees. Encircling bands of lenticels are prominent on young bark. The inner bark is reddish and astringent (Doran and Turnbull, 1997). Twigs are drooping, needle-like, furrowed, 1-2.5 mm in diameter and 23-38 cm long and angular to rounded in cross-section, glabrous or pubescent. The minute teeth-like reduced leaves are in whorls of 7-8 per node. Male flowers occur on simple terminal, elongated spikes 7-40 mm long and are arranged in whorls with 7-11.5 whorls per cm of spike. Female flowers are borne on lateral woody branches. The 'cones' are globose to short- to long- cylindrical, 10-35 mm long, 9

orls of 7-8 per node. Male flowers occur on simple terminal, elongated spikes 7-40 mm long and are arranged in whorls with 7-11.5 whorls per cm of spike. Female flowers are borne on lateral woody branches. The 'cones' are globose to short- to long- cylindrical, 10-35 mm long, 9-15 mm diameter, with acute bracteoles more or less protruding from the surface of the cone. Fruitlets bear a single, dull brown samara 6-8 mm long. In subsp.incanathe young shoots and 'cones' are frequently covered in a fine white pubescence.

 Reproduccion: Until recently there has been little research on genetic variation. Coordinated international provenance trials of subsp. equisetifolia commenced in 1992 with 40 trials established in 20 countries by 1995 ( Pinyopusarerk et al., 1995 ). These trials have displayed large phenotypic variation between populations, e.g. in growth rates, branching habits and age to first flowering. A 2-year assessment of a trial at Ratchaburi, Thailand showed Malaysian, Thailand and Papua New Guinea sources to be the highest ranked for growth rates of the natural provenances, while Indian, Chinese and Vietnamese sources were the best, on average, of the land races ( Pinyopusarerk et al., 1996a ). Outstanding growth rates of provenances from Malaysia and Thailand have also been reported in Kenya ( Kimondo, 1996 ). However, trials in Egypt ( El-Lakany and Yuness, 1996 ) and Vietnam ( Phi Quang Dien, 1996 ) showed somewhat different results suggesting a likely genotype x

 on average, of the land races ( Pinyopusarerk et al., 1996a ). Outstanding growth rates of provenances from Malaysia and Thailand have also been reported in Kenya ( Kimondo, 1996 ). However, trials in Egypt ( El-Lakany and Yuness, 1996 ) and Vietnam ( Phi Quang Dien, 1996 ) showed somewhat different results suggesting a likely genotype x site interaction. The Australian Tree Seed Centre of CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products has a comprehensive collection of seed material collected from 67 sites in 22 countries. A breeding program of C. equisetifolia in India using a large number of individual trees from this international collection is currently underway ( Pinyopusarerk, 1996 ). Casuarina equisetifolia has a lifespan of 40-50 years and displays rapid early growth rates (about 2-3 m per annum in height) in cultivation. Although it is an evergreen species, C. equisetifolia sheds a large amount of twigs throughout the year. Shoot growth is generally active for much of the year except during cool and dry months. In areas where there is pronounced wet and dry season, flowering and fruiting are more regular and occur once or twice per year ( Troup, 1921 ). Where there is no distinct wet or dry season, flowering and fruiting tend to be irregular and may occur throughout the year. The fruits on one tree do not all mature at the same time, often presenting a problem for seed collection. Elfers (1998) cites material describing a general inability to root sucker and poor coppicing except from stumps greater than 1 m tall. Although trees in natural stands are reported to be mostly monoecious, with male and female flowers separate but borne on the same tree, most cultivated populations are predominantly dioecious ( Dorairaj and Wilson, 1981 ; Luechanimitchit and Luangviriyasaeng, 1996 ).

 poor coppicing except from stumps greater than 1 m tall. Although trees in natural stands are reported to be mostly monoecious, with male and female flowers separate but borne on the same tree, most cultivated populations are predominantly dioecious ( Dorairaj and Wilson, 1981 ; Luechanimitchit and Luangviriyasaeng, 1996 ). The age to first flowering varies from 2 to 5 years ( Parrotta, 1993 ). Pollination is by wind. Female cones mature about 18-20 weeks after anthesis, and will release small samara (winged seeds) within 3 days when dried under full sun. A kilogram of cones (about 250 cones) yields 20-60 g of seed ( Kondas, 1983 ; Parrotta, 1993 ). There are about 650,000-760,000 seeds/kg but on average only 270,000 of these seeds are viable ( Turnbull and Martensz, 1983 ). The fruits on one tree do not all mature at the same time. Binggeli (1997) reports that viability lasts only a few months and that germination range is in the order 30-87%. Within the natural range of subsp. equisetifolia , the climate is hot humid to hot sub-humid, while subsp. incana inhabits mainly the warm sub-humid zone. Frosts are absent, although where subsp. incana occurs there may be one to three frosts per year within a few kilometres of the sea. It naturally occurs between 0-100 m altitude, but has been planted up to 1500 m. Temperatures are warm throughout the year with the mean maximum of the hottest month 30-35°C. In Australia, the mean minimum of the coolest month varies from 19.5°C at Darwin to mainly 10-16°C along the Queensland coast south of Cairns and as low as 6°C on parts of the northern coast of New

In Australia, the mean minimum of the coolest month varies from 19.5°C at Darwin to mainly 10-16°C along the Queensland coast south of Cairns and as low as 6°C on parts of the northern coast of New South Wales. In its introduced range it grows well where the mean annual temperature is 18-28°C during the hottest month and 10-20°C during the coldest month. In southern India, the mean maximum of the hottest month is 37-47°C, while the mean minimum decreases to 7-17°C. Over most of its distribution, C. equisetifolia occurs in areas receiving a mean annual rainfall of 1000-2500 mm with a distinct wet and dry season. When cultivated, it will thrive in a wider range of rainfall, from less than 350 mm to 5000 mm per annum ( Troup, 1921 ; Pinyopusarerk and House, 1993 ). A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Casuarina equisetifolia is commonly confined to a narrow strip adjacent to sandy shores rarely extending inland to lower hills (e.g. in Fiji). It is found on sand dunes, in sands alongside estuaries behind foredunes and gentle slopes near the sea. It may be found at the leading edge of dune vegetation, subject to salt spray and inundation with sea water at extremely high tides. Subsp. incana has been recorded growing on rocky headlands up to 30 m above sea level. Soils are well drained and rather coarse textured, principally sands, of 2 m or more in depth, often covering a more moisture-retentive layer of sandy loam. The species

Soils are well drained and rather coarse textured, principally sands, of 2 m or more in depth, often covering a more moisture-retentive layer of sandy loam. The species tolerates both calcareous and slightly alkaline soils but is intolerant of prolonged waterlogging. It grows well in soils with a pH from 5.0 to 9.5 ( Yadav et al., 1977 ; National Research Council, 1984 ; CATIE, 1991 ). It has been successfully grown in dune sands, ( Maheut and Dommergues, 1959 ; Chu and Kha, 1996 ) tin-mine spoils ( Esbenshade and Grainger, 1980 ; Thaiutsa, 1990 ) and sterile pumice ( National Research Council, 1984 ). Casuarina equisetifolia may form pure stands on the coastal dunes growing over a ground cover of dune grasses and broadleaved herbs, or can be part of a richer association of trees and shrubs collectively termed the Indo-Pacific strand flora. Tree associates in this vegetation include Barringtonia asiatica , Calophyllum inophyllum , Eugenia sp., Heritiera littoralis , Hibiscus tiliaceus , Pongamia glabra , Thespesia populnea and Pandanus sp. ( Champion, 1936 ; Doran and Turnbull, 1997 ). In Australia, it also grows in narrow belts adjacent to mangrove forests or scattered in open woodlands dominated by eucalypts.

It has been successfully grown in dune sands ( Maheut and Dommergues, 1959 ; Chu and Kha, 1996 ) and tin-mine spoils ( Esbenshade and Grainger, 1980 ; Thaiutsa, 1990 ) and sterile pumice ( National Research Council, 1984 ). It is very tolerant of salt spray and saline conditions ( Elfers, 1988 ). Casuarina equisetifolia is commonly confined to a narrow strip adjacent to sandy shores rarely extending inland to lower hills (e.g. in Fiji). It is found on sand dunes, in sands alongside estuaries behind foredunes and gentle slopes near the sea. It may be found at the leading edge of dune vegetation, subject to salt spray and inundation with sea water at extremely high tides. Subsp. incana has been recorded growing on rocky headlands up to

Uses
Extensively cultivated for fuel, erosion control, and as a windbreak.  It can
be trimmed and used as a hedge.  The bark, used for tanning, penetrates the
hide quickly, furnishing a fairly plump, pliant, soft leather of pale
reddish-brown color.  With the neutral sulfite semichemical process, wood
yields a good pulp.  The wood is used for beams, boatbuilding, electric poles,
fences, furniture, gates, house posts, mine props, oars, pavings, pilings,
rafters, roofing shingles, tool handles, wagon wheels, and yokes.  The needles
have been employed in preparing active carbon by the zinc chloride method
(C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  Hill tribes of New Guinea use
Casuarina
in
rotation to restore nitrogen to the soil.  They even use
Casuarina oligodon
as a cover crop for coffee.  Considering its unique ability to grow well,

Casuarina oligodon
as a cover crop for coffee.  Considering its unique ability to grow well,
even in highly eroded areas, Aspiras (1981) recommends it for Philippine barren
hills and watersheds.  "It is not known to deplete the soil of important
nutrients unlike other fast-growing species now being grown in the countryside.
Aside from its ability to raise the N status of the soil when grown in
rotational agriculture or in stabilizing road embankments, it also produces
good quality timber of high energy value.  It may even be raised as a nurse
plant to pine, just like
Myrica
, or planted between coconut trees for
its nitrogen and timber." (Aspiras, 1981).  In the Philippines, this is
recognized as one of the best trees for planting in sites covered by Imperata
grass (NAS, 1983e).  In Thailand it is planted along coastlines to produce the
poles used in building fish traps as well as fuelwood.  In the Dominican
Republic, it has been used to reclaim stripmine lands.  Egyptians plant the
trees along the coast to Protect houses from the wind and salt spray.

headache, nerves, pimples, sores, sorethroat, stomachache, swellings, and
toothache (Duke and Wain, 1981).  In Ternate, the seeds are used for passing
blood in diarrhea (Burkill, 1966).
Chemistry
Asparagine and glutamine accounted for 92% of the total amino acid in the
nodules.  The bark contains 10% catchol tannin, the root 15%.
Description
Tall evergreen tree to 30 m, the branches often drooping, sulcate, green, with
6–8 scalelike leaves.  Internodes 5–7.5 mm long on the branchlets, only 2.5 mm
on main shoots.  Main shoots minutely hairy, with small recurved scales ca 2.5
mm long, usually 8 in a whorl.  Male spikes usually numerous, terminating the
branches on which the female "cones" are borne lower down, cylindric to
fusiform 12–24 mm long.  Female "cones" subglobose to ellipsoid, 10–20 mm in
diameter.  Seeds ca 660,000–990,000/kg.
Germplasm
Reported from the Australian Center of Diversity, beefwood, or cvs thereof, is
reported to tolerate calcareous soils, drought, granitic soils, poor soil, salt
and salt spray, sand, waterlogging, and wind.  In Kenya, it grows around cement

, or cvs thereof, is
reported to tolerate calcareous soils, drought, granitic soils, poor soil, salt
and salt spray, sand, waterlogging, and wind.  In Kenya, it grows around cement
works, in Hawaii in sterile pumice, in Malaysia on sterile tin tailings, near
Hilo Bay on tidal rocks with its roots in salt water (NAS, 1983e).  It is
sensitive to fire, grazing, and, in early stages, weed competition.  Older
trees are problems in hurricanes.  It is one of the most fire-sensitive of the
Casaurina
species.  Subspecies incana is a small tree possibly useful
for low growing shelter belts (NAS, 1983e) (2
n
= 18).
Distribution
Said to be indigenous from Indonesia and Malaysia to India and Sri Lanka and to
north and northeast Australia, the Australian Pine is now one of the most
common trees on frost-free beaches anywhere in the world.
Ecology
Ranging from Subtropical Thorn Woodland to Wet through Tropical Thorn to Wet
Forest Life Zone,
Casuarina
is reported to tolerate annual precipitation
of 6.4 to 43 dm (mean of 49 cases = 16.0) (but 2–50 possible, NAS, 1983e),
annual temperature of 22.1 to 26.9°C (mean of 34 cases = 25.2), and pH of
5.0 to 7.7 (mean of 2 cases = 6.4) (Duke, 1978, 1979).
Cultivation
Seeds have been successfully stored for 24 months at ca -7°C to 2°C with
moisture content of 6–16% (Ag. Handbook 450).  In Hawaii seeds are broadcast in
spring and

5.0 to 7.7 (mean of 2 cases = 6.4) (Duke, 1978, 1979).
Cultivation
Seeds have been successfully stored for 24 months at ca -7°C to 2°C with
moisture content of 6–16% (Ag. Handbook 450).  In Hawaii seeds are broadcast in
spring and covered with less than 1 cm soil.  Seedling density should be about
21–32/1000 sq cm.  Mulching is not required.  Normally seedlings are raised in
nurseries to outplant taking advantage of the rainy season, 4–18 months after
sowing.  Irrigation may be needed during dry periods over the first three
years.  In new areas, seeds have to be inoculated.  They should also be treated
to repel ants.  Cuttings strike root readily.  Trees are usually spaced 2–4 m
apart.  WARNING:
Casuarina
can exhaust the soil moisture, lower the
water table, and restrict understory growth, leaving the soil exposed.  Some
species are agressive weed species.  Trees may die young under unfavorable
circumstances (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  According to the National Academy of
Sciences, this has become an undesirable weed in Florida (NRC, 1982).
Harvesting

plantations are worked under a clear-felling system, with a

greatest volume, but a shorter rotation (15 years) is preferred.  In Madras
State, the plantations are worked with a short rotation of 7–15 years (usually
10 years), while in North Kanara a 30-year rotation is followed.  From a purely
silvicultural consideration, the proper rotation appears to be 7 years.  In
parts of the Philippines, this has outgrown
Gmelina arborea
and
Leucaena
(NAS, 1983e).
Yields and Economics
With plants spaced 2 m apart, on a 7–10-year rotation, the trees may yield
75–200 MT wood/ha, i.e. 10–20 MT/ha/yr.  Higher yields have been reported.
Citing literature yields of 58–229 kg/ha/yr nitrogen, Aspiras (1981) notes that

fixes ca 60–230 kg N/ha/yr (Aspiras, 1981).  The wood,
burning with immense heat, even when green, has been called the best firewood
in the world.  In India, it is used to fuel locomotives.  It makes a good
charcoal.  In China the wood is used for firing brick kilns.  With a specific
gravity of 0.8–1.2, the wood has a calorific value of 4,959 kcal/kg (8,910
Btu).  The charcoal has a calorific value of 7,181 kcals/kg, one of the highest
reported values.  The yields of 10–20 MT/ha/yr are roughly equivalent to 25–50
barrels of oil/ha/yr.
Biotic Factors
In Puerto Rico, natural regeneration is rare because ants consume nearly all
the seeds; many trees are killed by disease.  The Puerto Rican dieback of 1940,
followed by stemcanker, has been blamed on

Other insect pests, e.g.,
Arbela tetraonis
, the bark-eating caterpillar,
Celosterna

beetle,
Oryctes rhinoceros
, also cause considerable damage to
plantations.  Infection by the root fungus
Trichosporium vesiculosum
is
among the more serious diseases affecting
Casuarina
(favored by
excessive watering and congestion).  Early thinning checks it to some extent.
Trees infected by insects and fungi should be removed and the stumps grubbed
up.  Keeping an interval of two years between felling and replanting, and
planting of other trees such as
Anacardium occidentale, Azadirachta indica,
Pithecellobium dulce, Pongamia glabra, Sapindus laurifolius,
and
Syzygium cumini
, along with
Casuarina
are recommended to segregate
the plants, minimizing the spread of infection.  It also helps attract

 Invasion: In Australia,C. equisetifoliasubsp.equisetifoliais mainly a small tree, 8-16 m tall, in contrast to populations in South-East Asia where the tree may attain heights of 35 m with diameters to 50 cm. The subsp.incanais typically a small tree and may be reduced to only a large shrub 6-10 m tall on poor sites. Form in wild populations is very variable, varying from crooked, low branching trees on exposed sea shores, to straight-stemmed forest trees in more sheltered situations. Crowns are finely branched. The bark is light grey-brown, smooth on small trunks, becoming rough and thick furrowed on older trees. Encircling bands of lenticels are prominent on young bark. The inner bark is reddish and astringent (Doran and Turnbull, 1997). Twigs are drooping, needle-like, furrowed, 1-2.5 mm in diameter and 23-38 cm long and angular to rounded in cross-section, glabrous or pubescent. The minute teeth-like reduced leaves are in whorls of 7-8 per node. Male flowers occur on simple terminal, elongated spikes 7-40 mm long and are arranged in whorls with 7-11.5 whorls per cm of spike. Female flowers are borne on lateral woody branches. The 'cones' are globose to short- to long- cylindrical, 10-35 mm long, 9

orls of 7-8 per node. Male flowers occur on simple terminal, elongated spikes 7-40 mm long and are arranged in whorls with 7-11.5 whorls per cm of spike. Female flowers are borne on lateral woody branches. The 'cones' are globose to short- to long- cylindrical, 10-35 mm long, 9-15 mm diameter, with acute bracteoles more or less protruding from the surface of the cone. Fruitlets bear a single, dull brown samara 6-8 mm long. In subsp.incanathe young shoots and 'cones' are frequently covered in a fine white pubescence.

 Reproduccion: Until recently there has been little research on genetic variation. Coordinated international provenance trials of subsp. equisetifolia commenced in 1992 with 40 trials established in 20 countries by 1995 ( Pinyopusarerk et al., 1995 ). These trials have displayed large phenotypic variation between populations, e.g. in growth rates, branching habits and age to first flowering. A 2-year assessment of a trial at Ratchaburi, Thailand showed Malaysian, Thailand and Papua New Guinea sources to be the highest ranked for growth rates of the natural provenances, while Indian, Chinese and Vietnamese sources were the best, on average, of the land races ( Pinyopusarerk et al., 1996a ). Outstanding growth rates of provenances from Malaysia and Thailand have also been reported in Kenya ( Kimondo, 1996 ). However, trials in Egypt ( El-Lakany and Yuness, 1996 ) and Vietnam ( Phi Quang Dien, 1996 ) showed somewhat different results suggesting a likely genotype x

However, trials in Egypt ( El-Lakany and Yuness, 1996 ) and Vietnam ( Phi Quang Dien, 1996 ) showed somewhat different results suggesting a likely genotype x site interaction. The Australian Tree Seed Centre of CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products has a comprehensive collection of seed material collected from 67 sites in 22 countries. A breeding program of C. equisetifolia in India using a large number of individual trees from this international collection is currently underway ( Pinyopusarerk, 1996 ). Casuarina equisetifolia has a lifespan of 40-50 years and displays rapid early growth rates (about 2-3 m per annum in height) in cultivation. Although it is an evergreen species, C. equisetifolia sheds a large amount of twigs throughout the year. Shoot growth is generally active for much of the year except during cool and dry months. In areas where there is pronounced wet and dry season, flowering and fruiting are more regular and occur once or twice per year ( Troup, 1921 ). Where there is no distinct wet or dry season, flowering and fruiting tend to be irregular and may occur throughout the year. The fruits on one tree do not all mature at the same time, often presenting a problem for seed collection. Elfers (1998) cites material describing a general inability to root sucker and poor coppicing except from stumps greater than 1 m tall. Although trees in natural stands are reported to be mostly monoecious, with male and female flowers separate but borne on the same tree, most cultivated populations are predominantly dioecious ( Dorairaj and Wilson, 1981 ; Luechanimitchit and Luangviriyasaeng, 1996 ).

Although trees in natural stands are reported to be mostly monoecious, with male and female flowers separate but borne on the same tree, most cultivated populations are predominantly dioecious ( Dorairaj and Wilson, 1981 ; Luechanimitchit and Luangviriyasaeng, 1996 ). The age to first flowering varies from 2 to 5 years ( Parrotta, 1993 ). Pollination is by wind. Female cones mature about 18-20 weeks after anthesis, and will release small samara (winged seeds) within 3 days when dried under full sun. A kilogram of cones (about 250 cones) yields 20-60 g of seed ( Kondas, 1983 ; Parrotta, 1993 ). There are about 650,000-760,000 seeds/kg but on average only 270,000 of these seeds are viable ( Turnbull and Martensz, 1983 ). The fruits on one tree do not all mature at the same time. Binggeli (1997) reports that viability lasts only a few months and that germination range is in the order 30-87%. Within the natural range of subsp. equisetifolia , the climate is hot humid to hot sub-humid, while subsp. incana inhabits mainly the warm sub-humid zone. Frosts are absent, although where subsp. incana occurs there may be one to three frosts per year within a few kilometres of the sea. It naturally occurs between 0-100 m altitude, but has been planted up to 1500 m. Temperatures are warm throughout the year with the mean maximum of the hottest month 30-35°C. In Australia, the mean minimum of the coolest month varies from 19.5°C at Darwin to mainly 10-16°C along the Queensland coast south of Cairns and as low as 6°C on parts of the northern coast of New

In Australia, the mean minimum of the coolest month varies from 19.5°C at Darwin to mainly 10-16°C along the Queensland coast south of Cairns and as low as 6°C on parts of the northern coast of New South Wales. In its introduced range it grows well where the mean annual temperature is 18-28°C during the hottest month and 10-20°C during the coldest month. In southern India, the mean maximum of the hottest month is 37-47°C, while the mean minimum decreases to 7-17°C. Over most of its distribution, C. equisetifolia occurs in areas receiving a mean annual rainfall of 1000-2500 mm with a distinct wet and dry season. When cultivated, it will thrive in a wider range of rainfall, from less than 350 mm to 5000 mm per annum ( Troup, 1921 ; Pinyopusarerk and House, 1993 ). A modified description of climatic requirements (see climatic data table of this data sheet) was prepared by CSIRO ( Booth and Jovanovic, 2000 ). Casuarina equisetifolia is commonly confined to a narrow strip adjacent to sandy shores rarely extending inland to lower hills (e.g. in Fiji). It is found on sand dunes, in sands alongside estuaries behind foredunes and gentle slopes near the sea. It may be found at the leading edge of dune vegetation, subject to salt spray and inundation with sea water at extremely high tides. Subsp. incana has been recorded growing on rocky headlands up to 30 m above sea level. Soils are well drained and rather coarse textured, principally sands, of 2 m or more in depth, often covering a more moisture-retentive layer of sandy loam. The species

Soils are well drained and rather coarse textured, principally sands, of 2 m or more in depth, often covering a more moisture-retentive layer of sandy loam. The species tolerates both calcareous and slightly alkaline soils but is intolerant of prolonged waterlogging. It grows well in soils with a pH from 5.0 to 9.5 ( Yadav et al., 1977 ; National Research Council, 1984 ; CATIE, 1991 ). It has been successfully grown in dune sands, ( Maheut and Dommergues, 1959 ; Chu and Kha, 1996 ) tin-mine spoils ( Esbenshade and Grainger, 1980 ; Thaiutsa, 1990 ) and sterile pumice ( National Research Council, 1984 ). Casuarina equisetifolia may form pure stands on the coastal dunes growing over a ground cover of dune grasses and broadleaved herbs, or can be part of a richer association of trees and shrubs collectively termed the Indo-Pacific strand flora. Tree associates in this vegetation include Barringtonia asiatica , Calophyllum inophyllum , Eugenia sp., Heritiera littoralis , Hibiscus tiliaceus , Pongamia glabra , Thespesia populnea and Pandanus sp. ( Champion, 1936 ; Doran and Turnbull, 1997 ). In Australia, it also grows in narrow belts adjacent to mangrove forests or scattered in open woodlands dominated by eucalypts.

Uses
Extensively cultivated for fuel, erosion control, and as a windbreak.  It can
be trimmed and used as a hedge.  The bark, used for tanning, penetrates the
hide quickly, furnishing a fairly plump, pliant, soft leather of pale
reddish-brown color.  With the neutral sulfite semichemical process, wood
yields a good pulp.  The wood is used for beams, boatbuilding, electric poles,
fences, furniture, gates, house posts, mine props, oars, pavings, pilings,
rafters, roofing shingles, tool handles, wagon wheels, and yokes.  The needles
have been employed in preparing active carbon by the zinc chloride method
(C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  Hill tribes of New Guinea use

even in highly eroded areas, Aspiras (1981) recommends it for Philippine barren

nutrients unlike other fast-growing species now being grown in the countryside.
Aside from its ability to raise the N status of the soil when grown in
rotational agriculture or in stabilizing road embankments, it also produces
good quality timber of high energy value.  It may even be raised as a nurse
plant to pine, just like
Myrica
, or planted between coconut trees for
its nitrogen and timber." (Aspiras, 1981).  In the Philippines, this is
recognized as one of the best trees for planting in sites covered by Imperata
grass (NAS, 1983e).  In Thailand it is planted along coastlines to produce the
poles used in building fish traps as well as fuelwood.  In the Dominican
Republic, it has been used to reclaim stripmine lands.  Egyptians plant the
trees along the coast to Protect houses from the wind and salt spray.

6–8 scalelike leaves.  Internodes 5–7.5 mm long on the branchlets, only 2.5 mm
on main shoots.  Main shoots minutely hairy, with small recurved scales ca 2.5
mm long, usually 8 in a whorl.  Male spikes usually numerous, terminating the
branches on which the female "cones" are borne lower down, cylindric to
fusiform 12–24 mm long.  Female "cones" subglobose to ellipsoid, 10–20 mm in
diameter.  Seeds ca 660,000–990,000/kg.

, or cvs thereof, is
reported to tolerate calcareous soils, drought, granitic soils, poor soil, salt
and salt spray, sand, waterlogging, and wind.  In Kenya, it grows around cement
works, in Hawaii in sterile pumice, in Malaysia on sterile tin tailings, near
Hilo Bay on tidal rocks with its roots in salt water (NAS, 1983e).  It is
sensitive to fire, grazing, and, in early stages, weed competition.  Older
trees are problems in hurricanes.  It is one of the most fire-sensitive of the
Casaurina
species.  Subspecies incana is a small tree possibly useful
for low growing shelter belts (NAS, 1983e) (2
n
= 18).
Distribution
Said to be indigenous from Indonesia and Malaysia to India and Sri Lanka and to
north and northeast Australia, the Australian Pine is now one of the most
common trees on frost-free beaches anywhere in the world.
Ecology
Ranging from Subtropical Thorn Woodland to Wet through Tropical Thorn to Wet
Forest Life Zone,
Casuarina
is reported to tolerate annual precipitation
of 6.4 to 43 dm (mean of 49 cases = 16.0) (but 2–50 possible, NAS, 1983e),
annual temperature of 22.1 to 26.9°C (mean of 34 cases = 25.2), and pH of
5.0 to 7.7 (mean of 2 cases = 6.4) (Duke, 1978, 1979).
Cultivation
Seeds have been successfully stored for 24 months at ca -7°C to 2°C with
moisture content of 6–16% (Ag. Handbook 450).  In Hawaii seeds are broadcast in
spring and

5.0 to 7.7 (mean of 2 cases = 6.4) (Duke, 1978, 1979).
Cultivation
Seeds have been successfully stored for 24 months at ca -7°C to 2°C with
moisture content of 6–16% (Ag. Handbook 450).  In Hawaii seeds are broadcast in
spring and covered with less than 1 cm soil.  Seedling density should be about
21–32/1000 sq cm.  Mulching is not required.  Normally seedlings are raised in
nurseries to outplant taking advantage of the rainy season, 4–18 months after
sowing.  Irrigation may be needed during dry periods over the first three
years.  In new areas, seeds have to be inoculated.  They should also be treated
to repel ants.  Cuttings strike root readily.  Trees are usually spaced 2–4 m
apart.  WARNING:
Casuarina
can exhaust the soil moisture, lower the
water table, and restrict understory growth, leaving the soil exposed.  Some
species are agressive weed species.  Trees may die young under unfavorable
circumstances (C.S.I.R., 1948–1976).  According to the National Academy of
Sciences, this has become an undesirable weed in Florida (NRC, 1982).
Harvesting
Although other
Casuarinas
coppice readily, this one does not.
Casuarina
plantations are worked under a clear-felling system, with a
rotation of 7–35 years.  Some estimates showed a long rotation (33 years) gave
greatest volume, but a shorter rotation (15 years) is preferred.  In Madras

plantations are worked under a clear-felling system, with a

greatest volume, but a shorter rotation (15 years) is preferred.  In Madras
State, the plantations are worked with a short rotation of 7–15 years (usually
10 years), while in North Kanara a 30-year rotation is followed.  From a purely
silvicultural consideration, the proper rotation appears to be 7 years.  In
parts of the Philippines, this has outgrown
Gmelina arborea
and
Leucaena
(NAS, 1983e).
Yields and Economics
With plants spaced 2 m apart, on a 7–10-year rotation, the trees may yield
75–200 MT wood/ha, i.e. 10–20 MT/ha/yr.  Higher yields have been reported.
Citing literature yields of 58–229 kg/ha/yr nitrogen, Aspiras (1981) notes that

Casuarina
equisetifolia
fixes ca 60–230 kg N/ha/yr (Aspiras, 1981).  The wood,
burning with immense heat, even when green, has been called the best firewood
in the world.  In India, it is used to fuel locomotives.  It makes a good
charcoal.  In China the wood is used for firing brick kilns.  With a specific
gravity of 0.8–1.2, the wood has a calorific value of 4,959 kcal/kg (8,910
Btu).  The charcoal has a calorific value of 7,181 kcals/kg, one of the highest
reported values.  The yields of 10–20 MT/ha/yr are roughly equivalent to 25–50
barrels of oil/ha/yr.
Biotic Factors
In Puerto Rico, natural regeneration is rare because ants consume nearly all
the seeds; many trees are killed by disease.  The Puerto Rican dieback of 1940,
followed by stemcanker, has been blamed on
Diplodia natalensis
.  Nursery
seedlings in India are attacked by crickets (

Other insect pests, e.g.,
Arbela tetraonis
, the bark-eating caterpillar,
Celosterna
scabrator
, a longicorn, and grubs of the rhinoceros
beetle,
Oryctes rhinoceros
, also cause considerable damage to
plantations.  Infection by the root fungus
Trichosporium vesiculosum
is
among the more serious diseases affecting
Casuarina
(favored by
excessive watering and congestion).  Early thinning checks it to some extent.
Trees infected by insects and fungi should be removed and the stumps grubbed
up.  Keeping an interval of two years between felling and replanting, and
planting of other trees such as
Anacardium occidentale, Azadirachta indica,
Pithecellobium dulce, Pongamia glabra, Sapindus laurifolius,
and
Syzygium cumini
, along with
Casuarina
are recommended to segregate
the plants, minimizing the spread of infection.  It also helps attract
insectivorous birds which are remarkably scarce in
Casuarina
.  A
