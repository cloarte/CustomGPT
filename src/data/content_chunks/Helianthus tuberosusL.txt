Plant Notes:  Jerusalem Artichoke is an introduced herbaceous perennial in the Sunflower family (Asteraceae). It has been widely cultivated for an extended period of time and its original distribution is uncertain. It is believed to be native to the central or mid-western United States. In Alabama in occurs statewide. Jerusalem Artichoke occurs around old home sites, on roadsides, in pastures and fields, and in waste areas. It is a perennial from a rhizome. Edible tubers are produced along the rhizome late in the growing season. Stems are 3-6 feet tall, sometimes branched above the middle, green or reddish brown in color, and pubescent with stiff hairs. Lower leaves are often opposite while the upper leaves are alternate. Leaves are petiolate, the petiole often winged, lanceolate to ovate in outline, 3-nerved from near the base, pubescent to glabrous, gland-dotted, with entire to serrate margins. Flowers are produced in heads. Each head has 10-20 yellow ray flowers and 60-100 yellow disc flowers. The fruit is an achene. Jerusalem Artichoke tubers were utilized as a food by Native Americans. They are similar to and can be used in many of the same ways as White Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). Jerusalem Artichoke is grown as a crop primarily in Europe, but to some extent in North America.
