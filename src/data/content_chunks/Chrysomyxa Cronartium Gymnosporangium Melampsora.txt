Submitted by tbrenesa on Mon, 02/24/2025 - 10:23 Dear NPDN friends, My colleague Pedro Pablo Parra, a former postdoc in my lab and now a Project Manager at the European Union National Reference Laboratories, is seeking specimens from the following genera of rust fungi: Chrysomyxa, Cronartium, Gymnosporangium, and Melampsora. If you are working with these genera, have specimens available, or can connect me with individuals who routinely collect them, please let me know. The purpose of acquiring this material for the EURL collection is to fully characterize it and offer it as reference material to European Union National Reference Laboratories through prepared microscope slides, photographs, sequences of barcoding regions, and more. Additionally, the material may be used for training purposes, as this is one of the roles of the EURL. This is a great opportunity for our network to collaborate with the EURL labs. Pablo will cover all expenses related to sample handling. Please let me know if you are interested in collaborating, and I can provide more details. Thank you! Romina Gazis, Ph.D. Associate Professor & Extension Specialist Director, Plant Diagnostic Clinic Department of Plant Pathology IFAS University of Florida Tropical Research and Education Center 18905 SW 280th St. Homestead, FL 33031 r.gazisseregina@ufl.edu | 786-217-9275 Tags Announcement Expiration Date Sun, 05/25/2025 - 12:00
