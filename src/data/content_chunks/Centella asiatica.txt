(2013) confirmed the presence of both diploid and tetraploid populations in Madagascar and measured differences in triterpenoid levels. A deliberately induced tetraploid line has been shown to have greater dry weight, larger leaves and increased content of triterpenoids ( Thong-on et al., 2014 ). A number of studies have confirmed the considerable variation across different populations of C. asiatica , including in China ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) and in India (Mathur et al. , 2003). In leaf transcriptome studies, results from gene ontology and functional annotation of sequences resulted in the identification of genes related to different sets of cellular functions, including identification of genes related to primary and secondary metabolism ( Sangwan et al., 2013 ).

C. asiatica reproduces by seed and by its far-reaching runners, which root at the nodes and can survive separation from the parent plant ( Floridata, 2014 ). C. asiatica is pollinated by insects ( PFAF, 2015 ). Singh and Singh (2002) compared the growth rates of seedlings and individual ramets from established plants and concluded that the latter are the more important in maintaining and extending populations at the local level. In relation to its value as a medicinal plant and concern at the possible loss of useful ecotypes, a number of authors (e.g. Hanumantharaya et al., 2010 ; Joshi et al., 2013 ) have reported methods for in vitro plantlet regeneration via callus-mediated organogenesis from leaf and stem explants. Gandi and Giri (2012) also reported the successful transformation of C. asiatica using Agrobacterium rhizogenes 8196. Physiology and Phenology Fresh seeds tend to be dormant for about two months but are then able to germinate at 25-30°C, with best germination in red or white light ( Devkota and Jha, 2010a ). Germination was seriously inhibited by salinity (NaCl at 6500 ppm) ( Devkota and Jha, 2010a ). Under artificial shade net condition, 100:50:0 kg NPK/ha was found optimum for growth of C. asiatica ( Krishnamurthy et al., 2006 ). In a pot study, Devkota and Jha (2013) compared different ratios of urea and farmyard manure and found the optimum to be a 50:50 mixture of the two.

An area of low-lying (5-3000 m altitude) grazed Zoysia japonica grassland in northwest Kyushu, Japan, was recognized as a new association of Zoysia japonica ,  characterized by the presence of C. asiatica and Lespedeza cuneata var. serpens ( Itow, 1970 ). C. asiatica prefers damp habitats ( IUCN, 2015 ). It can tolerate partial shade but also grows in full sun. Devkota and Jha (2010b) recorded highest biomass under 30% shading but found that root systems were strongest in full sunlight. Growth was reduced at 50 and 70% shading. C. asiatica will grow on a wide range of soil types, including clay, but favours lighter soils with clay content below 50% ( Devkota and Jha, 2014 ). C. asiatica grown under the shade of a mango orchard produced dry yield of 5.52 tonnes/ha from six coppicings per hectare in two years. Under artificial shade, 100:50:0 kg NPK/ha was found to be optimal, recording a maximum dry weight yield of 2.16 tonnes/ha per year ( Krishnamurthy et al., 2006 ).
