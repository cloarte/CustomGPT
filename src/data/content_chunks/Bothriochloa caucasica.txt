Caucasian bluestem
Gramineae
Bothriochloa caucasica
(Trin.) C.E. Hubb.
Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This bunchgrass bluestem from Russia shows promise as a pasture and hay grass for the Central and Southern Great Plains. The plant is leafy  with fine stems and reseeds readily. It is palatable while succulent but ripens early so is less useful for late pasture than the native bluestems. It is especially useful for erosion control and is also used for pasture and hay. It thrives best on medium- to fine-textured soils but will also grow on sandy soil.
