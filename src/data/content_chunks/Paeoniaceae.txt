Paeoniaceae YASIN J. NASIR National Herbarium, Agricultural Research Council, Islamabad. Perennial herbs or shrubs with alternate, exstipulate leaves. Leaves 1-3-ternate. Flowers solitary, showy, regular, bisexual. Calyx of 5 free sepals, persistent. Corolla of 5(-10) free petals, Stamens many; anthers extrorse. Carpels 2-5 or 8, apocarpous on a fleshy disc. Fruit consisting of a cluster of (1-)2-8 follicles. Seeds several, large. A monotypic family with c. 33 species in Asia, Europe and temperate N. America. Differs from Ranunculaceae in the following characters:1. Morphological: Extrorse dehiscence of the anthers, the presence of a fleshy disc, the large follicles and arillate seeds.2. Anatomical: Xylem vessels with scalariform plates (not simple perforations), also the xylem in the stem is not concave or v-shaped but it is rather flat. Large chromosomes of a type not found in Ranunculaceae.Acknowledgements: We are grateful to the United States Department of Agriculture for financing this research under P.L. 480 and to Mr. I.C.
