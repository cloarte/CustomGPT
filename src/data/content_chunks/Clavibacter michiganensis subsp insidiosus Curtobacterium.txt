15 th Meeting of the EPPO Panel on Bacterial diseases Ljubljana, 2010-03-22/24 The Panel on bacterial diseases met in Ljubljana at the kind invitation of the National Institute of Biology, SI. The meeting was held in connection with the second meeting of the Association of Phytobacteriologists (EAP). The EPPO Secretariat expressed its satisfaction that the two meetings can be held back to back for a mutual benefit. The Panel continued its work on the preparation of diagnostic protocols. The following protocols were reviewed: Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. insidiosus ELISA tests for plant pathogenic bacteria Rep-PCR tests for identification of bacteria Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv . flaccumfaciens Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv . flaccumfaciens - D. Caffier (FR) Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. insidiosus was judged ready to be sent for final approval. The other 3 protocols were considered ready to be sent for country consultation after the meeting with the aim to present them for final approval in 2010 if the EPPO Secretariat is able to address comments made during country consultation together with the authors. A revised draft for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was also reviewed. The Panel agreed the author should prepare a revised version of the protocol. Regarding Erwinia amylovora the protocol was delayed as it was noted that a ring-test is being performed. The Panel did not have time to address the questions the Secretariat has on this protocol and it was agreed that these issues would be discussed directly with the author. The Panel members were thanked for their involvement in the development of the new standard PM7/98 Specific requirements for laboratories preparing for accreditation for plant pest diagnostic activities which was being published at the time

The Panel members were thanked for their involvement in the development of the new standard PM7/98 Specific requirements for laboratories preparing for accreditation for plant pest diagnostic activities which was being published at the time of the meeting. The Chairman reminded the laboratories applying for accreditation to use it. The Panel members examined the lists of tests (for plant pathogenic bacteria) that are agreed to be widely used according to the criteria agreed by the Panel on Diagnostics. They wished to add the following tests as they agreed they are widely used in the region: pathogenicity tests and fatty acid profiling tests for the following pests PM 7/42 (1) Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, PM 7/59 (1) Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, PM 7/20 (1) Erwinia amylovora, PM 7/21 (1) Ralstonia solanacearum, PM 7/65 (1) Xanthomonas fragariae and also fatty acid profiling alone for PM 7/60 (1) Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii. Future work The Panel agreed that it would be very useful if a draft protocol could be prepared on Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. allii . Ms Lopez volunteered to work on a new protocol on the citrus pathogen 'Candidatus Liberibacter' which is very important in the Southern EPPO region. The next meeting of the Panel on Bacterial Diseases is scheduled for 2011-10-24/27 in Bulgaria, at the kind invitation of Ms Koutzarova.
