Buffalograss, a native species, is the dominant grass in parts of theGreat Plains. It is a fine-leaved, sod-forming perennial, generally only 6 to 8inches high, with leaves 3 to 6 inches long and less than 0.125 inch wide. Itspreads by surface runners to form a dense sod, Growth starts in late springand continues through the summer. It is very palatable and stands grazing well.It is readily established either by seeding or by sod pieces, and is valuableboth as pasture and for erosion control. The species is unisexual, about halfthe plants being female and producing seed; and half male, the flowers of whichproduce only pollen.
