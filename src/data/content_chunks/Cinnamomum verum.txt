 Invasion: An evergreen tree up to 18 m tall (in cultivation, it is usually a dense bushy plant about 2-3 m high); bole low-branching, up to 60 cm in diameter; buttresses 60 cm tall, 70 cm deep, thin, light pinkish-brown; bark about 10 mm thick, strongly aromatic; the bark on young shoots is smooth and pale brown, on mature branches and stems rough, dark brown or brownish-grey; oil cells are located in the phloem, and are oval or round in cross-section; wood of mature trees varies from light brownish-grey to grey or yellowish-brown, without markings, more or less lustrous and faintly scented.

 Reproduccion: Reproductive Biology The genus Cinnamomum is open-pollinated, and pollination is most probably by insects, especially flies. Fruits mature in 6 months. Propagation is mainly by seed, and as the fruits are much liked by birds, the seed is easily spread, though they quickly lose their viability. Vegetative propagation is possible, by cuttings, layering or division of old rootstocks. Germination of seeds of the closely related C. camp

 pollination is most probably by insects, especially flies. Fruits mature in 6 months. Propagation is mainly by seed, and as the fruits are much liked by birds, the seed is easily spread, though they quickly lose their viability. Vegetative propagation is possible, by cuttings, layering or division of old rootstocks. Germination of seeds of the closely related C. camphora appears to be inhibited while the seed remains in contact with the flesh of ripe fruits, which appear to release inhibitory substances ( Firth, 1979 ). Physiology and Phenology Seedling root growth is initially rapid, with the formation of a well-developed taproot followed by numerous spreading laterals, leading to a moderately deep and extensive root system ( PROTA, 2023 ). There is normally a single central stem, but in cultivation trees are coppiced. The uncut tree has numerous, often drooping, branches beginning low on the trunk. Growth takes place in flushes, young leaves being reddish in colour, later turning dark green. In Sri Lanka, the trees tend to flower in January and the fruits ripen about 6 months later ( Orwa et al., 2009 ). Competition between the endemic palm Phoenicophorium borsigianum and the aggressively invasive alien C. verum in the Seychelles was found to be greatly influenced by the amount of available photosynthetically active radiation (Fleischmann et al., 1999). Both species showed a negative correlation between mean leaf area of seedlings and light levels. P. borsigianum responded significantly better to low gap light levels than C. verum and both species showed no further response to high levels of direct sunlight. P. borsigianum and probably other endemic palms act as a filter affecting the distribution and abundance of establishing C. verum seedlings. Mortality of C. verum was strongly negatively correlated with levels of photosynthetically active radiation, whereas P

Mortality of C. verum was strongly negatively correlated with levels of photosynthetically active radiation, whereas P. borsigianum showed no such correlation (Fleischmann et al., 1999). Environmental Requirements Cinnamomum is adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions. Cinnamon requires a warm and humid climate with a well distributed annual rainfall of around 2000-2500 mm, and average temperatures of about 27°C. Wild cinnamon trees are adapted to tropical evergreen rainforests. It grows best at low altitudes, and is usually grown without shade, but being essentially a forest tree, light shade is tolerated. It grows well on different soils in the tropics, but soil type has a pronounced effect on bark quality. Fine sandy and lateritic gravelly soils rather than rocky and stony substrates are best in Sri Lanka and India, but in the Seychelles and Madagascar more loamy soils are preferred. Cinnamon is considered susceptible to salinity, and a bitter product results from waterlogged and marshy conditions. These ecological aspects are more or less the same for both cinnamon and cassia, although cassia is somewhat less specific than cinnamon. The species occurs up to 2000 m altitude, on well-drained hillside soils of low fertility and pH 4-6 ( Ravindran, 2017 ).
