Elytra 1.2-1.3 times longer than wide, apex broadly rounded. Elytral declivity abrupt, convex, surface opaque with dense, confused granules and rows of long stout setae.Immature StagesThe egg and pupa have not been described. The larvae of X. crassiusculus and Xylosandrus discolor are briefly described and keyed by Gardner (1934). Gardner (1934) describes the mature larva (as Xyleborus semigranosus) as follows: length about 3.5 mm. Head pale, slightly wider than long. Labrum with strong posterior extension. Epipharyngeal setae very small. Maxillary palp with apical segment only slightly longer than wide. Labial palps separated by about width of a basal segment, apical segment globular, not longer than wide. Abdominal terga with two distinct folds separated by an extremely narrow subdivision. Spiracles with combined width of air-tubes equal to diameter of atrium. Skin rather densely covered with micro-asperities. Too little is known of the larvae of other species of Xylosandrus to be sure whether the description is adequate to separate X. crassiusculus larvae from those of related species. Gardner (1934) distinguishes the species from Xylosandrus discolor by the micro-asperate (versus smooth) skin.

 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Xylosandrus, Xyleborinus and Euwallacea are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. Some species infest small twigs and shoots, others are found in larger branches and poles, while others are found in large timber; others may breed in material of almost any size. In general, most species bore through the bark and into the wood where an enlarged chamber of varying size and shape is constructed. The tunnels into the wood are highly variable in depth and shape, depending on the species involved in the construction. Generally only unhealthy or newly fallen material is infested, but some species are capable of attacking host plants following only a slight set-back, for example, transplanting or temporarily unfavourable conditions such as drought or mechanical injury. A few species have become aggressive under certain conditions, and have thereby attained the status of important pests.All species of Xyleborus and the related genera are closely associated with ambrosial fungi. Some of these fungi are phytopathogenic and all species of Xyleborus and related genera should be considered to be possible vectors of plant disease.Some details of the biology of X. crassiusculus are given by Beeson (1930) , Browne (1961) , Schedl (1963) and Beaver (1976, 1988). The species is known to prefer fresh, moist wood ( Beeson, 1930 ; Beaver, 1988 ), and attack-densities are usually higher on wood in the shade than in the sun, and higher on the lower side of logs.

 crassiusculus are given by Beeson (1930) , Browne (1961) , Schedl (1963) and Beaver (1976, 1988). The species is known to prefer fresh, moist wood ( Beeson, 1930 ; Beaver, 1988 ), and attack-densities are usually higher on wood in the shade than in the sun, and higher on the lower side of logs. Stems of fairly small diameter (2.5 - 8 cm) are usually attacked, but sometimes larger logs. The gallery sytem is somewhat variable depending on the size of the stem. In large stems, it branches several times in one transverse plane, and may penetrate 5 cm or more. In small stems, there are fewer branches and one or more may extend along the axis of the stem. In the palm rachis, the galleries run more irregularly through the fibrous tissues. Brood sizes up to 65 have been recorded in the Congo, and up to 100 in Ghana ( Schedl, 1963 ), but usually range between about 10 and 40 ( Beaver, 1988 ). In the tropics, breeding is continuous throughout the year, with overlapping generations, so that the species is present at all times and in all stages of development ( Browne, 1968 ). In south-eastern USA, beetles are active from the beginning of March until autumn, and the life cycle takes about 55 days ( Bambara and Casey, 2003 ).
 Sintomas: Attacked plants may show signs of wilting, branch die-back, shoot breakage, chronic debilitation, sun-scorch or a general decline in vigour.
