Spotted Lanternﬂy (SLF) Research Facilitation Process 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The SLF Research Facilitation Process (RFP) provides a practical approach for Federal and State partners, 
universities and research institutes to fulﬁll the Strategic Plan’s research component (Goal 2, Objective 2). The 
process will: 
 
• Identify and prioritize operational and stakeholder needs 
• Support the development and delivery of SLF tools and methods 
• Identify and track the status of federally funded SLF research 
• Provide SLF research transparency and the judicious use of resources 
• Support SLF research engagement, coordination and communication 
• Serve as a conduit for funding new  SLF research 
 
Needs Assessment 
The SLF National Policy Manager (NPM) will lead a series of meetings with National Plant Board (NPB) 
representatives (2 members from each of the 4 regions) to identify and develop a list of SLF operational and 
stakeholder needs. The NPM will share the list with the SLF Cross-Functional Working Group (Emergency 
Domestic Programs, Field Operations and Science and Technology (S&T)) to cross-check and prioritize the needs 
based on the SLF Strategic Plan. Moving forward, the working group will share the ranked-ordered list with 
APHIS’ SLF Research Coordination Group 
SLF Research Coordination 
The APHIS SLF Research Coordination Group—led by SLF S&T—will create and update a roster of (completed and 
current) SLF research projects from research institutions and federal agencies. Members of the group will include 
representatives from Agriculture Research Service,

SLF Research Coordination 
The APHIS SLF Research Coordination Group—led by SLF S&T—will create and update a roster of (completed and 
current) SLF research projects from research institutions and federal agencies. Members of the group will include 
representatives from Agriculture Research Service, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, 
university partners and industry researchers. The group will compare the SLF ranked-ordered needs document 
against the roster of SLF research projects and provide quarterly updates. This coordinated effort will enhance 
transparency and communication, eliminate duplicative research efforts, and potentially increase the timely 
delivery of tools, methods and practical pest management. 
Communication of Research to Stakeholders 
SLF S&T Staﬀ Scientist will facilitate the transfer of research outcomes and deliverables for stakeholders to 
consider using in their ongoing SLF control eﬀorts. They will work with APHIS-funded research projects’ primary 
investigators to create protocols, manuals, or other end-user products for stakeholders. The yearly outcomes of 
The Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) 5-year Strategy (Strategic Plan) for Fiscal Years 2024-2028 
outlines the national strategy for the future direction of the SLF program. Over the next 5 
years, Federal and State partners will work to limit the advancement of the pest and further 
scientific research toward the development of tools and pest management options.

Identified SLF needs will direct research priorities.  APHIS will fund projects that align with the Strategic Plan and 
identified priorities. Funding groups participating in the SLF research coordination group will be encouraged to 
follow the RFP process when considering funding SLF research or requesting research proposals. The SLF cross 
functional working group (CFWG) will review all proposals/suggestions, progress, and results.
