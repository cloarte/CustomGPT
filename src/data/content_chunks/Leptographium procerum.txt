 Invasion: L. procerum can be characterized as a typical species of Leptographium (Jacobs and Wingfield, 2001). The conidiophores can occur singly or in groups of up to three, directly from the mycelium and are (150-) 245-570 (-760) µm long with rhizoid-like structures present at the base. As in the case with other species of Leptographium, the stipes are olivaceous, cylindrical, 3-10-septate and (125-) 206-496 (-690) µm long. The conidiogenous apparatus consists of two to five series of cylindrical branches that are (25-) 39-75 (-90) µm long, excluding the conidial mass. The conidiogenous apparatus terminates in conidiogenous cells that are cylindrical, tapering slightly at the apex, (11-) 15-18 (-22) µm long and 1-2 µm wide. The conidia are hyaline, aseptate, obovoid to broadly ellipsoid with truncate bases and rounded apices, and 3-5 x 1-3 µm (Kendrick, 1962;Jacobs and Wingfield, 2001). Strains of L. procerum were found

Strains of L. procerum were found to grow and sporulate equally well on PDA and MEA, although the pathogen grows slightly faster on PDA (Kendrick, 1962).

 Reproduccion: GeneticsJacobs et al. (2001) found that L. procerum was phylogenetically most closely related to Leptographium terebrantis. Although they share a common habitat, these species are morphologically distinct.Physiology and PhenologyL. procerum is characterized by the presence of cellulose in its cell walls, a characteristic shared with other species of Ophiostoma ( Horner et al., 1986 ). Hubert (1953) showed that extracts from L. procerum could induce wilt and death in tomato seedlings, indicating that a toxin could be involved.Environmental RequirementsWhite pine root decline appears to be linked to stress conditions ( Alexander et al., 1988 ). The disease was found to be prevalent in areas with heavy soil moisture or drought conditions ( Prey, 1975 ). It was also noticed in trees planted in poorly-drained sites and those infested by other pathogens ( Towers, 1977 ). L. procerum, together with L. terebrantis, was isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic trees that were stressed as a result of prescribed burning practices ( Otrosina et al., 2002 ).

The presence of L. procerum in Pinus palustris could also be seen as an indicator of stress ( Otrosina et al., 1999 ). Trees exposed to air pollution are also more prone to infection by L. procerum and insects ( Lackner and Alexander, 1983 ).Red pine decline, which is also associated with the presence of L. procerum, mainly occurs on sandy soils. Stressed conditions can play a role in this disease as they create favourable conditions for attack by the insects that vector the fungus ( Klepzig et al., 1991 ).AssociationsL. procerum has been isolated from the roots of trees infested with black stain root disease ( Bertagnole et al., 1983 ). This disease is caused by a species in the same genus, Leptographium wageneri. Both white pine root decline and red pine decline appear to be caused by a complex of organisms, involving a number of insects and beetles, rather than by a single organism ( Otrosina et al., 1999 ; Erbilgin and Raffa, 2002 ). Although L. procerum has been associated with the symptoms of white pine root decline, it does not seem to be the primary cause of the disease ( Hubert, 1953 ). The disease is not prevalent on healthy, unstressed trees, but readily occurs on trees that are stressed ( Livingston and Wingfield, 1982 ). L. procerum appears to be of minor importance in tree mortality and occurs in weevil-damaged trees ( Wingfield, 1982 ; Nevill and Alexander, 1992a ).

In most cases, L. procerum is isolated, together with L. terebrantis, from trees showing symptoms of insect damage ( Livingston et al., 1983 ; Wingfield, 1983 ; Rane and Tattar, 1987 ). L. terebrantis appears to be more virulent than L. procerum ( Rane and Tattar, 1987 ; Klepzig et al., 1996 ). Barnard et al. (1985) reported that in half of the cases of sand pine root disease, L. procerum was isolated together with a known root pathogen. Houston (1969) found that cankers on Pinus strobus caused by L. procerum infection were almost always associated with damage by snow, ice and the activities of ants.
 Sintomas: White pine root decline was first reported in eastern USA and L. procerum was later found to be consistently isolated from diseased trees ( Kendrick, 1962 ; Dochinger, 1967 ). However, the role of the fungus in causing this disease has been a matter of considerable debate ( Lackner and Alexander, 1982 ; Harrington and Cobb, 1983 ; Wingfield, 1983 , 1986).

One of the first symptoms to appear, in both inoculation studies and natural infections, is a reduction in height growth, followed by crown discoloration. A dark stain can be observed in the roots of the diseased trees, which rapidly progresses upwards in the tree ( Leaphart, 1960 ; Alexander et al., 1988 ). In severe infections, marked resin exudation is observed ( Alexander et al., 1988 ). Symptoms associated with white pine root decline include extended periods of bud break, retardation of shoot elongation, crooking of growing shoots, loss of turgour in older needles, wilting of younger needles ( Hubert, 1953 ; Dochinger, 1967 ; Halambek, 1976 ; Pest Alert, 1977 ; Smith, 1991 ), retention of needles, needle wilt, browning of needles, and resin-soaked, black-streaked wood at the base of stems and basal cankers ( Houston, 1969 ; Pest Alert, 1977 ; Towers, 1977 ; Anderson and Alexander, 1979 ; Mackenzie and Dick, 1984 ; Alexander et al., 1988 ; Smith, 1991 ; Otrosina et al., 1997 ). The basal cankers are at first circular to irregular, reddish, sunken areas, which in some cases enlarge and coalesce to form larger flattened cankers ( Houston, 1969 ).

Colonized roots are resin-soaked and cross-sections of the stems reveal prominent wedges of blue-stained wood. Discoloration of the sapwood is consistent with the patterns and physiology of blue-stain fungi ( Alexander et al., 1988 ). In some cases the roots show diffuse black streaking ( Livingston and Wingfield, 1982 ).L. procerum acts in a similar way to wilt pathogens. It occurs in the vascular system, where it erodes the cell walls and travels from cell to cell through the pits ( Kilbertus et al., 1980 ). White pine infected with L. procerum showed greater vascular occlusion, lower moisture content and reduced hydraulic conductivity than non-infected trees ( Butnor et al., 2000 ). The water in the stem is reduced, leading to desiccation of the sapwood and foliage and ultimately premature death ( Butnor et al., 2000 ).Reduced water potential in symptomatic trees supports the notion that this root disease is associated with xylem dysfunction ( Horner et al., 1987 ). Tree death occurs when the xylem is blocked by resin ( Alexander et al., 1988 ). Symptoms were found to vary between Pinus strobus and P. sylvestris; it takes longer for symptoms to appear on P. sylvestris (Horner and Alexander, 1983b).Red pine decline disease is characterized by circular regions of dead and dying trees that expand gradually. The root systems of these trees show high levels of mortality and several fungi (L. terebrantis, L. procerum and Ophiostoma ips) can be isolated from stained areas ( Klepzig et al., 1995 ; Erbilgin and Raffa, 2002 ).

Both white pine root decline and red pine decline appear to be caused by a complex of organisms, involving a number of insects and beetles, rather than by a single organism ( Otrosina et al., 1999 ; Erbilgin and Raffa, 2002 ). Although L. procerum has been associated with the symptoms of white pine root decline, it does not seem to be the primary cause of the disease ( Hubert, 1953 ). The disease is not prevalent on healthy, unstressed trees, but readily occurs on trees that are stressed ( Livingston and Wingfield, 1982 ). L. procerum appears to be of minor importance in tree mortality and occurs in weevil-damaged trees ( Wingfield, 1982 ; Nevill and Alexander, 1992a ). In most cases, L. procerum is isolated, together with L. terebrantis, from trees showing symptoms of insect damage ( Livingston et al., 1983 ; Wingfield, 1983 ; Rane and Tattar, 1987 ). L. terebrantis appears to be more virulent than

evil-damaged trees ( Wingfield, 1982 ; Nevill and Alexander, 1992a ). In most cases, L. procerum is isolated, together with L. terebrantis, from trees showing symptoms of insect damage ( Livingston et al., 1983 ; Wingfield, 1983 ; Rane and Tattar, 1987 ). L. terebrantis appears to be more virulent than L. procerum ( Rane and Tattar, 1987 ; Klepzig et al., 1996 ). Barnard et al. (1985) reported that in half of the cases of sand pine root disease, L. procerum was isolated together with a known root pathogen. Houston (1969) found that cankers on Pinus strobus caused by L. procerum infection were almost always associated with damage by snow, ice and the activities of ants.
