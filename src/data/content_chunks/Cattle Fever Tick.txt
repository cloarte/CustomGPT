    Finding of No Significant Impact     
 Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program Fence Deterrent in Cameron and Willacy 
Counties, Texas Environmental Assessment                                                                                           
July 2021  
In May 2021, USDA-APHIS completed an environmental assessment (EA) relative to the 
installation of high game fencing at specific locations in Cameron and Willacy Counties, Texas 
to prevent or limit the spread of cattle fever ticks by free-ranging wildlife hosts (such as white-
tailed deer and nilgai) north of the Texas Southern border known as Permanent Tick Quarantine 
Zone (PTQZ). Ongoing cattle fever tick eradication efforts in Southern Texas include 
surveillance and patrolling for stray or smuggled tick-infested livestock, treatment of tick-
infested animals, and vacating of tick-infested pastures and premises. Unfortunately these efforts 
seem to be insufficient given the persistent increasing number of tick-infested premises observed 
outside of the PTQZ in recent years, and also given the potential for both the ticks and the bovine 
disease to spread across the region including Cameron and Willacy Counties. Installing high 
game fencing, in addition to above-mentioned ongoing eradication efforts, may limit the 
movements of tick hosts (such as white-tailed deer and nilgai antelope) and eventually contribute 
in the program’s effort to reducing the

 the bovine 
disease to spread across the region including Cameron and Willacy Counties. Installing high 
game fencing, in addition to above-mentioned ongoing eradication efforts, may limit the 
movements of tick hosts (such as white-tailed deer and nilgai antelope) and eventually contribute 
in the program’s effort to reducing the use of chemicals needed to treat tick-infested cattle, as 
well as associated animal production costs overall. Therefore, by funding the installation of high 
game fencing against potential wildlife tick-hosts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS), cattle fever tick 
eradication program (CFTEP) expects to reduce the risk of the spread of the disease bovine 
babesiosis among U.S. cattle populations in Southern Texas. The EA is available from:

The EA analyses the alternatives of (A) no action under which USDA-APHIS would not fund 
the installation of high game fencing in Cameron and Willacy Counties, which would then cause 
the continued spread of cattle fever ticks by infested wildlife ungulates in cattle ranches with the 
potential of increasing the likelihood of babesiosis outbreaks in U.S. cattle populations and 
related financial consequences; and (B) proposed action under which USDA-APHIS would fund 
the installation of high game fencing at specific locations in Cameron and Willacy Counties to 
deter the movements of potential wildlife tick

related financial consequences; and (B) proposed action under which USDA-APHIS would fund 
the installation of high game fencing at specific locations in Cameron and Willacy Counties to 
deter the movements of potential wildlife tick-hosts, facilitating current CFTEP efforts. 
USDA-APHIS announced the availability of this EA for a 30-day public comment period via 
local newspapers in Texas and via Regulations.gov. The comment period ended on June 30, 
2021. The agency received no comments on the EA.  
USDA-APHIS determined that there are no disproportionate adverse effects associated with the 
preferred action alternative to children, minority populations, or low-income populations over 
those effects to the general populations, in accordance with Executive Order 12898, Federal 
Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations; 
and Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety 
Risks. 
I found that the implementation of the proposed program will not significantly impact the quality 
of the human environment. I have considered and based my finding of no significant impact on 
the environment on the analysis contained within the EA. Because I have not found evidence of 
significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, I find that an 
environmental impact statement does not need to be prepared and that the program may proceed.
