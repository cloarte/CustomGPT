•Tropilaelaps, an exotic parasitic mite found in Asia and Indonesia, is one of the 
primary targets for this study 
•This mite feeds on honey bee brood (both larvae and pupae) causing deformed 
bees, death and absconding, but unlike Varroa, it does not feed on adult bees 
•Because Tropilaelaps mites have a quicker reproductive cycle, they can out 
produce Varroa mites 
•Adult mites move very quickly on brood combs and can be seen moving in and 
out of cells; they are about 1/3 the size of Varroa mites, so they are just visible to 
the naked eye
