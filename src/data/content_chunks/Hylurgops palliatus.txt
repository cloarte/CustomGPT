 Reproduccion: The phenology and life cycle of H. palliatus were studied in Finland and Denmark ( Nuorteva, 1956 ; Subansence, 1971). Ozols (1975) , Lekander et al. (1977) and Rudnev and Vasechko (1988) provide data on its development in different regions.Trees are infested in early spring. Studies were carried out in two forest areas in Denmark (Zealand and South Jutland) to determine the emergence dates and flight periods of H. palliatus. It was shown that the overwintered adults began to fly in April, when the maximum temperature reached approximately 6°C, and the peak of activity occurred in late April when the maximum temperatures were approximately 15-25°C (Subansence

It was shown that the overwintered adults began to fly in April, when the maximum temperature reached approximately 6°C, and the peak of activity occurred in late April when the maximum temperatures were approximately 15-25°C (Subansence, 1971). Flight activity declined in June. The adults of the new generation emerged between July and November/December, with a peak in August. These adults flew little and overwintered near the sites in which they had developed. There was only one generation a year.In Latvia, the swarming starts in mid-April ( Ozols, 1975 ). In Finland it takes place in early May and the first eggs were observed in the mid-May ( Nuorteva, 1956 ). In general, all development stages have been observed during quite a long period in the summer. The biology and ecology of H. palliatus is briefly reviewed by Escherich (1923) , Stark (1952), Postner (1974) , Lekander et al. (1977) , Rudnev and Vasechko (1988) , and Ehnström and Axelsson (2002) . Wood and Bright (1992) gave several references relating to the biology, habitats and taxonomy of H. palliatus. H. palliatus is a monogamous species. In central Scandinavia, H. palliatus flies from the end of April to the beginning of May ( Lekander et al., 1977 ). The immature beetles seek the under-side of timber and branches cut in the winter and preferably those that are lying directly in contact with the ground. They make irregular galleries in the bark.

 et al., 1977 ). The immature beetles seek the under-side of timber and branches cut in the winter and preferably those that are lying directly in contact with the ground. They make irregular galleries in the bark. Some weeks later the now mature beetles leave these galleries and look for suitable material in which to breed. The larvae mine in all directions without any evident pattern and they eventually consume the entire phloem in localized areas of heavy infestation. They pupate in late July and the new generation emerges in August. Generally, H. palliatus hibernates in the bark in association with the gallery systems but more occasionally in stump roots or litter. Generally, there is one generation annually. In the Ukraine, a sister generation may be produced or a second generation occurs, and hibernation as a larva is also possible ( Rudnev and Vasechko, 1988 ).The egg galleries are usually longitudinal and 2-5 cm long. According to Nuorteva (1956) , the mean number of eggs in egg galleries was 37; the biggest number of eggs was observed in the relatively short egg galleries: 2.7 cm - 63 eggs, 2.2 cm - 62 eggs and 2.2 cm - 39 eggs. H. palliatus is a typically secondary species ( Escherich, 1923 ). It generally reproduces in dead or dying trees. Chararas (1959) studied osmotic pressures in the bark, wood and needles of branches of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies. For both species, low pressures were associated with heavy attacks by Scolytidae. Measurements on a large number of samples showed that H. palliatus attacked branches only when bark pressures were in the range 3-5 atm, i.e. in dying trees. H. palliatus infests the bases and roots of dying trees and stumps. It prefers logs cut during the autumn of the previous year to newly cut logs ( Schroeder, 1991

 Scolytidae. Measurements on a large number of samples showed that H. palliatus attacked branches only when bark pressures were in the range 3-5 atm, i.e. in dying trees. H. palliatus infests the bases and roots of dying trees and stumps. It prefers logs cut during the autumn of the previous year to newly cut logs ( Schroeder, 1991 ). This type of older breeding material may release relatively high amounts of ethanol produced in deteriorating tree tissue, whereas monoterpenes are probably released in lower amounts compared with the amounts released from newly felled or broken trees. Schroeder (1992) also studied the field response of H. palliatus to the attractant ethanol in combination with volatile wood constituents released from the non-host tree species Populus tremula and Betula pendula. The attraction of the species decreased when aspen or birch wood was added to the ethanol bait.The sections close to the roots and parts of bark lying on the soil surface or partially covered with soil were attacked by H. palliatus. It occurs mainly on the under-side of timber, branches and other logging waste. Also the lower part (up to about 2 m) of standing, dying or dead trees, and occasionally stumps and roots, will be attacked. It seems to prefer high humidity in the bark and often occurs with Trypodendron lineatum (striped ambrosia beetle) ( Ozols, 1975 ; Lekander et al., 1977 ; Koch, 1992 ; Jakus, 1998 ).In Sweden, the attacks of bark beetles on broken conifer stems after severe snow-breakage in early 1988 were studied in autumn 1988 and 1989 ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ). H. palliatus was frequently encountered on spruce and pine stumps in the second year following snow-breakage, whereas on spruce stumps it also occurred in the first year ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ).The attack density

H. palliatus was frequently encountered on spruce and pine stumps in the second year following snow-breakage, whereas on spruce stumps it also occurred in the first year ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ).The attack density and breeding success of the bark beetles and the abundance of their predators were studied at forest-clearcut edges in southern Finland on Picea abies (Norway spruce) ( Peltonen and Heliövaara, 1999 ). Attack densities of H. palliatus increased markedly towards the forest interior. The breeding success of H. palliatus was increased with increasing distance from the stand edge.Attacks of bark and wood-boring beetles on mechanically created high stumps of P. abies were studied in central Sweden. H. palliatus was among the most frequently encountered species on the stumps. A negative relationship was found between stump diameter and H. palliatus occupancy ( Schroeder et al., 1999 ). Wingfield and Gibbs (1991) studied the blue-stain fungi associated with H. palliatus. Isolations for blue-stain fungi were made from Hylastes ater, Hylastes opacus, H. palliatus and Tomicus piniperda trapped in Pinus sylvestris billets. Five Leptographium spp. including one of unknown identity and two, apparently undescribed Graphium spp., were isolated. Leptographium procerum, Leptographium serpens [Ophiostoma serpens] and Leptographium wingfieldii were recorded for the first time in the UK.

Leptographium lundbergii had previously been found in this country.A dark stain penetrating only shallowly into the sap wood develops round the gallery and is most often caused by Ophiostoma penicillatum ( Lekander et al., 1977 ).In Germany, a new species of the hyphomycete genus Phialocephala, Phialocephala trigonospora, was isolated from conifericolous bark beetles (Dryocoetes autographus, H. palliatus, Ips typographus and Orthotomicus laricis) and their galleries in the bark of Pinus sylvestris and P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1998 ).During a survey of fungi associated with bark beetles (Crypturgus cinereus, Crypturgus pusillus, D. autographus, H. palliatus, I. typographus, Pityogenes chalcographus and Trypodendron lineatum) in Germany, an undescribed species of Ophiostoma was isolated. This differs from the other species of the genus by having pigmented, aseptate, convergent ostiolar hyphae; cucullate, sheathed ascospores; and is a Hyalorhinocladiella anamorph. The species is described as Ophiostoma neglectum. It is rarely associated with primary bark beetles but often associated with secondary bark beetles mainly infesting P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999b ). Diplocladium gregarium was described almost 100 years ago. It was recent rediscovered from bark beetle (C. pusillus

It is rarely associated with primary bark beetles but often associated with secondary bark beetles mainly infesting P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999b ). Diplocladium gregarium was described almost 100 years ago. It was recent rediscovered from bark beetle (C. pusillus, D. autographus, H. palliatus, I. typographus and Orthotomicus laricis) galleries in the bark of P. abies and Pinus sylvestris in Germany. The fungus was redescribed and a new genus (Cylindrocarpostylus) was proposed to accommodate it ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999a ). A previously unknown heterobasidiomycetous fungus was isolated from the galleries of H. palliatus, collected from P. abies in Germany. It is described as Atractocolax pulvinatus gen. et sp. nov. (Kirschner et al., 1999). Several species of bark beetles may carry dauer larvae of nematodes. H. palliatus proved to be a vector of dauer larvae of Bursaphelenchus poligraphi, Bursaphelenchus eggersi and Bursaphelenchus sexdentati in Germany ( Braasch et al., 1999 ). Kakulia et al. (1973) studied the nematode fauna of H. palliatus in the Former Republic of Georgia. Parasitorhabditis palliati, Cryptaphelenchus cryptus, B. eggersi, Mikoletzkya palliati, Panagrolaimus fuchsi and Cephalobus persegnis were found in H. palliatus and its frass on Picea orientalis in the Borzhomy and Khashuri districts of Georgia

 Sintomas: The beetles of the genus Hylurgops are similar to Hylastes in their appearance and habits. They differ from Hylastes in having pronotal pits of varying size versus uniform size, the pronotum is generally more constricted anteriorly and the setae are longer on the elytral declivity.

Larval galleries are long and almost parallel to each other. Pupation occurs in the sapwood. Young adults have maturation feeding in galleries, thus in high density population primary pattern of galleries becomes unclear. Larvae or pupae overwinter in galleries, while adults in the litter or under the bark.DamageH. palliatus attacks fallen and standing trees, usually dead and those dying. It infests the lower part of stems with the thick bark. This species prefers shaded and moist conditions.Preventive measures and controlRemoval of weakened trees, windthrows etc.Image GalleryReferencesKolk A., Starzyk J.

It was shown that the overwintered adults began to fly in April, when the maximum temperature reached approximately 6°C, and the peak of activity occurred in late April when the maximum temperatures were approximately 15-25°C (Subansence, 1971). Flight activity declined in June. The adults of the new generation emerged between July and November/December, with a peak in August. These adults flew little and overwintered near the sites in which they had developed. There was only one generation a year.In Latvia, the swarming starts in mid-April ( Ozols, 1975 ). In Finland it takes place in early May and the first eggs were observed in the mid-May ( Nuorteva, 1956 ). In general, all development stages have been observed during quite a long period in the summer. The biology and ecology of H. palliatus is briefly reviewed by Escherich (1923) , Stark (1952), Postner (1974) , Lekander et al. (1977) , Rudnev and Vasechko (1988) , and Ehnström and Axelsson (2002) . Wood and Bright (1992) gave several references relating to the biology, habitats and taxonomy of H. palliatus. H. palliatus is a monogamous species. In central Scandinavia, H. palliatus flies from the end of April to the beginning of May ( Lekander et al., 1977 ). The immature beetles seek the under-side of timber and branches cut in the winter and preferably those that are lying directly in contact with the ground. They make irregular galleries in the bark.

 et al., 1977 ). The immature beetles seek the under-side of timber and branches cut in the winter and preferably those that are lying directly in contact with the ground. They make irregular galleries in the bark. Some weeks later the now mature beetles leave these galleries and look for suitable material in which to breed. The larvae mine in all directions without any evident pattern and they eventually consume the entire phloem in localized areas of heavy infestation. They pupate in late July and the new generation emerges in August. Generally, H. palliatus hibernates in the bark in association with the gallery systems but more occasionally in stump roots or litter. Generally, there is one generation annually. In the Ukraine, a sister generation may be produced or a second generation occurs, and hibernation as a larva is also possible ( Rudnev and Vasechko, 1988 ).The egg galleries are usually longitudinal and 2-5 cm long. According to Nuorteva (1956) , the mean number of eggs in egg galleries was 37; the biggest number of eggs was observed in the relatively short egg galleries: 2.7 cm - 63 eggs, 2.2 cm - 62 eggs and 2.2 cm - 39 eggs. H. palliatus is a typically secondary species ( Escherich, 1923 ). It generally reproduces in dead or dying trees. Chararas (1959) studied osmotic pressures in the bark, wood and needles of branches of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies. For both species, low pressures were associated with heavy attacks by Scolytidae. Measurements on a large number of samples showed that H. palliatus attacked branches only when bark pressures were in the range 3-5 atm, i.e. in dying trees. H. palliatus infests the bases and roots of dying trees and stumps. It prefers logs cut during the autumn of the previous year to newly cut logs ( Schroeder, 1991

 Scolytidae. Measurements on a large number of samples showed that H. palliatus attacked branches only when bark pressures were in the range 3-5 atm, i.e. in dying trees. H. palliatus infests the bases and roots of dying trees and stumps. It prefers logs cut during the autumn of the previous year to newly cut logs ( Schroeder, 1991 ). This type of older breeding material may release relatively high amounts of ethanol produced in deteriorating tree tissue, whereas monoterpenes are probably released in lower amounts compared with the amounts released from newly felled or broken trees. Schroeder (1992) also studied the field response of H. palliatus to the attractant ethanol in combination with volatile wood constituents released from the non-host tree species Populus tremula and Betula pendula. The attraction of the species decreased when aspen or birch wood was added to the ethanol bait.The sections close to the roots and parts of bark lying on the soil surface or partially covered with soil were attacked by H. palliatus. It occurs mainly on the under-side of timber, branches and other logging waste. Also the lower part (up to about 2 m) of standing, dying or dead trees, and occasionally stumps and roots, will be attacked. It seems to prefer high humidity in the bark and often occurs with Trypodendron lineatum (striped ambrosia beetle) ( Ozols, 1975 ; Lekander et al., 1977 ; Koch, 1992 ; Jakus, 1998 ).In Sweden, the attacks of bark beetles on broken conifer stems after severe snow-breakage in early 1988 were studied in autumn 1988 and 1989 ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ). H. palliatus was frequently encountered on spruce and pine stumps in the second year following snow-breakage, whereas on spruce stumps it also occurred in the first year ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ).The attack density

 beetles on broken conifer stems after severe snow-breakage in early 1988 were studied in autumn 1988 and 1989 ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ). H. palliatus was frequently encountered on spruce and pine stumps in the second year following snow-breakage, whereas on spruce stumps it also occurred in the first year ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ).The attack density and breeding success of the bark beetles and the abundance of their predators were studied at forest-clearcut edges in southern Finland on Picea abies (Norway spruce) ( Peltonen and Heliövaara, 1999 ). Attack densities of H. palliatus increased markedly towards the forest interior. The breeding success of H. palliatus was increased with increasing distance from the stand edge.Attacks of bark and wood-boring beetles on mechanically created high stumps of P. abies were studied in central Sweden. H. palliatus was among the most frequently encountered species on the stumps. A negative relationship was found between stump diameter and H. palliatus occupancy ( Schroeder et al., 1999 ). Wingfield and Gibbs (1991) studied the blue-stain fungi associated with H. palliatus. Isolations for blue-stain fungi were made from Hylastes ater, Hylastes opacus, H. palliatus and Tomicus piniperda trapped in Pinus sylvestris billets. Five Leptographium spp. including one of unknown identity and two, apparently undescribed Graphium spp., were isolated. Leptographium procerum, Leptographium serpens [Ophiostoma serpens] and Leptographium wingfieldii were recorded for the first time in the UK. Leptographium lundbergii had previously been found in this country.A dark stain penetrating only shallowly into the sap wood develops round the gallery and is

Leptographium lundbergii had previously been found in this country.A dark stain penetrating only shallowly into the sap wood develops round the gallery and is most often caused by Ophiostoma penicillatum ( Lekander et al., 1977 ).In Germany, a new species of the hyphomycete genus Phialocephala, Phialocephala trigonospora, was isolated from conifericolous bark beetles (Dryocoetes autographus, H. palliatus, Ips typographus and Orthotomicus laricis) and their galleries in the bark of Pinus sylvestris and P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1998 ).During a survey of fungi associated with bark beetles (Crypturgus cinereus, Crypturgus pusillus, D. autographus, H. palliatus, I. typographus, Pityogenes chalcographus and Trypodendron lineatum) in Germany, an undescribed species of Ophiostoma was isolated. This differs from the other species of the genus by having pigmented, aseptate, convergent ostiolar hyphae; cucullate, sheathed ascospores; and is a Hyalorhinocladiella anamorph. The species is described as Ophiostoma neglectum. It is rarely associated with primary bark beetles but often associated with secondary bark beetles mainly infesting P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999b ). Diplocladium gregarium was described almost 100 years ago. It was recent rediscovered from bark beetle (C. pusillus

It is rarely associated with primary bark beetles but often associated with secondary bark beetles mainly infesting P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999b ). Diplocladium gregarium was described almost 100 years ago. It was recent rediscovered from bark beetle (C. pusillus, D. autographus, H. palliatus, I. typographus and Orthotomicus laricis) galleries in the bark of P. abies and Pinus sylvestris in Germany. The fungus was redescribed and a new genus (Cylindrocarpostylus) was proposed to accommodate it ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999a ). A previously unknown heterobasidiomycetous fungus was isolated from the galleries of H. palliatus, collected from P. abies in Germany. It is described as Atractocolax pulvinatus gen. et sp. nov. (Kirschner et al., 1999). Several species of bark beetles may carry dauer larvae of nematodes. H. palliatus proved to be a vector of dauer larvae of Bursaphelenchus poligraphi, Bursaphelenchus eggersi and Bursaphelenchus sexdentati in Germany ( Braasch et al., 1999 ). Kakulia et al. (1973) studied the nematode fauna of H. palliatus in the Former Republic of Georgia. Parasitorhabditis palliati, Cryptaphelenchus cryptus, B. eggersi, Mikoletzkya palliati, Panagrolaimus fuchsi and Cephalobus persegnis were found in H. palliatus and its frass on Picea orientalis in the Borzhomy and Khashuri districts of Georgia

 Sintomas: The beetles of the genus Hylurgops are similar to Hylastes in their appearance and habits. They differ from Hylastes in having pronotal pits of varying size versus uniform size, the pronotum is generally more constricted anteriorly and the setae are longer on the elytral declivity.

The attraction of the species decreased when aspen or birch wood was added to the ethanol bait.The sections close to the roots and parts of bark lying on the soil surface or partially covered with soil were attacked by H. palliatus. It occurs mainly on the under-side of timber, branches and other logging waste. Also the lower part (up to about 2 m) of standing, dying or dead trees, and occasionally stumps and roots, will be attacked. It seems to prefer high humidity in the bark and often occurs with Trypodendron lineatum (striped ambrosia beetle) ( Ozols, 1975 ; Lekander et al., 1977 ; Koch, 1992 ; Jakus, 1998 ).In Sweden, the attacks of bark beetles on broken conifer stems after severe snow-breakage in early 1988 were studied in autumn 1988 and 1989 ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ). H. palliatus was frequently encountered on spruce and pine stumps in the second year following snow-breakage, whereas on spruce st

H. palliatus was frequently encountered on spruce and pine stumps in the second year following snow-breakage, whereas on spruce stumps it also occurred in the first year ( Schroeder and Eidmann, 1993 ).The attack density and breeding success of the bark beetles and the abundance of their predators were studied at forest-clearcut edges in southern Finland on Picea abies (Norway spruce) ( Peltonen and Heliövaara, 1999 ). Attack densities of H. palliatus increased markedly towards the forest interior. The breeding success of H. palliatus was increased with increasing distance from the stand edge.Attacks of bark and wood-boring beetles on mechanically created high stumps of P. abies were studied in central Sweden. H. palliatus was among the most frequently encountered species on the stumps. A negative relationship was found between stump diameter and H. palliatus occupancy ( Schroeder et al., 1999 ). Associations Wingfield and Gibbs (1991) studied the blue-stain fungi associated with H. palliatus. Isolations for blue-stain fungi were made from Hylastes ater, Hylastes opacus, H. palliatus and Tomicus piniperda trapped in Pinus sylvestris billets. Five Leptographium spp. including one of unknown identity and two, apparently undescribed Graphium spp., were isolated. Leptographium procerum, Leptographium serpens [Ophiostoma serpens] and Leptographium wingfieldii were recorded for the first time in the UK. Leptographium lundbergii had previously been

 Leptographium spp. including one of unknown identity and two, apparently undescribed Graphium spp., were isolated. Leptographium procerum, Leptographium serpens [Ophiostoma serpens] and Leptographium wingfieldii were recorded for the first time in the UK. Leptographium lundbergii had previously been found in this country.A dark stain penetrating only shallowly into the sap wood develops round the gallery and is most often caused by Ophiostoma penicillatum ( Lekander et al., 1977 ).In Germany, a new species of the hyphomycete genus Phialocephala, Phialocephala trigonospora, was isolated from conifericolous bark beetles (Dryocoetes autographus, H. palliatus, Ips typographus and Orthotomicus laricis) and their galleries in the bark of Pinus sylvestris and P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1998 ).During a survey of fungi associated with bark beetles (Crypturgus cinereus, Crypturgus pusillus, D. autographus, H. palliatus, I. typographus, Pityogenes chalcographus and Trypodendron lineatum) in Germany, an undescribed species of Ophiostoma was isolated. This differs from the other species of the genus by having pigmented, aseptate, convergent ostiolar hyphae; cucullate, sheathed ascospores; and is a Hyalorhinocladiella anamorph. The species is described as Ophiostoma neglectum. It is rarely associated with primary bark beetles but often associated with secondary bark beetles mainly infesting P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999b ). Diplocladium g

It is rarely associated with primary bark beetles but often associated with secondary bark beetles mainly infesting P. abies ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999b ). Diplocladium gregarium was described almost 100 years ago. It was recent rediscovered from bark beetle (C. pusillus, D. autographus, H. palliatus, I. typographus and Orthotomicus laricis) galleries in the bark of P. abies and Pinus sylvestris in Germany. The fungus was redescribed and a new genus (Cylindrocarpostylus) was proposed to accommodate it ( Kirschner and Oberwinkler, 1999a ). A previously unknown heterobasidiomycetous fungus was isolated from the galleries of H. palliatus, collected from P. abies in Germany. It is described as Atractocolax pulvinatus gen. et sp. nov. (Kirschner et al., 1999). Several species of bark beetles may carry dauer larvae of nematodes. H. palliatus proved to be a vector of dauer larvae of Bursaphelenchus poligraphi, Bursaphelenchus eggersi and Bursaphelenchus sexdentati in Germany ( Braasch et al., 1999 ). Kakulia et al. (1973) studied the nematode fauna of H. palliatus in the Former Republic of Georgia. Parasitorhabditis palliati, Cryptaphelenchus cryptus, B. eggersi, Mikoletzkya palliati, Panagrolaimus fuchsi and Cephalobus persegnis were found in H. palliatus and

Larval galleries are long and almost parallel to each other. Pupation occurs in the sapwood. Young adults have maturation feeding in galleries, thus in high density population primary pattern of galleries becomes unclear. Larvae or pupae overwinter in galleries, while adults in the litter or under the bark.DamageH. palliatus attacks fallen and standing trees, usually dead and those dying. It infests the lower part of stems with the thick bark. This species prefers shaded and moist conditions.Preventive measures and controlRemoval of weakened trees, windthrows etc.Image GalleryReferencesKolk A., Starzyk J.
