Region: Iceland 
As of the effective date listed above, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is restricting the importation of avian commodities 
from the region listed above due to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). 
Avian (bird, poultry, among other) commodities originating from or transiting the region are 
subject to HPAI-related import restrictions, such as those summarized below. Specific 
restrictions can differ by region and change as additional epidemiologic information becomes 
available. Details of region-specific import restrictions will be available through the Veterinary 
Services (VS) Permitting Assistant within a few weeks. 
Restrictions 
Poultry, commercial birds, ratites, and avian hatching eggs: Importation is prohibited. 
Pet and zoo birds, pigeons, and doves: May be imported under an APHIS import permit and

APHIS-22-022 Ι Issued May 2022  
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a very 
contagious, deadly disease of birds. Everyone who owns 
or works with birds needs to know how to safeguard them 
from this devastating disease. This includes facilities 
regulated under the Animal Welfare Act. Whether at a large 
zoo or wildlife rehabilitation facility, strong biosecurity 
measures can prevent an HPAI introduction and keep your 
birds healthy. 
Biosecurity Measures
• Sep arate and compartmentalize  your birds to prevent 
contact with free-ranging (non-captive) wild birds.
• T est and quarantine  all sick birds and newly acquired 
birds to prevent the spread of illness.
• Cle an and disinfect enclosures and equipment used 
for captive birds.
• Pr event cross-contamination  via personnel (staff, 
volunteers, veterinarians) by wearing personal 
protective equipment or dedicated facility clothing  
and shoes and showering before and after contact  
with birds.
Report Sick Birds
HPAI can strike with little to no warning—sudden death, 
decreased food and water consumption, and lethargy are 
common signs. Early detection is vital to keep the disease 
from spreading. If you see any sign of illness in your birds, 
immediately report it to your State veterinarian or the  
U.S. Department of Agriculture (1-866-536-7593). 
Depopulation is NOT required for exhibit flocks with 
HPAI-infected birds. However, if HPAI is suspected in your 
birds, you will need to follow quarantine requirements and 
use proper biosecurity to prevent disease spread.
