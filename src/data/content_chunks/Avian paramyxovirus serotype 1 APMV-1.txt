 
Newcastle Disease (ND)  
Response Plan: The Red Book (2014) 
 
1 

Purpose of Plan 
• Provides responders with: 
– A guiding APHIS policy document  to use during an ND 
outbreak in domestic poultry. 
– Current strategic guidance for control and eradication of 
ND in domestic poultry during an outbreak. 
 
  
 
2 

Definitions 
• Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1) is the etiologic 
agent of ND in birds. 
• APMV-1 viruses that cause ND are either virulent (vNDV) 
or low virulence (loNDV). 
• In the Code of Federal Regulations, ND refers to an 
infection of poultry with vNDV. 
• NDV refers to the virus in general. 
– For example, when discussing environmental persistence.

Target Audience 
• Animal health emergency responders, Federal, 
State, local, and Tribal governments as well as 
industry partners. 

Key Components of the Plan  
• Response Goals 
• Response Strategy 
• Critical Activities and Tools 
• Framework for Incident Management 
 
5 

ND Response Goals 
• Detect, control, and contain ND in domestic poultry as 
quickly as possible. 
• Eradicate ND using strategies that are designed to 
protect public health and the environment and 
stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply, and the 
economy. 
• Provide science- and risk-based approaches and 
systems to facilitate continuity of business for non-
infected animals and non-contaminated animal 
products.

ND Response Strategy 
• The primary control and eradication strategy for ND 
in domestic poultry is stamping-out. 
– Stamping-out is the depopulation of all clinically affected 
and in-contact susceptible poultry. 
– If the spread of ND outpaces the resources for stamping-
out, or if other factors direct the response away from 
stamping-out alone, emergency vaccination strategies 
may be considered. 
• The response strategy will be supported by a 
coordinated public awareness campaign.   
 
 
 
 
 
 

ND Response Strategy 
Stamping-Out Policy 
• Primary strategy for control and eradication of ND in domestic 
poultry. 
• Infected birds will be depopulated in the safest, quickest, and 
most humane way possible. 
• Based on the epidemiology of the outbreak, prioritizing the 
poultry to depopulate first may be necessary. 
• Where resources are limited, premises will be prioritized so that 
those with the highest potential for active ND spread are 
“stamped-out” first.

• Addresses the issues and concerns relating to food safety, 
public health, and animal welfare. 
• Addresses issues and concerns rated to continuity of 
business, interstate commerce, and international trade.
