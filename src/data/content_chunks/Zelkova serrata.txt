 Invasion: Z. serrata is a deciduous broad-leaved tree with vase-shaped or round crown form, maximum height reaches 35 m, and nearly the same in crown width, with trunk diameter reaching 2 m at breast-height. The trunk is straight and well branched, with branches spreading in an upward direction forming a fan-shaped or umbrella-like framework in the crown. Bark is smooth and bright reddish brown during the first few years of new shoots, light grey to greyish brown and lenticels evident when young, and with detaching scales after growing more than 30 cm in trunk diameter.The root system is shallow and has a large lateral spread. Seedling tap roots are thin and lateral root growth is dominant. Tap roots of matured trees divide into thinner roots in the upper soil layers, forming a horizontally expanded root system. Lateral roots from the stump expand just below the ground surface and well branched, thin roots are dense and distributed widely in the root system, binding soil tightly. Root tips are 0.25-0.3 mm in diameter, and 3-4 mm in length (Karizumi, 1987). Leaves are deciduous, alternate, flat and thin; leaf blades are ovate, serrated

 roots from the stump expand just below the ground surface and well branched, thin roots are dense and distributed widely in the root system, binding soil tightly. Root tips are 0.25-0.3 mm in diameter, and 3-4 mm in length (Karizumi, 1987). Leaves are deciduous, alternate, flat and thin; leaf blades are ovate, serrated with a crenate margin, a long acuminate tip, rotund to slightly cordate base, 3-7 (-12) cm long, 1-2.5 (-5) cm wide with short petioles (1-3 mm). Hairs are scattered on the leaf surface; lateral veins are pinnate with 8-18 pairs, terminating in the serrated margin. Z. serrata var. stipulacea has dense hairs on both sides of the leaf blade and on the petiole.Z. serrata has male, bisexual and female flowers, which are small and ornamentally insignificant. Female flowers tend to bloom earlier than male flowers. Several male flowers are axillary on the basal leaves of current shoots with 4-6 stamens; 1(-3) female flowers are axillary on the upper leaves of current shoots with 1 pistil without stamen; and bisexual flowers possess few stamens and are located on the middle parts of current shoots. The number of flowers per shoot and the sex ratio vary among trees and by the position of shoots in the tree crown (Suo and Hashizume, 1995). Primordia of male flowers are formed by late July to August; female primordia are formed by the following March to April; pollen-mother cells develop in late March, and pollens are matured until late April (Taniguchi and Hashizume, 2003). Fruits are small drupes (5 mm in diameter), distorted spherical, ripening to a dark grey colour in September to November.New leaf fl

 flowers are formed by late July to August; female primordia are formed by the following March to April; pollen-mother cells develop in late March, and pollens are matured until late April (Taniguchi and Hashizume, 2003). Fruits are small drupes (5 mm in diameter), distorted spherical, ripening to a dark grey colour in September to November.New leaf flushing and shoot elongation occurs in mid-April, and finishes within a few weeks. Flowering occurs in mid-April to late May at the same time as leaf flushing. Intermittent shoot elongation occurs sporadically during the summer, as lammas shoots, especially in the upper crown. Leaves turn yellow, then orange to reddish brown in October. Viable seeds are dispersed from mid-October to early November. Seed fall begins in September, but most of such early-fallen seeds are not viable. More than 65% of Z. serrata seeds remain attached to the fruiting shoot, and such shoots detach from the tree and drop to the ground far from the mother tree, and may play a role in wind-dispersal (Hoshino, 1990).
 Impacto: No encontrado
 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: Z. serrata grows predominantly within warm- and cool-temperate climate. Precipitation is concentrated in early summer to early autumn as rainfall, and additionally in winter as snowfall in some regions. Z. serrata is grown in average, medium wet, well-drained, acidic, clay, sandy soils. Trees grow differently according to soil fertility and permeability, preferring rich and moist loams, such as the lower slopes and dells ( Asami and Okuda, 1999 ). Established trees are drought tolerant. Z. serrate slightly prefer south-facing, gentle to intermediate slopes, or hollows.
