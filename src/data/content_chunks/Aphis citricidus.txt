 Reproduccion: Based on morphological and molecular analysis, Lagos et al. (2014) reassigned Toxoptera to the genus Aphis , changing its status to subgenus. Further research using molecular methods has been conducted to discriminate A. citricidus from the other species in the subgenus, and especially from the related A. aurantii ( Wang and Qiao, 2009 ) . The biological behaviour of A. citricidus varies significantly depending on climatic conditions. Generally, it is anholocyclic (generations follow one another by parthenogenesis). In temperate regions of Japan, the production of the amphigonic forms and overwintering as a winter egg has been reported ( Komazaki et al., 1979 ) but this is exceptional. Aphis citricidus only infests newly forming shoots. In southern Florida, new shoots generally last 10 days in summer and 10-16 days in autumn and spring.

When the sprout tissues harden and become unsuitable for feeding, alate forms are differentiated for dispersal in search of other susceptible shoots for colonization. The nymphs can move from one tree to another covering a distance of up to 8-12 m. Alate adults, therefore, play an important role in the epidemiology of Citrus tristeza virus . In countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Kenya, Taiwan and Japan, two distinct population peaks per year are observed in the spring and autumn. A two-year field survey conducted in a citrus grove in southern Florida indicated that the population peaks did not fall on the same months each year, they were solely dependent on the rainfall of the preceding months ( Tsai, 1999 ). Spring and autumn flight peaks of alates of A. citricidus occur in South Africa ( Schwartz, 1965 ), Australia ( Carver, 1978 ) and Brazil ( Nickel et al., 1984 ). In Japan, brown citrus aphid populations peak three times per year but can be found on citrus in all seasons, except when overwintering ( Komazaki, 1993 ). The development time of A. citricidus is temperature dependent. At 20°C, the nymphal development time is 6-8 days, and the longevity is 28.4 days. Fecundity is 58.5 offspring/female with an intrinsic rate of natural increase of 0.36, net reproductive rate of 56.2, and mean generation time of 11.2 days. Its thermal threshold is 8.4°C and it required 125-degree days for development ( Komazaki, 1982 ).

Takanashi (1989) reported a slightly longer generation time under similar conditions and differentiated between alatae and aptera development time. The developmental periods of immature stages of A. citricidus in an insectary ranged from 63.1 days at 8°C to 5.5 days at 30°C when eight constant temperatures (8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 28, 30 and 32°C) were evaluated. The lower developmental threshold for the A. citricidus immature instars was estimated at 6.3°C. An upper temperature threshold for the development of the nymph (31.2°C) was determined from a nonlinear biophysical model. The percentage survival of the immature instars varied from 81 to 97% within the temperature range 8-30°C, but survival was reduced to 29% at 32°C. The average longevity of adult females ranged from 60 days at 10°C to 6.5 days at 32°C. The average progeny per female was 52.5 at 20°C and 7.5 at 32°C. The largest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) (0.3765) occurred at 28°C. Populations reared at 10 and 32°C had the lowest rm values of 0.0588 and 0.0960, respectively. The mean generation time of the population ranged from 51 days at 10°C to 8 days at 32°C.

The percentages of immatures surviving at 25±1°C on rough lemon ( Citrus jambhiri ), sour orange ( Citrus aurantium ), grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi ), key lime ( Citrus aurantiifolia ), box orange ( Severinia buxifolia [ Atalantia buxifolia ]), calamondin ( Citrus x macrocarpa [ Citrofortunella macrocarpa ]), lime berry ( Triphasia trifolia ) and orange jassamine ( Murraya paniculata ) were 82.0, 93.5, 93.3, 88.3, 53.1, 86.5, 41.6 and 62.8%, respectively. Developmental times for the immature stages among populations were similar (5.9-6.2 days) on rough lemon, sour orange, grapefruit and key lime. Longer developmental periods (6.5-7.2 days) occurred on box orange, calamondin, lime berry and orange jasmine ( Tsai, 1998 ). The average number of nymphs reproduced per female were 58.8, 43.0, 34.1, 42.5, 32.7, 17.7, 20.8 and 23.0 on sour orange, grapefruit, key lime, rough lemon, calamondin, box orange, lime berry and orange jasmine, respectively.

Female adults lived an average of 22.1, 19.5, 17.5, 18.0, 22.8, 16.3, 22.6 and 14.6 days on these hosts. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) for A. citricidus was highest on grapefruit. Estimates of rm varied from 0.381 on grapefruit to 0.183 on lime berry. The mean population generation time on these hosts ranged from 9.7 to 12.2 days ( Tsai, 1998 ). Aphis citricidus is ant-attended. The main environmental requirement for A. citricidus is the presence of plants of the genus Citrus that can support it nutritionally. The aphid can adapt to environmental conditions that differ from those of its place of origin (warm-humid climate).
 Sintomas: Young shoots are most susceptible to being infested by A. citricidus and support rapid population build-up. Like other aphids, A. citricidus is an external feeder and extracts sap from the host plant by penetrating its stylet into the phloem. Excess plant sap is excreted as honeydew which supports the growth of sooty mould. Heavily infested shoots are easily detected as colonies invade the entire axis. Ants attending the colonies are often present to pick up honeydew. When disturbed, A. citricidus populations sway rapidly in unison, making stridulatory movements with their hind legs presumably to fend off their enemies.

Female adults lived an average of 22.1, 19.5, 17.5, 18.0, 22.8, 16.3, 22.6 and 14.6 days on these hosts. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) for A. citricidus was highest on grapefruit. Estimates of rm varied from 0.381 on grapefruit to 0.183 on lime berry. The mean population generation time on these hosts ranged from 9.7 to 12.2 days ( Tsai, 1998 ). Aphis citricidus is ant-attended. The main environmental requirement for A. citricidus is the presence of plants of the genus Citrus that can support it nutritionally. The aphid can adapt to environmental conditions that differ from those of its place of origin (warm-humid climate).
 Sintomas: Young shoots are most susceptible to being infested by A. citricidus and support rapid population build-up. Like other aphids, A. citricidus is an external feeder and extracts sap from the host plant by penetrating its stylet into the phloem. Excess plant sap is excreted as honeydew which supports the growth of sooty mould. Heavily infested shoots are easily detected as colonies invade the entire axis. Ants attending the colonies are often present to pick up honeydew. When disturbed, A. citricidus populations sway rapidly in unison, making stridulatory movements with their hind legs presumably to fend off their enemies.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics Based on morphological and molecular analysis, Lagos et al. (2014) reassigned Toxoptera to the genus Aphis , changing its status to subgenus. Further research using molecular methods has been conducted to discriminate A. citricidus from the other species in the subgenus, and especially from the related A. aurantii ( Wang and Qiao, 2009 ) . Reproductive Biology The biological behaviour of A. citricidus varies significantly depending on climatic conditions. Generally, it is anholocyclic (generations follow one another by parthenogenesis). In temperate regions of Japan, the production of the amphigonic forms and overwintering as a winter egg has been reported ( Komazaki et al., 1979 ) but this is exceptional. Physiology and Phenology Aphis citricidus only infests newly forming shoots. In southern Florida, new shoots generally last 10 days in summer and 10-16 days in autumn and spring. When the sprout tissues harden and become unsuitable for feeding, alate forms are differentiated for dispersal in search of other susceptible shoots for colonization. The nymphs can move from one tree to another covering a distance of up to 8-12 m. Alate adults, therefore, play an important role in the epidemiology of Citrus tristeza virus . In countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Kenya, Taiwan and Japan, two distinct population peaks per year are observed in the spring and autumn. A two-year field survey conducted in a

s can move from one tree to another covering a distance of up to 8-12 m. Alate adults, therefore, play an important role in the epidemiology of Citrus tristeza virus . In countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Kenya, Taiwan and Japan, two distinct population peaks per year are observed in the spring and autumn. A two-year field survey conducted in a citrus grove in southern Florida indicated that the population peaks did not fall on the same months each year, they were solely dependent on the rainfall of the preceding months ( Tsai, 1999 ). Spring and autumn flight peaks of alates of A. citricidus occur in South Africa ( Schwartz, 1965 ), Australia ( Carver, 1978 ) and Brazil ( Nickel et al., 1984 ). In Japan, brown citrus aphid populations peak three times per year but can be found on citrus in all seasons, except when overwintering ( Komazaki, 1993 ). The development time of A. citricidus is temperature dependent. At 20°C, the nymphal development time is 6-8 days, and the longevity is 28.4 days. Fecundity is 58.5 offspring/female with an intrinsic rate of natural increase of 0.36, net reproductive rate of 56.2, and mean generation time of 11.2 days. Its thermal threshold is 8.4°C and it required 125-degree days for development ( Komazaki, 1982 ). Takanashi (1989) reported a slightly longer generation time under similar conditions and differentiated between alatae and aptera development time. The developmental periods of immature stages of A. citricidus in an insectary ranged from 63.1 days at 8°C to 5.5 days at 30°C when eight constant temperatures (8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 28, 30 and 32°C) were evaluated.

tera development time. The developmental periods of immature stages of A. citricidus in an insectary ranged from 63.1 days at 8°C to 5.5 days at 30°C when eight constant temperatures (8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 28, 30 and 32°C) were evaluated. The lower developmental threshold for the A. citricidus immature instars was estimated at 6.3°C. An upper temperature threshold for the development of the nymph (31.2°C) was determined from a nonlinear biophysical model. The percentage survival of the immature instars varied from 81 to 97% within the temperature range 8-30°C, but survival was reduced to 29% at 32°C. The average longevity of adult females ranged from 60 days at 10°C to 6.5 days at 32°C. The average progeny per female was 52.5 at 20°C and 7.5 at 32°C. The largest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) (0.3765) occurred at 28°C. Populations reared at 10 and 32°C had the lowest rm values of 0.0588 and 0.0960, respectively. The mean generation time of the population ranged from 51 days at 10°C to 8 days at 32°C. The optimal temperature range for population growth of the brown citrus aphid was 20-30°C ( Tsai and Wang, 1999 ). Host plants also influence the development, survival, longevity and reproduction of A. citricidus .
