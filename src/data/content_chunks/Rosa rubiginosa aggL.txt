Rosa rubiginosa agg.L. - Sweet-briar  -Rosaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney(Map updated: March 2008)Sweetbriar, also known as eglantine, is a rather uncommon native wild rose species of basic soils. It is an erect-growing shrub with bright pink flowers and the leaves have many sticky fruity-scented brown glands on the undersurface of the leaves, which have rather rounded leaflets. The older stems carry a mixture of large thorns and more slender prickles.The fruity scent of the leaves when rubbed (some describe it as like apples) is quite strong and distinctive and a good guide to identification if you can smell it, but a minority of people cannot detect this scent.All names:Rosa rubiginosa agg.L.;Rosa eglanteriaauct.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
