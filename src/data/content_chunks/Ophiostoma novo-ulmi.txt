 Invasion: Colonies of O. novo-ulmi are greyish- to cream-white when grown on Oxoid malt extract agar (MEA) at 20°C for 7 days in darkness followed by 10 days in diffuse daylight. The colony form ranges from regular striate petaloid to irregular lobed. The colonies commonly show moderate aerial mycelium, aggregated into ropes to give a fibrous, striate appearance. Occasionally, colonies are observed with less aerial mycelium and frosty to smooth mycelium ('uniform powdery' form, only in subsp. novo-ulmi;Brasier and Kirk, 2001). Diurnal zonation of the colonies is moderate to strong. Growth on MEA at 20°C in the dark ranges from 3.1 to 4.8 mm per day, the growth optimum is around 20-22°C, and the maximum temperature is 32-33°C. This feature is important for distinguishing O. novo-ulmi from O. ulmi.Hyphae are septate, and ca 1-6 µm diameter; the aerial hyphae are often aggregated into strands

 3.1 to 4.8 mm per day, the growth optimum is around 20-22°C, and the maximum temperature is 32-33°C. This feature is important for distinguishing O. novo-ulmi from O. ulmi.Hyphae are septate, and ca 1-6 µm diameter; the aerial hyphae are often aggregated into strands. Mycelial conidia are usually produced abundantly. The sporothrix conidiophores are mostly lateral, ca 10-30 µm long; their conidia are borne on short denticles of 0.5-1 µm. Sporothrix-like conidia are non-septate, hyaline, variably ellipsoid to elongate, often tapering and slightly curved, with a small attachment collar. Conidia are 4.5-14 x 2-3 µm. The mycelial conidia are often aggregated into mucilaginous droplets and bud in a yeast-like fashion. The synnemetal anamorph (Pesotum) is usually absent on malt agar and is only produced on elm wood or on media containing elm wood. Synnemata are single or multiple, brown-black, slender and up to 1-2 mm tall. They are attached to the substratum by brown, rhizoid-like hyphae and are composed of parallel bundles of brown, septate hyphae, flaring at the top to branched hyaline hyphae producing non-septate, hyaline, ovoid to ellipsoid conidia (2-6 x 1-3 µm), which aggregate into a cream-white mucilaginous spore drop. The budding, yeast-like anamorph is produced in liquid cultures, and on the surface of solid media. Ascoma (perithecia) are only formed when isolates of

The budding, yeast-like anamorph is produced in liquid cultures, and on the surface of solid media. Ascoma (perithecia) are only formed when isolates of different mating types (termed A and B) are present and only on media containing elm wood. The ascoma are globose at the base, black, 75-140 µm wide, sparsely to moderately bristly; their necks are black, 230-640 µm long, and carry numerous ostiolar hyphae. Asci are thin-walled, globose to oval, evanescent. Ascospores are hyaline, non-septate, orange-segment shaped, 4.5-6 x 1-1.5 µm and accumulate as a cream-white mucilaginous spore drop (Brasier, 1991).O. novo-ulmi subsp. novo-ulmi differs from O. novo-ulmi subsp. americana as follows: the radial growth rate on Oxoid MEA at 20°C is ca 3.1-4.4 mm/day (3.2-4.8 mm/day in subsp. americana). Colonies on MEA at 20°C are commonly irregularly fibrous striate (regularly fibrous striate in subsp. americana). 'Uniform powdery' ('up-mut') mycelial-mycelial dimorphism is present (not present in subsp. americana). Ascoma have neck lengths of approximately 230-640 µm (only ca 160-420 µm in subsp. americana); the base width is ca 75-160 µm (85-

Ascoma have neck lengths of approximately 230-640 µm (only ca 160-420 µm in subsp. americana); the base width is ca 75-160 µm (85-150 µm in subsp. americana); neck length/base width ratio lies between 1.9 and 7.4 (1.6-4.5 in subsp. americana) (Brasier, 1981;Brasier and Kirk, 2001).Colonies of O. novo-ulmi are prone to degeneration in culture and should be stored at low temperatures, preferentially in liquid nitrogen (Brasier, 1991).

 Reproduccion: GeneticsThere are usually five chromosomes in the haploid genome of O. novo-ulmi. However, Dewar and Bernier (1993) identified an isolate with seven chromosomes. This polymorphism proved stable in pairings with other isolates and did not have any effect on growth and pathogenicity ( Dewar and Bernier, 1995 ; Dewar et al., 1997 ). Polymorphism in chromosome size and number is a characteristic found in other fungal species (e.g. Kistler and Miao, 1992 ). The mitochondrial DNA of O. novo-ulmi is 48-71 kb, compared to 74-88 kb in O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ).Considerable research has been devoted to the molecular characterization of O. novo-ulmi and its differentiation from O. ulmi.

Differences between the two species have been found in protein and isoenzyme patterns ( Bernier et al., 1983 ; Jeng and Hubbes, 1983 ; Jeng et al., 1988 ), and in RFLPs of mitochondrial ( Bates et al., 1993b ), nuclear ( Bates et al., 1993a ) and ribosomal DNA ( Hintz et al., 1993 ). RAPDs have also been used to differentiate the two species ( Pipe et al., 1995 ; Hoegger et al., 1996 ). Differences have also been found in the cerato-ulmin gene ( Jeng et al., 1996 ; Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two species are separated most effectively by PCR-RFLP of ribosomal DNA ( Harrington et al., 2001 ). The two subspecies (subsp. novo-ulmi and subsp. americana) of O. novo-ulmi can be separated using a wide range of markers. The mitochondrial DNA is 65-71 kb in subsp. novo-ulmi compared to 48-60 kb in subsp. americana ( Brasier and Kirk, 2001 ). Differences were found in isoenzyme patterns ( Jeng et al., 1988 ), RFLPs of mitochondrial ( Bates et al., 1993b ) and nuclear DNA ( Bates et al., 1993a ), RAPDs, and in the DNA sequence of the cerato-ulmin gene ( Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two subspecies can be further differentiated by PCR-RFLP of their cerato-ulmin and colony type genes ( Konrad et al., 2002 ).

 in the DNA sequence of the cerato-ulmin gene ( Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two subspecies can be further differentiated by PCR-RFLP of their cerato-ulmin and colony type genes ( Konrad et al., 2002 ). Evidence for natural hybridization between the two subspecies in Europe was provided by Jeng et al. (1988) and Konrad et al. (2002) . Both subspecies of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi show different degrees of sexual incompatibility to each other. Both species are heterothallic with the two mating types A and B ( Shafer and Liming, 1950 ; Brasier, 1991 ). While O. novo-ulmi strongly rejects O. ulmi as the male in pairings, O. ulmi unrestrictedly accepts O. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner ( Brasier, 1981 ). In pairings between isolates of the two subspecies, subsp. novo-ulmi partially rejects subsp. americana as the male (ca 90% less fertile perithecia than in novo-ulmi x novo-ulmi matings), whereas in pairings with subsp. americana as the female and subsp. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner, full mating can be observed ( Brasier, 1979 ). These mating barriers strongly support both the species status of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi as well as the designation of the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi. Hybrids between O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi also show a marked loss in fitness and are transient in natural populations ( Brasier et al., 1998 ), but may act as a 'genetic bridge' in the transfer of genes between the two species.Mycoviruses, termed d-factors ( Brasier, 1983 ) occur naturally in the cytop

. Hybrids between O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi also show a marked loss in fitness and are transient in natural populations ( Brasier et al., 1998 ), but may act as a 'genetic bridge' in the transfer of genes between the two species.Mycoviruses, termed d-factors ( Brasier, 1983 ) occur naturally in the cytoplasm of the Dutch elm disease fungi. They spread by hyphal fusion between compatible mycelia and cause detrimental effects on affected isolates, resulting in reduced spore production and loss of virulence ( Brasier, 1984 ). The spread of d-factors within a population is hindered by the production of ascospores, which are free of virus particles, and by vegetative incompatibility (vic) between fungal strains. Hence, diversity in both mating type (allows sexual sporulation) and vic genes (creates incompatibility between mycelia) is an important fitness trait in populations of O. novo-ulmi. Recent evidence suggests that interspecific hybridization events have played a major role in the evolution of Dutch elm disease fungi. O. ulmi introgressants into O. novo-ulmi have been identified in different parts of the O. novo-ulmi population ( Brasier, 2001 ). There is evidence that a pathogenicity gene from O. ulmi introgressed into a hypovirulent isolate of O. novo-ulmi ( Et-Touil et al., 1999 ). The acquisition of a mating type gene of O. ulmi by O. novo-ulmi has been shown and vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes of O. ulmi have also been found in isolates of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 2001 ). These hybridization events and their effect on the vic system of O. novo-ulmi may be, at least partially, responsible

 type gene of O. ulmi by O. novo-ulmi has been shown and vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes of O. ulmi have also been found in isolates of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 2001 ). These hybridization events and their effect on the vic system of O. novo-ulmi may be, at least partially, responsible for the persistent high fitness of the pathogen population ( Brasier, 2000a ). The hybridization occuring between the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi in central and other parts of Europe contributes to the ongoing evolution of the Dutch elm disease fungi ( Brasier, 2001 ; Konrad et al., 2002 ).Physiology and PhenologyO. novo-ulmi is the causal agent of the current Dutch elm disease pandemics in North America, Europe and western and central Asia. It exhibits a much higher degree of virulence than O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ). Phytotoxic compounds have been assumed to be responsible for the high level of virulence in O. novo-ulmi. In particular, the role of the hydrophobin cerato-ulmin (CU) in the pathogenesis of DED has been the subject of extensive investigation because it was reported as a wilt toxin ( Takai, 1974 ). CU production is one of the distinguishing features between O. ulmi and novo-ulmi, as O. novo-ulmi (in contrast to O. ulmi) produces moderate to high amounts of CU in liquid culture ( Scheffer et al., 1987 ). Takai (1980) showed a correlation between high CU production and high virulence. The injection of purified CU into elms caused wilting, a reduction in transpiration, an increase in leaf respiration and electrolyte loss ( Takai, 1974 ). Symptoms were the same as those observed in elms infected with the fungus ( Tak

 of CU in liquid culture ( Scheffer et al., 1987 ). Takai (1980) showed a correlation between high CU production and high virulence. The injection of purified CU into elms caused wilting, a reduction in transpiration, an increase in leaf respiration and electrolyte loss ( Takai, 1974 ). Symptoms were the same as those observed in elms infected with the fungus ( Takai and Hiratsuka, 1984 ). The higher aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi compared to O. ulmi was thus attributed to a higher expression of the protein in the aggressive species caused by differences in the promoter sequence of the CU gene and the derived amino-acid sequence ( Jeng et al., 1996 ). Further evidence suggested that the role of CU should be re-evaluated because a non-CU-producing natural mutant of O. novo-ulmi (Brasier et al., 1995) and mutants induced in the laboratory ( Bowden et al., 1996 ) retained high virulence. CU was therefore proposed to be a parasitic fitness factor, with its main function to protect against desiccation, thereby helping spores to survive during unfavourable conditions such as dispersal ( Temple et al., 1997 ; Temple and Horgen, 2000 ). However, when non-pathogenic O. quercus was transformed with the CU gene from O. novo-ulmi it was able to cause symptoms of DED on elm (Del Sorbo et al., 2000). This emphasises the need for further investigation of the aetiology of Dutch elm disease.By analysing European populations of O. novo-ulmi, Brasier (1988) showed that populations can rapidly change their genetic structure after establishment at a new disease location. The initially clonal population commonly consists only of isolates of mating type B with one, or a few, vegetative incompatibility (vic) types predominating. The predominance of mating type B in

 disease.By analysing European populations of O. novo-ulmi, Brasier (1988) showed that populations can rapidly change their genetic structure after establishment at a new disease location. The initially clonal population commonly consists only of isolates of mating type B with one, or a few, vegetative incompatibility (vic) types predominating. The predominance of mating type B in all populations of O. novo-ulmi has been ascribed to the slightly higher virulence of B type isolates ( Brasier, 1991 ). However, the population soon becomes highly diverse in terms of vic and mating types. High selection pressure for sexual reproduction, which creates vic diversity in the population within a short period of time through the spread of mycoviruses in the clonal population, is believed to be the cause of this phenomenon ( Brasier, 1996a ). However, differences in the structure of European and North American populations of O. novo-ulmi have been reported. Although European populations generally show a high diversification of vic types at post-epidemic sites, only three vic types made up 88% of the isolates in a study in the USA ( Brasier, 1996a ). A low incidence of mycovirus infection in North America is believed to be the cause of this difference ( Brasier and Kirk, 2000 ).Reproductive BiologyThe life cycle of O. novo-ulmi is one of the best studied in plant pathology and often is used as a textbook example of insect-pathogen interactions. Two stages are distinct in the life cycle: the parasitic phase involving host colonization, overcoming host resistance, and growth inside the host tissue; and the saprophytic phase inside the bark involving sporulation of the fungus in the breeding galleries of its bark beetle (Scolytus and Hylurgopinus) vectors. As O. novo-ulmi is fully reliant on dissemination by bark beetles, its lifestyle

 the life cycle: the parasitic phase involving host colonization, overcoming host resistance, and growth inside the host tissue; and the saprophytic phase inside the bark involving sporulation of the fungus in the breeding galleries of its bark beetle (Scolytus and Hylurgopinus) vectors. As O. novo-ulmi is fully reliant on dissemination by bark beetles, its lifestyle is perfectly adapted to its vectors.When the young bark beetles emerge in spring from their pupation chambers in the bark of an elm tree they already carry the fungus. The fungus has spread and sporulated inside the breeding gallery of the beetles during the winter and spring. The young beetle is often surrounded in its pupal chamber by synnemata of the fungus and has ample opportunity to catch a high number of spores ( Webber, 1990 ). After pupation, the young beetles fly to the twigs of healthy elms for maturation feeding. They feed on the phloem and also the xylem tissue on branches, in twig crotches or leaf axils. The fungus is inoculated into the elm tree by the beetle during this essential phase. After the establishment of infection, the fungus spreads throughout the xylem vessels of the elm tree in its yeast-like stage and causes a vascular wilt (Sinclair and Campana, 1978). To complete the disease cycle, the pathogen must again come into contact with its vectors. The scolytid beetles must breed in the bark of the dying elms in order for this to occur. As the galleries of the bark beetles superficially penetrate the xylem, the fungus is 'released' from the vascular system of the elm and starts growing into the phloem (bark) of the elm. Other O. novo-ulmi genotypes are introduced into the bark with the beetles ( Webber, 2000 ). The combined process of beetle and pathogen colonization of

 the galleries of the bark beetles superficially penetrate the xylem, the fungus is 'released' from the vascular system of the elm and starts growing into the phloem (bark) of the elm. Other O. novo-ulmi genotypes are introduced into the bark with the beetles ( Webber, 2000 ). The combined process of beetle and pathogen colonization of elm bark is known as the saprophytic phase ( Webber et al., 1987 ). During this phase a marked sequence in sporulation can be seen in the breeding galleries of the bark beetles. The production of fruiting structures appears to follow a predetermined, ontogenetic sequence which starts with the mycelial sporothrix stage, is followed by the formation of synnemata (Pesotum), and ends with the production of perithecia ( Webber et al., 1987 ). Sexual sporulation is important for the fungus to maintain the fitness of the population by the creation of new genotypes. The saprophytic phase is therefore one of the most crucial periods in the life cycle of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 1984 ). In the case of an overwintering brood, the formation of perithecia coincides with the fall in temperature; perithecia might thus act as an overwintering stage ( Lea and Brasier, 1983 ). When the young beetles, which by now carry the fungus, emerge from the breeding systems they fly to the branches of healthy elm trees for feeding. After successful inoculation of the fungus into the elm the disease cycle is complete.Environmental RequirementsO. novo-ulmi inhabits the xylem and bark of elm trees, particularly in and around the breeding galleries of scolytid beetles.

 elm the disease cycle is complete.Environmental RequirementsO. novo-ulmi inhabits the xylem and bark of elm trees, particularly in and around the breeding galleries of scolytid beetles. Climatic conditions in the breeding galleries of the bark beetles are important for the growth of O. novo-ulmi inside the bark and its subsequent sporulation (saprophytic phase). Microclimatic conditions are best for the fungus in relatively thick parts of the bark, where the moisture content is highest and relatively constant. Prolonged exposure to high summer temperatures and the combined action of a lower initial moisture content and lack of nutrients in the outer bark usually inhibits sporulation of O. novo-ulmi in stems and branches of smaller diameter ( Webber, 1990 ). The preferred breeding site of a bark beetle therefore largely determines its success as a vector of Dutch elm disease ( Webber, 2000 ).As the optimum growth temperature for O. novo-ulmi is around 22°C ( Brasier, 1981 ), the pathogen is able to move further to the north than O. ulmi, which has an optimum growth temperature of ca 28°C. This is exemplified by the situation in northern Scotland, UK, where Dutch elm disease became evident only after the arrival of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 1996b ).AssociationsO. novo-ulmi is closely associated with its bark beetle vectors from the genera Scolytus (North America, Europe and western Asia) and Hylurgopinus (in North America only). The bark beetles act not only as vectors, but also provide sites for sporulation of the fungus in their breeding galleries. Scolytus scolytus is the most effective vector carrying up to 350,000 spores ( Webber, 1990 ). About 1000 spores are generally required for effective infection by O. novo-ulmi on an intermediate susceptible

urgopinus (in North America only). The bark beetles act not only as vectors, but also provide sites for sporulation of the fungus in their breeding galleries. Scolytus scolytus is the most effective vector carrying up to 350,000 spores ( Webber, 1990 ). About 1000 spores are generally required for effective infection by O. novo-ulmi on an intermediate susceptible host such as Ulmus procera ( Webber, 2000 ). Two smaller species Scolytus multistriatus and S. pygmaeus, are less effective vectors in Europe ( Faccoli and Battisti, 1997 ). Spore load was found to vary between spring-emerging beetles (e.g. 58% beetles infested with spores) and summer-emerging beetles (e.g. only 8% beetles infested with spores) ( Faccoli and Battisti, 1997 ). This probably relates to climatic conditions in the bark, which may be too dry in summer for extensive sporulation to occur. The relationship between O. novo-ulmi and its vectors can be considered as mutualistic because both profit from their combined attack on the elms. However, the vectors do not rely solely on the fungus for creating breeding sites and, in fact, the high aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi is decimating the number of available hosts for the beetles, especially Scolytus scolytus in Europe, which needs relatively mature trees for successful breeding. Webber and Gibbs (1989) also found that S. scolytus has to feed on phloem tissue that is free of fungal growth for successful development from first- to third-instar larvae, otherwise the larvae are killed.The role of mites in the breeding galleries of bark beetles must not be disregarded.

Although they eat a significant part of the fungal biomass, they also play an important role in the dissemination of fungal spores inside the breeding galleries ( Brasier, 1978 ). Fransen (1939) reported that mites drag the spores of the pathogen through the frass in the larval galleries to the pupal chambers, thus forming a carpet of synnemata inside the chamber, which greatly enhances the opportunities for distribution of the spores by the young beetles. Brasier (1984) showed experimentally that the activity of the mites can enhance sexual sporulation of the fungus.
 Sintomas: The symptoms of infection by O. novo-ulmi are that of a typical vascular wilt disease. The first external symptoms on an elm tree are discoloration or drooping of the leaves at the tip of a branch. Subsequently, the leaves yellow, curl, turn brown, and finally fall off the tree soon after they have died. Alternatively, leaves can dry out rapidly, turn a dull green before dying, and remain attached to the twigs for several weeks. The shoot tip may wither and droop. A branch carrying only a few wilted leaves at the tip is called a 'flag'. Small flags develop when Scolytus bark beetles feed on the twig crotches of elms. Hylurgopinus rufipes causes the formation of large elm flags, because it feeds on the branches. This is important in control programmes as the small flags caused by the Scolytus feeding are easily missed during surveys (Sinclair and Campana, 1978). Characteristic diagnostic symptoms for DED are commonly seen in the xylem of

ig crotches of elms. Hylurgopinus rufipes causes the formation of large elm flags, because it feeds on the branches. This is important in control programmes as the small flags caused by the Scolytus feeding are easily missed during surveys (Sinclair and Campana, 1978). Characteristic diagnostic symptoms for DED are commonly seen in the xylem of affected twigs and branches. Browning of the water-conducting vessels of the whole outer growth ring can be seen on cross-section, also brown streaking in the direction of the grain on the twig, after removal of the bark. However, symptoms may vary and trees with extensive wilting may not show any discoloration and vice versa (Sutherland et al., 1997). The discoloration is caused by tylosis formation by the elm as a reaction to the fungal infection ( Duchesne, 1993 ). Symptoms usually start to appear between July and autumn leaf fall. When the infection is mediated by bark beetles, symptoms start at single branches, which die back starting from the top. If the disease reaches the stem the whole tree may die in the same year (especially smaller trees) or the year after the infection. O. novo-ulmi is a far more virulent pathogen than O. ulmi and can move from the branches towards the stem in only a few weeks ( Scala et al., 1997 ). Infections via root grafts usually kill a tree faster than infections caused by vectors as the propagules are rapidly distributed throughout the tree with the sapstream (Stipes and Campana, 1981). Recovery of infected elms is rarely seen with O. novo-ulmi infection ( Brasier, 1991 ). If the infection occurs during late summer and autumn, leaves will often only change colour prematurely and have normal budset; however, the branch will be dead in the next spring and the disease will have spread further into the tree.

Evidence for natural hybridization between the two subspecies in Europe was provided by Jeng et al. (1988) and Konrad et al. (2002) . Both subspecies of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi show different degrees of sexual incompatibility to each other. Both species are heterothallic with the two mating types A and B ( Shafer and Liming, 1950 ; Brasier, 1991 ). While O. novo-ulmi strongly rejects O. ulmi as the male in pair

 al. (2002) . Both subspecies of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi show different degrees of sexual incompatibility to each other. Both species are heterothallic with the two mating types A and B ( Shafer and Liming, 1950 ; Brasier, 1991 ). While O. novo-ulmi strongly rejects O. ulmi as the male in pairings, O. ulmi unrestrictedly accepts O. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner ( Brasier, 1981 ). In pairings between isolates of the two subspecies, subsp. novo-ulmi partially rejects subsp. americana as the male (ca 90% less fertile perithecia than in novo-ulmi x novo-ulmi matings), whereas in pairings with subsp. americana as the female and subsp. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner, full mating can be observed ( Brasier, 1979 ). These mating barriers strongly support both the species status of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi as well as the designation of the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi. Hybrids between O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi also show a marked loss in fitness and are transient in natural populations ( Brasier et al., 1998 ), but may act as a 'genetic bridge' in the transfer of genes between the two species.Mycoviruses, termed d-factors ( Brasier, 1983 ) occur naturally in the cytoplasm of the Dutch elm disease fungi. They spread by hyphal fusion between compatible mycelia and cause detrimental effects on affected isolates, resulting in reduced spore production and loss of virulence ( Brasier, 1984 ). The spread of d-factors within a population is hindered by the production of ascospores, which are free of virus particles, and by vegetative incomp

toplasm of the Dutch elm disease fungi. They spread by hyphal fusion between compatible mycelia and cause detrimental effects on affected isolates, resulting in reduced spore production and loss of virulence ( Brasier, 1984 ). The spread of d-factors within a population is hindered by the production of ascospores, which are free of virus particles, and by vegetative incompatibility (vic) between fungal strains. Hence, diversity in both mating type (allows sexual sporulation) and vic genes (creates incompatibility between mycelia) is an important fitness trait in populations of O. novo-ulmi. Recent evidence suggests that interspecific hybridization events have played a major role in the evolution of Dutch elm disease fungi. O. ulmi introgressants into O. novo-ulmi have been identified in different parts of the O. novo-ulmi population ( Brasier, 2001 ). There is evidence that a pathogenicity gene from O. ulmi introgressed into a hypovirulent isolate of O. novo-ulmi ( Et-Touil et al., 1999 ). The acquisition of a mating type gene of O. ulmi by O. novo-ulmi has been shown and vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes of O. ulmi have also been found in isolates of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 2001 ). These hybridization events and their effect on the vic system of O. novo-ulmi may be, at least partially, responsible for the persistent high fitness of the pathogen population ( Brasier, 2000a ). The hybridization occuring between the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi in central and other parts of Europe contributes to the ongoing evolution of the Dutch elm disease fungi ( Brasier, 2001 ; Konrad et al., 2002 ).Physiology and PhenologyO. novo-ulmi

 responsible for the persistent high fitness of the pathogen population ( Brasier, 2000a ). The hybridization occuring between the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi in central and other parts of Europe contributes to the ongoing evolution of the Dutch elm disease fungi ( Brasier, 2001 ; Konrad et al., 2002 ).Physiology and PhenologyO. novo-ulmi is the causal agent of the current Dutch elm disease pandemics in North America, Europe and western and central Asia. It exhibits a much higher degree of virulence than O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ). Phytotoxic compounds have been assumed to be responsible for the high level of virulence in O. novo-ulmi. In particular, the role of the hydrophobin cerato-ulmin (CU) in the pathogenesis of DED has been the subject of extensive investigation because it was reported as a wilt toxin ( Takai, 1974 ). CU production is one of the distinguishing features between O. ulmi and novo-ulmi, as O. novo-ulmi (in contrast to O. ulmi) produces moderate to high amounts of CU in liquid culture ( Scheffer et al., 1987 ). Takai (1980) showed a correlation between high CU production and high virulence. The injection of purified CU into elms caused wilting, a reduction in transpiration, an increase in leaf respiration and electrolyte loss ( Takai, 1974 ). Symptoms were the same as those observed in elms infected with the fungus ( Takai and Hiratsuka, 1984 ). The higher aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi compared to O. ulmi was thus attributed to a higher expression of the protein in the aggressive species caused by differences in the promoter sequence of the CU gene and the derived amino-acid sequence ( Jeng et al., 1996 ). Further evidence suggested that the role of CU should be re-eval

 Takai and Hiratsuka, 1984 ). The higher aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi compared to O. ulmi was thus attributed to a higher expression of the protein in the aggressive species caused by differences in the promoter sequence of the CU gene and the derived amino-acid sequence ( Jeng et al., 1996 ). Further evidence suggested that the role of CU should be re-evaluated because a non-CU-producing natural mutant of O. novo-ulmi (Brasier et al., 1995) and mutants induced in the laboratory ( Bowden et al., 1996 ) retained high virulence. CU was therefore proposed to be a parasitic fitness factor, with its main function to protect against desiccation, thereby helping spores to survive during unfavourable conditions such as dispersal ( Temple et al., 1997 ; Temple and Horgen, 2000 ). However, when non-pathogenic O. quercus was transformed with the CU gene from O. novo-ulmi it was able to cause symptoms of DED on elm (Del Sorbo et al., 2000). This emphasises the need for further investigation of the aetiology of Dutch elm disease.By analysing European populations of O. novo-ulmi, Brasier (1988) showed that populations can rapidly change their genetic structure after establishment at a new disease location. The initially clonal population commonly consists only of isolates of mating type B with one, or a few, vegetative incompatibility (vic) types predominating. The predominance of mating type B in all populations of O. novo-ulmi has been ascribed to the slightly higher virulence of B type isolates ( Brasier, 1991 ). However, the population soon becomes highly diverse in terms of vic and mating types.

 in all populations of O. novo-ulmi has been ascribed to the slightly higher virulence of B type isolates ( Brasier, 1991 ). However, the population soon becomes highly diverse in terms of vic and mating types. High selection pressure for sexual reproduction, which creates vic diversity in the population within a short period of time through the spread of mycoviruses in the clonal population, is believed to be the cause of this phenomenon ( Brasier, 1996a ). However, differences in the structure of European and North American populations of O. novo-ulmi have been reported. Although European populations generally show a high diversification of vic types at post-epidemic sites, only three vic types made up 88% of the isolates in a study in the USA ( Brasier, 1996a ). A low incidence of mycovirus infection in North America is believed to be the cause of this difference ( Brasier and Kirk, 2000 ).Reproductive BiologyThe life cycle of O. novo-ulmi is one of the best studied in plant pathology and often is used as a textbook example of insect-pathogen interactions. Two stages are distinct in the life cycle: the parasitic phase involving host colonization, overcoming host resistance, and growth inside the host tissue; and the saprophytic phase inside the bark involving sporulation of the fungus in the breeding galleries of its bark beetle (Scolytus and Hylurgopinus) vectors. As O. novo-ulmi is fully reliant on dissemination by bark beetles, its lifestyle is perfectly adapted to its vectors.When the young bark beetles emerge in spring from their pupation chambers in the bark of an elm tree they already carry the fungus. The fungus has spread and sporulated inside the breeding gallery of the beetles during the winter and spring.

 lifestyle is perfectly adapted to its vectors.When the young bark beetles emerge in spring from their pupation chambers in the bark of an elm tree they already carry the fungus. The fungus has spread and sporulated inside the breeding gallery of the beetles during the winter and spring. The young beetle is often surrounded in its pupal chamber by synnemata of the fungus and has ample opportunity to catch a high number of spores ( Webber, 1990 ). After pupation, the young beetles fly to the twigs of healthy elms for maturation feeding. They feed on the phloem and also the xylem tissue on branches, in twig crotches or leaf axils. The fungus is inoculated into the elm tree by the beetle during this essential phase. After the establishment of infection, the fungus spreads throughout the xylem vessels of the elm tree in its yeast-like stage and causes a vascular wilt (Sinclair and Campana, 1978). To complete the disease cycle, the pathogen must again come into contact with its vectors. The scolytid beetles must breed in the bark of the dying elms in order for this to occur. As the galleries of the bark beetles superficially penetrate the xylem, the fungus is 'released' from the vascular system of the elm and starts growing into the phloem (bark) of the elm. Other O. novo-ulmi genotypes are introduced into the bark with the beetles ( Webber, 2000 ). The combined process of beetle and pathogen colonization of elm bark is known as the saprophytic phase ( Webber et al., 1987 ). During this phase a marked sequence in sporulation can be seen in the breeding galleries of the bark beetles. The production of fruiting structures appears to follow a predetermined, ontogenetic sequence which starts with the mycelial sporothrix stage, is followed by the formation of synnemata

 of elm bark is known as the saprophytic phase ( Webber et al., 1987 ). During this phase a marked sequence in sporulation can be seen in the breeding galleries of the bark beetles. The production of fruiting structures appears to follow a predetermined, ontogenetic sequence which starts with the mycelial sporothrix stage, is followed by the formation of synnemata (Pesotum), and ends with the production of perithecia ( Webber et al., 1987 ). Sexual sporulation is important for the fungus to maintain the fitness of the population by the creation of new genotypes. The saprophytic phase is therefore one of the most crucial periods in the life cycle of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 1984 ). In the case of an overwintering brood, the formation of perithecia coincides with the fall in temperature; perithecia might thus act as an overwintering stage ( Lea and Brasier, 1983 ). When the young beetles, which by now carry the fungus, emerge from the breeding systems they fly to the branches of healthy elm trees for feeding. After successful inoculation of the fungus into the elm the disease cycle is complete.Environmental RequirementsO. novo-ulmi inhabits the xylem and bark of elm trees, particularly in and around the breeding galleries of scolytid beetles. Climatic conditions in the breeding galleries of the bark beetles are important for the growth of O. novo-ulmi inside the bark and its subsequent sporulation (saprophytic phase). Microclimatic conditions are best for the fungus in relatively thick parts of the bark, where the moisture content is highest and relatively constant. Prolonged exposure to high summer temperatures and the combined action of a lower initial moisture content and lack of nutrients in the outer bark usually inhibits sporulation of O. novo-ulmi in stems and branches of smaller diameter ( Web

rophytic phase). Microclimatic conditions are best for the fungus in relatively thick parts of the bark, where the moisture content is highest and relatively constant. Prolonged exposure to high summer temperatures and the combined action of a lower initial moisture content and lack of nutrients in the outer bark usually inhibits sporulation of O. novo-ulmi in stems and branches of smaller diameter ( Webber, 1990 ). The preferred breeding site of a bark beetle therefore largely determines its success as a vector of Dutch elm disease ( Webber, 2000 ).As the optimum growth temperature for O. novo-ulmi is around 22°C ( Brasier, 1981 ), the pathogen is able to move further to the north than O. ulmi, which has an optimum growth temperature of ca 28°C. This is exemplified by the situation in northern Scotland, UK, where Dutch elm disease became evident only after the arrival of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 1996b ).AssociationsO. novo-ulmi is closely associated with its bark beetle vectors from the genera Scolytus (North America, Europe and western Asia) and Hylurgopinus (in North America only). The bark beetles act not only as vectors, but also provide sites for sporulation of the fungus in their breeding galleries. Scolytus scolytus is the most effective vector carrying up to 350,000 spores ( Webber, 1990 ). About 1000 spores are generally required for effective infection by O. novo-ulmi on an intermediate susceptible host such as Ulmus procera ( Webber, 2000 ). Two smaller species Scolytus multistriatus and S. pygmaeus, are less effective vectors in Europe ( Faccoli and Battisti, 1997 ). Spore load was found to vary between spring-emerging beetles (e.g. 58% beetles infested with spores) and summer-

 susceptible host such as Ulmus procera ( Webber, 2000 ). Two smaller species Scolytus multistriatus and S. pygmaeus, are less effective vectors in Europe ( Faccoli and Battisti, 1997 ). Spore load was found to vary between spring-emerging beetles (e.g. 58% beetles infested with spores) and summer-emerging beetles (e.g. only 8% beetles infested with spores) ( Faccoli and Battisti, 1997 ). This probably relates to climatic conditions in the bark, which may be too dry in summer for extensive sporulation to occur. The relationship between O. novo-ulmi and its vectors can be considered as mutualistic because both profit from their combined attack on the elms. However, the vectors do not rely solely on the fungus for creating breeding sites and, in fact, the high aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi is decimating the number of available hosts for the beetles, especially Scolytus scolytus in Europe, which needs relatively mature trees for successful breeding. Webber and Gibbs (1989) also found that S. scolytus has to feed on phloem tissue that is free of fungal growth for successful development from first- to third-instar larvae, otherwise the larvae are killed.The role of mites in the breeding galleries of bark beetles must not be disregarded. Although they eat a significant part of the fungal biomass, they also play an important role in the dissemination of fungal spores inside the breeding galleries ( Brasier, 1978 ). Fransen (1939) reported that mites drag the spores of the pathogen through the frass in the larval galleries to the pupal chambers, thus forming a carpet of synnemata inside the chamber, which greatly enhances the opportunities for distribution of the spores by the young beetles. Brasier (1984) showed experimentally

Brasier (1984) showed experimentally that the activity of the mites can enhance sexual sporulation of the fungus.

The setose bases of the perithecia range from 75-150 μm wide.  Perithecial necks are long (160-640 μm).  Asci are evanescent.  Ascospores are hyaline, one-celled, and reniform in shape, about 4.5-6.0 μm x 1.5 μm.  Conidia often exude in a sticky droplet perched atop the perithecial neck.  The sexual stage is rarely found in nature.Asexual StagesAsexual spores are of three types.1. Hyaline, single-celled, ovoid conidia that are 2.0-5.0 μm x 1.0-3.0 μm and borne in a white drop atop a black synnema, forming a coremium.2. Conidia measuring 4.0-6.0 μm x 2.0-3.0 μm are borne in clusters on short denticles, directly on the vegetative mycelium.  These conidia are hyaline, single-celled, elongated, pyriform  and often have a convex curve on one side.3.

Crown symptoms range from branch flagging to complete canopy involvement, depending on where the fungus invades the tree.Vascular SymptomsBrown discoloration is usually associated with the current year's growth ring (xylem) in branches and stems.Insect SignsSmaller European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatusMarsham) preferentially feeds in the crotches of small twigs and can cause these twigs to fall.  Brood galleries are formed under the bark, parallel to the grain of the wood.  Larval feeding galleries are horizontal to the grain.  The adult beetle is a shiny, dark reddish-brown color and about 1/8 inch long.  The underside of the posterior portion of the beetle is concave and the beetle has an obvious abdominal spine-like projection that points toward the rear of the insect.  Larvae are small, white, legless grubs that are about the same size as the adult beetle.Native elm bark beetle (Hylurgopinus rufipes(Eichhoff)) differs from smaller European elm bark beetle in its feeding site preferences, breeding gallery orientation and morphology.  Native elm bark beetle feeds on large branches and trunks.  Brood galleries are horizontal to the grain of the wood and larval feeding galleries are parallel to the grain.  Adults of the native elm bark beetle are dull, brownish-black and less than 1/8 inch long.  The native elm bark beetle lacks the concave shape and

Brood galleries are horizontal to the grain of the wood and larval feeding galleries are parallel to the grain.  Adults of the native elm bark beetle are dull, brownish-black and less than 1/8 inch long.  The native elm bark beetle lacks the concave shape and abdominal projection of the smaller European elm bark beetle.Ecology and SpreadDutch Elm Disease CycleOphiostoma ulmiis a vascular wilt pathogen of theUlmaceae, primarily elm species.  Spores of the fungus are vectored by bark beetles in the speciesHylurgopinusandScolytusand also spread from tree to tree via root grafts.  The fungus overwinters in diseased and dead trees, which are favored breeding sites for the bark beetle vectors.  The coremial stage of the fungus often colonizes the brood galleries of the beetles, and the perithecial stage may occasionally be found there as well.  Sticky spore droplets adhere to the adult beetles as they emerge from the tree.  The newly emerged beetle vector feeds on healthy trees, inoculating the xylem in the feeding wounds with spores of the fungus.The most efficient North American vector isScolytus multistriatus(the smaller European elm bark beetle), a non-native species that feeds in twig crotches, so most infections begin in twigs.  In North America's northeastern region the native elm bark beetleHylurgopinus rufipesis the more prevalent vector.  However, because the native elm bark beetle preferentially feeds on large branches and smaller trunks, where bark is thicker, the likelihood of successful inoculation of the xylem is reduced.

 native elm bark beetleHylurgopinus rufipesis the more prevalent vector.  However, because the native elm bark beetle preferentially feeds on large branches and smaller trunks, where bark is thicker, the likelihood of successful inoculation of the xylem is reduced.  The feeding habit of native elm bark beetle makes it a less efficient vector and results in infections that begin in major branches.The yeastlike stage of the fungus moves with the sap throughout the tree via the xylem.  Hyphal growth also helps the fungus spread between vessels.  The fungus usually spreads from the inoculation site to the roots during the first season of infection.  The fungus proliferates in the roots and then is drawn up by the sap flow, leading to a systemic infection that kills the tree within a growing season.  The fungus also can spread from tree-to-tree via root grafts.Geographic DistributionOphiostoma ulmiwas found throughout the range of elm in North America and also was present throughout Europe and Asia as well, but is reportedly rarely found now as it has been displaced by the more aggressive subspecies ofOphiostoma novo-ulmi.Ophiostoma novo-ulmisubsp.americanahas been documented in Canada, and in the United States in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states, the Great Lakes states, Washington and California.  Subspeciesamericanaalso occurs in Europe (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Scandanavia).Ophiostoma novo-ulmisubsp.novo ulmioccurs throughout Europe, as well as southwest and central Asia.ManagementManagement of any pathogen is often dependent upon both cultural and chemical options.

Consult your local extension specialist or agent for recommendations relevant to your particular host and state.SanitationSanitation is the most important part of Dutch elm disease management.  Any cut elm wood, whether from healthy, dying or dead elms should be debarked, buried or burned to discourage colonization by bark beetles and prevent beetle emergence from infested wood.Breaking Root GraftsMature elms that are within 25-50 ft. (9-15 m) of one another likely share grafted roots.  Root grafts should be broken if Dutch elm disease is detected in one of the trees.  Disrupting the graft before removing the infected tree is extremely important because once the trunk of the infected tree is cut, then the infested sap in the roots will be drawn into the adjacent healthy tree via intact grafts.  Grafts can be disrupted mechanically with a 3-5 ft. blade (5 feet is best) or chemically by a professional pesticide applicator.PruningNew branch infections can be eradicated by pruning out the infected branch.  If fungicides are being used in conjunction with pruning, then the fungicide should be injected before the branch is pruned.  Because the infection may be more advanced than the foliar symptoms indicate, care should be taken to peel the bark from infected branches and examine the vascular tissue for staining.  Infected branches should be removed at a branch fork at least 5 ft. (10 ft. is better) below the last visible sign of vascular streaking.  If the branch is pruned during the growing season, then an application of tree paint to the cut surface is recommended to help prevent beetles from being attracted to the wounded tree.

.  Infected branches should be removed at a branch fork at least 5 ft. (10 ft. is better) below the last visible sign of vascular streaking.  If the branch is pruned during the growing season, then an application of tree paint to the cut surface is recommended to help prevent beetles from being attracted to the wounded tree.  For pruning to be the most successful, constant monitoring of the canopy for new symptoms is necessary, followed by immediate excision of the affected branches.FungicidesValuable amenity trees can be preventatively or therapeutically treated with fungicide injections.  Therapeutic treatment is usually not effective if more than 10% of the canopy is visibly symptomatic.  Fungicides are not curative and must be reapplied at label intervals for the life of the tree.Fungicide Table  derived fromHaugen and Stennes, 1999.Active IngredientInjection StyleProsConsThiabendazole hypophosphite(Arbotect 20S)Macroinjection into root flares2-3 years of protection.

Beetle emergence can occur from April through October, making timing of insecticide application very important.  Insecticides should be applied to the bark during the dormant season, before adult beetles emerge in the spring.  Complete coverage of the bark is critical.  Active ingredients labeled for use on elm and targeting native elm bark beetle and smaller European elm bark beetle include bifenthrin, carbaryl, permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin.Resistant or Tolerant TreesPlanting resistant or tolerant elms is a viable way of keeping an elm component in landscapes.

 Invasion: Colonies of O. novo-ulmi are greyish- to cream-white when grown on Oxoid malt extract agar (MEA) at 20°C for 7 days in darkness followed by 10 days in diffuse daylight. The colony form ranges from regular striate petaloid to irregular lobed. The colonies commonly show moderate aerial mycelium, aggregated into ropes to give a fibrous, striate appearance. Occasionally, colonies are observed with less aerial mycelium and frosty to smooth mycelium ('uniform powdery' form, only in subsp. novo-ulmi;Brasier and Kirk, 2001). Diurnal zonation of the colonies is moderate to strong. Growth on MEA at 20°C in the dark ranges from 3.1 to 4.8 mm per day, the growth optimum is around 20-22°C, and the maximum temperature is 32-33°C. This feature is important for distinguishing O. novo-ulmi from O. ulmi.Hyphae are septate, and ca 1-6 µm diameter; the aerial hyphae are often aggregated into strands

 3.1 to 4.8 mm per day, the growth optimum is around 20-22°C, and the maximum temperature is 32-33°C. This feature is important for distinguishing O. novo-ulmi from O. ulmi.Hyphae are septate, and ca 1-6 µm diameter; the aerial hyphae are often aggregated into strands. Mycelial conidia are usually produced abundantly. The sporothrix conidiophores are mostly lateral, ca 10-30 µm long; their conidia are borne on short denticles of 0.5-1 µm. Sporothrix-like conidia are non-septate, hyaline, variably ellipsoid to elongate, often tapering and slightly curved, with a small attachment collar. Conidia are 4.5-14 x 2-3 µm. The mycelial conidia are often aggregated into mucilaginous droplets and bud in a yeast-like fashion. The synnemetal anamorph (Pesotum) is usually absent on malt agar and is only produced on elm wood or on media containing elm wood. Synnemata are single or multiple, brown-black, slender and up to 1-2 mm tall. They are attached to the substratum by brown, rhizoid-like hyphae and are composed of parallel bundles of brown, septate hyphae, flaring at the top to branched hyaline hyphae producing non-septate, hyaline, ovoid to ellipsoid conidia (2-6 x 1-3 µm), which aggregate into a cream-white mucilaginous spore drop. The budding, yeast-like anamorph is produced in liquid cultures, and on the surface of solid media. Ascoma (perithecia) are only formed when isolates of

The budding, yeast-like anamorph is produced in liquid cultures, and on the surface of solid media. Ascoma (perithecia) are only formed when isolates of different mating types (termed A and B) are present and only on media containing elm wood. The ascoma are globose at the base, black, 75-140 µm wide, sparsely to moderately bristly; their necks are black, 230-640 µm long, and carry numerous ostiolar hyphae. Asci are thin-walled, globose to oval, evanescent. Ascospores are hyaline, non-septate, orange-segment shaped, 4.5-6 x 1-1.5 µm and accumulate as a cream-white mucilaginous spore drop (Brasier, 1991).O. novo-ulmi subsp. novo-ulmi differs from O. novo-ulmi subsp. americana as follows: the radial growth rate on Oxoid MEA at 20°C is ca 3.1-4.4 mm/day (3.2-4.8 mm/day in subsp. americana). Colonies on MEA at 20°C are commonly irregularly fibrous striate (regularly fibrous striate in subsp. americana). 'Uniform powdery' ('up-mut') mycelial-mycelial dimorphism is present (not present in subsp. americana). Ascoma have neck lengths of approximately 230-640 µm (only ca 160-420 µm in subsp. americana); the base width is ca 75-160 µm (85-

Ascoma have neck lengths of approximately 230-640 µm (only ca 160-420 µm in subsp. americana); the base width is ca 75-160 µm (85-150 µm in subsp. americana); neck length/base width ratio lies between 1.9 and 7.4 (1.6-4.5 in subsp. americana) (Brasier, 1981;Brasier and Kirk, 2001).Colonies of O. novo-ulmi are prone to degeneration in culture and should be stored at low temperatures, preferentially in liquid nitrogen (Brasier, 1991).

 Habitat: No encontrado
 Reproduccion: GeneticsThere are usually five chromosomes in the haploid genome of O. novo-ulmi. However, Dewar and Bernier (1993) identified an isolate with seven chromosomes. This polymorphism proved stable in pairings with other isolates and did not have any effect on growth and pathogenicity ( Dewar and Bernier, 1995 ; Dewar et al., 1997 ). Polymorphism in chromosome size and number is a characteristic found in other fungal species (e.g. Kistler and Miao, 1992 ). The mitochondrial DNA of O. novo-ulmi is 48-71 kb, compared to 74-88 kb in O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ).Considerable research has been devoted to the molecular characterization of O. novo-ulmi and its differentiation from O. ulmi. Differences between the two species have been found in protein and isoenzyme patterns ( Bernier et al., 1983 ; Jeng and Hubbes, 1983 ; Jeng et al

, compared to 74-88 kb in O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ).Considerable research has been devoted to the molecular characterization of O. novo-ulmi and its differentiation from O. ulmi. Differences between the two species have been found in protein and isoenzyme patterns ( Bernier et al., 1983 ; Jeng and Hubbes, 1983 ; Jeng et al., 1988 ), and in RFLPs of mitochondrial ( Bates et al., 1993b ), nuclear ( Bates et al., 1993a ) and ribosomal DNA ( Hintz et al., 1993 ). RAPDs have also been used to differentiate the two species ( Pipe et al., 1995 ; Hoegger et al., 1996 ). Differences have also been found in the cerato-ulmin gene ( Jeng et al., 1996 ; Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two species are separated most effectively by PCR-RFLP of ribosomal DNA ( Harrington et al., 2001 ). The two subspecies (subsp. novo-ulmi and subsp. americana) of O. novo-ulmi can be separated using a wide range of markers. The mitochondrial DNA is 65-71 kb in subsp. novo-ulmi compared to 48-60 kb in subsp. americana ( Brasier and Kirk, 2001 ). Differences were found in isoenzyme patterns ( Jeng et al., 1988 ), RFLPs of mitochondrial ( Bates et al., 1993b ) and nuclear DNA ( Bates et al., 1993a ), RAPDs, and in the DNA sequence of the cerato-ulmin gene ( Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two subspecies can be further differentiated by PCR-RFLP of their cerato-ulmin and colony type genes ( Konrad et al., 2002 ).

 in the DNA sequence of the cerato-ulmin gene ( Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two subspecies can be further differentiated by PCR-RFLP of their cerato-ulmin and colony type genes ( Konrad et al., 2002 ). Evidence for natural hybridization between the two subspecies in Europe was provided by Jeng et al. (1988) and Konrad et al. (2002) . Both subspecies of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi show different degrees of sexual incompatibility to each other. Both species are heterothallic with the two mating types A and B ( Shafer and Liming, 1950 ; Brasier, 1991 ). While O. novo-ulmi strongly rejects O. ulmi as the male in pairings, O. ulmi unrestrictedly accepts O. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner ( Brasier, 1981 ). In pairings between isolates of the two subspecies, subsp. novo-ulmi partially rejects subsp. americana as the male (ca 90% less fertile perithecia than in novo-ulmi x novo-ulmi matings), whereas in pairings with subsp. americana as the female and subsp. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner, full mating can be observed ( Brasier, 1979 ). These mating barriers strongly support both the species status of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi as well as the designation of the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi. Hybrids between O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi also show a marked loss in fitness and are transient in natural populations ( Brasier et al., 1998 ), but may act as a 'genetic bridge' in the transfer of genes between the two species.Mycoviruses, termed d-factors ( Brasier, 1983 ) occur naturally in the cytop

. Hybrids between O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi also show a marked loss in fitness and are transient in natural populations ( Brasier et al., 1998 ), but may act as a 'genetic bridge' in the transfer of genes between the two species.Mycoviruses, termed d-factors ( Brasier, 1983 ) occur naturally in the cytoplasm of the Dutch elm disease fungi. They spread by hyphal fusion between compatible mycelia and cause detrimental effects on affected isolates, resulting in reduced spore production and loss of virulence ( Brasier, 1984 ). The spread of d-factors within a population is hindered by the production of ascospores, which are free of virus particles, and by vegetative incompatibility (vic) between fungal strains. Hence, diversity in both mating type (allows sexual sporulation) and vic genes (creates incompatibility between mycelia) is an important fitness trait in populations of O. novo-ulmi. Recent evidence suggests that interspecific hybridization events have played a major role in the evolution of Dutch elm disease fungi. O. ulmi introgressants into O. novo-ulmi have been identified in different parts of the O. novo-ulmi population ( Brasier, 2001 ). There is evidence that a pathogenicity gene from O. ulmi introgressed into a hypovirulent isolate of O. novo-ulmi ( Et-Touil et al., 1999 ). The acquisition of a mating type gene of O. ulmi by O. novo-ulmi has been shown and vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes of O. ulmi have also been found in isolates of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 2001 ). These hybridization events and their effect on the vic system of O. novo-ulmi may be, at least partially, responsible

 type gene of O. ulmi by O. novo-ulmi has been shown and vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes of O. ulmi have also been found in isolates of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 2001 ). These hybridization events and their effect on the vic system of O. novo-ulmi may be, at least partially, responsible for the persistent high fitness of the pathogen population ( Brasier, 2000a ). The hybridization occuring between the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi in central and other parts of Europe contributes to the ongoing evolution of the Dutch elm disease fungi ( Brasier, 2001 ; Konrad et al., 2002 ).Physiology and PhenologyO. novo-ulmi is the causal agent of the current Dutch elm disease pandemics in North America, Europe and western and central Asia. It exhibits a much higher degree of virulence than O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ). Phytotoxic compounds have been assumed to be responsible for the high level of virulence in O. novo-ulmi. In particular, the role of the hydrophobin cerato-ulmin (CU) in the pathogenesis of DED has been the subject of extensive investigation because it was reported as a wilt toxin ( Takai, 1974 ). CU production is one of the distinguishing features between O. ulmi and novo-ulmi, as O. novo-ulmi (in contrast to O. ulmi) produces moderate to high amounts of CU in liquid culture ( Scheffer et al., 1987 ). Takai (1980) showed a correlation between high CU production and high virulence. The injection of purified CU into elms caused wilting, a reduction in transpiration, an increase in leaf respiration and electrolyte loss ( Takai, 1974 ). Symptoms were the same as those observed in elms infected with the fungus ( Tak

 of CU in liquid culture ( Scheffer et al., 1987 ). Takai (1980) showed a correlation between high CU production and high virulence. The injection of purified CU into elms caused wilting, a reduction in transpiration, an increase in leaf respiration and electrolyte loss ( Takai, 1974 ). Symptoms were the same as those observed in elms infected with the fungus ( Takai and Hiratsuka, 1984 ). The higher aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi compared to O. ulmi was thus attributed to a higher expression of the protein in the aggressive species caused by differences in the promoter sequence of the CU gene and the derived amino-acid sequence ( Jeng et al., 1996 ). Further evidence suggested that the role of CU should be re-evaluated because a non-CU-producing natural mutant of O. novo-ulmi (Brasier et al., 1995) and mutants induced in the laboratory ( Bowden et al., 1996 ) retained high virulence. CU was therefore proposed to be a parasitic fitness factor, with its main function to protect against desiccation, thereby helping spores to survive during unfavourable conditions such as dispersal ( Temple et al., 1997 ; Temple and Horgen, 2000 ). However, when non-pathogenic O. quercus was transformed with the CU gene from O. novo-ulmi it was able to cause symptoms of DED on elm (Del Sorbo et al., 2000). This emphasises the need for further investigation of the aetiology of Dutch elm disease.By analysing European populations of O. novo-ulmi, Brasier (1988) showed that populations can rapidly change their genetic structure after establishment at a new disease location.

 disease.By analysing European populations of O. novo-ulmi, Brasier (1988) showed that populations can rapidly change their genetic structure after establishment at a new disease location. The initially clonal population commonly consists only of isolates of mating type B with one, or a few, vegetative incompatibility (vic) types predominating. The predominance of mating type B in all populations of O. novo-ulmi has been ascribed to the slightly higher virulence of B type isolates ( Brasier, 1991 ). However, the population soon becomes highly diverse in terms of vic and mating types. High selection pressure for sexual reproduction, which creates vic diversity in the population within a short period of time through the spread of mycoviruses in the clonal population, is believed to be the cause of this phenomenon ( Brasier, 1996a ). However, differences in the structure of European and North American populations of O. novo-ulmi have been reported. Although European populations generally show a high diversification of vic types at post-epidemic sites, only three vic types made up 88% of the isolates in a study in the USA ( Brasier, 1996a ). A low incidence of mycovirus infection in North America is believed to be the cause of this difference ( Brasier and Kirk, 2000 ).Reproductive BiologyThe life cycle of O. novo-ulmi is one of the best studied in plant pathology and often is used as a textbook example of insect-pathogen interactions. Two stages are distinct in the life cycle: the parasitic phase involving host colonization, overcoming host resistance, and growth inside the host tissue; and the saprophytic phase inside the bark involving sporulation of the fungus in the breeding galleries of its bark beetle (Scolytus and Hylurgopinus) vectors.

As O. novo-ulmi is fully reliant on dissemination by bark beetles, its lifestyle is perfectly adapted to its vectors.When the young bark beetles emerge in spring from their pupation chambers in the bark of an elm tree they already carry the fungus. The fungus has spread and sporulated inside the breeding gallery of the beetles during the winter and spring. The young beetle is often surrounded in its pupal chamber by synnemata of the fungus and has ample opportunity to catch a high number of spores ( Webber, 1990 ). After pupation, the young beetles fly to the twigs of healthy elms for maturation feeding. They feed on the phloem and also the xylem tissue on branches, in twig crotches or leaf axils. The fungus is inoculated into the elm tree by the beetle during this essential phase. After the establishment of infection, the fungus spreads throughout the xylem vessels of the elm tree in its yeast-like stage and causes a vascular wilt (Sinclair and Campana, 1978). To complete the disease cycle, the pathogen must again come into contact with its vectors. The scolytid beetles must breed in the bark of the dying elms in order for this to occur. As the galleries of the bark beetles superficially penetrate the xylem, the fungus is 'released' from the vascular system of the elm and starts growing into the phloem (bark) of the elm.

Other O. novo-ulmi genotypes are introduced into the bark with the beetles ( Webber, 2000 ). The combined process of beetle and pathogen colonization of elm bark is known as the saprophytic phase ( Webber et al., 1987 ). During this phase a marked sequence in sporulation can be seen in the breeding galleries of the bark beetles. The production of fruiting structures appears to follow a predetermined, ontogenetic sequence which starts with the mycelial sporothrix stage, is followed by the formation of synnemata (Pesotum), and ends with the production of perithecia ( Webber et al., 1987 ). Sexual sporulation is important for the fungus to maintain the fitness of the population by the creation of new genotypes. The saprophytic phase is therefore one of the most crucial periods in the life cycle of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 1984 ). In the case of an overwintering brood, the formation of perithecia coincides with the fall in temperature; perithecia might thus act as an overwintering stage ( Lea and Brasier, 1983 ). When the young beetles, which by now carry the fungus, emerge from the breeding systems they fly to the branches of healthy elm trees for feeding. After successful inoculation of the fungus into the elm the disease cycle is complete.Environmental RequirementsO. novo-ulmi inhabits the xylem and bark of elm trees, particularly in and around the breeding galleries of scolytid beetles.

Climatic conditions in the breeding galleries of the bark beetles are important for the growth of O. novo-ulmi inside the bark and its subsequent sporulation (saprophytic phase). Microclimatic conditions are best for the fungus in relatively thick parts of the bark, where the moisture content is highest and relatively constant. Prolonged exposure to high summer temperatures and the combined action of a lower initial moisture content and lack of nutrients in the outer bark usually inhibits sporulation of O. novo-ulmi in stems and branches of smaller diameter ( Webber, 1990 ). The preferred breeding site of a bark beetle therefore largely determines its success as a vector of Dutch elm disease ( Webber, 2000 ).As the optimum growth temperature for O. novo-ulmi is around 22°C ( Brasier, 1981 ), the pathogen is able to move further to the north than O. ulmi, which has an optimum growth temperature of ca 28°C. This is exemplified by the situation in northern Scotland, UK, where Dutch elm disease became evident only after the arrival of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 1996b ).AssociationsO. novo-ulmi is closely associated with its bark beetle vectors from the genera Scolytus (North America, Europe and western Asia) and Hylurgopinus (in North America only). The bark beetles act not only as vectors, but also provide sites for sporulation of the fungus in their breeding galleries. Scolytus scolytus is the most effective vector carrying up to 350,000 spores ( Webber, 1990 ).

Scolytus scolytus is the most effective vector carrying up to 350,000 spores ( Webber, 1990 ). About 1000 spores are generally required for effective infection by O. novo-ulmi on an intermediate susceptible host such as Ulmus procera ( Webber, 2000 ). Two smaller species Scolytus multistriatus and S. pygmaeus, are less effective vectors in Europe ( Faccoli and Battisti, 1997 ). Spore load was found to vary between spring-emerging beetles (e.g. 58% beetles infested with spores) and summer-emerging beetles (e.g. only 8% beetles infested with spores) ( Faccoli and Battisti, 1997 ). This probably relates to climatic conditions in the bark, which may be too dry in summer for extensive sporulation to occur. The relationship between O. novo-ulmi and its vectors can be considered as mutualistic because both profit from their combined attack on the elms. However, the vectors do not rely solely on the fungus for creating breeding sites and, in fact, the high aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi is decimating the number of available hosts for the beetles, especially Scolytus scolytus in Europe, which needs relatively mature trees for successful breeding. Webber and Gibbs (1989) also found that S. scolytus has to feed on phloem tissue that is free of fungal growth for successful development from first- to third-instar larvae, otherwise the larvae are killed.The role of mites in the breeding galleries of bark beetles must not be disregarded.

Although they eat a significant part of the fungal biomass, they also play an important role in the dissemination of fungal spores inside the breeding galleries ( Brasier, 1978 ). Fransen (1939) reported that mites drag the spores of the pathogen through the frass in the larval galleries to the pupal chambers, thus forming a carpet of synnemata inside the chamber, which greatly enhances the opportunities for distribution of the spores by the young beetles. Brasier (1984) showed experimentally that the activity of the mites can enhance sexual sporulation of the fungus.
 Sintomas: The symptoms of infection by O. novo-ulmi are that of a typical vascular wilt disease. The first external symptoms on an elm tree are discoloration or drooping of the leaves at the tip of a branch. Subsequently, the leaves yellow, curl, turn brown, and finally fall off the tree soon after they have died. Alternatively, leaves can dry out rapidly, turn a dull green before dying, and remain attached to the twigs for several weeks. The shoot tip may wither and droop. A branch carrying only a few wilted leaves at the tip is called a 'flag'. Small flags develop when Scolytus bark beetles feed on the twig crotches of elms. Hylurgopinus rufipes causes the formation of large elm flags, because it feeds on the branches. This is important in control programmes as the small flags caused by the Scolytus feeding are easily missed during surveys (Sinclair and Campana, 1978). Characteristic diagnostic symptoms for DED are commonly seen in the xylem of

ig crotches of elms. Hylurgopinus rufipes causes the formation of large elm flags, because it feeds on the branches. This is important in control programmes as the small flags caused by the Scolytus feeding are easily missed during surveys (Sinclair and Campana, 1978). Characteristic diagnostic symptoms for DED are commonly seen in the xylem of affected twigs and branches. Browning of the water-conducting vessels of the whole outer growth ring can be seen on cross-section, also brown streaking in the direction of the grain on the twig, after removal of the bark. However, symptoms may vary and trees with extensive wilting may not show any discoloration and vice versa (Sutherland et al., 1997). The discoloration is caused by tylosis formation by the elm as a reaction to the fungal infection ( Duchesne, 1993 ). Symptoms usually start to appear between July and autumn leaf fall. When the infection is mediated by bark beetles, symptoms start at single branches, which die back starting from the top. If the disease reaches the stem the whole tree may die in the same year (especially smaller trees) or the year after the infection. O. novo-ulmi is a far more virulent pathogen than O. ulmi and can move from the branches towards the stem in only a few weeks ( Scala et al., 1997 ). Infections via root grafts usually kill a tree faster than infections caused by vectors as the propagules are rapidly distributed throughout the tree with the sapstream (Stipes and Campana, 1981). Recovery of infected elms is rarely seen with O. novo-ulmi infection ( Brasier, 1991 ). If the infection occurs during late summer and autumn, leaves will often only change colour prematurely and have normal budset; however, the branch will be dead in the next spring and the disease will have spread further into the tree.

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology GeneticsThere are usually five chromosomes in the haploid genome of O. novo-ulmi. However, Dewar and Bernier (1993) identified an isolate with seven chromosomes. This polymorphism proved stable in pairings with other isolates and did not have any effect on growth and pathogenicity ( Dewar and Bernier, 1995 ; Dewar et al., 1997 ). Polymorphism in chromosome size and number is a characteristic found in other fungal species (e.g. Kistler and Miao, 1992 ). The mitochondrial DNA of O. novo-ulmi is 48-71 kb, compared to 74-88 kb in O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ).Considerable research has been devoted to the molecular characterization of O. novo-ulmi and its differentiation from O. ulmi. Differences between the two species have been found in protein and isoenzyme patterns ( Bernier et al., 1983 ; Jeng and Hubbes, 1983 ; Jeng et al., 1988 ), and in RFLPs of mitochondrial ( Bates et al., 1993b ), nuclear ( Bates et al., 1993a ) and ribosomal DNA ( Hintz et al., 1993 ). RAPDs have also been used to differentiate the two species ( Pipe et al., 1995 ; Hoegger et al., 1996 ). Differences have also been found in the cerato-ul

RAPDs have also been used to differentiate the two species ( Pipe et al., 1995 ; Hoegger et al., 1996 ). Differences have also been found in the cerato-ulmin gene ( Jeng et al., 1996 ; Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two species are separated most effectively by PCR-RFLP of ribosomal DNA ( Harrington et al., 2001 ). The two subspecies (subsp. novo-ulmi and subsp. americana) of O. novo-ulmi can be separated using a wide range of markers. The mitochondrial DNA is 65-71 kb in subsp. novo-ulmi compared to 48-60 kb in subsp. americana ( Brasier and Kirk, 2001 ). Differences were found in isoenzyme patterns ( Jeng et al., 1988 ), RFLPs of mitochondrial ( Bates et al., 1993b ) and nuclear DNA ( Bates et al., 1993a ), RAPDs, and in the DNA sequence of the cerato-ulmin gene ( Pipe et al., 1997 ). The two subspecies can be further differentiated by PCR-RFLP of their cerato-ulmin and colony type genes ( Konrad et al., 2002 ). Evidence for natural hybridization between the two subspecies in Europe was provided by Jeng et al. (1988) and Konrad et al. (2002) . Both subspecies of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi show different degrees of sexual incompatibility to each other. Both species are heterothallic with the two mating types A and B ( Shafer and Liming, 1950 ; Brasier, 1991 ). While O. novo-ulmi strongly rejects O. ulmi as the male in pair

Both species are heterothallic with the two mating types A and B ( Shafer and Liming, 1950 ; Brasier, 1991 ). While O. novo-ulmi strongly rejects O. ulmi as the male in pairings, O. ulmi unrestrictedly accepts O. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner ( Brasier, 1981 ). In pairings between isolates of the two subspecies, subsp. novo-ulmi partially rejects subsp. americana as the male (ca 90% less fertile perithecia than in novo-ulmi x novo-ulmi matings), whereas in pairings with subsp. americana as the female and subsp. novo-ulmi as the male mating partner, full mating can be observed ( Brasier, 1979 ). These mating barriers strongly support both the species status of O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi as well as the designation of the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi. Hybrids between O. novo-ulmi and O. ulmi also show a marked loss in fitness and are transient in natural populations ( Brasier et al., 1998 ), but may act as a 'genetic bridge' in the transfer of genes between the two species.Mycoviruses, termed d-factors ( Brasier, 1983 ) occur naturally in the cytoplasm of the Dutch elm disease fungi. They spread by hyphal fusion between compatible mycelia and cause detrimental effects on affected isolates, resulting in reduced spore production and loss of virulence ( Brasier, 1984 ). The spread of d-factors within a population is hindered by the production of ascospores, which are free of virus particles, and by vegetative incomp

toplasm of the Dutch elm disease fungi. They spread by hyphal fusion between compatible mycelia and cause detrimental effects on affected isolates, resulting in reduced spore production and loss of virulence ( Brasier, 1984 ). The spread of d-factors within a population is hindered by the production of ascospores, which are free of virus particles, and by vegetative incompatibility (vic) between fungal strains. Hence, diversity in both mating type (allows sexual sporulation) and vic genes (creates incompatibility between mycelia) is an important fitness trait in populations of O. novo-ulmi. Recent evidence suggests that interspecific hybridization events have played a major role in the evolution of Dutch elm disease fungi. O. ulmi introgressants into O. novo-ulmi have been identified in different parts of the O. novo-ulmi population ( Brasier, 2001 ). There is evidence that a pathogenicity gene from O. ulmi introgressed into a hypovirulent isolate of O. novo-ulmi ( Et-Touil et al., 1999 ). The acquisition of a mating type gene of O. ulmi by O. novo-ulmi has been shown and vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes of O. ulmi have also been found in isolates of O. novo-ulmi ( Brasier, 2001 ). These hybridization events and their effect on the vic system of O. novo-ulmi may be, at least partially, responsible for the persistent high fitness of the pathogen population ( Brasier, 2000a ). The hybridization occuring between the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi in central and other parts of Europe contributes to the ongoing evolution of the Dutch elm disease fungi ( Brasier, 2001 ; Konrad et al., 2002 ).Physiology and PhenologyO. novo-ulmi

The hybridization occuring between the two subspecies of O. novo-ulmi in central and other parts of Europe contributes to the ongoing evolution of the Dutch elm disease fungi ( Brasier, 2001 ; Konrad et al., 2002 ).Physiology and PhenologyO. novo-ulmi is the causal agent of the current Dutch elm disease pandemics in North America, Europe and western and central Asia. It exhibits a much higher degree of virulence than O. ulmi ( Brasier, 1991 ). Phytotoxic compounds have been assumed to be responsible for the high level of virulence in O. novo-ulmi. In particular, the role of the hydrophobin cerato-ulmin (CU) in the pathogenesis of DED has been the subject of extensive investigation because it was reported as a wilt toxin ( Takai, 1974 ). CU production is one of the distinguishing features between O. ulmi and novo-ulmi, as O. novo-ulmi (in contrast to O. ulmi) produces moderate to high amounts of CU in liquid culture ( Scheffer et al., 1987 ). Takai (1980) showed a correlation between high CU production and high virulence. The injection of purified CU into elms caused wilting, a reduction in transpiration, an increase in leaf respiration and electrolyte loss ( Takai, 1974 ). Symptoms were the same as those observed in elms infected with the fungus ( Takai and Hiratsuka, 1984 ). The higher aggressiveness of O. novo-ulmi compared to O. ulmi was thus attributed to a higher expression of the protein in the aggressive species caused by differences in the promoter sequence of the CU gene and the derived amino-acid sequence ( Jeng et al., 1996 ).

Webber and Gibbs (1989) also found that S. scolytus has to feed on phloem tissue that is free of fungal growth for successful development from first- to third-instar larvae, otherwise the larvae are killed.The role of mites in the breeding galleries of bark beetles must not be disregarded. Although they eat a significant part of the fungal biomass, they also play an important role in the dissemination of fungal spores inside the breeding galleries ( Brasier, 1978 ). Fransen (1939) reported that mites drag the spores of the pathogen through the frass in the larval galleries to the pupal chambers, thus forming a carpet of synnemata inside the chamber, which greatly enhances the opportunities for distribution of the spores by the young beetles. Brasier (1984) showed experimentally

The setose bases of the perithecia range from 75-150 μm wide.  Perithecial necks are long (160-640 μm).  Asci are evanescent.  Ascospores are hyaline, one-celled, and reniform in shape, about 4.5-6.0 μm x 1.5 μm.  Conidia often exude in a sticky droplet perched atop the perithecial neck.  The sexual stage is rarely found in nature.Asexual StagesAsexual spores are of three types.1. Hyaline, single-celled, ovoid conidia that are 2.0-5.0 μm x 1.0-3.0 μm and borne in a white drop atop a black synnema, forming a coremium.2. Conidia measuring 4.0-6.0 μm x 2.0-3.0 μm are borne in clusters on short denticles, directly on the vegetative mycelium.  These conidia are hyaline, single-celled, elongated, pyriform  and often have a convex curve on one side.3.

, pyriform  and often have a convex curve on one side.3. The fungus also produces yeastlike single-celled, hyaline spores of variable size that form by budding.Symptoms and SignsOphiostoma ulmicauses symptoms typical of vascular wilt.Foliar SymptomsWilting of green leaves progresses to yellowing and browning, and leaf abscission is common.  Crown symptoms range from branch flagging to complete canopy involvement, depending on where the fungus invades the tree.Vascular SymptomsBrown discoloration is usually associated with the current year's growth ring (xylem) in branches and stems.Insect SignsSmaller European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatusMarsham) preferentially feeds in the crotches of small twigs and can cause these twigs to fall.  Brood galleries are formed under the bark, parallel to the grain of the wood.  Larval feeding galleries are horizontal to the grain.  The adult beetle is a shiny, dark reddish-brown color and about 1/8 inch long.  The underside of the posterior portion of the beetle is concave and the beetle has an obvious abdominal spine-like projection that points toward the rear of the insect.  Larvae are small, white, legless grubs that are about the same size as the adult beetle.Native elm bark beetle (Hylurgopinus rufipes(Eichhoff)) differs from smaller European elm bark beetle in its feeding site preferences, breeding gallery orientation and morphology.  Native elm bark beetle feeds on large branches and trunks.  Brood galleries are horizontal to the grain of the wood and larval feeding galleries are parallel to the grain.  Adults of the native elm bark beetle are dull, brownish-black and less than 1/8 inch long.  The native elm bark beetle lacks the concave shape and

 gallery orientation and morphology.  Native elm bark beetle feeds on large branches and trunks.  Brood galleries are horizontal to the grain of the wood and larval feeding galleries are parallel to the grain.  Adults of the native elm bark beetle are dull, brownish-black and less than 1/8 inch long.  The native elm bark beetle lacks the concave shape and abdominal projection of the smaller European elm bark beetle.Ecology and SpreadDutch Elm Disease CycleOphiostoma ulmiis a vascular wilt pathogen of theUlmaceae, primarily elm species.  Spores of the fungus are vectored by bark beetles in the speciesHylurgopinusandScolytusand also spread from tree to tree via root grafts.  The fungus overwinters in diseased and dead trees, which are favored breeding sites for the bark beetle vectors.  The coremial stage of the fungus often colonizes the brood galleries of the beetles, and the perithecial stage may occasionally be found there as well.  Sticky spore droplets adhere to the adult beetles as they emerge from the tree.  The newly emerged beetle vector feeds on healthy trees, inoculating the xylem in the feeding wounds with spores of the fungus.The most efficient North American vector isScolytus multistriatus(the smaller European elm bark beetle), a non-native species that feeds in twig crotches, so most infections begin in twigs.  In North America's northeastern region the native elm bark beetleHylurgopinus rufipesis the more prevalent vector.  However, because the native elm bark beetle preferentially feeds on large branches and smaller trunks, where bark is thicker, the likelihood of successful inoculation of the xylem is reduced.  The feeding habit of native elm bark beetle makes it a less efficient vector and results in infections

 native elm bark beetleHylurgopinus rufipesis the more prevalent vector.  However, because the native elm bark beetle preferentially feeds on large branches and smaller trunks, where bark is thicker, the likelihood of successful inoculation of the xylem is reduced.  The feeding habit of native elm bark beetle makes it a less efficient vector and results in infections that begin in major branches.The yeastlike stage of the fungus moves with the sap throughout the tree via the xylem.  Hyphal growth also helps the fungus spread between vessels.  The fungus usually spreads from the inoculation site to the roots during the first season of infection.  The fungus proliferates in the roots and then is drawn up by the sap flow, leading to a systemic infection that kills the tree within a growing season.  The fungus also can spread from tree-to-tree via root grafts.Geographic DistributionOphiostoma ulmiwas found throughout the range of elm in North America and also was present throughout Europe and Asia as well, but is reportedly rarely found now as it has been displaced by the more aggressive subspecies ofOphiostoma novo-ulmi.Ophiostoma novo-ulmisubsp.americanahas been documented in Canada, and in the United States in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states, the Great Lakes states, Washington and California.  Subspeciesamericanaalso occurs in Europe (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Scandanavia).Ophiostoma novo-ulmisubsp.novo ulmioccurs throughout Europe, as well as southwest and central Asia.ManagementManagement of any pathogen is often dependent upon both cultural and chemical options.

ulmisubsp.novo ulmioccurs throughout Europe, as well as southwest and central Asia.ManagementManagement of any pathogen is often dependent upon both cultural and chemical options.  Consult your local extension specialist or agent for recommendations relevant to your particular host and state.SanitationSanitation is the most important part of Dutch elm disease management.  Any cut elm wood, whether from healthy, dying or dead elms should be debarked, buried or burned to discourage colonization by bark beetles and prevent beetle emergence from infested wood.Breaking Root GraftsMature elms that are within 25-50 ft. (9-15 m) of one another likely share grafted roots.  Root grafts should be broken if Dutch elm disease is detected in one of the trees.  Disrupting the graft before removing the infected tree is extremely important because once the trunk of the infected tree is cut, then the infested sap in the roots will be drawn into the adjacent healthy tree via intact grafts.  Grafts can be disrupted mechanically with a 3-5 ft. blade (5 feet is best) or chemically by a professional pesticide applicator.PruningNew branch infections can be eradicated by pruning out the infected branch.  If fungicides are being used in conjunction with pruning, then the fungicide should be injected before the branch is pruned.  Because the infection may be more advanced than the foliar symptoms indicate, care should be taken to peel the bark from infected branches and examine the vascular tissue for staining.  Infected branches should be removed at a branch fork at least 5 ft. (10 ft. is better) below the last visible sign of vascular streaking.  If the branch is pruned during the growing season, then an application of tree paint to the cut surface is recommended to help prevent beetles from being attracted to the wounded tree.  For pruning to be the most successful,

.  Infected branches should be removed at a branch fork at least 5 ft. (10 ft. is better) below the last visible sign of vascular streaking.  If the branch is pruned during the growing season, then an application of tree paint to the cut surface is recommended to help prevent beetles from being attracted to the wounded tree.  For pruning to be the most successful, constant monitoring of the canopy for new symptoms is necessary, followed by immediate excision of the affected branches.FungicidesValuable amenity trees can be preventatively or therapeutically treated with fungicide injections.  Therapeutic treatment is usually not effective if more than 10% of the canopy is visibly symptomatic.  Fungicides are not curative and must be reapplied at label intervals for the life of the tree.Fungicide Table  derived fromHaugen and Stennes, 1999.Active IngredientInjection StyleProsConsThiabendazole hypophosphite(Arbotect 20S)Macroinjection into root flares2-3 years of protection.

Severe vascular tissue damage and discoloration at the injection site.Remember: the label is the law.InsecticidesInsecticides are a rarely utilized component of Dutch elm disease management. Beetle emergence can occur from April through October, making timing of insecticide application very important.  Insecticides should be applied to the bark during the dormant season, before adult beetles emerge in the spring.  Complete coverage of the bark is critical.  Active ingredients labeled for use on elm and targeting native elm bark beetle and smaller European elm bark beetle include bifenthrin, carbaryl, permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin.Resistant or Tolerant TreesPlanting resistant or tolerant elms is a viable way of keeping an elm component in landscapes.

The perithecial and coremial stages of the fungus may be observed fruiting in beetle galleries of infected trees.  Coremia production can be induced in the laboratory by incubating discolored vascular tissue in a moist chamber at room temperature.  The perithecial stage is rarely observed.The fungus can be isolated from twigs with discolored xylem by surface sterilizing the twig, removing the bark, and placing excised pieces of discolored xylem onto solid culture medium.O. ulmigrows on a wide variety of synthetic agars and agars containing plant extracts.

Shake during pouring to maintain dispersal of sapwood.A selective medium for isolation and storage:
Brasier recommends dissolving 0.2 g. of cylcoheximide in 100 ml of distilled water, then adding 50 ml of the cycloheximide solution to 1 L of malt agar and autoclaving 15 minutes.  Cool the medium to about 45°C, add streptomycin alone or in combination with penicillin to make the final antibiotic concentration 0.1% 0f the liquid medium.Resources and ReferencesBiggerstaff, C., Iles, J.K., and Gleason, M.L.  1999.Sustainable urban landscapes: Dutch elm disease and disease-resistant elms.Iowa State University Extension.Brasier, C.M.  1981.
