THE HARM IT CAUSES
This pest is one of the most damaging snails in the 
world because it can consume at least 500 diﬀ  erent 
types of plants.  It poses a serious health risk to 
humans since it can carry a parasite that can cause 
meningitis.  The snails also damage buildings by 
eating plaster, stucco, and other calcium-rich 
materials needed to grow their shells.  They have no 
natural enemies and reproduce rapidly, with each 
mated snail laying about 1,200 eggs each year.
