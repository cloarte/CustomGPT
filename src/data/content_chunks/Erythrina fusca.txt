Uses
Occasionally planted as a hedge and as a support for the betel vine in Assam
and Bengal.  Young leaves are eaten, raw or boiled, as a vegetable in Java.  In
Puerto Rico, trees have been planted in pastures and along fences and roads as
ornamental shade trees.  Elsewhere, they are used for cacao and coffee shade
and living fence posts.  Heartwood is light yellow to yellowish-brown and
moderately soft.  The lightweight wood is weak, not durable, and scarcely
suitable for lumber.
Folk Medicine
According to Hartwell (1967–1971) seeds are used in folk remedies for cancer in
Annam.  Reported to have the same medicinal attributes as
Erythrina indica,
whose bark is used for fever, hepatosis, malaria, rheumatism, toothache,
also for boils and fractures.  Perry (1980) cites many more uses for
Erythrina indica
.  The bark is used for poulticing fresh wounds in
Malasia.  Boiled roots are taken internally or externally for beri-beri.
Grated wood used for hematuria (Perry, 1980).  The root is used for rheumatism.

erysopine, erysothiopine, eryso- thiovine, crysovine, erythraline, erythramine,

The similarity in alkaloid and amino acid patterns in
E. fusca

E.

were considered by Krukoff (1972) in rendering these species
synonymous.
Description
Deciduous armed tree, 10–20 m tall; to 1 m dbh; outer bark grayish, coarse,
branches glabrous, sparsely armed with short prickles.  Leaves trifoliolate;
stipules caducous; petioles 8–18 cm long; rachis 4–8 cm long; petiole and
rachis with 2 apical glands; leaflets ±ovate, ±rounded or
acute at apex, glabrous above, with white appressed trichomes below; terminal
leaflet 8–14 cm long, 7–12 cm wide; lateral leaflets smaller.  Flowers thick,
mostly 3 per node, in large, terminal, somewhat pendent racemes; pedicels
stout, turned away from apex, ca 2 cm long; flowers showy, pale orange; stamens
diadelphous, green, gradually arched, about halfway exserted.  Legumes 15–20 cm
long, 2 cm wide, densely brown-tomentose, pointed at apex, weakly ribbed on
margins; seeds several, ellipsoid

diadelphous, green, gradually arched, about halfway exserted.  Legumes 15–20 cm
long, 2 cm wide, densely brown-tomentose, pointed at apex, weakly ribbed on
margins; seeds several, ellipsoid, dark brown, ca 12 mm long (Croat, 1978).
Germplasm
Reported from the Indochina-Indonesian and Central American Centers of
Diversity (Croat, 1978), bois immortelle, or cvs thereof, is reported to
tolerate waterlogging.  Apparently it will not tolerate shade.  (2
n
= 42)
Distribution
Mascarene Islands, from Northeastern India to Java, Polynesia and Sri Lanka.
Near sea coasts, along rivers, and in places where soil conditions exclude the
true "high evergreen forest" (Burkill, 1966).  According to Croat, the species
(as
E. fusca
) is widespread in the Old World tropics, while in the
Americas (as
E. glauca
), it ranges from Guatemala throughout the Amazon
Basin.  In Panama, it is known only from Tropical Moist Forest, often forming
pure stands in freshwater marshes, in the Canal Zone, Bocas del Toro, Cocle,
Darien, and Panama (Croat, 1978).  This is the most widespread species in the
genus, and the only one occurring (on three continents, undoubtedly dispersed
by marine currents (Krukoff, 1972).

ien, and Panama (Croat, 1978).  This is the most widespread species in the
genus, and the only one occurring (on three continents, undoubtedly dispersed
by marine currents (Krukoff, 1972).
Ecology
Estimated to range from Tropical Dry to Wet through Subtropical Dry to Wet
Forest Life Zones, this coral bean is estimated to tolerate annual
precipitation of 10 to 40 dm, annual temperature of 20 to 28°C, and pH of 6
to 8.  According to Krukoff (1972) the species thrives in variety of
conditions, seeming to prefer lowlands (seashores, swamps with outlets, low
overflow lands, river banks, shores of lakes, etc.).
Cultivation
According to Martin and Ruberte (1975), this is one of the easiest species of
Erythrina
to grow.  Like most
Erythrinas,
this probably roots
readily from large fence-post sized cuttings.  Seeds germinate rather rapidly.
Harvesting
For those risking them as vegetables, the young buds and leaves are probably at
their tenderest when leafing out, often in tandem with the commencement of the
rainy season.
Yields and Economics
No data available.
Energy
With no hard data available to me, I have no reason to suspect that this
species would be any less productive than
E. poeppigiana,
which probably
returns ca 25 MT/ha/yr in monoculture, 10 MT/ha in intercropping scenarios.
Nitrogen fixing nodules are reported in Hawaii (Allen and Allen, 1981).
