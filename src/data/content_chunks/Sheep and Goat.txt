will be conducted while the animals are in quarantine. Various other tests or treatments may 
be required when the Deputy Administrator, VS, determines that such tests or treatments are

released to the importer. 
8. ANIMALS REFUSED ENTRY: 
 
Any animal refused entry into the United States for non-compliance with the requirements of this 
protocol must be removed from the United States within a time period specified by the 
Administrator, or will be considered abandoned by the importer. Pending removal or abandonment, 
the animal will be subject to such safeguards as the APHIS inspector determines necessary to 
prevent the possible introduction of ectoparasites or disease into the United States. If an animal that 
has been refused entry is not removed from the United States within a prescribed time period or is 
abandoned, it may be seized and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of as the Administrator determines 
necessary to prevent the possible introduction of ectoparasites or disease into the United States.
