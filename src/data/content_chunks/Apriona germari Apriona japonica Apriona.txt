47 th Meeting of the Panel on Phytosanitary Measures Paris, 2013-03-05/07 The Panel met in Paris in the EPPO headquarters on 2013-03-05/07. The main task of this Panel is to evaluate risks presented by specific pests and design phytosanitary measures to avoid their introduction and spread. EPPO lists of pests recommended for regulation On a case by case basis, the Panel reviewed in detail PRAs prepared by the Expert Working Groups for PRA and performed pest risk management when necessary, and it also reviewed national PRAs. The Panel recommended to the Working Party the addition to the A1 List of Apriona germari, Apriona japonica, Apriona cinerea and Oemona hirta; and the addition to the A2 List of Thaumatotibia leucotreta, Phytophthora kernoviae and Phytophthora ramorum. The Panel reconsidered the pest risk management guidance given previously for Agrilus planipennis to be consistent with the recent recommendation on Agrilus anxius . The Panel reviewed the present situation of A1 pests and considered that no pests should be transferred from the A1 to the A2 List although the situation of Anoplophora glabripennis should be reviewed next year. Alert List The Panel reviewed the EPPO Alert List (the purpose of this List is to warn countries about possible new risks, and in certain cases to propose candidates for PRA and eventually regulation). Considering that the alert had been given and that no further action was needed, the Panel decided to delete Enaphalodes rufulus, Halyomorpha halys, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lactucae, Phytophthora pinifolia, Tomato torrado virus. The Panel suggested some emerging pests that could be added to the Alert List (e.g. Diplocarp

The Panel suggested some emerging pests that could be added to the Alert List (e.g. Diplocarpon mali , Meloidogyne mali, Myiopardalis pardalina, Pistosia dactyliferae, Phenagriluacoccus solani, Sclerotinia homeocarpa) . Pest Risk Analysis The Panel reviewed the comments on the draft Standard PM 5/ Decision support scheme for the identification of the need of a commodity PRA for imports of plants for planting after Country Consultation. It will be presented to the Working Party on Phytosanitary Regulations in June 2013 for recommendation for adoption. The Panel finalized the Decision-support scheme for prioritizing action during outbreaks which was first prepared in the framework of PRATIQUE. This draft standard will be sent for Country Consultation. In addition to the review of PRAs (see above) the Panel established the priorities for the organization of EWGs for PRA. The selection was made taking into account the following elements: geographical distribution, importance of the crop(s) concerned, risk of natural spread into the region or for further spread within the region, potential pathways, economic impact, environmental impact, possibilities of control, similarities to other known cases, availability and validity of data. Aromia bungii was considered as having a high priority. The Panel also agreed that, instead of holding an EWG for a PRA, a study could be performed on wood chips and wood waste. The objective of the study would be to gather information on the commodity (production mode, sizes, uses…) as well as gathering existing measures applied to this commodity by the industry or required by other

The objective of the study would be to gather information on the commodity (production mode, sizes, uses…) as well as gathering existing measures applied to this commodity by the industry or required by other countries to better address phytosanitary risks associated with such commodities in future PRAs. Pest reporting The Panel was given a presentation on the computerized system that is currently being developed by the Secretariat to allow EPPO member countries to report their pest outbreaks to EPPO via a web-based interface. Phytosanitary regulations in EPPO member countries Mr Tryakhov presented the work on phytosanitary issues within the newly created Eurasian Economic Commission (agreement between Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Federation of Russia). As usual, Mr Cardon (EU Commission) updated the Panel on the implementation of EPPO recommendations within EU countries. It was noted that EPPO PRAs are used to support EU regulations. The next Panel meeting is planned in Malta on 2012-10-29/31.
