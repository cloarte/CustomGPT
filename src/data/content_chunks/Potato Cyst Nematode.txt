Breadcrumb Home Plants Plant Health Plant Pests and Diseases Pale Cyst Nematode Pale Cyst Nematode Last Modified:  February 26, 2025 LM Dandurand, University of Idaho The pale cyst nematode ( Globodera pallida , PCN) is a soil-dwelling roundworm that feeds on the roots of high-value crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants. PCN is native to South America and was discovered in Idaho in 2006. This pest can remain dormant and viable in soil for 30 years. PCN are microscopic cyst-forming nematodes. When a mated female dies, her body hardens and becomes a cyst that contains between 300 to 500 viable eggs. If PCN populations are left unchecked, they can reduce crop yields by 20 to 70 percent. What To Look For When PCN is detected, it stops commerce in potatoes and nursery stock. It can seriously harm our agricultural production, environment, and economy. Here's what to look for: Cysts Dead females (cysts) can be found on the roots and potato tubers. They can stay dormant for up to 30 years, while the eggs inside remain viable. Field damage Stunted plants with yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventually plant death. PCN Photo Gallery Tap any image to view larger

Florida Division of Plant Industry, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Bugwood.org Sign of Globodera pallida on potato. Florida Division of Plant Industry, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Bugwood.org How To Prevent This Pest PCN spreads when soil from an infested field is moved to a new location on farming equipment, seed potatoes, or waste from potato grading operations. All farming equipment used on infested land must be pressure washed to remove soil. Equipment with difficult to reach areas, such as harvesters, may need to be steam treated or fumigated to ensure it is nematode-free. Pressure washing and steam treatments are coordinated through APHIS. To prevent the spread of PCN: Make sure all farm machinery, trucks, construction, and other equipment are clean when going from field to field. Do not allow any equipment in your fields unless it has been thoroughly cleaned. This is especially important when renting land, as you may not have records of previous crop history. Check the condition of trucks and other vehicles entering your operation. Find out where they have been and what sanitation treatments they have had. Seed potato shipments are a particular concern for PCN spread because trucks may make more than one stop. Do not spread waste from potato grading, processing, or storage operations on farmland or place it in an area where it can be spread to farmlands. Leave hedgerows, sod barriers, or sod strips between fields and along highways. Buy only certified seed that comes from fields tested and found to be PCN-free. Plant a PCN-resistant variety (if available) in your noninfested fields at least once every 4 years. Plant cover crops as soon as possible when land is not in use because wind and water erosion can spread PCN cysts. Tell people in your

 or sod strips between fields and along highways. Buy only certified seed that comes from fields tested and found to be PCN-free. Plant a PCN-resistant variety (if available) in your noninfested fields at least once every 4 years. Plant cover crops as soon as possible when land is not in use because wind and water erosion can spread PCN cysts. Tell people in your operation about the seriousness of PCN and potato diseases. Make sure they follow all precautions. Provide equipment needed to conduct proper cleaning and disinfection procedures. Segregate potatoes in storage by field. Do not reuse previously used bags or containers for potato transport. Be sure all commercial transport vehicles are free of soil. Do not allow temporary help, custom applicators, or utility companies to bring their vehicles onto your farmland without proper cleaning. Do not allow them to bring any bags or containers with them to the field. Do not use common headlands, farm roads, and public roads as turning areas. Prohibit nonauthorized entry onto farmlands using “No Trespassing” signs. Do not assume that nonregulated fields are free of PCN. How It Is Treated PCN-infested fields are treated with a chemical fumigant in late summer or early fall and sometimes in early spring, depending on soil temperature. These treatments continue until PCN is eradicated. APHIS monitors eradication progress. Report Plant Pests and Diseases Have you seen this pest or signs of pest damage?

Delimiting (Delimitation) Survey A full‐field survey at a sampling rate of 8,000 cc of soil per acre (equivalent to approximately 20 pounds of soil per acre) used to determine the presence or absence of PCN. A series of two negative delimiting surveys, each following harvest of the next two host crops grown on the field, is required to deregulate an associated field.

The deregulation requirement for fields deemed inconclusive for PCN or suspect for PCN by morphological/morphometric analysis is a series of two follow-up surveys at the delimiting survey rate, one of which must follow the next host crop grown on the field.

Negative for PCN No PCN cysts were found. Positive for PCN (Infested) The minimum threshold for declaring a field positive for PCN (infested) is met by detecting a minimum of two cysts from two samples that were identified as Globodera sp. by morphological/morphometric analysis, and at least one of the cysts was viable and confirmed as Globodera pallida (PCN) by molecular (DNA) analysis. Suspect for PCN by DNA Analysis A single cyst was identified as Globodera pallida (PCN) by morphological/morphometric and molecular (DNA) analysis; however, the minimum threshold for declaring a field positive for PCN (infested) was not met. Suspect for PCN by Morphological/Morphometric Analysis Cyst(s) from one or more samples were identified as Globodera sp. by morphological/morphometric analysis.
