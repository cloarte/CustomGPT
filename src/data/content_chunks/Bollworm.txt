Introduction  
 
The Cotton Pests Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Plant Protection and Quarantine 
(PPQ) program works with growers, the cotton industry, States, and Mexico to eradicate the boll weevil 
(BW) and pink bollworm (PBW) from all cotton-producing areas of the United States and northern 
Mexico. Collectively, the BW and PBW are the most destructive pests of cotton, worldwide. The Cotton 
Pests Program also maintains preparedness capabilities to address other cotton pests that could enter the 
United States. PPQ provides national coordination, operational oversight, and technology development 
(such as sterile moth production for PBW eradication), while program partners have provided more than 
two-thirds of the funding for the BW eradication effort and most of the operational funds for PBW 
eradication. PPQ also provides technical advice on trapping and treatment protocols to its partners in 
Mexico for their eradication efforts.

Boll Weevil 
 
The boll weevil (BW) has cost cotton growers more than $15 billion since it entered the United States in 
the late 19th century (National Cotton Council of America, 2021). PPQ began the initial BW eradication 
program along the Virginia-North Carolina border in the early 1980s. The BW eradication effort 
involves mapping cotton fields, using pheromone traps to evaluate weevil

) has cost cotton growers more than $15 billion since it entered the United States in 
the late 19th century (National Cotton Council of America, 2021). PPQ began the initial BW eradication 
program along the Virginia-North Carolina border in the early 1980s. The BW eradication effort 
involves mapping cotton fields, using pheromone traps to evaluate weevil presence, and applying 
pesticides. Once BW is eradicated from an area, cotton growers rely less on insecticides, thus reducing 
their production costs. Over the course of the eradication efforts, the program has increased these 
growers’ global competitiveness, primarily through reduced production costs and increasing yields.   
 
To date, PPQ and cooperators have eradicated BW from 99 percent of the 13.76 million acres of U.S. 
cotton (Acreage Report, National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2022). The Lower Rio Grande Valley 
(LRGV) is the last zone within the United States where the pest persists. BW populations in the 
neighboring Mexican cotton-producing State of Tamaulipas impact eradication efforts in the LRGV. 
Therefore, PPQ and its cooperators in Mexico’s National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety and 
Quality (SENASICA) and the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation (TX-BWEF) are working to 
eradicate BW from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. 
 
PPQ continued virtual monthly meetings with SENASICA to maintain open communication about BW 
eradication successes and challenges throughout the 2023 growing season. PPQ also engaged its 
international counterparts in Mexico City to expand its engagement with SENASICA. PPQ will continue 
engaging SENASICA at multiple levels to ensure growers adhere to eradication

PPQ continued virtual monthly meetings with SENASICA to maintain open communication about BW 
eradication successes and challenges throughout the 2023 growing season. PPQ also engaged its 
international counterparts in Mexico City to expand its engagement with SENASICA. PPQ will continue 
engaging SENASICA at multiple levels to ensure growers adhere to eradication and quality control 
protocols, as well as ensure growers adhere to defoliation, harvest, and stalk-destruction deadlines set by 
the BW eradication program.

In addition to monthly meetings with SENASICA in FY 2023, cooperators from the United States and 
Mexico gathered for their annual meeting to review progress and amend the BW Eradication 
Operational Plan for the 2023 growing season. Amendments were adopted to enhance quality controls 
for technician training, BW monitoring, data integrity, and communication. These mutually agreed upon 
amendments help to ensure accurate and timely treatment of areas where BW captures are present and 
refined previously adopted practices, for a more rigorous quality control protocol for BW monitoring, 
knowledge retention, and data integrity. 
 
In FY 2023, PPQ continued its support for the BW Eradication Program in Tamaulipas, Mexico, through 
its agreement with the North American Plant Protection Organization (NAPPO), which funds ultra-low 
volume malathion and aerial treatment expenses. Cooperators from TX-BWEF provided technical 
training and assistance to SENASICA and growers in Tamaulipas to implement the rigorous quality 
control program protocols. This includes providing technical assistance through the smart device 
application that enables employees and TX-BWEF managers to monitor trap deployment, trap servicing, 
and treatment activities in real time.

and treatment activities in real time. 
 
Environmental conditions in the LRGV and Northern Tamaulipas present PPQ and its cooperators with  
challenges that interfere with BW monitoring and treatments. Extreme heat in FY 2023 accelerated 
cotton growth by several weeks in the LRGV and Tamaulipas areas, prompting an earlier harvest.  
Extended heat and drought conditions hardened the soil, hindering growers’ ability to plow down their 
fields and prolonging the availability of hostable materials for BW. Additionally in Tamaulipas, security 
events associated with cartel activity prevented growers from monitoring and treating for BW activity. 
Monitoring and treatment gaps extending 2 weeks or more may allow reproductive pockets of BW to 
generate high numbers.

Captures in Tamaulipas increased by 486 percent, with 1,964 captures in October 2023, compared with 
404 BW captures by the same time in 2022. Cooperators in Tamaulipas treated 344,883 acres in 2023 
compared with 447,026 treated acres in 2022. Captures in LRGV decreased by 54 percent, totaling 
2,175 by October 2023, compared with 4,033 BW captures by the same time in 2022. Cooperators 
treated 569,445 acres in the LRGV, compared with 447,047 that needed treatment at the same time the 
prior year.

PPQ will continue partnering with the U.S. cotton industry to reduce the BW population in the LRGV 
and to conduct BW surveillance efforts for all U.S. cotton production areas in FY 2024. PPQ will also 
continue to partner with SENASICA’s Tamaulipas BW Eradication Program to provide technical 
assistance and funding for their parallel program to the LRGV program. PPQ is committed to 
monitoring BW to ensure the detection of any reintroductions quickly, and to work toward successful 
eradication of BW in the United States in the coming years. 
Pink Bollworm 
 
In the United States, although the volume of acreage planted with cotton varies from year to year, the 
PBW commonly caused cotton losses of 20 percent or more in affected areas. Since the PBW control 
program began in 1967, PPQ and cooperative program partners have eradicated the PBW from Southern 
California, Arizona, large areas of New Mexico, and the El Paso/Trans Pecos region of Texas. On 
September 26, 2018, PPQ issued a Federal Order releasing Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas 
from the PBW quarantine. On October 19, 2018, PPQ, in conjunction with industry partners, officially 
announced the successful eradication of PBW from all commercial cotton-producing areas in the 
continental United States.

In FY 2018, Florida added a PBW quarantine for an area in the Everglades where a wild PBW 
population has persisted for the last 80 years and appears to only be active in wild cotton. As a result, 
PPQ, along with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the Florida cotton 
industry, began surveying the perimeter of the commercial cotton area in the northern part of the State 
and the adjacent okra fields in the city of Homestead, to ensure that PBW has not spread. In FY 2023, 
PPQ continued to survey these areas in Florida to ensure that isolated PBW populations in southern 
Florida do not move into the commercial cotton production areas north of the Everglades. These surveys 
will continue in FY 2024.
