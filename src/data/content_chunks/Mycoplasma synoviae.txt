1.  Reagent Name : Mycoplasma synoviae 
 
2.  Strain or Source: BRP batch 1; European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & 
HealthCare (EDQM); Strasbourg, France 
 
3.  Lot Number: 17Apr12-MS 
 
4.  Fill Date: April 17, 2012 
 
5.  Expiration Date : None 
Precautions: This reagent must be handled in a manner consistent with Biosafety Level 2 
(BSL-2) standards. 
6
.  Intended Use: For use as a reference standard in the culture method to determine 
mycoplasma contamination of biological products. 
 
7.  Instructions for Use: Vials of the culture should be rapidly thawed in a 35°-38°C water 
bath and immediately diluted in sterile saline (0.8-0.9% NaCl solution) to achieve the desired 
concentration of colony forming units (CFU); refer to Section 14. To maintain viability, culture 
dilutions must be inoculated onto medium within 10 minutes of preparation. 
 
8.  Test of Reagent: Purity of this reagent was analyzed by the method described in 9 CFR 
113.27(d). The estimated titer of this re

dilutions must be inoculated onto medium within 10 minutes of preparation. 
 
8.  Test of Reagent: Purity of this reagent was analyzed by the method described in 9 CFR 
113.27(d). The estimated titer of this reagent was determined empirically using standard plate 
count analysis. 
 
9.  Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 1.0 mL frozen culture  
  
10.  Storage Conditions: -60°C or colder   
 
11.  CVB Technical Contact: Bacteriology Section, Center for Veterinary Biologics, (515) 
337-6100. 
 
12.  Origin and Passage History: The strain was first isolated in France in 1999 from a flock 
of turkey broilers. The CVB acquired the strain from the EDQM in 2012.

13.  Method of Preparation : The culture was diluted to a stock concentration recommended 
by the European Pharmacopoeia in Reference Standard Leaflet Y0000689 in mycoplasma 
medium supplemented with 15% glycerol. The diluted culture is stored at less than -60°C. 
 
14.  Other: The estimated titer of this reagent is 37,147 CFU/mL. To achieve a use-dilution 
containing a target concentration of approximately 100 CFU/mL, prepare a 1:370 dilution in

medium supplemented with 15% glycerol. The diluted culture is stored at less than -60°C. 
 
14.  Other: The estimated titer of this reagent is 37,147 CFU/mL. To achieve a use-dilution 
containing a target concentration of approximately 100 CFU/mL, prepare a 1:370 dilution in 
sterile saline. Begin by making a 1:9.25 dilution (0.5 mL culture + 4.125 mL saline) followed by 
a 1:4 dilution (1 mL [1:9.25 dilution] + 3 mL saline), and a 10-fold dilution. Subsequent 10-fold 
dilutions may be generated to produce 10 CFU/mL, 1 CFU/mL, and 0.1 CFU/mL solutions. To 
verify the concentration of the dilutions, plate 0.1 mL of each dilution on mycoplasma agar or 
Frey agar plates and incubate for 10-14 days in a humidified chamber containing 4-6% CO2 in 
air or 4-6% CO2 in nitrogen. Note: this strain grows best on Frey agar. 
Restrictions: This reagent is intended as a one-time use reference standard for the 
mycoplasma contamination test. Culturing this organism with the intent to propagate a stock 
culture is not permitted.
