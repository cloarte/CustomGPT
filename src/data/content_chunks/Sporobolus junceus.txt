 Reproduccion: A chromosome number of 2 n = 36 has been reported for S. junceus (cited as S. poiretii ) ( Brown, 1951 ; Gould, 1965 ). Very little information is available on the reproductive biology of S. junceus. Reproduction is by seed and plant divisions ( Institute for Regional Conservation, 2020 ). Sporobolus junceus is a C4 grass, adapted to fire-maintained longleaf pine savannahs ( Kirkman et al., 2004 ). Flowers and fruits are produced 7-9 weeks following a fire ( Canfield and Tanner, 1997 ). It is also reported as flowering all year ( Institute for Regional Conservation, 2020 ). Sporobolus junceus is a perennial grass ( Institute for Regional Conservation, 2020 ). There is very little detailed information about the environmental requirements of S. junceus. This species grows at 2-400 m, in moist, well-drained, nutrient-poor sandy or limestone soils, with an acidic to neutral pH ( Barkworth et al., 2007 ; Florida Native Plants Society, 2020 ; Institute for Regional Conservation, 2020 ). Drought tolerant, S. junceus does not tolerate saline environments or flooding ( Institute for Regional Conservation, 2020 ).
