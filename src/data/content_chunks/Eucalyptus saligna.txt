 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for E. saligna is 2 n = 22 ( Matsumoto et al., 2000 ). Hybrids of E. saligna with other Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus grandis , Eucalyptus robusta and Eucalyptus botryoides have been described for areas located within and outside its native range ( Skolmen, 1986 ; 1990; Benson and McDougall, 1998 ). Eucalyptus saligna reproduces by seed and is vegetatively propagated by air-layering and grafting. This species can sprout from dormant buds present in the cambium throughout the stem.

 ). Eucalyptus saligna reproduces by seed and is vegetatively propagated by air-layering and grafting. This species can sprout from dormant buds present in the cambium throughout the stem. Sprouts also grow from the lignotuber, a mass of bud tissue at or just below the groundline. Lignotubers persist when stems are killed by shading, thinning or fire and sprout after a mature stand is cut ( Cremer et al., 1978 ; Skolmen, 1990 ). Flowers of E. saligna are perfect. The opened flowers are yellowish-white and are insect-pollinated. Pollen is generally shed before the style becomes receptive, so selfing is rare ( Skolmen, 1986 ; 1990). When in flower, E. saligna provides nectar resources for a diverse range of birds and flying foxes and insects (bees) ( Benson and McDougall, 1998 ; Hornsby Shire Council, 2017 ). Trees begin to flower at 3 to 4 years of age (Skolmen, 1988; Orwa et al., 2009 ; Hornsby Shire Council, 2017 ). In Australia, E. saligna flowers between December and February, but can be variable; flowers are white. The capsule ripens about 6 months after flowering but opens to release seed one or two months after ripening. Mature fruits may be retained on trees for up to 2 years and seeds are gradually shed during this time. Seeds germinate without treatment (e.g. no dormancy; Benson and McDougall, 1998 ; Hornsby Shire Council, 2017 ). In China, it has been recorded flowering in April and May ( Flora of China Editorial Committee, 2017 ). E. saligna also tolerates fire and trees can resprout from epicormic buds on lower trunk and branches after high intensity fire ( Benson and McDougall, 1998 ). E

E. saligna also tolerates fire and trees can resprout from epicormic buds on lower trunk and branches after high intensity fire ( Benson and McDougall, 1998 ). Eucalyptus saligna is a perennial tree that may live up to 200 years ( Hornsby Shire Council, 2017 ). Eucalyptus saligna is a component of the endangered Blue Gum High Forest ecological community in the Sydney region. It is listed as ‘critically endangered’ in Australia where much of its native range has been extensively cleared and natural populations are highly threatened by the invasion of alien species such as Cinnamomum camphora , Lonicera japonica and Ligustrum sinense ( Benson and McDougall, 1998 ; Hornsby Shire Council, 2017 ). In Australia, E. saligna is usually found in mixture with Eucalyptus microcorys (tallowwood eucalyptus) and Eucalyptus pilularis (blackbutt eucalyptus), the main coastal species in New South Wales, and is also found associated with several other species of eucalypts. It seldom grows in pure stands (Forestry and Timber Bureau, 1962). Eucalyptus saligna prefers areas where the climate is warm temperate to subtropical, dry to moist with a mild dry season and mean annual temperature ranging from 10° to 22°C and mean annual rainfall ranging from 700 mm to 2300 mm. It withstands short periods of drought of up to 4 months and tolerates frosts in the range -2°C to -15°C. Within its native distribution range, this species occurs in summer-rainfall

Within its native distribution range, this species occurs in summer-rainfall zones, but it has been grown successfully in areas where there is winter-rainfall. E. saligna is adapted to grow on clay loam, heavy clay, loam, sandy loam and sandy soils with pH of 6.0 to 8.0. It prefers moist but well-drained soils and is sensitive to saline and waterlogged soils ( Duke, 1983 ; Orwa et al., 2009 ; Flora of Australia, 2017 ). This species is very intolerant of shade ( Skolmen, 1990 ).
