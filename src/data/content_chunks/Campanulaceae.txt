Stamens equaling number of corolla lobes, antisepalous, distinct, coherent, or connate; anthers tetrasporangiate, dithecal, introrsely dehiscent by longitudinal slits, basifixed. Gynoecium syncarpous, 2-5(-10)-locular with axile placentation, [rarely 1-locular with parietal, basal, or apical placentation outside of China]; ovary at least partly inferior (superior inCyananthus), sometimes crowned by an annular or tubular nectary; style solitary, pubescent with pollen-collecting hairs below apex; stigma typically with as many lobes as ovary locules. Fruit a capsule, commonly apically loculicidal or laterally poricidal, or a berry. Seeds usually small, numerous; embryo small, straight; endosperm copious, oily or rarely starchy.Eighty-six genera and over 2,300 species: cosmopolitan; 16 genera (one endemic, two introduced) and 159 species (77 endemic, two introduced) in China.Two of us (Lammers and Klein) do not agree with the separation ofLeptocodonandCampanumoeafromCodonopsisin this treatment. We consider that the single character used in each case, five lamellar glands alternate with the stamens inLeptocodonand baccate fruit inCampanumoea, is not sufficient to justify recognition of a distinct genus.

Vasc. Pl. 8: 26-56. 2007), and Lammers (World Checkl. Bibliogr. Campanulaceae. 262-273. 2007). On the other hand, one of us (Hong) notes that two characters distinguishLeptocodonfromCodonopsis. One is the five lamellar glands and the other is the shape of the stigma segments, which are clavate inLeptocodonbut orbicular-deltoid inCodonopsis.Campanumoeadiffers fromCodonopsisnot only in having baccate fruit but also in its pollen, which is shortly 5-colpate (vs. 5-8-long-colpate in the core group ofCodonopsis).Campanumoeais not a very distinct genus, and it seems that it would be equally reasonable to sink it intoCodonopsisor to separate it. However, if it were sunk, then it would also be reasonable to sinkAdenophoraintoCampanulabecause the former genus differs from the latter only in having a nectar disk around the style.PentaphragmaWallich ex G.
