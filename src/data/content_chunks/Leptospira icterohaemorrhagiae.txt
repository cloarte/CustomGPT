2. Strain or Source: N/A 
3. Lot Number: IRP 542 (06) 
4. Fill Date: November 1, 2006 
5. Expiration Date: July 31, 2026 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: To be used as a reference bacterin in accordance with SAM 627 
(Supplemental Assay Method for in vitro Potency Testing of Leptospira interrogans Serogroup 
icterohaemorrhagiae Bacterins). CAUTION: This reference is to be used for canine, swine, and 
bovine vaccines as approved in Outlines of Production. 
7. Instructions for Use: Make an initial dilution of 1:10 (1.0 mL bacterin + 9.0 mL 0.85% 
NaCl solution). Adjust final dilution (using 0.85% NaCl solution) based on host animal dosage 
per the following table. The final dilution is considered as UNDILUTED when entering data into 
the software to estimate relative potency.
