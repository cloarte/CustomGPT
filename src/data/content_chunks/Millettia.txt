Leaves pulvinate, usually imparipinnate; leaflets (1-)5-15(to over 40), usually opposite, rarely alternate; stipels present or absent. Inflorescences various, but not in elongated racemes. Flowers often in fascicles and these arranged in pseudoracemes or pseudopanicles, sometimes on leafless branches or on main trunk. Bracteoles usually present. Calyx various, truncate or with 4 or 5 short lobes. Corolla papilionaceous; standard with or without basal calluses; wings free or ± adherent to keel. Stamens 10, monadelphous or diadelphous; vexillary filament free or connate to others; anthers versatile, sometimes with trichomes. Disk generally present, tubular, surrounding stipe of ovary; ovary with 1-12 or more ovules. Legumes dehiscent or indehiscent, winged or not; valves woody or papery.
