II. CURRENT TRACEABILITY SITUATION 
 
2.1 Who are we? 
 
TAHC was founded by the Texas Legislature in 1893 and is charged with 
protecting Texas’ livestock and poultry  “from all contagious or infectious 
diseases of a malignant character.” Today, TAHC remains true to this charge 
while evolving with the times to protect the health and marketability of all 
Texas livestock and poultry.  
 
TAHC has legislative authority to make and enforce regulations to prevent, 
control, and eradicate specific infectious animal diseases which endanger 
livestock and poultry. TAHC regulations are made and adopted by 13 
governor-appointed commissioners who represent the general public, various 
livestock industries, and professions. The commissioners serve staggered 
six-year terms and meet as needed to study the regulatory need s of the 
agency, review public comments on proposed regulation changes, and adopt 
new rules when necessary. 
 
TAHC’s headquarters are in Austin with six region offices strategically 
located across the state so the staff can work more effectively with ranchers, 
livestock markets and slaughter plant personnel, and other livestock industry 
representatives across Texas’ 254 counties. 
 
Texas has unique risks associated with its size and extensive borders. In 
addition to the four US states that boarder Texas, the Texas -Mexico border 
spans approximately 1,248 miles.  Texas also has multiple land ports, 
seaports, and international airports.  
 
In addition to TAHC’s animal health specialists, who have expertise in the 
Texas animal agriculture industry, to help develop the most efficient animal

In addition to TAHC’s animal health specialists, who have expertise in the 
Texas animal agriculture industry, to help develop the most efficient animal 
disease traceability program, TAHC uses various animal disease traceability 
working groups , which meet on an as -needed basis . These groups bring 
together representatives and experts from various industries to provide  
species specific valuable guidance and on the  continued development and 
implementation of traceability efforts in Texas.

2.2 Where are we now? 
 
Texas has successfully completed four previous ADT Road Maps. The first 
Texas ADT Road Map plans established the initial development and  
implementation of a basic traceability system and rules during FY2012, 
FY2013, and FY2014. Building on the previous successes the Texas ADT 
Road Map 2 for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017, continued implementation 
of traceability activities and began development of a system for electronic 
capture of ICVI data. For FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020, the  Texas ADT 
Road Map 3 focused on improving the availability and retrieval of 
traceability information, as well as the evaluation of visual versus electronic 
traceability devices and documents.  With the success of the previous four 
ADT Road maps FY2021,  FY2022, and FY2023 concentrated on the 
continued transition to electronic traceability devices and encourage 
paperless reporting. 
 
TAHC continues to work with the animal disease traceability cattle working 
group and other industries to find workable solutions and to help develop  
short and long-term

TAHC continues to work with the animal disease traceability cattle working 
group and other industries to find workable solutions and to help develop  
short and long-term plans for the future of animal identification and disease 
traceability in Texas. 
 
Premises Registration Systems 
 
TAHC has continued voluntary premises registration to support the 
administration of location identifiers that adhere to the federal standards. 
ADT staff manages the various premises registration systems, including 
issuing premises identification numbers (P IN)s, location identification 
numbers (LID)s, and scrapie flock identification numbers. Each number is 
nationally unique and recognized. 
 
A national premises identification number (PIN) is a unique number, 
permanently assigned to a physical address where agricultural animals are 
located. Texas utilizes the USDA-APHIS provided Premise Management 
System (PM) to obtain a PIN from the federal allocator.  A PIN consists of 
seven alphanumeric characters, beginning with two leading zeros. To obtain 
a PIN, producers may contact TAHC’s ADT department. The owner’s 
contact and premises information is entered, maintained, and stored 
electronically in PM and hard copy files on-site. 
 
Texas has a state system and process for issuing a location identification 
number (LID).  A LID is assigned to an owner’s contact and operation 
information, which are stored in a state administered CoreOne database  
(TexCore). Only the LID number itself is reported to the federal repository 
system as a valid

-site. 
 
Texas has a state system and process for issuing a location identification 
number (LID).  A LID is assigned to an owner’s contact and operation 
information, which are stored in a state administered CoreOne database  
(TexCore). Only the LID number itself is reported to the federal repository 
system as a valid number. All LIDs start with the state postal abbreviation 
(TX) followed by six random alphanumeric characters, which makes the 
LIDs nationally unique. In most cases, a LID may be used in lieu of a PIN. 
To obtain a LID, producers may contact their local TAHC region office or 
6  
ADT department. 
 
Additionally, ADT staff administers the Scrapie program for sheep and  
goats. They collect producer and flock information over the telephone, assign 
a Scrapie flock identification number, enter the information into SCS-SCR, 
and maintain a scanned file copy of the registration/order form. 
 
Administration of Official Identification Devices 
 
The proper administration of official identification devices and reporting is 
key for capturing accurate information needed to achieve successful animal 
disease traceability. The most commonly used forms of official ID are USDA 
approved Animal Identification Number (AIN) “840” series Radio 
Frequency Identification tags (RFID) and National Uniform Eartagging 
System (NUES) identification metal eartags.  Brucellosis calfhood 
vaccination tags, Swine PIN tags, Scrapie tags, and breed registration 
tattoos/brands (uniquely identifying the animal and accompanied by the 
breed registration paperwork) are also acceptable as official ID. A complete 
list of acceptable official identification devices/methods

 (NUES) identification metal eartags.  Brucellosis calfhood 
vaccination tags, Swine PIN tags, Scrapie tags, and breed registration 
tattoos/brands (uniquely identifying the animal and accompanied by the 
breed registration paperwork) are also acceptable as official ID. A complete 
list of acceptable official identification devices/methods is posted on 
TAHC’s website and updated regularly. Producers are encouraged to contact 
their veterinarian or TAHC to determine which method of tagging will be 
best for their operation. 
 
AIN - RFID tags 
AIN device manufacturers and managers may  distribute approved AIN 
devices to producers and are responsible for entering tag distribution 
records into the Animal Identification Management System (AIMS). All 
recipients of AIN devices must first have a LID or PIN and provide that 
number to the distributor for proper reporting. ADT staff are available to 
register premises, process address exceptions, and issue the allocated 
PINs and/or LIDs. Additionally, TAHC r egion office staff can  register 
premises and issue LIDs. Producers with a valid PIN or LID are 
encouraged to purchase official identification from an USDA approved 
tagging manufacturer or supplier. TAHC will provide or direct producers 
to the complete list of approved AIN devices and tag manufacturers’ 
information maintained on the USDA traceability website. 
 
TAHC will continue to promote and support the use of electronic 
identification. By the end of FY2019, TAHC successfully transitioned to 
only using electronic identification for regulatory and disease program 
work by all TAHC field personnel.  TAHC may use ADT cooperative  
agreement funds to purchase additional AIN RFID tags and RFID device

TAHC will continue to promote and support the use of electronic 
identification. By the end of FY2019, TAHC successfully transitioned to 
only using electronic identification for regulatory and disease program 
work by all TAHC field personnel.  TAHC may use ADT cooperative  
agreement funds to purchase additional AIN RFID tags and RFID device 
applicators. In addition, TAHC may supply AIN RFID tags to producers 
with a valid PIN or LID, if supplies are available and only on a case-by-
case basis. TAHC’s ADT department is responsible for overseeing the 
management of all official ID devices distributed and/or applied by the 
agency. TAHC region office staff will collect all official ID allocation 
7  
records from field staff, enter the data into TexCore, and report official 
ID distributions to TAHC ’s ADT department. Tag distribution records 
for official AIN devices are entered and maintained in AIMS by ADT 
staff. 
 
After RFID tags are applied to the animals, the RFID devices can  be 
scanned and read by standard ISO compliant readers. Electronic readers 
are available for purchase by animal health agencies, markets, operations, 
and producers from the manufacturers. TAHC field personnel  regularly 
use handheld readers, wands, and stationary readers paired with handheld 
PDAs and laptops to electronically capture the animal identification 
numbers and upload the data into the appropriate systems  using MIMS; 
while conducting testing, disease response, trace work, and assisting with 
livestock identification. Funds will be used to purchase electronic readers 
with accessories for TAHC field personnel and accredited vets, as part of 
our technology equipment refresh and to increase infrastructure.

with accessories for TAHC field personnel and accredited vets, as part of 
our technology equipment refresh and to increase infrastructure. 
 
Accredited Veterinarians and Cattle Producers 
In order to expand the use of RFID devices, USDA will offer free AIN-
840 low frequency RFID white and orange OCV  tags to states for 
accredited veterinarians and cattle producers for use  on replacement 
breeding cattle. The complimentary RFID tags are used as an alternative 
to silver metal “ Brite” tags and orange metal Official Calfhood 
Vaccination (OCV) tags. Though the metal clip tags have served a 
valuable purpose in disease control and eradication programs, RFID 
devices provide state animal health officials and the cattle industries 
increased ability to accurately and quickly trace animals exposed to or 
infected with potentially devastating diseases before they can  do 
substantial damage to the U.S. livestock and consumer markets. 
 
Texas accredited veterinarians and cattle producers that are interested in 
receiving official RFID tags at no-cost may submit their  requests to 
TAHC’s ADT department. TAHC will fill the requests for these devices 
from the supply given by USDA. The tags will  be distributed to field 
offices, accredited vets, producers,  or operations that are eligible to 
receive these official id devices at no -cost. These no- cost official id 
devices will be shipped directly from TAHC supply. The shipping costs 
for devices redistributed from TAHC will be paid for with cooperative

 given by USDA. The tags will  be distributed to field 
offices, accredited vets, producers,  or operations that are eligible to 
receive these official id devices at no -cost. These no- cost official id 
devices will be shipped directly from TAHC supply. The shipping costs 
for devices redistributed from TAHC will be paid for with cooperative 
funds, any overages will be covered by state funding. 
 
Accredited Veterinarians are required to maintain records and report all 
official ID devices distributed and/or applied, using one of the following 
methods: record and submit identification data on an official animal 
health record (test record, vaccination chart, or ICVI) for data entry into 
8  
TexCore; vets who are AIN Device Managers may enter AIN distribution 
records directly into AIMs; or report official ID distribution records to 
TAHC’s ADT department for data entry into AIMS. 
 
Livestock Marketing Facilities 
TAHC recommends that producers/buyers contact their local livestock 
market/auction barn to determine current requirements and available 
options for livestock identification. Some animals may be required to be 
officially identified prior to or after purchase to comply with the ADT, 
disease program, or regulatory requirements. 
 
Livestock marketing facilities are not required to report tag distribution  
records for livestock tagged at the market . As part of a separate TAHC 
rule, livestock marketing facilities are required to keep certain dealer 
records for a minimum of five years and to make the records available 
for inspection by TAHC representatives. TAHC Market Inspectors report 
all tag sequence allocations to region offices, which are then entered into 
TexCore. Dealer records are to include records

 the market . As part of a separate TAHC 
rule, livestock marketing facilities are required to keep certain dealer 
records for a minimum of five years and to make the records available 
for inspection by TAHC representatives. TAHC Market Inspectors report 
all tag sequence allocations to region offices, which are then entered into 
TexCore. Dealer records are to include records of individual animal 
identification numbers, plus consignor and consignee contact 
information for animals sold. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites 
All facilities such as livestock markets receiving certain classes of 
livestock without official identification must be designated as an 
approved tagging site by agreement. The purpose of this agreement is to 
maintain integrity and control of application of official eartags at  an 
approved tagging site, where livestock may be officially identified on 
behalf of the owner or person in possession, care or control of the animals 
when they are brought to the facility. Animals requiring official 
identification may  be moved to these sites without prior official 
identification, provided the site can maintain the individual identity of 
animals until they are officially identified. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites can order RFID  tags in increments of 1 00 by 
contacting TAHC ’s ADT department.  RFID tags will be used to 
officially identify all animals in accordance with 9 CFR 86 and 4 TAC 
§50.2, including: 
• Officially identify animals required to be identified before 
commingling with animals from different premises or use a backtag 
or other method to accurately maintain the animal's identity until the 
official ear tag is applied. The official identification can then be 
correlated to the person responsible for shipping the animal. 
• Only apply official eartags

, including: 
• Officially identify animals required to be identified before 
commingling with animals from different premises or use a backtag 
or other method to accurately maintain the animal's identity until the 
official ear tag is applied. The official identification can then be 
correlated to the person responsible for shipping the animal. 
• Only apply official eartags to animals not already officially 
identified, (except as provided in 9 CFR 86.4(c)); and 
• Do not remove official identification devices unless authorized by an 
animal health official. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites must submit records of tag application within 
9  
30 days if requested by TAHC personnel. The report must include, at a 
minimum: The name, physical address, city, state and zip code of the 
owner or person responsible for animals tagged; the official identification 
numbers of the  tags applied associated with the  owner or person 
responsible for the animals; and the date the official identification eartags 
were applied. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites must maintain records of official identification 
eartags received and applied for a minimum of five years. Also, maintain 
an accurate inventory of official eartags and application records in a 
secure place accessible only to tag applicator personnel. Any lost or 
stolen tags must be immediately reported to Texas animal health officials. 
 
Swine PIN tags 
Producers requesting Swine PIN tags must first have a premises ID 
number (PIN), as the PIN is imprinted on the tags. ADT staff will register 
the premises over the phone and provide the allocated PIN number. The 
Swine PIN tags are available for purchase from an USDA approved 
tagging manufacturer or supplier. TAHC will provide or direct producers

Swine PIN tags are available for purchase from an USDA approved 
tagging manufacturer or supplier. TAHC will provide or direct producers 
to the list of official PIN tags for slaughter swine and their  approved tag 
manufacturers’ information maintained on the USDA traceability 
website. 
 
TAHC will use ADT cooperative agreement funds to purchase Swine 
PIN tags and applicators for animal disease regulatory work. These tags 
will be registered to and imprinted with the PIN for TAHC ’s central 
office. These tags are only distributed to TAHC region offices to be used 
by TAHC field staff when conducting swine testing.  The initial tag  
distributions from the central office to the region offices are entered and 
maintained in TexCore. When applied to the animal, the tag allocations 
are reported on the swine test charts and submitted to TAHC  region 
offices for data entry. 
 
Scrapie tags 
USDA-APHIS announced nationwide identification and recordkeeping 
requirements for sheep and goats on March 25, 2019 as part of the 
National Scrapie Eradication Program. USDA-APHIS believes the final 
rule will result in a more effective disease eradication program. The rule 
provides a more flexible approach to disease investigations and affected 
flock management, and more consistent animal identification and 
recordkeeping requirements between sheep and goats. Under this rule, all 
sheep and goats must have official identification (I.D.) when moving off 
their premises of origin, unless specifically exempt.

flock management, and more consistent animal identification and 
recordkeeping requirements between sheep and goats. Under this rule, all 
sheep and goats must have official identification (I.D.) when moving off 
their premises of origin, unless specifically exempt. 
 
Acceptable forms of official identification include plastic or metal 
Scrapie flock ID tags, Scrapie 840 RFID ear tags, and plastic or metal 
serial tags. Registered tattoos and 840 electronic implants are accepted 
10  
as official ID with the exception of sheep and goats that are in slaughter 
channels or moving through a livestock market or buying station. 
 
The national Scrapie Program hotline forwards the phone calls of Texas 
breeders, dealers, and livestock markets to TAHC’s ADT department. 
ADT staff will register the flocks/operations for a Scrapie flock 
identification number or verify their existing Scrapie flock ID number. 
TAHC will provide the caller with the information on how to purchase 
the official ID devices. For producers, dealers, and markets eligible to 
receive free tags, TAHC will place the order into AIMS. Scrapie flock 
and serial tags ordered through AIMS will be shipped directly to the 
recipient and the tag allocation entered into AIMS by the tagging 
manufacturers. 
 
TAHC will order Scrapie serial tags and applicators for the ADT 
department and region offices. TAHC may supply a very limited amount 
of these Scrapie serial tags to producers with a valid Scrapie flock ID 
number, if supplies are available and, on a case-by-case basis. The most

department and region offices. TAHC may supply a very limited amount 
of these Scrapie serial tags to producers with a valid Scrapie flock ID 
number, if supplies are available and, on a case-by-case basis. The most 
common reason for TAHC to issue Scrapie serial tags is for sheep or 
goats going to a show or out of state within the two weeks, in other words, 
needed sooner than the time it takes for flock ID tags to be ordered, 
produced, and shipped. ADT staff will enter these tag allocations into 
AIMS. 
 
Animal Health and Movement Records 
 
TAHC maintains various other traceability data sources by continuing to 
collect and store identification data required for testing, movement, change 
of ownership, and other applicable animal health disease programs.  These 
include but are not limited to data collected and/or stored from interstate and 
intrastate certificates of veterinary inspection (ICVIs), bovine brucellosis and 
tuberculosis test charts, brucellosis vaccination records, scrapie tag 
distribution, and interstate permits. 
 
As outlined in the previous Road Maps, TAHC has continued to focus on the 
electronic data capture, the promotion and transition from paper to electronic 
documentation. During FY2014, TAHC IT Development Team completed 
the development of a TAHC eCVI and put a link to a new application on 
TAHC’s website. The application enables Texas veterinarians  to purchase 
eCVIs online. The Health Certificate webpage on the agency’s website, 
displays all the ICVI purchasing options (electronic and paper).

eCVI online application continues to work as expected and veterinarians are 
successfully utilizing the tool. TAHC staff is continuing to monitor all CVIs 
and eCVIs for data quality and compliance. Starting in FY2016, TAHC 
contracted with Trace First to utilize StateVet.com for the data entry and 
upload of ICVI data into SCS, for cattle with official identificatio n moving 
interstate. Additionally, at the end of the FY2016 cooperative year, TAHC 
Program Records and ADT staff started using document management 
11  
software, Square 9, to begin scanning all paper and electronic interstate CVIs, 
for all species with or without official identification, into an electronically 
searchable system. The emphasis placed on transitioning from a primarily 
paper-based system to electronic capture of CVI data has resulted in 
significant improvements in traceability and completion of trace 
performance exercises. 
 
During FY2019 and FY2020, TAHC worked with VS and Palantir staff to 
implement use of DIS-AHER, including establishing access, user training for 
staff, identification of data sources, verifying compatibility, initiating 
electronic information sharing of summary data, and pilot testing DIS for 
FY2020 ADT Cooperative Agreement work plans and quarterly reporting.

ADT data collected in Texas is entered and stored in a mixture of state and 
USDA maintained standardized animal health systems. Federal systems 
utilized: AHER for data searches, SCR for Scrapie Flock IDs, EMRS2 for 
NPTs and Response records . MIMS for electronic data captured in field, 
Premise Management for Premises IDs, AIMS for AIN and Scrapie official 
ID distributions. Texcore for issuing LIDs, including StateVet for official ID 
distribution, regulatory program and movement records. These systems are 
already connected to AHER and electronically accessible to TAHC and 
USDA animal health officials. State systems utilized: TAHC Tag 
Application for NUES tag field distribut ions and Square9 for electronic 
document storage. 
 
During FY2021, TAHC  implemented our state procured private CoreOne 
system for Texas, TexCore. TAHC  transition from CoreOne -SCS to 
CoreOne-TexCore as our primary system, including StateVet, for all LIDs, 
official ID distributions, animal disease programs and movement records.  
TexCore is aligned with established data and communication interfaces to 
ensure continued compatibility. TAHC will continue to share the summary 
data to AHER through the standard connection between the AHER system 
and TexCore. Additionally, TAHC is available during normal business hours 
for sharing of data (not included in AHER) with other state & federal Animal 
Health Officials, law enforcement, and open records requests.

and TexCore. Additionally, TAHC is available during normal business hours 
for sharing of data (not included in AHER) with other state & federal Animal 
Health Officials, law enforcement, and open records requests. 
 
During FY2022, TAHC continued the transition into TexCore. Modifications 
and updates were done to increase the usability of this system.  USDA 
supplied tags were distributed to producers and accredited veterinarians for 
use in replacement cattle. 
 
During FY2023, CVI Central was added. CVI Central provides a single web-
based portal for managing CVI workflows . It is used for both paper and 
electronic certificates. TexCore continued to be updated and USDA supplied 
tag distribution continued. 
 
TAHC is dedicated to data security  and the protection of Texas producers’ 
personal information.  Therefore, TAHC staff are required to complete 
12  
information systems and data security training annually. 
 
TAHC will continue to monitor and report on the administration of official 
identification devices, animal health and movement records in our ADT 
cooperative agreements, quarterly and final accomplishment reports. 
 
The process must be supported and funded by USDA to ensure successful 
compliance by the regulated industries in an equitable and cost -effective 
fashion, and to ensure the successful management and enforcement of the 
same traceability process by the responsible state animal health agencies.

fashion, and to ensure the successful management and enforcement of the 
same traceability process by the responsible state animal health agencies. 
 
2.3 Strengths and Weaknesses 
 
The Texas Animal Health Commission has a long history of working 
productively with the animal agriculture industries in Texas, and in finding 
practical solutions and applying pragmatic regulations. As such, the major 
strength of TAHC is its existing working relationship with those industries 
and people who will be affected by traceability regulations. Secondly, TAHC 
has a well -trained work force with capable field inspectors, a committed 
ADT team, and in -house database development IT management personnel. 
TAHC staff are actively working through the best  traceability solution for 
Texas and are equipped to come up with a workable solution in partnership 
with animal agriculture and other interested partners.  
                                      
Regarding challenges, TAHC faces a continuing challenge to develop 
efficient systems to electronically capture and upload searchable traceability 
data. This includes all records of interstate movement, test charts, as well as 
data migration from existing federal ID databases and integration of 
extensive state-level data. Another challenge exists in the need to educate the 
producers and industries of Texas  regarding the new disease traceability 
approach and ID requirements. Due to Texas’ large variety of livestock 
producers and management practices, a major obstacle is to get everyone on 
the same page and agree to one s ystem. Lastly, TAHC is experiencing a 
number of varied animal health issues  which has redirected resources and 
caused personnel to delay or halt regular job duties (including

approach and ID requirements. Due to Texas’ large variety of livestock 
producers and management practices, a major obstacle is to get everyone on 
the same page and agree to one s ystem. Lastly, TAHC is experiencing a 
number of varied animal health issues  which has redirected resources and 
caused personnel to delay or halt regular job duties (including ADT work) to 
assist with the responses. 
 
2.4 Opportunities and Threats 
 
Texas has a history of significant animal health issues, whether disease or 
natural disaster related. Until August 2011, TAHC maintained extensive first 
point testing ear tag records and drew on these records routinely for disease 
tracing purposes, and for linkage of cattle to owners in natural disasters or 
for law enforcement purposes. There is no doubt that Texas and its partners 
in animal agriculture commerce need an efficient and reliable animal 
traceability system. Without a traceability system, disease tracing and natural 
disaster recovery would become much more difficult and, in many cases,  
unreliable or impossible. Assurance of and linkage of animal ID to cases 
13  
involving animal ownership change and movement are made possible by 
standardized identification and recordation methods.

There are many opportunities to improve and advance our traceability 
systems in Texas. Emerging new technologies which allow for a variety of 
easier, faster, and more effective ways to manage electronically identified 
animals and animal health records throughout all sectors of the livestock 
industry. Additionally, we have opportunities to increase the acceptance and 
use of electronic identification devices, whether it is the availability of no-
cost low frequency tags to vets, the use of ultra -high frequency devices at 
markets, or simply beginning to use electronic official ID tags at all the  
Cattle Fever Tick dipping vats. TAHC is encouraged to hear that some of the 
most reluctant members of the industry are showing increased interest in the 
benefits of traceability. 
 
TAHC is the state-level organization for foreign animal disease response,  a 
responsibility that is not directly shared with any other agency or 
organization. The Governor added TAHC to the State Emergency 
Management Council in 2001, to the Homeland Security Council in 2005, 
and the Critical Infrastructure/Key Resources (CI/KR) Committee in 2006. 
Because of the agency’s expertise in animal health, the chief of the Texas 
Division of Emergency Management designated TAHC as the state’s lead 
agency for all animal issues in emergencies.  With the largest animal 
agriculture industries in the nation, Texas needs disease traceability to avoid

potentially catastrophic animal and economic loss. 
 
2.5 Inventory of existing infrastructure and suitability assessment 
 
• Human Resources 
In fiscal year 2023, TAHC employed five (5) full-time employees in the 
ADT department: (1) ADT Coordinator, (1) ADT Technical Inspector, 
and (3) Customer Service Representatives. Cooperative funding help 
support these positions.  The ADT coordinator is responsible for 
overseeing and coordinating all ADT program activities and projects, in 
the office and in the field, and serves as a signatory official for the ADT 
cooperative agreement and quarterly reports. The coordinator also 
promotes traceability programs across the state at meetings and 
conferences. The ADT  Technical Insp ector works with field staff and 
accredited veterinarians to preform  herd testing, research and pilot 
project management, disease outbreak and trace work, and training on 
the use of ADT equipment such as wands, PDAs, RFID tags, etc. The 
customer service representatives  register premises, answer incoming

TAHC’s Information Technology Services department manages TAHC’s 
resources for connectivity between the offices and the field  and ensures 
agency access to USDA animal disease traceability and animal health 
information databases.  TAHC maintains all previously purchased 
hardware, including computers (desktops, laptops, & handhelds), 
printers, scanners, RFID wand readers, cell phones, and wireless internet 
access, and software, including, p remises location mapping software, 
such as ArcGIS and Google Earth software. ITS also employees a robust 
database development team and is provides advice on best practices 
regarding data management. 
 
• Animal Health Information Resources 
TAHC Program Records department processes all certificates of 
veterinary inspection and issues and monitors Texas entry permit 
programs for domestic and exotic animals and fowl entering Texas from 
other states. Program Records also ensures all traceability  data such as 
animal identifications, owner information,  health certificates, 
vaccination records and test charts are entered into TexCore.  In 2023, 
TAHC began using the application C VI Central, which helps manage 
CVI workflow and streamlines the transmission of animal health data 
electronically to improve the processing time for both electronic and 
paper CVIs.  Program Records is also responsible for maintaining records

IV. TRACEABILITY REQUIREMENTS 
 
4.1 Strategic goals 
 
USDA’s Overarching Goals established in 2018: 
1. Enhance electronic sharing of data among federal and state animal health 
officials, veterinarians and industry; including sharing basic ADT data 
with the federal animal health events repository (AHER); 
2. Increase the use electronic ID tags for animals requiring individual 
identification in order to make the transmission of data more efficient; 
3. Enhance the ability to track animals from birth to slaughter through a 
system that allows tracking data points to be connected; and 
4. Elevate the discussion with States and industry to work toward a system 
where animal health certificates are electronically transmitted from 
private veterinarians to state animal health officials. 
 
TAHC’s ADT Strategic Goals: 
To develop and implement a  statewide infrastructure for advancing animal 
disease traceability in Texas that complies with the federal minimum 
standards established by United States Department of Agriculture.
Text Len: 1713

 work toward a system 
where animal health certificates are electronically transmitted from 
private veterinarians to state animal health officials. 
 
TAHC’s ADT Strategic Goals: 
To develop and implement a  statewide infrastructure for advancing animal 
disease traceability in Texas that complies with the federal minimum 
standards established by United States Department of Agriculture. 
 
To establish traceability systems for species and industries that do not or no 
longer have compliant systems in place, for example beef cattle and cervidae. 
 
4.2  Programmatic goals (Objectives) 
 
TAHC will work cooperatively with USDA APHIS, to the degree possible, 
on activities that will support compliance with the aligned federal regulations 
defined in 9 CFR Part 86 and state regulations 4 Texas Administrative Code 
Chapter 50. Cooperation and high compliance with traceability regulations 
are critical to achieve optimum tracing capabilities. 
 
16  
TAHC will follow protocols and achieve assigned quotas, in accordance with 
USDA provided Guidelines for Administering Traceability Performance  
Measures document, for the administration and completion of National 
Priority Traces (NPTs) to maintain eligibility for reimbursements of 
expenditures. Moreover, TAHC’s goal is to consistently meet or exceed the 
average time it takes to complete the NPTs with no performance concerns 
on our performance report. 
 
The proper administration of official identification devices and documents 
used to help determine interstate movements, in particular Interstate 
Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVIs), is key for capturing accurate 
information needed to achieve successful animal disease traceability. 
TAHC’s goal is to continue to place a priority on activities that will make 
electronic information more readily available, including activities to

 of official identification devices and documents 
used to help determine interstate movements, in particular Interstate 
Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVIs), is key for capturing accurate 
information needed to achieve successful animal disease traceability. 
TAHC’s goal is to continue to place a priority on activities that will make 
electronic information more readily available, including activities to 
support official identification, recordkeeping pertaining to the distribution of 
official ear tags, promotion of radio frequency identification and electronic 
interstate movement documentation. 
 
Objectives, to include, but not limited to: 
• Increase number of registered premises 
• Increase number of animals with official ID 
• Increase use of electronic IDs 
• Increase use of electronic CVIs 
 
Sharing information quickly and effectively will help USDA APHIS and 
state animal health agencies respond to animal disease events and make ADT 
successful. Information systems must be compatible. Therefore, TAHC will 
continue to administer the required data elements in accordance with data 
standards defined in the ADT Technical Specification  document. While  
USDA will not fund information system development, data resulting from 
funded tracing activities will be compatible so it can be shared with other 
animal health officials. 
 
4.3          Animal Disease Traceability Performance Measures 
 
TAHC, in cooperation with the USDA VS staff, will annually administer 
National Priority Traces (NPTs) that reflect tracing capabilities based on the 
defined tracing activities. Compilation of the results across all recipients will 
enable APHIS to determine current traceability values for the TPMs to 
document progress made from the national baseline values and subsequent 
“comparison years” that were established in prior cooperative agreement 
periods.

aces (NPTs) that reflect tracing capabilities based on the 
defined tracing activities. Compilation of the results across all recipients will 
enable APHIS to determine current traceability values for the TPMs to 
document progress made from the national baseline values and subsequent 
“comparison years” that were established in prior cooperative agreement 
periods. The trace activity response times will be reported based o n the 
following four preliminary performance standard measures: 
 
1) Time to report to the State/Tribe of official tagging/identifying of an 
animal in question that has moved interstate. 
2) Time for the State/Tribe of first officially tagging/identifying an 
17  
animal in question that has moved interstate to provide a record of 
the official tag distribution. 
3) Time to report to the State/Tribe from which an animal in question has 
moved interstate. 
4) Time for the State/Tribe from which an animal in question has moved 
interstate to provide the location and contact information from which 
the animal was moved interstate. 
 
ADT personnel are continuing to work closely with USDA VS staff to 
successfully administer traces for the National Priority Traces (NPTs) and 
use Emergency Management Response System-2 (EMRS2) for tracking and 
reporting trace activities. 
 
These performance trace activities measure the time it takes to answer four  
specific questions regarding the allocation of official identification and/or  
interstate movement. The start time is when the State is notified of the  
official identification number, and the end time is when the State finds the  
information to answer the question posed by the activity. Activities 2, 3, &4 
are the most important to complete. Traces for Activity

specific questions regarding the allocation of official identification and/or  
interstate movement. The start time is when the State is notified of the  
official identification number, and the end time is when the State finds the  
information to answer the question posed by the activity. Activities 2, 3, &4 
are the most important to complete. Traces for Activity 1 will be limited to 
Animal Identification Number (AIN) tags as the official animal number. 
Completing trace exercises for cattle is the priority. Trace activities for other 
species may be reported, but they do not count toward the quota for NPTs. 
 
USDA VS personnel will select the appropriate official identification 
number(s) to trace and initiate the NPT in EMRS2. The system will 
automatically send an email notice of NPT creation to an ADT group email 
address. TAHC currently has two ADT staff members with eAuthentication 
Level 2 access assigned to complete the NPTs in the EMRS2 utility. ADT 
personnel work together to coordinate the assignment and completion of the 
NPT activity. ADT staff will conduct extensive searches in traceability 
electronic databases; such as AHER, TexCore, AIMS, etc. If no clear results 
are found, they will conduct searches of paper systems and make phone calls 
to parties involved, if necessary. When the trace is complete, the ADT staff 
will access EMRS2 to document all steps taken in the Key Actions, enter the 
trace information found, upload a copy of the record(s), and close out the 
NPT. 
 
TAHC’s goal is to consistently meet or exceed the average time it takes to 
complete the NPTs with no performance concerns on our performance 
report.

included in the quarterly ADT accomplishment reports. 
 
 
4.4 Data requirements 
 
• A PIN or LID will be assigned to all Texas producers when they provide 
18  
TAHC staff with current and accurate herd owner contact information, 
including but not limited to: owner’s name, mailing address, and phone 
number. 
• Texas will accept all forms of official ID as outlined by USDA standards. 
Texas will not accept brands or tattoos as official ID, unless the animal is 
accompanied with official breed registration documentation. 
• TAHC supports the use of official ID tags to identify all adult cattle prior 
to interstate movement to comply with the federal rule or to be tagged 
within 7 days for intrastate movement. 
• Tags and applicators may be distributed by approved device manufacturers, 
accredited veterinarians, TAHC personnel, or shipped directly to the 
producers, depending on available funds. 
•  TAHC has fully  transitioned from using our own online tag allocation 
reporting application to utilizing Trace First’s TexCore system as our 
primary tag distribution record keeping system for NUES tags. 
• TAHC will continue to use USDA’s AIMS system for AIN distribution 
record keeping.

4.7         Organizational needs 
 
TAHC has an organizational structure in place that will support animal 
disease traceability and all aspects of implementation. 
 
4.7.1 Executive support 
 
TAHC is an animal health agency administered by licensed 
veterinarians. As animal health professionals who handle the realities 
of animal disease on a daily basis, TAHC’s management advocates 
implementation of a practicable animal disease traceability program. 
 
4.7.2 Coordination and oversight procedures 
 
The Texas animal disease traceability working groups are species 
specific and provide valuable guidance and oversight in the continued 
development and implementation of traceability efforts in Texas.  
Originally, the working group was comprised of representatives from 
all various livestock industries and producers. The species -specific 
working groups were implemented to provide more effective and 
focused advancement within their industries.  The working groups 
meet on an as-needed basis. 
 
The compatibility with other states, tribes, territories, and USDA is 
monitored using policy standards, federal minimum standards,  
common data collection practices, standardized reporting and 
program evaluation based off performance measures. 
 
The ADT  department is responsible for coordination and 
implementation of the animal disease traceability  plan, including 
coordination of other agency office and field staff.  Additional 
responsibilities and job duties may be assigned by TAHC’s executive 
director.

4.7.3 Policy 
 
The animal disease traceability program in Texas is governed by the 
existing mandate in the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.056. 
This policy authorizes TAHC to establish and enforce, by 
Commission rule, an animal identification program consistent with 
the Federal program.  The rules proposed and adopted by the 
Commission are legal requirements promulgated by the Commission 
to carry out their mission to protect animal health in Texas. The rules 
of the Commission are found in Title 4, Texas Administrative Code, 
20  
Chapters 31 through 60. 
 
During fiscal year  2013, TAHC adopted new animal disease 
traceability rules, published as a separate chapter to enhance program 
transparency and to incorporate elements in the adopted federal ADT 
rule. Chapter 50: Animal Disease Traceability went into effect on 
Monday, October 7, 2013.  The rule specifically establishes the 
requirements for approved tagging sites. All facilities such as 
livestock markets receiving certain classes of livestock without 
official identification must be designated as an approved tagging site 
or be affiliated with one. 
 
The Commission adopted a new section in Chapter 50: Animal 
Disease Traceability, Cattle Identification and became effective on 
Tuesday, February 4, 2014. This amendment establishes 
identification requirements for adult cattle being sold within the state 
of Texas. The rule states that

 must be designated as an approved tagging site 
or be affiliated with one. 
 
The Commission adopted a new section in Chapter 50: Animal 
Disease Traceability, Cattle Identification and became effective on 
Tuesday, February 4, 2014. This amendment establishes 
identification requirements for adult cattle being sold within the state 
of Texas. The rule states that all adult breeding cattle, except cattle 
going directly to slaughter, shall be permanently identified within 
seven days of change of ownership. Untagged adult cattle have seven 
days after purchase to be delivered to a slaughter facility, resold 
through a livestock market, or have acceptable permanent official 
identification applied. Slaughter type cattle that will be put on  feed 
prior to slaughter shall also be permanently identified within seven 
days of purchase. 
 
Additionally, if any changes are made to the state animal disease 
traceability rules, they will be structured for seamless compliance 
with the federal ADT rule. 
 
4.7.4 Staffing 
 
TAHC personnel are needed to perform essential job duties required 
to carry out program objectives.  The animal disease traceability 
department is responsible for administering/overseeing the program. 
Staff throughout the agency provide support for the program.  
 
Personnel needed to implement program are (at minimum): 
• Program Coordinator 
• Program field support specialist – 1 
• Office administrative support staff – 9 
• Part-time support from staff veterinarians, field inspectors, 
region admins, and IT support specialists 
 
4.7.5 Projected Budget requirements The projected total program costs:

TAHC’s state budget cannot solely financially support the ADT 
program and relies on funding through f ederal cooperative  
agreements. Any reduction in cooperative agreement awarded 
funding will hinder the potential advancement of animal disease 
traceability. 
 
4.7.6 Outreach 
 
TAHC will continue to promote and educate Texas livestock industry 
and stakeholders about advancing animal disease traceability.  
Outreach efforts are made on a daily basis by our field, office, and 
communications staff. ADT staff is available by phone, email, and in 
person to answer questions. TAHC maintains a detailed  ADT 
webpage that is reviewed and updated quarterly, with vital updates 
made as needed. TAHC’s Public Information Office publishes ADT 
focused news releases, electronic newsletters, handouts, fact sheets, 
brochures, and regularly  posts to social media. TAHC field staff

brochures, and regularly  posts to social media. TAHC field staff 
regularly provide in- person contact at livestock markets, special 
sales, rodeos, exhibitions, special events, make ADT presentations 
and work information booths at industry meetings and conferences.  
 
Successful implementation of any plan to advance animal disease 
traceability cannot be achieved without outreach to constituents 
primarily affected by the plan. 
 
 
4.7.6.1     Accredited veterinarians 
Accredited veterinarians are instrumental to the 
traceability framework focusing on the identification 
and interstate movement of livestock, as well as 
transitioning to electronic data capture and submission 
of electronic animal health records. 
• The plan to inform accredited veterinarians of the              
ADT program, requirements, plans for 
implementation and advancement will utilize various 
forms of media, such as: press releases, electronic 
22  
newsletters, handouts, fact sheets, brochures,  social 
media, agency website, agency email, mass mail 
outs, and attend regional conventions and meetings. 
• Since fiscal year 2019, TAHC has conducted 
extensive outreach and education efforts to 
accredited veterinarians to provide information on 
how to transition to electronic official identification, 
electronic data capture equipment,  and reporting 
requirements including how to become an AIN 
device manager.

4.9 Compliance and enforcement of traceability regulations 
 
TAHC office staff monitors premises registrations, tag distributions, tag 
allocation records, disease program documents, movement records, and 
submitted complaints for potential compliance issues. TAHC field staff 
monitors operations, animals, animal movements, documents, and 
submitted complaints for potential compliance issues. All compliance issues 
are reported to TAHC ’s Legal Dep artment to investigate any alleged 
violations and follow up enforcement actions. Possible enforcement actions 
include warning letters, administrative penalties, and criminal actions filed 
with local prosecuting authorities. TAHC records and report the number of 
investigations and enforcement actions  to our AVIC and in the quarterly 
ADT Enforcement Action reports.  
 
Additionally, when TAHC receives returned NUES tags from a distribution 
partner, we will conduct a comparison of all tags issued, reported, and 
returned to ensure accountability for all tags. Also, when an accredited vet 
places multiple orders for RFID tags, TAHC will verify that the tag 
allocation records for previous orders are being reported properly, prior to 
placing additional orders.

II. CURRENT TRACEABILITY SITUATION 
 
2.1 Who are we? 
 
TAHC was founded by the Texas Legislature in 1893 and is charged with 
protecting Texas’ livestock and poultry  “from all contagious or infectious 
diseases of a malignant character.” Today, TAHC remains true to this charge 
while evolving with the times to protect the health and marketability of all 
Texas livestock and poultry.  
 
TAHC has legislative authority to make and enforce regulations to prevent, 
control, and eradicate specific infectious animal diseases which endanger 
livestock and poultry. TAHC regulations are made and adopted by 13 
governor-appointed commissioners who represent the general public, various 
livestock industries, and professions. The commissioners serve staggered 
six-year terms and meet as needed to study the regulatory need s of the 
agency, review public comments on proposed regulation changes, and adopt 
new rules when necessary. 
 
TAHC’s headquarters are in Austin with six region offices strategically 
located across the state so the staff can work more effectively with ranchers, 
livestock markets and slaughter plant personnel, and other livestock industry 
representatives across Texas’ 254 counties. 
 
Texas has unique risks associated with its size and extensive borders. In 
addition to the four US states that boarder Texas, the Texas -Mexico border 
spans approximately 1,248 miles.  Texas also has multiple land ports, 
seaports, and international airports.  
 
In addition to TAHC’s animal health specialists, who have expertise in the

In addition to TAHC’s animal health specialists, who have expertise in the 
Texas animal agriculture industry, to help develop the most efficient animal 
disease traceability program, TAHC uses various animal disease traceability 
working groups , which meet on an as -needed basis . These groups bring 
together representatives and experts from various industries to provide  
species specific valuable guidance and on the  continued development and 
implementation of traceability efforts in Texas.

2.2 Where are we now? 
 
Texas has successfully completed four previous ADT Road Maps. The first 
Texas ADT Road Map plans established the initial development and  
implementation of a basic traceability system and rules during FY2012, 
FY2013, and FY2014. Building on the previous successes the Texas ADT 
Road Map 2 for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017, continued implementation 
of traceability activities and began development of a system for electronic 
capture of ICVI data. For FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020, the  Texas ADT 
Road Map 3 focused on improving the availability and retrieval of 
traceability information, as well as the evaluation of visual versus electronic 
traceability devices and documents.  With the success of the previous four 
ADT Road maps FY2021,  FY2022, and FY2023 concentrated on the 
continued transition to electronic traceability devices and encourage 
paperless reporting.

paperless reporting. 
 
TAHC continues to work with the animal disease traceability cattle working 
group and other industries to find workable solutions and to help develop  
short and long-term plans for the future of animal identification and disease 
traceability in Texas. 
 
Premises Registration Systems 
 
TAHC has continued voluntary premises registration to support the 
administration of location identifiers that adhere to the federal standards. 
ADT staff manages the various premises registration systems, including 
issuing premises identification numbers (P IN)s, location identification 
numbers (LID)s, and scrapie flock identification numbers. Each number is 
nationally unique and recognized. 
 
A national premises identification number (PIN) is a unique number, 
permanently assigned to a physical address where agricultural animals are 
located. Texas utilizes the USDA-APHIS provided Premise Management 
System (PM) to obtain a PIN from the federal allocator.  A PIN consists of 
seven alphanumeric characters, beginning with two leading zeros. To obtain 
a PIN, producers may contact TAHC’s ADT department. The owner’s 
contact and premises information is entered, maintained, and stored 
electronically in PM and hard copy files on-site. 
 
Texas has a state system and process for issuing a location identification 
number (LID).  A LID is assigned to an owner’s contact and operation 
information, which are stored in a state administered CoreOne database  
(TexCore). Only the LID number itself is reported to the federal repository 
system as a valid

-site. 
 
Texas has a state system and process for issuing a location identification 
number (LID).  A LID is assigned to an owner’s contact and operation 
information, which are stored in a state administered CoreOne database  
(TexCore). Only the LID number itself is reported to the federal repository 
system as a valid number. All LIDs start with the state postal abbreviation 
(TX) followed by six random alphanumeric characters, which makes the 
LIDs nationally unique. In most cases, a LID may be used in lieu of a PIN. 
To obtain a LID, producers may contact their local TAHC region office or 
6  
ADT department. 
 
Additionally, ADT staff administers the Scrapie program for sheep and  
goats. They collect producer and flock information over the telephone, assign 
a Scrapie flock identification number, enter the information into SCS-SCR, 
and maintain a scanned file copy of the registration/order form. 
 
Administration of Official Identification Devices 
 
The proper administration of official identification devices and reporting is 
key for capturing accurate information needed to achieve successful animal 
disease traceability. The most commonly used forms of official ID are USDA 
approved Animal Identification Number (AIN) “840” series Radio 
Frequency Identification tags (RFID) and National Uniform Eartagging 
System (NUES) identification metal eartags.  Brucellosis calfhood 
vaccination tags, Swine PIN tags, Scrapie tags, and breed registration 
tattoos/brands (uniquely identifying the animal and accompanied by the 
breed registration paperwork) are also acceptable as official ID. A complete 
list of acceptable official identification devices/methods

 (NUES) identification metal eartags.  Brucellosis calfhood 
vaccination tags, Swine PIN tags, Scrapie tags, and breed registration 
tattoos/brands (uniquely identifying the animal and accompanied by the 
breed registration paperwork) are also acceptable as official ID. A complete 
list of acceptable official identification devices/methods is posted on 
TAHC’s website and updated regularly. Producers are encouraged to contact 
their veterinarian or TAHC to determine which method of tagging will be 
best for their operation. 
 
AIN - RFID tags 
AIN device manufacturers and managers may  distribute approved AIN 
devices to producers and are responsible for entering tag distribution 
records into the Animal Identification Management System (AIMS). All 
recipients of AIN devices must first have a LID or PIN and provide that 
number to the distributor for proper reporting. ADT staff are available to 
register premises, process address exceptions, and issue the allocated 
PINs and/or LIDs. Additionally, TAHC r egion office staff can  register 
premises and issue LIDs. Producers with a valid PIN or LID are 
encouraged to purchase official identification from an USDA approved 
tagging manufacturer or supplier. TAHC will provide or direct producers 
to the complete list of approved AIN devices and tag manufacturers’ 
information maintained on the USDA traceability website. 
 
TAHC will continue to promote and support the use of electronic 
identification. By the end of FY2019, TAHC successfully transitioned to 
only using electronic identification for regulatory and disease program 
work by all TAHC field personnel.  TAHC may use ADT cooperative  
agreement funds to purchase additional AIN RFID tags and RFID device

TAHC will continue to promote and support the use of electronic 
identification. By the end of FY2019, TAHC successfully transitioned to 
only using electronic identification for regulatory and disease program 
work by all TAHC field personnel.  TAHC may use ADT cooperative  
agreement funds to purchase additional AIN RFID tags and RFID device 
applicators. In addition, TAHC may supply AIN RFID tags to producers 
with a valid PIN or LID, if supplies are available and only on a case-by-
case basis. TAHC’s ADT department is responsible for overseeing the 
management of all official ID devices distributed and/or applied by the 
agency. TAHC region office staff will collect all official ID allocation 
7  
records from field staff, enter the data into TexCore, and report official 
ID distributions to TAHC ’s ADT department. Tag distribution records 
for official AIN devices are entered and maintained in AIMS by ADT 
staff. 
 
After RFID tags are applied to the animals, the RFID devices can  be 
scanned and read by standard ISO compliant readers. Electronic readers 
are available for purchase by animal health agencies, markets, operations, 
and producers from the manufacturers. TAHC field personnel  regularly 
use handheld readers, wands, and stationary readers paired with handheld 
PDAs and laptops to electronically capture the animal identification 
numbers and upload the data into the appropriate systems  using MIMS; 
while conducting testing, disease response, trace work, and assisting with 
livestock identification. Funds will be used to purchase electronic readers 
with accessories for TAHC field personnel and accredited vets, as part of 
our technology equipment refresh and to increase infrastructure.

with accessories for TAHC field personnel and accredited vets, as part of 
our technology equipment refresh and to increase infrastructure. 
 
Accredited Veterinarians and Cattle Producers 
In order to expand the use of RFID devices, USDA will offer free AIN-
840 low frequency RFID white and orange OCV  tags to states for 
accredited veterinarians and cattle producers for use  on replacement 
breeding cattle. The complimentary RFID tags are used as an alternative 
to silver metal “ Brite” tags and orange metal Official Calfhood 
Vaccination (OCV) tags. Though the metal clip tags have served a 
valuable purpose in disease control and eradication programs, RFID 
devices provide state animal health officials and the cattle industries 
increased ability to accurately and quickly trace animals exposed to or 
infected with potentially devastating diseases before they can  do 
substantial damage to the U.S. livestock and consumer markets. 
 
Texas accredited veterinarians and cattle producers that are interested in 
receiving official RFID tags at no-cost may submit their  requests to 
TAHC’s ADT department. TAHC will fill the requests for these devices 
from the supply given by USDA. The tags will  be distributed to field 
offices, accredited vets, producers,  or operations that are eligible to 
receive these official id devices at no -cost. These no- cost official id 
devices will be shipped directly from TAHC supply. The shipping costs 
for devices redistributed from TAHC will be paid for with cooperative

 given by USDA. The tags will  be distributed to field 
offices, accredited vets, producers,  or operations that are eligible to 
receive these official id devices at no -cost. These no- cost official id 
devices will be shipped directly from TAHC supply. The shipping costs 
for devices redistributed from TAHC will be paid for with cooperative 
funds, any overages will be covered by state funding. 
 
Accredited Veterinarians are required to maintain records and report all 
official ID devices distributed and/or applied, using one of the following 
methods: record and submit identification data on an official animal 
health record (test record, vaccination chart, or ICVI) for data entry into 
8  
TexCore; vets who are AIN Device Managers may enter AIN distribution 
records directly into AIMs; or report official ID distribution records to 
TAHC’s ADT department for data entry into AIMS. 
 
Livestock Marketing Facilities 
TAHC recommends that producers/buyers contact their local livestock 
market/auction barn to determine current requirements and available 
options for livestock identification. Some animals may be required to be 
officially identified prior to or after purchase to comply with the ADT, 
disease program, or regulatory requirements. 
 
Livestock marketing facilities are not required to report tag distribution  
records for livestock tagged at the market . As part of a separate TAHC 
rule, livestock marketing facilities are required to keep certain dealer 
records for a minimum of five years and to make the records available 
for inspection by TAHC representatives. TAHC Market Inspectors report 
all tag sequence allocations to region offices, which are then entered into 
TexCore. Dealer records are to include records

 the market . As part of a separate TAHC 
rule, livestock marketing facilities are required to keep certain dealer 
records for a minimum of five years and to make the records available 
for inspection by TAHC representatives. TAHC Market Inspectors report 
all tag sequence allocations to region offices, which are then entered into 
TexCore. Dealer records are to include records of individual animal 
identification numbers, plus consignor and consignee contact 
information for animals sold. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites 
All facilities such as livestock markets receiving certain classes of 
livestock without official identification must be designated as an 
approved tagging site by agreement. The purpose of this agreement is to 
maintain integrity and control of application of official eartags at  an 
approved tagging site, where livestock may be officially identified on 
behalf of the owner or person in possession, care or control of the animals 
when they are brought to the facility. Animals requiring official 
identification may  be moved to these sites without prior official 
identification, provided the site can maintain the individual identity of 
animals until they are officially identified. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites can order RFID  tags in increments of 1 00 by

officially identify all animals in accordance with 9 CFR 86 and 4 TAC 
§50.2, including: 
• Officially identify animals required to be identified before 
commingling with animals from different premises or use a backtag 
or other method to accurately maintain the animal's identity until the 
official ear tag is applied. The official identification can then be 
correlated to the person responsible for shipping the animal.

• Only apply official eartags to animals not already officially 
identified, (except as provided in 9 CFR 86.4(c)); and 
• Do not remove official identification devices unless authorized by an 
animal health official. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites must submit records of tag application within 
9  
30 days if requested by TAHC personnel. The report must include, at a 
minimum: The name, physical address, city, state and zip code of the 
owner or person responsible for animals tagged; the official identification 
numbers of the  tags applied associated with the  owner or person 
responsible for the animals; and the date the official identification eartags 
were applied. 
 
Approved Tagging Sites must maintain records of official identification 
eartags received and applied for a minimum of five years. Also, maintain 
an accurate inventory of official eartags and application records in a 
secure place accessible only to tag applicator personnel. Any lost or 
stolen tags must be immediately reported to Texas animal health officials. 
 
Swine PIN tags 
Producers requesting Swine PIN tags must first have a premises ID 
number (PIN), as the PIN is imprinted on the tags. ADT staff will register 
the premises over the phone and provide the allocated PIN number. The 
Swine PIN tags are available for purchase from an USDA approved 
tagging manufacturer or supplier. TAHC will provide or direct producers

Swine PIN tags are available for purchase from an USDA approved 
tagging manufacturer or supplier. TAHC will provide or direct producers 
to the list of official PIN tags for slaughter swine and their  approved tag 
manufacturers’ information maintained on the USDA traceability 
website. 
 
TAHC will use ADT cooperative agreement funds to purchase Swine 
PIN tags and applicators for animal disease regulatory work. These tags 
will be registered to and imprinted with the PIN for TAHC ’s central 
office. These tags are only distributed to TAHC region offices to be used 
by TAHC field staff when conducting swine testing.  The initial tag  
distributions from the central office to the region offices are entered and 
maintained in TexCore. When applied to the animal, the tag allocations 
are reported on the swine test charts and submitted to TAHC  region 
offices for data entry. 
 
Scrapie tags 
USDA-APHIS announced nationwide identification and recordkeeping 
requirements for sheep and goats on March 25, 2019 as part of the 
National Scrapie Eradication Program. USDA-APHIS believes the final 
rule will result in a more effective disease eradication program. The rule 
provides a more flexible approach to disease investigations and affected 
flock management, and more consistent animal identification and 
recordkeeping requirements between sheep and goats. Under this rule, all 
sheep and goats must have official identification (I.D.) when moving off 
their premises of origin, unless specifically exempt.

flock management, and more consistent animal identification and 
recordkeeping requirements between sheep and goats. Under this rule, all 
sheep and goats must have official identification (I.D.) when moving off 
their premises of origin, unless specifically exempt. 
 
Acceptable forms of official identification include plastic or metal 
Scrapie flock ID tags, Scrapie 840 RFID ear tags, and plastic or metal 
serial tags. Registered tattoos and 840 electronic implants are accepted 
10  
as official ID with the exception of sheep and goats that are in slaughter 
channels or moving through a livestock market or buying station. 
 
The national Scrapie Program hotline forwards the phone calls of Texas 
breeders, dealers, and livestock markets to TAHC’s ADT department. 
ADT staff will register the flocks/operations for a Scrapie flock 
identification number or verify their existing Scrapie flock ID number. 
TAHC will provide the caller with the information on how to purchase 
the official ID devices. For producers, dealers, and markets eligible to 
receive free tags, TAHC will place the order into AIMS. Scrapie flock 
and serial tags ordered through AIMS will be shipped directly to the 
recipient and the tag allocation entered into AIMS by the tagging 
manufacturers. 
 
TAHC will order Scrapie serial tags and applicators for the ADT 
department and region offices. TAHC may supply a very limited amount 
of these Scrapie serial tags to producers with a valid Scrapie flock ID 
number, if supplies are available and, on a case-by-case basis. The most

TAHC will order Scrapie serial tags and applicators for the ADT 
department and region offices. TAHC may supply a very limited amount 
of these Scrapie serial tags to producers with a valid Scrapie flock ID 
number, if supplies are available and, on a case-by-case basis. The most 
common reason for TAHC to issue Scrapie serial tags is for sheep or 
goats going to a show or out of state within the two weeks, in other words, 
needed sooner than the time it takes for flock ID tags to be ordered, 
produced, and shipped. ADT staff will enter these tag allocations into 
AIMS. 
 
Animal Health and Movement Records 
 
TAHC maintains various other traceability data sources by continuing to 
collect and store identification data required for testing, movement, change 
of ownership, and other applicable animal health disease programs.  These 
include but are not limited to data collected and/or stored from interstate and 
intrastate certificates of veterinary inspection (ICVIs), bovine brucellosis and 
tuberculosis test charts, brucellosis vaccination records, scrapie tag 
distribution, and interstate permits. 
 
As outlined in the previous Road Maps, TAHC has continued to focus on the 
electronic data capture, the promotion and transition from paper to electronic 
documentation. During FY2014, TAHC IT Development Team completed 
the development of a TAHC eCVI and put a link to a new application on 
TAHC’s website. The application enables Texas veterinarians  to purchase 
eCVIs online. The Health Certificate webpage on the agency’s website, 
displays all the ICVI purchasing options (electronic and paper).

displays all the ICVI purchasing options (electronic and paper).  TAHC’s 
eCVI online application continues to work as expected and veterinarians are 
successfully utilizing the tool. TAHC staff is continuing to monitor all CVIs 
and eCVIs for data quality and compliance. Starting in FY2016, TAHC 
contracted with Trace First to utilize StateVet.com for the data entry and 
upload of ICVI data into SCS, for cattle with official identificatio n moving 
interstate. Additionally, at the end of the FY2016 cooperative year, TAHC 
Program Records and ADT staff started using document management 
11  
software, Square 9, to begin scanning all paper and electronic interstate CVIs, 
for all species with or without official identification, into an electronically 
searchable system. The emphasis placed on transitioning from a primarily 
paper-based system to electronic capture of CVI data has resulted in 
significant improvements in traceability and completion of trace 
performance exercises. 
 
During FY2019 and FY2020, TAHC worked with VS and Palantir staff to 
implement use of DIS-AHER, including establishing access, user training for 
staff, identification of data sources, verifying compatibility, initiating 
electronic information sharing of summary data, and pilot testing DIS for 
FY2020 ADT Cooperative Agreement work plans and quarterly reporting.

FY2020 ADT Cooperative Agreement work plans and quarterly reporting. 
 
ADT data collected in Texas is entered and stored in a mixture of state and 
USDA maintained standardized animal health systems. Federal systems 
utilized: AHER for data searches, SCR for Scrapie Flock IDs, EMRS2 for 
NPTs and Response records . MIMS for electronic data captured in field, 
Premise Management for Premises IDs, AIMS for AIN and Scrapie official 
ID distributions. Texcore for issuing LIDs, including StateVet for official ID 
distribution, regulatory program and movement records. These systems are 
already connected to AHER and electronically accessible to TAHC and 
USDA animal health officials. State systems utilized: TAHC Tag 
Application for NUES tag field distribut ions and Square9 for electronic 
document storage. 
 
During FY2021, TAHC  implemented our state procured private CoreOne 
system for Texas, TexCore. TAHC  transition from CoreOne -SCS to 
CoreOne-TexCore as our primary system, including StateVet, for all LIDs, 
official ID distributions, animal disease programs and movement records.  
TexCore is aligned with established data and communication interfaces to 
ensure continued compatibility. TAHC will continue to share the summary 
data to AHER through the standard connection between the AHER system 
and TexCore. Additionally, TAHC is available during normal business hours 
for sharing of data (not included in AHER) with other state & federal Animal 
Health Officials, law enforcement, and open records requests.

Health Officials, law enforcement, and open records requests. 
 
During FY2022, TAHC continued the transition into TexCore. Modifications 
and updates were done to increase the usability of this system.  USDA 
supplied tags were distributed to producers and accredited veterinarians for 
use in replacement cattle. 
 
During FY2023, CVI Central was added. CVI Central provides a single web-
based portal for managing CVI workflows . It is used for both paper and 
electronic certificates. TexCore continued to be updated and USDA supplied 
tag distribution continued. 
 
TAHC is dedicated to data security  and the protection of Texas producers’ 
personal information.  Therefore, TAHC staff are required to complete 
12  
information systems and data security training annually. 
 
TAHC will continue to monitor and report on the administration of official 
identification devices, animal health and movement records in our ADT 
cooperative agreements, quarterly and final accomplishment reports. 
 
The process must be supported and funded by USDA to ensure successful 
compliance by the regulated industries in an equitable and cost -effective 
fashion, and to ensure the successful management and enforcement of the 
same traceability process by the responsible state animal health agencies.

fashion, and to ensure the successful management and enforcement of the 
same traceability process by the responsible state animal health agencies. 
 
2.3 Strengths and Weaknesses 
 
The Texas Animal Health Commission has a long history of working 
productively with the animal agriculture industries in Texas, and in finding 
practical solutions and applying pragmatic regulations. As such, the major 
strength of TAHC is its existing working relationship with those industries 
and people who will be affected by traceability regulations. Secondly, TAHC 
has a well -trained work force with capable field inspectors, a committed 
ADT team, and in -house database development IT management personnel. 
TAHC staff are actively working through the best  traceability solution for 
Texas and are equipped to come up with a workable solution in partnership 
with animal agriculture and other interested partners.  
                                      
Regarding challenges, TAHC faces a continuing challenge to develop 
efficient systems to electronically capture and upload searchable traceability 
data. This includes all records of interstate movement, test charts, as well as 
data migration from existing federal ID databases and integration of 
extensive state-level data. Another challenge exists in the need to educate the 
producers and industries of Texas  regarding the new disease traceability 
approach and ID requirements. Due to Texas’ large variety of livestock 
producers and management practices, a major obstacle is to get everyone on 
the same page and agree to one s ystem. Lastly, TAHC is experiencing a 
number of varied animal health issues  which has redirected resources and 
caused personnel to delay or halt regular job duties (including

approach and ID requirements. Due to Texas’ large variety of livestock 
producers and management practices, a major obstacle is to get everyone on 
the same page and agree to one s ystem. Lastly, TAHC is experiencing a 
number of varied animal health issues  which has redirected resources and 
caused personnel to delay or halt regular job duties (including ADT work) to 
assist with the responses. 
 
2.4 Opportunities and Threats 
 
Texas has a history of significant animal health issues, whether disease or 
natural disaster related. Until August 2011, TAHC maintained extensive first 
point testing ear tag records and drew on these records routinely for disease 
tracing purposes, and for linkage of cattle to owners in natural disasters or 
for law enforcement purposes. There is no doubt that Texas and its partners 
in animal agriculture commerce need an efficient and reliable animal 
traceability system. Without a traceability system, disease tracing and natural 
disaster recovery would become much more difficult and, in many cases,  
unreliable or impossible. Assurance of and linkage of animal ID to cases 
13  
involving animal ownership change and movement are made possible by 
standardized identification and recordation methods.         
                                                                                                                  
Text Len: 1375

There are many opportunities to improve and advance our traceability 
systems in Texas. Emerging new technologies which allow for a variety of 
easier, faster, and more effective ways to manage electronically identified 
animals and animal health records throughout all sectors of the livestock 
industry. Additionally, we have opportunities to increase the acceptance and 
use of electronic identification devices, whether it is the availability of no-
cost low frequency tags to vets, the use of ultra -high frequency devices at 
markets, or simply beginning to use electronic official ID tags at all the  
Cattle Fever Tick dipping vats. TAHC is encouraged to hear that some of the 
most reluctant members of the industry are showing increased interest in the 
benefits of traceability. 
 
TAHC is the state-level organization for foreign animal disease response,  a 
responsibility that is not directly shared with any other agency or 
organization. The Governor added TAHC to the State Emergency 
Management Council in 2001, to the Homeland Security Council in 2005, 
and the Critical Infrastructure/Key Resources (CI/KR) Committee in 2006. 
Because of the agency’s expertise in animal health, the chief of the Texas 
Division of Emergency Management designated TAHC as the state’s lead 
agency for all animal issues in emergencies.  With the largest animal 
agriculture industries in the nation, Texas needs disease traceability to avoid

2.5 Inventory of existing infrastructure and suitability assessment 
 
• Human Resources 
In fiscal year 2023, TAHC employed five (5) full-time employees in the 
ADT department: (1) ADT Coordinator, (1) ADT Technical Inspector, 
and (3) Customer Service Representatives. Cooperative funding help 
support these positions.  The ADT coordinator is responsible for 
overseeing and coordinating all ADT program activities and projects, in 
the office and in the field, and serves as a signatory official for the ADT 
cooperative agreement and quarterly reports. The coordinator also 
promotes traceability programs across the state at meetings and 
conferences. The ADT  Technical Insp ector works with field staff and 
accredited veterinarians to preform  herd testing, research and pilot 
project management, disease outbreak and trace work, and training on 
the use of ADT equipment such as wands, PDAs, RFID tags, etc. The 
customer service representatives  register premises, answer incoming 
phone calls, answer questions about the ADT program, manage tag 
allocations, perform official ID traces, conduct the daily business within 
the office, assist in trainings, equipment demonstrations, and support in 
the field.

• Technology and Equipment 
TAHC’s Information Technology Services department manages TAHC’s 
resources for connectivity between the offices and the field  and ensures 
agency access to USDA animal disease traceability and animal health 
information databases.  TAHC maintains all previously purchased 
hardware, including computers (desktops, laptops, & handhelds), 
printers, scanners, RFID wand readers, cell phones, and wireless internet 
access, and software, including, p remises location mapping software, 
such as ArcGIS and Google Earth software. ITS also employees a robust 
database development team and is provides advice on best practices 
regarding data management. 
 
• Animal Health Information Resources 
TAHC Program Records department processes all certificates of 
veterinary inspection and issues and monitors Texas entry permit 
programs for domestic and exotic animals and fowl entering Texas from 
other states. Program Records also ensures all traceability  data such as 
animal identifications, owner information,  health certificates, 
vaccination records and test charts are entered into TexCore.  In 2023, 
TAHC began using the application C VI Central, which helps manage 
CVI workflow and streamlines the transmission of animal health data 
electronically to improve the processing time for both electronic and 
paper CVIs.  Program Records is also responsible for maintaining records

IV. TRACEABILITY REQUIREMENTS 
 
4.1 Strategic goals 
 
USDA’s Overarching Goals established in 2018: 
1. Enhance electronic sharing of data among federal and state animal health 
officials, veterinarians and industry; including sharing basic ADT data 
with the federal animal health events repository (AHER); 
2. Increase the use electronic ID tags for animals requiring individual 
identification in order to make the transmission of data more efficient; 
3. Enhance the ability to track animals from birth to slaughter through a 
system that allows tracking data points to be connected; and 
4. Elevate the discussion with States and industry to work toward a system 
where animal health certificates are electronically transmitted from 
private veterinarians to state animal health officials. 
 
TAHC’s ADT Strategic Goals: 
To develop and implement a  statewide infrastructure for advancing animal 
disease traceability in Texas that complies with the federal minimum 
standards established by United States Department of Agriculture.

TAHC’s ADT Strategic Goals: 
To develop and implement a  statewide infrastructure for advancing animal 
disease traceability in Texas that complies with the federal minimum 
standards established by United States Department of Agriculture. 
 
To establish traceability systems for species and industries that do not or no 
longer have compliant systems in place, for example beef cattle and cervidae. 
 
4.2  Programmatic goals (Objectives) 
 
TAHC will work cooperatively with USDA APHIS, to the degree possible, 
on activities that will support compliance with the aligned federal regulations 
defined in 9 CFR Part 86 and state regulations 4 Texas Administrative Code 
Chapter 50. Cooperation and high compliance with traceability regulations 
are critical to achieve optimum tracing capabilities. 
 
16  
TAHC will follow protocols and achieve assigned quotas, in accordance with 
USDA provided Guidelines for Administering Traceability Performance  
Measures document, for the administration and completion of National 
Priority Traces (NPTs) to maintain eligibility for reimbursements of 
expenditures. Moreover, TAHC’s goal is to consistently meet or exceed the 
average time it takes to complete the NPTs with no performance concerns 
on our performance report. 
 
The proper administration of official identification devices and documents 
used to help determine interstate movements, in particular Interstate 
Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVIs), is key for capturing accurate 
information needed to achieve successful animal disease traceability. 
TAHC’s goal is to continue to place a priority on activities that will make 
electronic information more readily available, including activities to

 of official identification devices and documents 
used to help determine interstate movements, in particular Interstate 
Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVIs), is key for capturing accurate 
information needed to achieve successful animal disease traceability. 
TAHC’s goal is to continue to place a priority on activities that will make 
electronic information more readily available, including activities to 
support official identification, recordkeeping pertaining to the distribution of 
official ear tags, promotion of radio frequency identification and electronic 
interstate movement documentation. 
 
Objectives, to include, but not limited to: 
• Increase number of registered premises 
• Increase number of animals with official ID 
• Increase use of electronic IDs 
• Increase use of electronic CVIs 
 
Sharing information quickly and effectively will help USDA APHIS and 
state animal health agencies respond to animal disease events and make ADT 
successful. Information systems must be compatible. Therefore, TAHC will 
continue to administer the required data elements in accordance with data 
standards defined in the ADT Technical Specification  document. While  
USDA will not fund information system development, data resulting from 
funded tracing activities will be compatible so it can be shared with other 
animal health officials. 
 
4.3          Animal Disease Traceability Performance Measures 
 
TAHC, in cooperation with the USDA VS staff, will annually administer 
National Priority Traces (NPTs) that reflect tracing capabilities based on the 
defined tracing activities. Compilation of the results across all recipients will 
enable APHIS to determine current traceability values for the TPMs to 
document progress made from the national baseline values and subsequent 
“comparison years” that were established in prior cooperative agreement 
periods.

aces (NPTs) that reflect tracing capabilities based on the 
defined tracing activities. Compilation of the results across all recipients will 
enable APHIS to determine current traceability values for the TPMs to 
document progress made from the national baseline values and subsequent 
“comparison years” that were established in prior cooperative agreement 
periods. The trace activity response times will be reported based o n the 
following four preliminary performance standard measures: 
 
1) Time to report to the State/Tribe of official tagging/identifying of an 
animal in question that has moved interstate. 
2) Time for the State/Tribe of first officially tagging/identifying an 
17  
animal in question that has moved interstate to provide a record of 
the official tag distribution. 
3) Time to report to the State/Tribe from which an animal in question has 
moved interstate. 
4) Time for the State/Tribe from which an animal in question has moved 
interstate to provide the location and contact information from which 
the animal was moved interstate. 
 
ADT personnel are continuing to work closely with USDA VS staff to 
successfully administer traces for the National Priority Traces (NPTs) and 
use Emergency Management Response System-2 (EMRS2) for tracking and 
reporting trace activities. 
 
These performance trace activities measure the time it takes to answer four  
specific questions regarding the allocation of official identification and/or  
interstate movement. The start time is when the State is notified of the  
official identification number, and the end time is when the State finds the  
information to answer the question posed by the activity. Activities 2, 3, &4 
are the most important to complete. Traces for Activity

specific questions regarding the allocation of official identification and/or  
interstate movement. The start time is when the State is notified of the  
official identification number, and the end time is when the State finds the  
information to answer the question posed by the activity. Activities 2, 3, &4 
are the most important to complete. Traces for Activity 1 will be limited to 
Animal Identification Number (AIN) tags as the official animal number. 
Completing trace exercises for cattle is the priority. Trace activities for other 
species may be reported, but they do not count toward the quota for NPTs. 
 
USDA VS personnel will select the appropriate official identification 
number(s) to trace and initiate the NPT in EMRS2. The system will 
automatically send an email notice of NPT creation to an ADT group email 
address. TAHC currently has two ADT staff members with eAuthentication 
Level 2 access assigned to complete the NPTs in the EMRS2 utility. ADT 
personnel work together to coordinate the assignment and completion of the 
NPT activity. ADT staff will conduct extensive searches in traceability 
electronic databases; such as AHER, TexCore, AIMS, etc. If no clear results 
are found, they will conduct searches of paper systems and make phone calls 
to parties involved, if necessary. When the trace is complete, the ADT staff 
will access EMRS2 to document all steps taken in the Key Actions, enter the 
trace information found, upload a copy of the record(s), and close out the 
NPT. 
 
TAHC’s goal is to consistently meet or exceed the average time it takes to 
complete the NPTs with no performance concerns on our performance 
report.

included in the quarterly ADT accomplishment reports. 
 
 
4.4 Data requirements 
 
• A PIN or LID will be assigned to all Texas producers when they provide 
18  
TAHC staff with current and accurate herd owner contact information, 
including but not limited to: owner’s name, mailing address, and phone 
number. 
• Texas will accept all forms of official ID as outlined by USDA standards. 
Texas will not accept brands or tattoos as official ID, unless the animal is 
accompanied with official breed registration documentation. 
• TAHC supports the use of official ID tags to identify all adult cattle prior 
to interstate movement to comply with the federal rule or to be tagged

4.7         Organizational needs 
 
TAHC has an organizational structure in place that will support animal 
disease traceability and all aspects of implementation. 
 
4.7.1 Executive support 
 
TAHC is an animal health agency administered by licensed 
veterinarians. As animal health professionals who handle the realities 
of animal disease on a daily basis, TAHC’s management advocates 
implementation of a practicable animal disease traceability program. 
 
4.7.2 Coordination and oversight procedures 
 
The Texas animal disease traceability working groups are species 
specific and provide valuable guidance and oversight in the continued 
development and implementation of traceability efforts in Texas.  
Originally, the working group was comprised of representatives from 
all various livestock industries and producers. The species -specific 
working groups were implemented to provide more effective and 
focused advancement within their industries.  The working groups 
meet on an as-needed basis. 
 
The compatibility with other states, tribes, territories, and USDA is 
monitored using policy standards, federal minimum standards,  
common data collection practices, standardized reporting and 
program evaluation based off performance measures. 
 
The ADT  department is responsible for coordination and 
implementation of the animal disease traceability  plan, including 
coordination of other agency office and field staff.  Additional 
responsibilities and job duties may be assigned by TAHC’s executive 
director.

implementation of the animal disease traceability  plan, including 
coordination of other agency office and field staff.  Additional 
responsibilities and job duties may be assigned by TAHC’s executive 
director. 
 
 
 
4.7.3 Policy 
 
The animal disease traceability program in Texas is governed by the 
existing mandate in the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.056. 
This policy authorizes TAHC to establish and enforce, by 
Commission rule, an animal identification program consistent with 
the Federal program.  The rules proposed and adopted by the 
Commission are legal requirements promulgated by the Commission 
to carry out their mission to protect animal health in Texas. The rules 
of the Commission are found in Title 4, Texas Administrative Code, 
20  
Chapters 31 through 60. 
 
During fiscal year  2013, TAHC adopted new animal disease 
traceability rules, published as a separate chapter to enhance program 
transparency and to incorporate elements in the adopted federal ADT 
rule. Chapter 50: Animal Disease Traceability went into effect on 
Monday, October 7, 2013.  The rule specifically establishes the 
requirements for approved tagging sites. All facilities such as 
livestock markets receiving certain classes of livestock without 
official identification must be designated as an approved tagging site 
or be affiliated with one. 
 
The Commission adopted a new section in Chapter 50: Animal 
Disease Traceability, Cattle Identification and became effective on 
Tuesday, February 4, 2014. This amendment establishes 
identification requirements for adult cattle being sold within the state 
of Texas. The rule states that

The Commission adopted a new section in Chapter 50: Animal 
Disease Traceability, Cattle Identification and became effective on 
Tuesday, February 4, 2014. This amendment establishes 
identification requirements for adult cattle being sold within the state 
of Texas. The rule states that all adult breeding cattle, except cattle 
going directly to slaughter, shall be permanently identified within 
seven days of change of ownership. Untagged adult cattle have seven 
days after purchase to be delivered to a slaughter facility, resold 
through a livestock market, or have acceptable permanent official 
identification applied. Slaughter type cattle that will be put on  feed 
prior to slaughter shall also be permanently identified within seven 
days of purchase. 
 
Additionally, if any changes are made to the state animal disease 
traceability rules, they will be structured for seamless compliance 
with the federal ADT rule. 
 
4.7.4 Staffing 
 
TAHC personnel are needed to perform essential job duties required 
to carry out program objectives.  The animal disease traceability 
department is responsible for administering/overseeing the program. 
Staff throughout the agency provide support for the program.  
 
Personnel needed to implement program are (at minimum): 
• Program Coordinator 
• Program field support specialist – 1 
• Office administrative support staff – 9 
• Part-time support from staff veterinarians, field inspectors, 
region admins, and IT support specialists 
 
4.7.5 Projected Budget requirements The projected total program costs: 
 
 
 FY2024 FY2025 FY2026

TAHC’s state budget cannot solely financially support the ADT 
program and relies on funding through f ederal cooperative  
agreements. Any reduction in cooperative agreement awarded 
funding will hinder the potential advancement of animal disease 
traceability. 
 
4.7.6 Outreach 
 
TAHC will continue to promote and educate Texas livestock industry 
and stakeholders about advancing animal disease traceability.  
Outreach efforts are made on a daily basis by our field, office, and 
communications staff. ADT staff is available by phone, email, and in 
person to answer questions. TAHC maintains a detailed  ADT 
webpage that is reviewed and updated quarterly, with vital updates 
made as needed. TAHC’s Public Information Office publishes ADT 
focused news releases, electronic newsletters, handouts, fact sheets, 
brochures, and regularly  posts to social media. TAHC field staff

4.8  Monitoring and reporting interstate movement activity 
 
The traceability framework is focused on interstate movement and the 
accompanying ICVI or similar documentation for that movement. 
• ICVIs will be monitored for data quality and compliance. 
• The number of animals and the number of shipments that move 
interstate will be monitored and verified by a monthly inspection of all 
paper and electronic ICVIs. The number of documents and animals are 
calculated at the end of each month by program records and information 
technology staff. 
• The number of paper ICVIs, electronic ICVIs, and category II accredited 
veterinarians using electronic ICVIs are calculated at the end of each 
month by TAHC staff. 
• The volume of official identification devices issued by TAHC  is 
compiled by ADT staff and is reported in

4.9 Compliance and enforcement of traceability regulations 
 
TAHC office staff monitors premises registrations, tag distributions, tag 
allocation records, disease program documents, movement records, and 
submitted complaints for potential compliance issues. TAHC field staff 
monitors operations, animals, animal movements, documents, and 
submitted complaints for potential compliance issues. All compliance issues 
are reported to TAHC ’s Legal Dep artment to investigate any alleged 
violations and follow up enforcement actions. Possible enforcement actions 
include warning letters, administrative penalties, and criminal actions filed 
with local prosecuting authorities. TAHC records and report the number of 
investigations and enforcement actions  to our AVIC and in the quarterly 
ADT Enforcement Action reports.  
 
Additionally, when TAHC receives returned NUES tags from a distribution 
partner, we will conduct a comparison of all tags issued, reported, and 
returned to ensure accountability for all tags. Also, when an accredited vet 
places multiple orders for RFID tags, TAHC will verify that the tag 
allocation records for previous orders are being reported properly, prior to 
placing additional orders.
