Trichomanes speciosumWilld. - Killarney Fern  -Hymenophyllaceae© Stan Beesley© Graham Day(Map updated: March 2008)This fern, like other ferns, has two stages to its life-cycle. The typical fern-like stage is the sporophyte and is very rare, being known from one site in Northern Ireland: a cave near the coast in NE Antrim. Formerly the plant was common about Killarney (whence its English name) but over-collecting by gardeners and botanists in the 19th century all but exterminated it there. The other stage is the gametophyte which is like a filamentous green alga, and appears to be commoner. It is known from a number of sites in Co Fermanagh, all found since 1993.All names:Trichomanes speciosumWilld.;Trichomanes andrewsiiNewm.;Trichomanes radicansauct.NBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
