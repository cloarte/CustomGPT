The microconidia are borne in false heads on short monophialides and are single celled or one-septate, oval, elliptical or kidney-shaped, and measure 5-20 x 2-3.5 µm. Macroconidia are fusiform-falcate in shape, three- to five-septate and 27-48 x 2.5-4.5 µm, with a foot-shaped basal cell and a curved, pointed apical cell, and are borne on monophialides on branched or unbranched conidiophores (Booth and Waterson, 1964;Booth, 1971). Macroconidia may be produced in orange sporodochia or from monophialides on hyphae. Chlamydospores are formed singly or in pairs and are roughly spherical in shape, 7-13 µm in diameter, with a thick wall. In PDA, brown, blue or black sclerotia may be formed by some isolates (Leslie and Summerell, 2006).F. oxysporumf.sp.vasinfectumcannot be morphologically distinguished from otherformae speciales.

prophyte that can remain dormant in the soil for long periods in the form of chlamydospores. The fungus is spread locally when soil carrying chlamydospores is moved from one field to another on farm implements and crop residues, or by water from flooding or furrow-irrigation. Spores in the soil germinate when fungistasis is overcome by exogenous nutrients provided by root exudates from a nearby root. The germ tube grows towards the cotton root and enters through a fissure in the epidermis or by direct penetration. The fungus grows through the cortex to the stele and sporulates only when it has invaded the xylem. Conidia are then carried upwards in the transpiration stream, the fungus grows through the vessel end plates and then sporulates again in the adjoining vessel. Systemic spread within the plant occurs by spore transport; mycelial growth occurs in the vessels and later, to some extent, in the surrounding cortex. As the plant becomes completely infected, wilting and senescence occur as a result of water stress induced by the combined effect of mycelial growth in the xylem, fungal toxins and vascular occlusion by the host in an attempt to prevent systemic spread of the fungus. As the plant dies and tissues become moribund, the pathogen produces chlamydospores and the disease cycle is completed when host residues decay and spores are returned to the soil. Cotton plants are predisposed to infection by vascular-colonizing F. oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum isolates when the roots are invaded by nematodes ( Smith and Dick, 1960 ; Jorgenson et al., 1978 ). The main predisposing nematodes are Meloidogyne spp. ( Hillocks and Bridge, 1992 ), Belonolaimus longicaudatus ( Cooper and Brodie, 1963 ) and Rotylenchulus spp. (

The main predisposing nematodes are Meloidogyne spp. ( Hillocks and Bridge, 1992 ), Belonolaimus longicaudatus ( Cooper and Brodie, 1963 ) and Rotylenchulus spp. ( Khadr et al., 1972 ). The predisposing effect is due to root wounding and nutrient accumulation at the nematode feeding site. In the case of Meloidogyne , the nematode affects the physiology of the host, interfering with resistance mechanisms against systemic infection by the wilt fungus, resulting in increased susceptibility ( Hillocks, 1985 ). Root-rotting isolates of F. oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum do not require nematode injury to infect roots and produce symptoms.
 Sintomas: Symptoms of Fusarium wilt can appear at any stage of crop development. At high inoculum density or when infection initiates from the seed, plants may be killed at the seedling stage. In older plants, symptoms are first seen on the lower leaves. Leaf chlorosis begins at the margin and spreads between the main veins. More leaves become chlorotic as the disease spreads upwards in the plant and the leaves become flaccid, giving the plant a wilted appearance during the middle of the day. Symptomatic leaves may fall from the plant. Infected plants may also be stunted. As the infection progresses, all the leaves are affected and chlorosis turns to necrosis as the wilt becomes permanent and the plant dies from moisture stress.
