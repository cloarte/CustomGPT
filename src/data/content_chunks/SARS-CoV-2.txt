SARS-COV-2 IN ANIMALS:  
Guidance for Testing and Reporting 
Background: 
The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) expects member countries, including the U.S., to report 
confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in any animal species 
because they meet the WOAH definition of “emerging disease.” All confirmatory testing for cases of SARS-
CoV-2 in animals in the U.S. is conducted at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). The first confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 case in an animal species in the U.S. was in a tiger (Panthera tigris), which APHIS reported to 
WOAH, per reporting requirements (Terrestrial Code, Chapter 1.1, Article 1.1.2 and 1.1.3), on April 6, 2020. 
Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in several additional animal species in the U.S., most of which 
occurred during the circulation of the delta variant in humans. As additional cases are confirmed at NVSL, 
APHIS continues to submit routine updates to WOAH and to update the APHIS public dashboard. 
 
Like the approach with other zoonotic diseases, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, APHIS 
collaborates with and relies upon the expertise of our veterinary diagnostic laboratories to perform testing 
and report results quickly and accurately and to partner with us to use our collective resources most 
efficiently. Monitoring the S

Like the approach with other zoonotic diseases, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, APHIS 
collaborates with and relies upon the expertise of our veterinary diagnostic laboratories to perform testing 
and report results quickly and accurately and to partner with us to use our collective resources most 
efficiently. Monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 in animal populations remains a priority for APHIS. All laboratories 
are encouraged to submit samples from presumptive cases to NVSL for confirmation and characterization, 
especially when unexpected morbidity or mortality occurs.  
 
USDA also provides funding specifically to address research questions such as the susceptibility of different 
animal species, to better understand of viral evolution and the impact of new variants, and to monitor the 
virus where it might be maintained in animal populations. APHIS collaborates with public health partners by 
supporting SARS-CoV-2 response activities and sharing information about confirmed cases. 
 
Testing Information:  
APHIS encourages collaboration with public health and animal health officials, using a One Health approach 
on the decision to test potentially exposed and clinically ill animals for SARS-CoV-2. Consult these websites 
to find your appropriate state officials: State Animal Health Official and State Public Health Veterinarian. 
Refer to additional information at Evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Animals | CDC. 
 
Many laboratories perform initial SARS-CoV-2 testing, including members of the National Animal Health 
Laboratory Network (NAHLN) and private veterinary laboratories. Please communicate with the intended 
testing animal health laboratory before shipment to receive any specific instruction for packaging samples. 
All laboratories are responsible for forwarding appropriate samples to NVSL for confirmatory testing as 
described below. All testing at NAHLN and

testing animal health laboratory before shipment to receive any specific instruction for packaging samples. 
All laboratories are responsible for forwarding appropriate samples to NVSL for confirmatory testing as 
described below. All testing at NAHLN and other laboratories is completed at the cost of the submitter 
unless otherwise agreed upon at the State and Federal levels. Confirmatory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is 
conducted at NVSL and is typically conducted at no charge to the submitter. 
• Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 infections in any animal species are expected to be confirmed at 
NVSL EXCEPT for those in household cats, household dogs, and white-tailed deer from states, 
territories, or tribal nations that have previously had a confirmed case in that species. However, 
NVSL offers virus characterization for these cases at no cost to the submitter and welcomes data to 
contribute to the national analysis from laboratories that sequence samples from these cases. 
Please consult the figure at the end of this document for further guidance on when to submit 
samples to NVSL.

• Ship samples for confirmation to NVSL within 5 business days of the first positive test.  
• For submission of samples to NVSL, follow the protocols for packaging and labeling submissions to 
the NVSL. Diagnostic samples may be shipped as exempt material; UN3373 may be used where the 
situation warrants. Maintain sample cold chain using frozen gel ice packs.

Research studies of natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 
For research studies in animals with naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2, NVSL confirmation and reporting 
may be required for cases, except for those in household cats, household dogs, and white-tailed deer. 
Contact NVSL at NVSL.DVL.Heads@usda.gov for further information.  
• IMPORTANT: Be sure to retain adequate original collected sample for submission to NVSL to 
allow for this confirmatory testing (a minimum of 200µl of original sample).  
• Where whole genome sequencing was conducted, the unaltered data files directly from the 
sequencer (i.e., FASTQ) should be submitted to NVSL for analysis.  
• Ship samples for confirmation to NVSL within 5 business days of initial positive PCR test result.  
• For submission of samples to NVSL, follow the protocols for packaging and labeling submissions to 
the NVSL. Diagnostic samples may be shipped as exempt material; UN3373 may be used where the 
situation warrants. Maintain sample cold chain using frozen gel ice packs. 
NOTE: This information may be used for reporting purposes; however, details of the research project and 
results will remain confidential as laws allow. This guidance does not apply for research studies involving 
experimental infections.
