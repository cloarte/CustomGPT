Plant Notes:  Angle Pod is a native herbaceous perennial vine in the Dogbane family (Apocynaceae). It can be found throughout Alabama.

Colleters (multicellular secretory hairs) are found near the base of the midvein. Both stems and leaves emit a milky white latex when injured as well as an unpleasant odor. Flowers are produced in racemes or panicles in the axils of the leaves. The calyx is 5-lobed with colleters between the lobes. The corolla is rotate with 5 narrowly triangular spreading lobes.
