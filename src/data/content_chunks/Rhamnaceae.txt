5.Rhamnaceae鼠李科 shu li keAuthors:Yilin Chen&Carsten SchirarendDeciduous or evergreen, often thorny trees, shrubs, woody climbers, or lianas, rarely herbs. Leaves simple, petiolate, alternate or opposite, pinnately veined or 3-5-veined, entire to serrate, sometimes much reduced; stipules small, caducous or persistent, sometimes transformed into spines. Flowers yellowish to greenish, rarely brightly colored, small, bisexual or unisexual, rarely polygamous, (4 or)5-merous, hypogynous to epigynous, in mostly axillary, sessile or pedunculate cymes, or reduced to few in fascicles. Calyx tube patelliform or hemispherical to tubular, sometimes absent, at rim with calyx, corolla, and stamens; sepals 4 or 5, valvate in bud, triangular, erect or ± recurved during anthesis, adaxially often distinctly keeled, alternate with petals. Petals 4 or 5, rarely absent, usually smaller than sepals, concave or hooded, rarely nearly flat, often shortly clawed. Stamens 4 or 5, antepetalous and often ± enclosed by petals; filaments thin, adnate to bases of petals; anthers minute, versatile or not, 2(or 4)-celled, dehiscing by longitudinal slits, usually introrse. Disk intrastaminal, nectariferous, thin to ± fleshy, entire or lobed, glabrous or rarely pubescent, free from ovary or tightly surrounding it, or adnate to calyx tube. Ovary superior to inferior, (1 or)2-4-loculed, with 1(

Disk intrastaminal, nectariferous, thin to ± fleshy, entire or lobed, glabrous or rarely pubescent, free from ovary or tightly surrounding it, or adnate to calyx tube. Ovary superior to inferior, (1 or)2-4-loculed, with 1(or 2) ovules per locule; ovules anatropous, basal and erect; styles simple or ± deeply 3-lobed or 3-cleft. Fruit either an indehiscent, rarely explosively dehiscent, sometimes winged, schizocarpic capsule, or a ± fleshy drupe with 1-4 indehiscent, rarely dehiscent, pyrenes (stones). Seeds with thin, oily albumen, sometimes exalbuminous; embryo large, oily, straight or rarely bent.About 50 genera and more than 900 species: almost cosmopolitan, mainly in subtropical to tropical areas; 13 genera and 137 species (82 endemic, one introduced) in China.Former classifications usually placed Rhamnaceae in the Rhamnales, together with Vitaceae and Leeaceae (Suessenguth in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam., ed. 2, 20d. 1953), or together with Elaeagnaceae (Thorne, Bot. Rev. 58: 225-348. 1992). Orders such as Celastrales, Urticales, and Euphorbiales have often been considered as closely related groups. Recent analyses of DNA sequences strongly supported including the family in the Rosales, beside the closest relatives Barbeyaceae and Dirachmaceae (see Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II, Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 141: 399-436. 2003). Suessenguth (loc. cit.) grouped the family

Bot. 87: 1309-1324. 2000) revised this tribal classification on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis usingrbcL andtrnL-F sequences of the plastid genome. Now 11 tribes are recognized, of which four are represented in the Flora area.Microrhamnus bodinieriH. Léveillé (Fl.

Diverse Old World species ofRhamnusprovide yellow and green dyes as well as drugs.
