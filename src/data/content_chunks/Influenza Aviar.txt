Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus is an emerging disease in cattle. Federal and State 
agencies are moving quickly to conduct additional testing for HPAI (H5N1) virus, including viral genome 
sequencing to provide a better understanding of the situation to characterize the HPAI (H5N1) virus strain 
or strains associated with these detections as well as other components of this disease event at the 
connection between animals, people, and the environment. The genetic and epidemiological data indicate 
spillover of the virus from wild birds to dairy cows and some instances of spread from dairy to dairy and 
from dairy premises to poultry premises. Based on this analysis, we have learned that the whole genome 
sequence for virus found in positive herds in 8 states and on two recent commercial poultry premises in 
two different states indicates it is the same strain affecting both dairy cattle and poultry. While it is still 
unclear exactly how virus is spreading, the virus is shed in milk at high concentrations; therefore, anything 
that comes in contact with unpasteurized raw milk, spilled milk, etc. may spread the virus including other 
animals, vehicles, and other objects or materials. Therefore, both dairy and poultry producers should re- 
double biosecurity efforts and be vigilant about monitoring for and controlling disease in their herds and 
flocks. 
Additionally, in order to continue to monitor and understand the extent of this virus and reduce the risk of 
further spread of HPAI H5N1, resulting in greater threats to poultry and livestock, APHIS issued a

 producers should re- 
double biosecurity efforts and be vigilant about monitoring for and controlling disease in their herds and 
flocks. 
Additionally, in order to continue to monitor and understand the extent of this virus and reduce the risk of 
further spread of HPAI H5N1, resulting in greater threats to poultry and livestock, APHIS issued a Federal  
Order on April 24, 2024 that requires premovement testing for lactating dairy cattle moving interstate and 
reporting of positive test results from all laboratories and State Animal Health Officials (SAHO). This 
document outlines both the interstate movement requirements, as well as APHIS recommendations to 
limit the spread. Updated laboratory guidance, including details on required reporting, are located on the 
APHIS website. 
 
Our goal is to safeguard the health of U.S. livestock and poultry, protect the industry, keep our food supply 
safe, and protect public health and human safety based on the most up-to-date information we have. We 
continue to work diligently to understand the risk factors associated with this virus, transmission routes, 
and pathogenicity in cattle. This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation. USDA and Federal and State 
partners will continue to share additional updates as soon as information becomes available. 
 
Scope and Deﬁnitions 
Per the Federal Order, these steps are immediately required for lactating dairy cattle. Any requirements for 
other classes of dairy cattle, or expansion beyond dairy cattle, will be based on scientific factors concerning 
the virus and its evolving risk profile. 
Definitions used in this document: 
• Cattle – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of members of the

, or expansion beyond dairy cattle, will be based on scientific factors concerning 
the virus and its evolving risk profile. 
Definitions used in this document: 
• Cattle – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of members of the 
Family: Bovidae; Subfamily: bovinae; Genus: Bos; Species: Bos taurus and Bos indicus. 
• Lactating – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of dairy cows 
currently in one of the lactation phases (i.e., early, mid, and late) of their current production cycle. 
• Dairy – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of lactating cattle 
breeds raised for the primary purpose of milk production. 
• Nonlactating – Nonlactating cattle include: heifers, dry cows, and bull calves. 
• Affected herd – Any dairy cattle herd with suspect, presumptive, or confirmed positive cattle cases 
present as defined in the case definition, or exposed cattle present. 
• Exposed cattle – Any cattle that have been on the same premises as an affected herd within the 
3  
last 30 days (which is roughly equivalent to two incubation periods of influenza in other species; 
we currently have studies underway in cattle to better determine) and/or are epidemiologically 
connected. 
• Herd – Any group of one or more animals maintained on common ground 
 
Clinical Signs in Dairy Cattle 
See the case definition for a complete description. Briefly, dairy cattle may experience a sudden drop in 
feed intake; a marked drop in herd level milk production with some more severely affected cows having 
thickened milk or may have essentially no milk; subsequent acute drop in milk production; and respiratory 
signs including clear nasal discharge.

A
PHIS Requirements for Interstate Movement of Cattle 
Interstate movements of lactating dairy cattle must follow the Federal requirements outlined below. 
Additionally, state-specific guidance for moving cattle must be followed. Clinical lactating dairy cattle are 
ineligible for interstate movement or movement to slaughter. 
Nonlactating dairy cattle – including heifers, dry cows, and bull calves – are not currently subject to testing 
for interstate movement due to their risk profile. 
Prior to interstate movement, lactating dairy cattle are required to receive a negative test for Influenza A 
virus at an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory using an NAHLN 
approved assay. 
 
Sample Collection and Testing for Interstate Premovement Testing of Lactating Dairy Cattle 
• Samples are to be collected by an accredited veterinarian, or a state licensed veterinarian, or a 
sample collector approved by the appropriate state animal health official. Designated individuals 
on production sites can be trained to collect milk samples and nasal swab samples for diagnostic 
testing. 
• Samples must be collected under the supervision of a licensed or accredited veterinarian or as 
determined by the respective State Animal Health Official. 
• Milk samples: Samples to be collected include milk/udder secretions from individual cows. Each 
quarter is sampled and combined into one sample for submission to the laboratory. Submissions 
must be between 3-10 ml of milk per animal.

 be collected under the supervision of a licensed or accredited veterinarian or as 
determined by the respective State Animal Health Official. 
• Milk samples: Samples to be collected include milk/udder secretions from individual cows. Each 
quarter is sampled and combined into one sample for submission to the laboratory. Submissions 
must be between 3-10 ml of milk per animal. 
o Pooling of milk samples can be done only at the laboratory. 
• For groups/lots of 30 or fewer animals moving interstate, all animals being moved must be tested. 
If more than 30 animals are moving interstate, then only 30 animals total must be tested. 
• Sample collection and testing must take place no more than seven (7) days prior to interstate 
movement. 
• Samples for interstate premovement testing need to be submitted to an approved National Animal 
Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) Laboratory for testing. NAHLN laboratories will conduct 
NAHLN-approved PCR testing: FluA matrix, H5 and optionally 2.3.4.4b. Please see HPAI Livestock 
Testing Recommendations f or details.  
4  
• APHIS will reimburse for all interstate premovement testing at NAHLN laboratories; therefore, this 
testing at NAHLN laboratories will be completed at no cost to the producer/submitter. 
• At this time, APHIS is not reimbursing for sample collection or shipping. 
 
For Cattle with Positive HPAI Test Results 
• Lactating dairy cattle from herds which have tested positive for Influenza A are not eligible for 
interstate movement for thirty (30) days from the most recent collection of any sample that tests 
positive from any individual animal in the herd. After the 30-day period, animals must be tested 
Text Len: 1683

For Cattle with Positive HPAI Test Results 
• Lactating dairy cattle from herds which have tested positive for Influenza A are not eligible for 
interstate movement for thirty (30) days from the most recent collection of any sample that tests 
positive from any individual animal in the herd. After the 30-day period, animals must be tested 
again for movement. 
• If there are specific circumstances for isolating test-positive cattle and moving to another premises 
across state lines, this would need to be discussed and agreed upon with the respective State 
Animal Health Officials and APHIS. 
 
Cattle Moved Directly to Slaughter 
• Nonclinical lactating dairy cattle moving interstate direct to slaughter are not required to have a 
premovement test but must move on a certificate of veterinary inspection or other documentation 
of movement approved by the sending and receiving state animal health officials and provided to 
the sending and receiving state animal health officials. 
• Clinical lactating dairy cattle are ineligible for interstate movement or movement to slaughter. 
 
Certiﬁcates of Veterinary Inspection 
The interstate movement of all lactating dairy cattle must be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary 
Inspection (CVI) per 9 CFR Part 86, Animal Disease Traceability. The destination/receiving state(s) will 
continue to use CVIs as a basis to track the interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle. 
• All cattle on the CVI must have individual official identification. 
• The individual official identification must be recorded on the CVI. 
• The CVI must include a statement that the cattle are both free from, and have not been exposed 
to, a known contagious and infectious disease. 
 
Exhibition/Show Dairy Cattle   
Requirements above for premovement
Text Len: 1797
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 on the CVI must have individual official identification. 
• The individual official identification must be recorded on the CVI. 
• The CVI must include a statement that the cattle are both free from, and have not been exposed 
to, a known contagious and infectious disease. 
 
Exhibition/Show Dairy Cattle   
Requirements above for premovement testing and CVIs apply to dairy cattle moving interstate to 
exhibitions/shows. Animals moving interstate to an exhibition, show, or sale must have a negative test 
result from samples collected within 7 days of movement. These animals may travel to their home herd 
using the same negative test result provided the exhibition, show, or sale does not exceed 10 days of 
length. See also Recommendations to Minimize Influenza Transmission at Dairy Cattle Livestock Exhibitions. 
 
APHIS Recommendations 
Additional detailed actions are provided later in this document, subject to updates as information is 
gathered. 
 
Cattle Movement Recommendations. In addition to the interstate movement requirements above, APHIS 
provides the following recommendations.  
• APHIS strongly recommends minimizing movement of cattle as much as possible, with special 
5  
attention to evaluating risk and factoring that risk into movement decisions. 
• If you have any animals with clinical signs on the premises, do not move animals off the premises. 
• All animals that move on/off a premises should be isolated for 30 days to prevent the spread of 
disease. 
• If cattle must be moved, we strongly encourage extreme diligence by producers, veterinarians, 
and States to ensure only healthy cattle are moving and to ensure the validity of interstate 
health certificates. APHIS stands ready to assist SAHOs with developing language for interstate 
certificates of veterinary

 isolated for 30 days to prevent the spread of 
disease. 
• If cattle must be moved, we strongly encourage extreme diligence by producers, veterinarians, 
and States to ensure only healthy cattle are moving and to ensure the validity of interstate 
health certificates. APHIS stands ready to assist SAHOs with developing language for interstate 
certificates of veterinary inspection, as needed. 
• APHIS recommends premovement testing of non-lactating cattle as well. This testing at NAHLN 
laboratories will be completed at no cost to the producer. Additional recommendations for 
testing can be found here. 
• State-specific guidance for moving cattle will also need to be followed. 
• APHIS scientists are working to establish testing protocols, rapidly assessing currently available 
tests and test performance including sample types to better understand the characteristics; based 
on this analysis, we may recommend testing for other classes of cattle beyond lactating dairy cows 
in the future. 
• SAHOs should consider adopting the federal testing and movement requirements described above 
for intrastate movements of lactating dairy cattle to exhibitions or shows.  
 
B
iosecurity. Producers should implement enhanced biosecurity practices for keeping disease off farms and 
controlling disease spread on the farm. The Secure Milk Supply Plan is a collaborative initiative among the dairy 
industry, USDA, State officials and three universities. The Secure Milk Supply website offers comprehensive 
materials on dairy biosecurity practices, including posters and information sheets in English and Spanish.

APHIS Recommendations for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 Virus in Livestock for State 
Animal Health Officials, Accredited Veterinarians and Producers:  
• Monitoring for Sick Animals. Producers should monitor herds closely for cattle with clinical signs of 
disease. 
• Movement of Cattle. Movement of cattle should be minimized; movement of cattle should be 
focused on preventing movement of disease. 
• Vehicles, Equipment, and People on the Farm. Producers should limit the movement of vehicles and 
visitors on and off livestock and poultry premises and establish dedicated routes for vehicles that do 
come onto the premises. 
• Wildlife Management. Producers should monitor and report any odd behaviors and die offs in 
domestic and wild animals immediately. 
• Dairy Cattle Shows. Organizers and exhibitors should practice strict biosecurity practices for 
animals and equipment to include frequent cleaning and disinfecting all equipment, avoiding 
contact with other animals, isolating animals and observing for illness upon return from 
shows.  
 
6  
Disposal of Deceased Birds, Cats, and Other Small Animals  
• Producers should wear disposable gloves when handling any carcasses of birds or animals 
found on the farm.   
• If

 all equipment, avoiding 
contact with other animals, isolating animals and observing for illness upon return from 
shows.  
 
6  
Disposal of Deceased Birds, Cats, and Other Small Animals  
• Producers should wear disposable gloves when handling any carcasses of birds or animals 
found on the farm.   
• If there has been any potential human or animal exposure to rabies, contact your local health 
department for instructions; any cats that demonstrate neurologic signs should be submitted 
to the local public health laboratory for rabies testing.   
• Producers should work with their veterinarian to submit dead birds and cats to a NAHLN 
laboratory for influenza testing.   
• If dead cats cannot be submitted for rabies or influenza testing, thoroughly spray carcass with 
Virkon or equivalent disinfectant, double-bag and dispose in accordance with local and State 
laws. See AVMA guidelines or consult a veterinarian for animal carcass disposal practices.  
 
Milk Safety. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends special attention to raw milk safety and 
handling practices for discarded milk. Additional resources available at Questions and Answers Regarding  
Milk Safety During Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Outbreaks | FDA. 
• Safety of Feeding Waste or Discarded Milk to Animals. The FDA recommends producers discard milk 
from symptomatic cows. Young calves are susceptible to disease and disease-causing pathogens can 
be transmitted through raw milk. If milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those 
infected with HPAI A (H5N1), cannot be discarded and is intended to be used to feed calves (or other 
animals, such as farm cats), the FDA strongly encourages that it be heat treated to kill

 susceptible to disease and disease-causing pathogens can 
be transmitted through raw milk. If milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those 
infected with HPAI A (H5N1), cannot be discarded and is intended to be used to feed calves (or other 
animals, such as farm cats), the FDA strongly encourages that it be heat treated to kill harmful 
bacteria or viruses, such as influenza, before calf feeding. This heat treatment should be similar to 
times and temperatures commonly found in commercial milk pasteurization processing. 
• Safety of Unpasteurized Milk and Dairy Products for Human Consumption. Raw milk and raw milk 
dairy products should not be sold or distributed for human consumption. 
• Disposal of Discarded Milk. Disposal of milk should be handled in such a way as to prevent exposure 
to other animals. The FDA recommends producers take precautions when discarding milk from 
affected cows so that the discarded milk does not become a source of further spread. Producers 
should consult with their state regulatory authorities for specific recommendations or requirements, 
however, such precautions could include heat-treatment or pasteurization of discarded milk prior to 
dumping in lagoons or application of waste solids and ensuring biosecurity around lagoons (e.g., 
ensuring that animals and birds do not have access to lagoons). 
• Segregation of Milk from Infected Lactating Cows: Maximal care should be taken to segregate 
lactating cows known to be actively infected with H5N1 so their milk does not enter the food supply, 
consistent with the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.

 to segregate 
lactating cows known to be actively infected with H5N1 so their milk does not enter the food supply, 
consistent with the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance. 
One Health: Agriculture and Public Health Collaboration. Monitoring farmers and farm workers with 
exposure to infected cattle is important to human and animal health. APHIS will continue to share 
information from their investigations as they coordinate with CDC, as has been standard procedure with 
influenza in poultry and swine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with state 
and local health departments to continue to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected 
or potentially infected animals and test those people who develop symptoms. 
 
People exposed to HPAI A (H5N1)-infected cattle, birds, or other animals (including people wearing 
recommended PPE) should be monitored daily for signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness 
7  
beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Farms with HPAI-positive 
herds should implement farm-administered daily active monitoring using a simple symptom survey, that 
CDC provides to state and local public health agencies and that can also be made available directly to 
farmers. 
On a daily basis, farms should share the aggregate number of staff who may have been exposed to 
infected cattle or other animals and are now being monitored for symptoms to a local public health 
department to a local public health department to maintain awareness of possible spillover infection. 
 
Symptomatic persons should be referred to local public health for prompt medical evaluation, testing, and 
treatment, such as initiation of antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) as soon as possible.

Symptomatic persons should be referred to local public health for prompt medical evaluation, testing, and 
treatment, such as initiation of antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) as soon as possible. 
Additional information related to public health monitoring and preventing exposures to H5N1 are available 
on CDC’s website. 
People should take steps to reduce the risk of infection with avian influenza A viruses associated with 
working with animals or materials like raw milk. Farms should follow CDC’s guidance for workers, including 
the use of personal protective equipment to minimize the risk of on farm HPAI transmission. These 
recommendations and additional information can be found at the links below: 
 Recommendations for Worker Protection and Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to  
Reduce Exposure to Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease in Humans | Avian  
Influenza (Flu) (cdc.gov) 
 Prevention and Antiviral Treatment of Bird Flu Viruses in People | Avian Influenza (Flu) (cdc.gov) 
 
Producers with positive herds are encouraged to collaborate with local and state public health agencies, 
for example, permitting public health access conduct on-farm activities. Human and animal health experts 
have a pressing need to better understand the spread of H5N1 and how the virus manifests and might 
impact both animal and human health. There is no substitute for capturing real-time information from 
farmers and farmworkers who are or have experienced symptoms through surveys and monitoring of key 
health indicators. Willing producers and farmworkers should contact their local public health agency.

El virus H5N1 de la influenza aviar altamente patógena A (HPAI, por sus siglas en inglés) es una 
enfermedad emergente en el ganado vacuno. Las agencias federales y estatales están actuando 
rápidamente para llevar a cabo pruebas adicionales para el virus HPAI (H5N1), incluyendo la secuenciación 
del genoma viral para proporcionar una mejor comprensión de la situación para caracterizar la cepa o 
cepas del virus HPAI (H5N1) asociadas con estas detecciones, así como otros componentes de este evento 
de enfermedad en la conexión entre los animales, las personas y el medio ambiente. Los datos genéticos y 
epidemiológicos indican la propagación del virus de las aves silvestres a las vacas lecheras y algunos casos 
de propagación de lechería a lechería y de instalaciones lecheras a instalaciones avícolas. Basándonos en 
este análisis, hemos comprobado que la secuencia del genoma completo del virus encontrado en rebaños

lisis, hemos comprobado que la secuencia del genoma completo del virus encontrado en rebaños 
con resultados positivos en 8 estados y en dos instalaciones avícolas comerciales recientes en dos estados 
diferentes, indica que se trata de la misma cepa que afecta tanto al ganado vacuno lechero como a las 
aves de corral. Aunque todavía no está claro cómo se propaga exactamente, el virus se desprende en la 
leche en altas concentraciones; por tanto, cualquier cosa que entre en contacto con leche cruda no 
pasteurizada, leche derramada, etc. puede propagar el virus, incluidos otros animales, vehículos y otros 
objetos o materiales. Por lo tanto, tanto los productores lácteos como los avícolas deben redoblar los 
esfuerzos de bioseguridad y estar atentos al monitoreo y control de las enfermedades en sus rebaños y 
bandadas. 
Además, con el fin de continuar monitoreando y entendiendo el alcance de este virus y reducir el riesgo de 
una mayor propagación del virus H5N1 de la HPAI, lo que resultaría en mayores amenazas para las aves de

Requisitos del APHIS para el traslado interestatal de ganado vacuno 
Los movimientos interestatales de ganado vacuno lechero en lactación deben seguir los requisitos federales 
que se describen a continuación. Además, deben seguirse las guías específicas de cada estado para el 
traslado de ganado vacuno. El ganado vacuno lechero en lactación en estado clínico no es elegible para el 
traslado interestatal ni para el traslado con destino al matadero. 
El ganado vacuno lechero no lactante --incluidas las novillas, las vacas secas y los terneros-- no está sujeto 
actualmente a pruebas para el traslado interestatal debido a su perfil de riesgo. 
Antes del traslado interestatal, se requiere que el ganado vacuno lechero lactante reciba una prueba 
negativa para el virus de la influenza A en un laboratorio aprobado de la Red Nacional de Laboratorios de 
Sanidad Animal (NAHLN, por sus siglas en inglés) u tilizando un an

Recogida y análisis de muestras para las pruebas previas al traslado interestatal de ganado vacuno lechero 
en lactancia  
• Las muestras deben ser recogidas por un veterinario acreditado, o un veterinario con licencia 
estatal, o un recolector de muestras aprobado por el funcionario de sanidad animal estatal 
correspondiente. Los individuos designados en los sitios de producción pueden recibir 
adiestramiento para recoger muestras de leche y muestras de hisopos nasales para pruebas de 
diagnóstico. 
• Las muestras deben recogerse bajo la supervisión de un veterinario autorizado o acreditado o 
según determine el respectivo funcionario estatal de sanidad animal.

• Muestras de leche: las muestras que deben recogerse incluyen leche/secreciones de la ubre de 
vacas individuales. Cada trimestre se toma una muestra y se combina en una sola muestra para 
enviarla al laboratorio. Los envíos deben tener entre 3 y 10 ml de leche por animal. 
o La mezcla de muestras de leche solamente puede hacerse en el laboratorio. 
• En el caso de grupos o lotes de 30 animales o menos que se trasladen interestatalmente, todos 
los animales que se trasladen deberán someterse a pruebas. Si son más de 30 los animales que se 
trasladan interestatalmente, solamente deberán someterse a pruebas 30 animales en total. 
• La recogida de muestras y la realización de pruebas deben efectuarse como máximo siete (7) 
días antes del traslado interestatal. 
• Las muestras para las pruebas interestatales previas al traslado deben presentarse a un 
laboratorio aprobado de la Red Nacional de Laboratorios de Sanidad Animal (NAHLN) para su 
análisis. Los laboratorios de la NAHLN realizarán las pruebas PCR aprobadas por la NAHLN: Matriz

Recomendaciones para el traslado de ganado vacuno. Además de los requisitos de traslado interestatal 
arriba mencionados, el APHIS hace las siguientes recomendaciones.  
• El APHIS recomienda encarecidamente minimizar el traslado de ganado vacuno en la medida 
de lo posible, prestando especial atención a la evaluación del riesgo y teniendo en cuenta 
dicho riesgo a la hora de tomar decisiones sobre los traslados. 
• Si tiene animales con signos clínicos en las instalaciones, no los traslade fuera de ellas. 
• Todos los animales que entren o salgan de las instalaciones deben aislarse durante 30 días 
para evitar la propagación de enfermedades. 
• Si es necesario trasladar ganado vacuno, recomendamos encarecidamente que los 
productores, los veterinarios y los estados act

 o salgan de las instalaciones deben aislarse durante 30 días 
para evitar la propagación de enfermedades. 
• Si es necesario trasladar ganado vacuno, recomendamos encarecidamente que los 
productores, los veterinarios y los estados actúen con la máxima diligencia para garantizar que 
solamente se traslada ganado vacuno sano y para asegurar la validez de los certificados 
sanitarios interestatales. APHIS está listo para asistir a los SAHO en el desarrollo de lenguaje 
para los certificados interestatales de inspección veterinaria, según sea necesario. 
• El APHIS recomienda que también se realicen pruebas previas al traslado del ganado vacuno 
no lactante. Estas pruebas en los laboratorios de la NAHLN se realizarán sin costo alguno para 
el productor. Encontrará recomendaciones adicionales para las pruebas aquí. 
• También habrá que seguir las guías específicas de cada estado para el traslado de ganado vacuno.

• Los científicos del APHIS están trabajando para establecer protocolos de pruebas, evaluando 
rápidamente las pruebas disponibles en la actualidad y el rendimiento de las mismas, incluidos los 
tipos de muestras, para comprender mejor las características; basándonos en este análisis, es 
posible que en el futuro recomendemos la realización de pruebas para otras clases de ganado 
vacuno, más allá de las vacas lecheras lactantes. 
 
Bioseguridad. Los productores deben implementar prácticas de bioseguridad mejoradas para mantener 
las enfermedades fuera de las granjas y controlar la propagación de enfermedades en la granja. El Plan de 
Suministro Seguro de Leche e s una iniciativa de colaboración entre la industria lechera, el USDA, 
funcionarios estatales y tres universidades. La página web de Suministro Seguro de Leche ofrece

Recomendaciones del APHIS para el virus H5N1 de la influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI) en el 
ganado para funcionarios estatales de sanidad animal, veterinarios acreditados y productores: 
• Monitoreo de animales enfermos. Los productores deben vigilar de cerca los rebaños en busca de 
ganado vacuno con signos clínicos de enfermedad. 
• Traslado de ganado vacuno. El traslado de ganado vacuno debe reducirse al mínimo; el 
traslado de ganado vacuno debe centrarse en prevenir el traslado de enfermedades. 
• Vehículos, equipos y personas en la granja. Los productores deben limitar el movimiento de 
vehículos y visitantes dentro y fuera de las instalaciones ganaderas y avícolas y establecer rutas

• Vehículos, equipos y personas en la granja. Los productores deben limitar el movimiento de 
vehículos y visitantes dentro y fuera de las instalaciones ganaderas y avícolas y establecer rutas 
específicas para los vehículos que entren en las instalaciones. 
• Manejo de la vida silvestre. Los productores deben monitorear y notificar inmediatamente 
cualquier comportamiento extraño o muerte de animales domésticos o salvajes. 
Seguridad de la leche. La Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) 
recomienda prestar especial atención a la seguridad de la leche cruda y a las prácticas de manejo de la 
leche desechada. Recursos adicionales disponibles en Preguntas y respuestas sobre seguridad de la leche 
durante los brotes de la Influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI) | FDA.  
• Seguridad al alimentar animales con leche de desperdicio o desechada. La FDA recomienda a los 
productores que desechen la leche de las vacas sintomáticas. Los terneros jóvenes son susceptibles 
de contraer enfermedades y los patógenos causantes de enfermedades pueden transmitirse a través

icio o desechada. La FDA recomienda a los 
productores que desechen la leche de las vacas sintomáticas. Los terneros jóvenes son susceptibles 
de contraer enfermedades y los patógenos causantes de enfermedades pueden transmitirse a través 
de la leche cruda. Si la leche procedente de vacas que presentan síntomas de enfermedad, incluidas 
las infectadas con la HPAI A (H5N1), no puede desecharse y se destina a alimentar a terneros (u otros 
animales, como gatos de la granja), la FDA recomienda encarecidamente que se someta a un 
tratamiento térmico para eliminar bacterias o virus nocivos, como el de la influenza, antes de 
alimentar un ternero. Este tratamiento térmico debe ser similar a los tiempos y temperaturas 
habituales en el proceso comercial de pasteurización de la leche. 
• Seguridad de la leche y los productos lácteos no pasteurizados destinados al consumo humano. 
La leche cruda y los productos lácteos a base de leche cruda no deben venderse ni distribuirse 
para el consumo humano. 
• Eliminación de la leche desechada. La eliminación de la leche debe realizarse de forma que se evite

• Eliminación de la leche desechada. La eliminación de la leche debe realizarse de forma que se evite 
la exposición a otros animales. La FDA recomienda a los productores que tomen precauciones al 
desechar la leche de las vacas afectadas para que no se convierta en una fuente de propagación. Los 
productores deben consultar con las autoridades reguladoras de su estado para obtener 
recomendaciones o requisitos específicos, sin embargo, tales precauciones podrían incluir el 
tratamiento térmico o la pasteurización de la leche desechada antes de verterla en las lagunas o la 
aplicación de sólidos de desecho y garantizar la bioseguridad alrededor de las lagunas (por ejemplo, 
garantizar que los animales y las aves no tengan acceso a las mismas). 
• Segregación de la leche de vacas lactantes infectadas. Se debe tener el máximo cuidado para 
segregar a las vacas lactantes que se sabe que están activamente infectadas con H5N1 para que su 
leche no entre en el suministro de alimentos, de acuerdo con la Ordenanza de Leche Pasteurizada.

One Health: colaboración entre agricultura y salud pública. Monitorear a los granjeros y a los 
trabajadores de las granjas con exposición a ganado vacuno infectado es importante para la salud humana 
y animal. El APHIS seguirá compartiendo la información de sus investigaciones en coordinación con los 
Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés),  como ha sido el 
7  
procedimiento habitual con la influenza en aves de corral y cerdos. Los Centros para el Control y la 
Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) están trabajando con los departamentos de salud estatales y locales 
para seguir monitoreando a los trabajadores que puedan haber estado en contacto con animales 
infectados o potencialmente infectados y realizar pruebas a las personas que desarrollen síntomas.

Las personas expuestas a ganado vacuno, aves u otros animales infectados por el HPAI A (H5N1) [incluidas las 
personas que lleven puesto el equipo de protección personal (PPE, por sus siglas en inglés) recomendado] 
deben ser monitoreadas diariamente para detectar signos y síntomas de enfermedad respiratoria aguda a 
partir de su primera exposición y durante 10 días después de su última exposición. Las granjas con rebaños 
que den positivo a la HPAI deben implementar un monitoreo activo diario realizado en la granja utilizando 
una simple encuesta de síntomas, que los CDC proporcionan a las agencias de salud pública estatales y 
locales y que también puede estar disponible directamente para los granjeros. 
Diariamente, las granjas deben compartir con un departamento de salud pública local el número total de 
personal que puede haber estado expuesto a ganado vacuno u otros animales infectados y que ahora está 
siendo monitoreado para detectar síntomas, con el fin de mantener la concienciación sobre la posible 
propagación de la infección.

Las personas sintomáticas deben ser referidas a la salud pública local para una rápida evaluación médica, 
pruebas y tratamiento, como el inicio del tratamiento antiviral con Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) lo antes posible. 
Hay disponible información adicional relacionada con el monitoreo de la salud pública y la prevención de 
exposiciones al virus H5N1 en la página web del CDC. 
Las personas deben adoptar medidas para reducir el riesgo de infección por los virus de la influenza aviar A 
asociados al trabajo con animales o materiales como la leche cruda. Las granjas deben seguir la guía de los 
CDC para los trabajadores, incluyendo el uso de equipos de protección personal para minimizar el riesgo de 
transmisión de la HPAI en la granja. Estas recomendaciones e información adicional pueden encontrarse en 
los siguientes enlaces:

Influenza aviar altamente patógena: 
Desafíos en la implementación de prácticas de 
bioseguridad para los productores comerciales 
de pavo y huevos de mesa Mayo de 2024 
INTRODUCCIÓN 
La influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI) es una enfermedad grave, altamente contagiosa y muchas 
veces fatal para pollos y pavos. El Servicio de Inspección Sanitaria de Animales y Plantas (APHIS) del 
Departamento de Agricultura de EE. UU. (USDA) hizo dos estudios para investigar los factores potenciales 
de riesgo de la introducción del virus de la HPAI en las granjas en el 2022. Un estudio se centró en las 
granjas comerciales que crían pavos para carne. El otro estudio se centró en las granjas comerciales de 
huevos de mesa, incluyendo de cría, de gallinas y de ponedoras de huevos de mesa. En el estudio de pavo 
participaron 125 granjas de 12 estados. Entre enero y octubre de 2022, se confirmaron casos positivos de 
HPAI en granjas de pavos. En el estudio de huevos de mesa participaron 40 granjas de 8 estados. Entre 
febrero y septiembre de 2022, se confirmaron casos positivos de HPAI en granjas de huevos de mesa. En

HPAI en granjas de pavos. En el estudio de huevos de mesa participaron 40 granjas de 8 estados. Entre 
febrero y septiembre de 2022, se confirmaron casos positivos de HPAI en granjas de huevos de mesa. En 
ambos estudios, se seleccionaron granjas de control de los mismos estados que las granjas de caso, pero 
las granjas de control no tenían HPAI durante el mismo período (Figura 1).

El APHIS informó previamente sobre los factores de riesgo de la introducción de la HPAI en granjas 
comerciales de pavo y de huevos de mesa, basándose en los resultados de estos estudios. Este informe 
presenta los resultados de la información que dieron los productores sobre los desafíos de bioseguridad 
relacionados con el pienso, el personal y el equipo. El objetivo de este informe es ofrecer una perspectiva

cer una perspectiva 
nacional de estos desafíos, aumentar la conciencia de los problemas a nivel nacional y, quizás, identificar 
áreas para enfocar las mejoras de bioseguridad para reducir el riesgo potencial de la HPAI en las granjas 
comerciales
Para entender mejor las perspectivas de la industria de las áreas de bioseguridad que pueden ser difíciles 
de implementar, ambos estudios preguntaron a los participantes que tan difícil es para los productores 
alcanzar diversos objetivos de bioseguridad (nada, poco, algo, bastante o extremadamente difícil). Las 
infografías de las Figuras 2–7 presentan los resultados combinados de todas las granjas participantes de 
pavo y huevos de mesa (de caso y de control). Debido al pequeño tamaño de la muestra en algunas de las 
categorías de respuesta, se combinaron los niveles “bastante” y “extremadamente” difícil en el análisis. En 
los siguientes gráficos, los números pueden no sumar 100 por el redondeo.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus is an emerging disease in cattle. Federal and State 
agencies are moving quickly to conduct additional testing for HPAI (H5N1) virus, including viral genome 
sequencing to provide a better understanding of the situation to characterize the HPAI (H5N1) virus strain 
or strains associated with these detections as well as other components of this disease event at the 
connection between animals, people, and the environment. The genetic and epidemiological data indicate 
spillover of the virus from wild birds to dairy cows and some instances of spread from dairy to dairy and 
from dairy premises to poultry premises. Based on this analysis, we have learned that the whole genome 
sequence for virus found in positive herds in 8 states and on two recent commercial poultry premises in 
two different states indicates it is the same strain affecting both dairy cattle and poultry. While it is still 
unclear exactly how virus is spreading, the virus is shed in milk at high concentrations; therefore, anything 
that comes in contact with unpasteurized raw milk, spilled milk, etc. may spread the virus including other 
animals, vehicles, and other objects or materials. Therefore, both dairy and poultry producers should re- 
double biosecurity efforts and be vigilant about monitoring for and controlling disease in their herds and 
flocks. 
Additionally, in order to continue to monitor and understand the extent of this virus and reduce the risk of 
further spread of HPAI H5N1, resulting in greater threats to poultry and livestock, APHIS issued a

 producers should re- 
double biosecurity efforts and be vigilant about monitoring for and controlling disease in their herds and 
flocks. 
Additionally, in order to continue to monitor and understand the extent of this virus and reduce the risk of 
further spread of HPAI H5N1, resulting in greater threats to poultry and livestock, APHIS issued a Federal  
Order on April 24, 2024 that requires premovement testing for lactating dairy cattle moving interstate and 
reporting of positive test results from all laboratories and State Animal Health Officials (SAHO). This 
document outlines both the interstate movement requirements, as well as APHIS recommendations to 
limit the spread. Updated laboratory guidance, including details on required reporting, are located on the 
APHIS website. 
 
Our goal is to safeguard the health of U.S. livestock and poultry, protect the industry, keep our food supply 
safe, and protect public health and human safety based on the most up-to-date information we have. We 
continue to work diligently to understand the risk factors associated with this virus, transmission routes, 
and pathogenicity in cattle. This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation. USDA and Federal and State 
partners will continue to share additional updates as soon as information becomes available. 
 
Scope and Deﬁnitions 
Per the Federal Order, these steps are immediately required for lactating dairy cattle. Any requirements for 
other classes of dairy cattle, or expansion beyond dairy cattle, will be based on scientific factors concerning 
the virus and its evolving risk profile. 
Definitions used in this document: 
• Cattle – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of members of the

, or expansion beyond dairy cattle, will be based on scientific factors concerning 
the virus and its evolving risk profile. 
Definitions used in this document: 
• Cattle – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of members of the 
Family: Bovidae; Subfamily: bovinae; Genus: Bos; Species: Bos taurus and Bos indicus. 
• Lactating – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of dairy cows 
currently in one of the lactation phases (i.e., early, mid, and late) of their current production cycle. 
• Dairy – The requirements outlined within this guidance apply to the movement of lactating cattle 
breeds raised for the primary purpose of milk production. 
• Nonlactating – Nonlactating cattle include: heifers, dry cows, and bull calves. 
• Affected herd – Any dairy cattle herd with suspect, presumptive, or confirmed positive cattle cases 
present as defined in the case definition, or exposed cattle present. 
• Exposed cattle – Any cattle that have been on the same premises as an affected herd within the 
3  
last 30 days (which is roughly equivalent to two incubation periods of influenza in other species; 
we currently have studies underway in cattle to better determine) and/or are epidemiologically 
connected. 
• Herd – Any group of one or more animals maintained on common ground 
 
Clinical Signs in Dairy Cattle 
See the case definition for a complete description. Briefly, dairy cattle may experience a sudden drop in 
feed intake; a marked drop in herd level milk production with some more severely affected cows having 
thickened milk or may have essentially no milk; subsequent acute drop in milk production; and respiratory 
signs including clear nasal discharge.

thickened milk or may have essentially no milk; subsequent acute drop in milk production; and respiratory 
signs including clear nasal discharge. 
 
A
PHIS Requirements for Interstate Movement of Cattle 
Interstate movements of lactating dairy cattle must follow the Federal requirements outlined below. 
Additionally, state-specific guidance for moving cattle must be followed. Clinical lactating dairy cattle are 
ineligible for interstate movement or movement to slaughter. 
Nonlactating dairy cattle – including heifers, dry cows, and bull calves – are not currently subject to testing 
for interstate movement due to their risk profile. 
Prior to interstate movement, lactating dairy cattle are required to receive a negative test for Influenza A 
virus at an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory using an NAHLN 
approved assay. 
 
Sample Collection and Testing for Interstate Premovement Testing of Lactating Dairy Cattle 
• Samples are to be collected by an accredited veterinarian, or a state licensed veterinarian, or a 
sample collector approved by the appropriate state animal health official. Designated individuals 
on production sites can be trained to collect milk samples and nasal swab samples for diagnostic 
testing. 
• Samples must be collected under the supervision of a licensed or accredited veterinarian or as 
determined by the respective State Animal Health Official. 
• Milk samples: Samples to be collected include milk/udder secretions from individual cows. Each 
quarter is sampled and combined into one sample for submission to the laboratory. Submissions 
must be between 3-10 ml of milk per animal. 
Text Len: 1899

 be collected under the supervision of a licensed or accredited veterinarian or as 
determined by the respective State Animal Health Official. 
• Milk samples: Samples to be collected include milk/udder secretions from individual cows. Each 
quarter is sampled and combined into one sample for submission to the laboratory. Submissions 
must be between 3-10 ml of milk per animal. 
o Pooling of milk samples can be done only at the laboratory. 
• For groups/lots of 30 or fewer animals moving interstate, all animals being moved must be tested. 
If more than 30 animals are moving interstate, then only 30 animals total must be tested. 
• Sample collection and testing must take place no more than seven (7) days prior to interstate 
movement. 
• Samples for interstate premovement testing need to be submitted to an approved National Animal 
Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) Laboratory for testing. NAHLN laboratories will conduct 
NAHLN-approved PCR testing: FluA matrix, H5 and optionally 2.3.4.4b. Please see HPAI Livestock 
Testing Recommendations f or details.  
4  
• APHIS will reimburse for all interstate premovement testing at NAHLN laboratories; therefore, this 
testing at NAHLN laboratories will be completed at no cost to the producer/submitter. 
• At this time, APHIS is not reimbursing for sample collection or shipping. 
 
For Cattle with Positive HPAI Test Results 
• Lactating dairy cattle from herds which have tested positive for Influenza A are not eligible for 
interstate movement for thirty (30) days from the most recent collection of any sample that tests 
positive from any individual animal in the herd. After the 30-day period, animals must be tested 
Text Len: 1683

For Cattle with Positive HPAI Test Results 
• Lactating dairy cattle from herds which have tested positive for Influenza A are not eligible for 
interstate movement for thirty (30) days from the most recent collection of any sample that tests 
positive from any individual animal in the herd. After the 30-day period, animals must be tested 
again for movement. 
• If there are specific circumstances for isolating test-positive cattle and moving to another premises 
across state lines, this would need to be discussed and agreed upon with the respective State 
Animal Health Officials and APHIS. 
 
Cattle Moved Directly to Slaughter 
• Nonclinical lactating dairy cattle moving interstate direct to slaughter are not required to have a 
premovement test but must move on a certificate of veterinary inspection or other documentation 
of movement approved by the sending and receiving state animal health officials and provided to 
the sending and receiving state animal health officials. 
• Clinical lactating dairy cattle are ineligible for interstate movement or movement to slaughter. 
 
Certiﬁcates of Veterinary Inspection 
The interstate movement of all lactating dairy cattle must be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary 
Inspection (CVI) per 9 CFR Part 86, Animal Disease Traceability. The destination/receiving state(s) will 
continue to use CVIs as a basis to track the interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle. 
• All cattle on the CVI must have individual official identification. 
• The individual official identification must be recorded on the CVI. 
• The CVI must include a statement that the cattle are both free from, and have not been exposed 
to, a known contagious and infectious disease. 
 
Exhibition/Show Dairy Cattle   
Requirements above for premovement
Text Len: 1797
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 on the CVI must have individual official identification. 
• The individual official identification must be recorded on the CVI. 
• The CVI must include a statement that the cattle are both free from, and have not been exposed 
to, a known contagious and infectious disease. 
 
Exhibition/Show Dairy Cattle   
Requirements above for premovement testing and CVIs apply to dairy cattle moving interstate to 
exhibitions/shows. Animals moving interstate to an exhibition, show, or sale must have a negative test 
result from samples collected within 7 days of movement. These animals may travel to their home herd 
using the same negative test result provided the exhibition, show, or sale does not exceed 10 days of 
length. See also Recommendations to Minimize Influenza Transmission at Dairy Cattle Livestock Exhibitions. 
 
APHIS Recommendations 
Additional detailed actions are provided later in this document, subject to updates as information is 
gathered. 
 
Cattle Movement Recommendations. In addition to the interstate movement requirements above, APHIS 
provides the following recommendations.  
• APHIS strongly recommends minimizing movement of cattle as much as possible, with special 
5  
attention to evaluating risk and factoring that risk into movement decisions. 
• If you have any animals with clinical signs on the premises, do not move animals off the premises. 
• All animals that move on/off a premises should be isolated for 30 days to prevent the spread of 
disease. 
• If cattle must be moved, we strongly encourage extreme diligence by producers, veterinarians, 
and States to ensure only healthy cattle are moving and to ensure the validity of interstate 
health certificates. APHIS stands ready to assist SAHOs with developing language for interstate 
certificates of veterinary

 isolated for 30 days to prevent the spread of 
disease. 
• If cattle must be moved, we strongly encourage extreme diligence by producers, veterinarians, 
and States to ensure only healthy cattle are moving and to ensure the validity of interstate 
health certificates. APHIS stands ready to assist SAHOs with developing language for interstate 
certificates of veterinary inspection, as needed. 
• APHIS recommends premovement testing of non-lactating cattle as well. This testing at NAHLN 
laboratories will be completed at no cost to the producer. Additional recommendations for 
testing can be found here. 
• State-specific guidance for moving cattle will also need to be followed. 
• APHIS scientists are working to establish testing protocols, rapidly assessing currently available 
tests and test performance including sample types to better understand the characteristics; based 
on this analysis, we may recommend testing for other classes of cattle beyond lactating dairy cows 
in the future. 
• SAHOs should consider adopting the federal testing and movement requirements described above 
for intrastate movements of lactating dairy cattle to exhibitions or shows.

iosecurity. Producers should implement enhanced biosecurity practices for keeping disease off farms and 
controlling disease spread on the farm. The Secure Milk Supply Plan is a collaborative initiative among the dairy 
industry, USDA, State officials and three universities. The Secure Milk Supply website offers comprehensive 
materials on dairy biosecurity practices, including posters and information sheets in English and Spanish.

APHIS Recommendations for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 Virus in Livestock for State 
Animal Health Officials, Accredited Veterinarians and Producers:  
• Monitoring for Sick Animals. Producers should monitor herds closely for cattle with clinical signs of 
disease. 
• Movement of Cattle. Movement of cattle should be minimized; movement of cattle should be 
focused on preventing movement of disease. 
• Vehicles, Equipment, and People on the Farm. Producers should limit the movement of vehicles and 
visitors on and off livestock and poultry premises and establish dedicated routes for vehicles that do 
come onto the premises. 
• Wildlife Management. Producers should monitor and report any odd behaviors and die offs in 
domestic and wild animals immediately. 
• Dairy Cattle Shows. Organizers and exhibitors should practice strict biosecurity practices for 
animals and equipment to include frequent cleaning and disinfecting all equipment, avoiding 
contact with other animals, isolating animals and observing for illness upon return from 
shows.  
 
6  
Disposal of Deceased Birds, Cats, and Other Small Animals  
• Producers should wear disposable gloves when handling any carcasses of birds or animals 
found on the farm.   
• If

 all equipment, avoiding 
contact with other animals, isolating animals and observing for illness upon return from 
shows.  
 
6  
Disposal of Deceased Birds, Cats, and Other Small Animals  
• Producers should wear disposable gloves when handling any carcasses of birds or animals 
found on the farm.   
• If there has been any potential human or animal exposure to rabies, contact your local health 
department for instructions; any cats that demonstrate neurologic signs should be submitted 
to the local public health laboratory for rabies testing.   
• Producers should work with their veterinarian to submit dead birds and cats to a NAHLN 
laboratory for influenza testing.   
• If dead cats cannot be submitted for rabies or influenza testing, thoroughly spray carcass with 
Virkon or equivalent disinfectant, double-bag and dispose in accordance with local and State 
laws. See AVMA guidelines or consult a veterinarian for animal carcass disposal practices.  
 
Milk Safety. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends special attention to raw milk safety and 
handling practices for discarded milk. Additional resources available at Questions and Answers Regarding  
Milk Safety During Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Outbreaks | FDA. 
• Safety of Feeding Waste or Discarded Milk to Animals. The FDA recommends producers discard milk 
from symptomatic cows. Young calves are susceptible to disease and disease-causing pathogens can 
be transmitted through raw milk. If milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those 
infected with HPAI A (H5N1), cannot be discarded and is intended to be used to feed calves (or other 
animals, such as farm cats), the FDA strongly encourages that it be heat treated to kill

 susceptible to disease and disease-causing pathogens can 
be transmitted through raw milk. If milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those 
infected with HPAI A (H5N1), cannot be discarded and is intended to be used to feed calves (or other 
animals, such as farm cats), the FDA strongly encourages that it be heat treated to kill harmful 
bacteria or viruses, such as influenza, before calf feeding. This heat treatment should be similar to 
times and temperatures commonly found in commercial milk pasteurization processing. 
• Safety of Unpasteurized Milk and Dairy Products for Human Consumption. Raw milk and raw milk 
dairy products should not be sold or distributed for human consumption. 
• Disposal of Discarded Milk. Disposal of milk should be handled in such a way as to prevent exposure 
to other animals. The FDA recommends producers take precautions when discarding milk from 
affected cows so that the discarded milk does not become a source of further spread. Producers 
should consult with their state regulatory authorities for specific recommendations or requirements, 
however, such precautions could include heat-treatment or pasteurization of discarded milk prior to 
dumping in lagoons or application of waste solids and ensuring biosecurity around lagoons (e.g., 
ensuring that animals and birds do not have access to lagoons). 
• Segregation of Milk from Infected Lactating Cows: Maximal care should be taken to segregate 
lactating cows known to be actively infected with H5N1 so their milk does not enter the food supply, 
consistent with the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.

 to segregate 
lactating cows known to be actively infected with H5N1 so their milk does not enter the food supply, 
consistent with the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance. 
One Health: Agriculture and Public Health Collaboration. Monitoring farmers and farm workers with 
exposure to infected cattle is important to human and animal health. APHIS will continue to share 
information from their investigations as they coordinate with CDC, as has been standard procedure with 
influenza in poultry and swine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with state 
and local health departments to continue to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected 
or potentially infected animals and test those people who develop symptoms. 
 
People exposed to HPAI A (H5N1)-infected cattle, birds, or other animals (including people wearing 
recommended PPE) should be monitored daily for signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness 
7  
beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Farms with HPAI-positive 
herds should implement farm-administered daily active monitoring using a simple symptom survey, that 
CDC provides to state and local public health agencies and that can also be made available directly to 
farmers. 
On a daily basis, farms should share the aggregate number of staff who may have been exposed to 
infected cattle or other animals and are now being monitored for symptoms to a local public health 
department to a local public health department to maintain awareness of possible spillover infection. 
 
Symptomatic persons should be referred to local public health for prompt medical evaluation, testing, and 
treatment, such as initiation of antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) as soon as possible.

Symptomatic persons should be referred to local public health for prompt medical evaluation, testing, and 
treatment, such as initiation of antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) as soon as possible. 
Additional information related to public health monitoring and preventing exposures to H5N1 are available 
on CDC’s website. 
People should take steps to reduce the risk of infection with avian influenza A viruses associated with 
working with animals or materials like raw milk. Farms should follow CDC’s guidance for workers, including 
the use of personal protective equipment to minimize the risk of on farm HPAI transmission. These 
recommendations and additional information can be found at the links below: 
 Recommendations for Worker Protection and Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to  
Reduce Exposure to Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease in Humans | Avian  
Influenza (Flu) (cdc.gov) 
 Prevention and Antiviral Treatment of Bird Flu Viruses in People | Avian Influenza (Flu) (cdc.gov) 
 
Producers with positive herds are encouraged to collaborate with local and state public health agencies, 
for example, permitting public health access conduct on-farm activities. Human and animal health experts 
have a pressing need to better understand the spread of H5N1 and how the virus manifests and might 
impact both animal and human health. There is no substitute for capturing real-time information from 
farmers and farmworkers who are or have experienced symptoms through surveys and monitoring of key 
health indicators. Willing producers and farmworkers should contact their local public health agency.

El virus H5N1 de la influenza aviar altamente patógena A (HPAI, por sus siglas en inglés) es una 
enfermedad emergente en el ganado vacuno. Las agencias federales y estatales están actuando 
rápidamente para llevar a cabo pruebas adicionales para el virus HPAI (H5N1), incluyendo la secuenciación 
del genoma viral para proporcionar una mejor comprensión de la situación para caracterizar la cepa o 
cepas del virus HPAI (H5N1) asociadas con estas detecciones, así como otros componentes de este evento 
de enfermedad en la conexión entre los animales, las personas y el medio ambiente. Los datos genéticos y 
epidemiológicos indican la propagación del virus de las aves silvestres a las vacas lecheras y algunos casos

lisis, hemos comprobado que la secuencia del genoma completo del virus encontrado en rebaños 
con resultados positivos en 8 estados y en dos instalaciones avícolas comerciales recientes en dos estados 
diferentes, indica que se trata de la misma cepa que afecta tanto al ganado vacuno lechero como a las 
aves de corral. Aunque todavía no está claro cómo se propaga exactamente, el virus se desprende en la 
leche en altas concentraciones; por tanto, cualquier cosa que entre en contacto con leche cruda no 
pasteurizada, leche derramada, etc. puede propagar el virus, incluidos otros animales, vehículos y otros 
objetos o materiales. Por lo tanto, tanto los productores lácteos como los avícolas deben redoblar los 
esfuerzos de bioseguridad y estar atentos al monitoreo y control de las enfermedades en sus rebaños y 
bandadas. 
Además, con el fin de continuar monitoreando y entendiendo el alcance de este virus y reducir el riesgo de 
una mayor propagación del virus H5N1 de la HPAI, lo que resultaría en mayores amenazas para las aves de 
corral y el ganado, el APHIS emitió una orden federal  el 24 de abril de 2024 que requiere pruebas previas

Requisitos del APHIS para el traslado interestatal de ganado vacuno 
Los movimientos interestatales de ganado vacuno lechero en lactación deben seguir los requisitos federales 
que se describen a continuación. Además, deben seguirse las guías específicas de cada estado para el 
traslado de ganado vacuno. El ganado vacuno lechero en lactación en estado clínico no es elegible para el 
traslado interestatal ni para el traslado con destino al matadero. 
El ganado vacuno lechero no lactante --incluidas las novillas, las vacas secas y los terneros-- no está sujeto 
actualmente a pruebas para el traslado interestatal debido a su perfil de riesgo. 
Antes del traslado interestatal, se requiere que el ganado vacuno lechero lactante reciba una prueba 
negativa para el virus de la influenza A en un laboratorio aprobado de la Red Nacional de Laboratorios de 
Sanidad Animal (NAHLN, por sus siglas en inglés) u tilizando un an

Recogida y análisis de muestras para las pruebas previas al traslado interestatal de ganado vacuno lechero 
en lactancia  
• Las muestras deben ser recogidas por un veterinario acreditado, o un veterinario con licencia 
estatal, o un recolector de muestras aprobado por el funcionario de sanidad animal estatal 
correspondiente. Los individuos designados en los sitios de producción pueden recibir 
adiestramiento para recoger muestras de leche y muestras de hisopos nasales para pruebas de 
diagnóstico. 
• Las muestras deben recogerse bajo la supervisión de un veterinario autorizado o acreditado o 
según determine el respectivo funcionario estatal de sanidad animal.

• Muestras de leche: las muestras que deben recogerse incluyen leche/secreciones de la ubre de 
vacas individuales. Cada trimestre se toma una muestra y se combina en una sola muestra para 
enviarla al laboratorio. Los envíos deben tener entre 3 y 10 ml de leche por animal. 
o La mezcla de muestras de leche solamente puede hacerse en el laboratorio. 
• En el caso de grupos o lotes de 30 animales o menos que se trasladen interestatalmente, todos 
los animales que se trasladen deberán someterse a pruebas. Si son más de 30 los animales que se 
trasladan interestatalmente, solamente deberán someterse a pruebas 30 animales en total. 
• La recogida de muestras y la realización de pruebas deben efectuarse como máximo siete (7) 
días antes del traslado interestatal. 
• Las muestras para las pruebas interestatales previas al traslado deben presentarse a un 
laboratorio aprobado de la Red Nacional de Laboratorios de Sanidad Animal (NAHLN) para su 
análisis. Los laboratorios de la NAHLN realizarán las pruebas PCR aprobadas por la NAHLN: Matriz

Recomendaciones para el traslado de ganado vacuno. Además de los requisitos de traslado interestatal 
arriba mencionados, el APHIS hace las siguientes recomendaciones.  
• El APHIS recomienda encarecidamente minimizar el traslado de ganado vacuno en la medida 
de lo posible, prestando especial atención a la evaluación del riesgo y teniendo en cuenta 
dicho riesgo a la hora de tomar decisiones sobre los traslados. 
• Si tiene animales con signos clínicos en las instalaciones, no los traslade fuera de ellas. 
• Todos los animales que entren o salgan de las instalaciones deben aislarse durante 30 días 
para evitar la propagación de enfermedades. 
• Si es necesario trasladar ganado vacuno, recomendamos encarecidamente que los 
productores, los veterinarios y los estados act

para evitar la propagación de enfermedades. 
• Si es necesario trasladar ganado vacuno, recomendamos encarecidamente que los 
productores, los veterinarios y los estados actúen con la máxima diligencia para garantizar que 
solamente se traslada ganado vacuno sano y para asegurar la validez de los certificados 
sanitarios interestatales. APHIS está listo para asistir a los SAHO en el desarrollo de lenguaje 
para los certificados interestatales de inspección veterinaria, según sea necesario. 
• El APHIS recomienda que también se realicen pruebas previas al traslado del ganado vacuno 
no lactante. Estas pruebas en los laboratorios de la NAHLN se realizarán sin costo alguno para 
el productor. Encontrará recomendaciones adicionales para las pruebas aquí. 
• También habrá que seguir las guías específicas de cada estado para el traslado de ganado vacuno.

• Los científicos del APHIS están trabajando para establecer protocolos de pruebas, evaluando 
rápidamente las pruebas disponibles en la actualidad y el rendimiento de las mismas, incluidos los 
tipos de muestras, para comprender mejor las características; basándonos en este análisis, es 
posible que en el futuro recomendemos la realización de pruebas para otras clases de ganado 
vacuno, más allá de las vacas lecheras lactantes. 
 
Bioseguridad. Los productores deben implementar prácticas de bioseguridad mejoradas para mantener 
las enfermedades fuera de las granjas y controlar la propagación de enfermedades en la granja. El Plan de 
Suministro Seguro de Leche e s una iniciativa de colaboración entre la industria lechera, el USDA, 
funcionarios estatales y tres universidades. La página web de Suministro Seguro de Leche ofrece

Recomendaciones del APHIS para el virus H5N1 de la influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI) en el 
ganado para funcionarios estatales de sanidad animal, veterinarios acreditados y productores: 
• Monitoreo de animales enfermos. Los productores deben vigilar de cerca los rebaños en busca de 
ganado vacuno con signos clínicos de enfermedad. 
• Traslado de ganado vacuno. El traslado de ganado vacuno debe reducirse al mínimo; el 
traslado de ganado vacuno debe centrarse en prevenir el traslado de enfermedades. 
• Vehículos, equipos y personas en la granja. Los productores deben limitar el movimiento de 
vehículos y visitantes dentro y fuera de las instalaciones ganaderas y avícolas y establecer rutas

• Vehículos, equipos y personas en la granja. Los productores deben limitar el movimiento de 
vehículos y visitantes dentro y fuera de las instalaciones ganaderas y avícolas y establecer rutas 
específicas para los vehículos que entren en las instalaciones. 
• Manejo de la vida silvestre. Los productores deben monitorear y notificar inmediatamente 
cualquier comportamiento extraño o muerte de animales domésticos o salvajes. 
Seguridad de la leche. La Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) 
recomienda prestar especial atención a la seguridad de la leche cruda y a las prácticas de manejo de la 
leche desechada. Recursos adicionales disponibles en Preguntas y respuestas sobre seguridad de la leche 
durante los brotes de la Influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI) | FDA.  
• Seguridad al alimentar animales con leche de desperdicio o desechada. La FDA recomienda a los 
productores que desechen la leche de las vacas sintomáticas. Los terneros jóvenes son susceptibles 
de contraer enfermedades y los patógenos causantes de enfermedades pueden transmitirse a través

icio o desechada. La FDA recomienda a los 
productores que desechen la leche de las vacas sintomáticas. Los terneros jóvenes son susceptibles 
de contraer enfermedades y los patógenos causantes de enfermedades pueden transmitirse a través 
de la leche cruda. Si la leche procedente de vacas que presentan síntomas de enfermedad, incluidas 
las infectadas con la HPAI A (H5N1), no puede desecharse y se destina a alimentar a terneros (u otros 
animales, como gatos de la granja), la FDA recomienda encarecidamente que se someta a un 
tratamiento térmico para eliminar bacterias o virus nocivos, como el de la influenza, antes de 
alimentar un ternero. Este tratamiento térmico debe ser similar a los tiempos y temperaturas 
habituales en el proceso comercial de pasteurización de la leche. 
• Seguridad de la leche y los productos lácteos no pasteurizados destinados al consumo humano. 
La leche cruda y los productos lácteos a base de leche cruda no deben venderse ni distribuirse 
para el consumo humano. 
• Eliminación de la leche desechada. La eliminación de la leche debe realizarse de forma que se evite

• Eliminación de la leche desechada. La eliminación de la leche debe realizarse de forma que se evite 
la exposición a otros animales. La FDA recomienda a los productores que tomen precauciones al 
desechar la leche de las vacas afectadas para que no se convierta en una fuente de propagación. Los 
productores deben consultar con las autoridades reguladoras de su estado para obtener 
recomendaciones o requisitos específicos, sin embargo, tales precauciones podrían incluir el 
tratamiento térmico o la pasteurización de la leche desechada antes de verterla en las lagunas o la 
aplicación de sólidos de desecho y garantizar la bioseguridad alrededor de las lagunas (por ejemplo, 
garantizar que los animales y las aves no tengan acceso a las mismas). 
• Segregación de la leche de vacas lactantes infectadas. Se debe tener el máximo cuidado para 
segregar a las vacas lactantes que se sabe que están activamente infectadas con H5N1 para que su 
leche no entre en el suministro de alimentos, de acuerdo con la Ordenanza de Leche Pasteurizada.

One Health: colaboración entre agricultura y salud pública. Monitorear a los granjeros y a los 
trabajadores de las granjas con exposición a ganado vacuno infectado es importante para la salud humana 
y animal. El APHIS seguirá compartiendo la información de sus investigaciones en coordinación con los 
Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés),  como ha sido el 
7  
procedimiento habitual con la influenza en aves de corral y cerdos. Los Centros para el Control y la 
Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) están trabajando con los departamentos de salud estatales y locales 
para seguir monitoreando a los trabajadores que puedan haber estado en contacto con animales 
infectados o potencialmente infectados y realizar pruebas a las personas que desarrollen síntomas.

Las personas expuestas a ganado vacuno, aves u otros animales infectados por el HPAI A (H5N1) [incluidas las 
personas que lleven puesto el equipo de protección personal (PPE, por sus siglas en inglés) recomendado] 
deben ser monitoreadas diariamente para detectar signos y síntomas de enfermedad respiratoria aguda a 
partir de su primera exposición y durante 10 días después de su última exposición. Las granjas con rebaños 
que den positivo a la HPAI deben implementar un monitoreo activo diario realizado en la granja utilizando 
una simple encuesta de síntomas, que los CDC proporcionan a las agencias de salud pública estatales y 
locales y que también puede estar disponible directamente para los granjeros. 
Diariamente, las granjas deben compartir con un departamento de salud pública local el número total de 
personal que puede haber estado expuesto a ganado vacuno u otros animales infectados y que ahora está 
siendo monitoreado para detectar síntomas, con el fin de mantener la concienciación sobre la posible 
propagación de la infección.

Las personas sintomáticas deben ser referidas a la salud pública local para una rápida evaluación médica, 
pruebas y tratamiento, como el inicio del tratamiento antiviral con Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) lo antes posible. 
Hay disponible información adicional relacionada con el monitoreo de la salud pública y la prevención de 
exposiciones al virus H5N1 en la página web del CDC. 
Las personas deben adoptar medidas para reducir el riesgo de infección por los virus de la influenza aviar A 
asociados al trabajo con animales o materiales como la leche cruda. Las granjas deben seguir la guía de los 
CDC para los trabajadores, incluyendo el uso de equipos de protección personal para minimizar el riesgo de 
transmisión de la HPAI en la granja. Estas recomendaciones e información adicional pueden encontrarse en

Influenza aviar altamente patógena: 
Desafíos en la implementación de prácticas de 
bioseguridad para los productores comerciales 
de pavo y huevos de mesa Mayo de 2024 
INTRODUCCIÓN 
La influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI) es una enfermedad grave, altamente contagiosa y muchas 
veces fatal para pollos y pavos. El Servicio de Inspección Sanitaria de Animales y Plantas (APHIS) del 
Departamento de Agricultura de EE. UU. (USDA) hizo dos estudios para investigar los factores potenciales 
de riesgo de la introducción del virus de la HPAI en las granjas en el 2022. Un estudio se centró en las 
granjas comerciales que crían pavos para carne. El otro estudio se centró en las granjas comerciales de 
huevos de mesa, incluyendo de cría, de gallinas y de ponedoras de huevos de mesa. En el estudio de pavo 
participaron 125 granjas de 12 estados. Entre enero y octubre de 2022, se confirmaron casos positivos de 
HPAI en granjas de pavos. En el estudio de huevos de mesa participaron 40 granjas de 8 estados. Entre 
febrero y septiembre de 2022, se confirmaron casos positivos de HPAI en granjas de huevos de mesa. En

HPAI en granjas de pavos. En el estudio de huevos de mesa participaron 40 granjas de 8 estados. Entre 
febrero y septiembre de 2022, se confirmaron casos positivos de HPAI en granjas de huevos de mesa. En 
ambos estudios, se seleccionaron granjas de control de los mismos estados que las granjas de caso, pero 
las granjas de control no tenían HPAI durante el mismo período (Figura 1).

nacional de estos desafíos, aumentar la conciencia de los problemas a nivel nacional y, quizás, identificar 
áreas para enfocar las mejoras de bioseguridad para reducir el riesgo potencial de la HPAI en las granjas 
comerciales
Para entender mejor las perspectivas de la industria de las áreas de bioseguridad que pueden ser difíciles 
de implementar, ambos estudios preguntaron a los participantes que tan difícil es para los productores 
alcanzar diversos objetivos de bioseguridad (nada, poco, algo, bastante o extremadamente difícil). Las 
infografías de las Figuras 2–7 presentan los resultados combinados de todas las granjas participantes de 
pavo y huevos de mesa (de caso y de control). Debido al pequeño tamaño de la muestra en algunas de las 
categorías de respuesta, se combinaron los niveles “bastante” y “extremadamente” difícil en el análisis. En 
los siguientes gráficos, los números pueden no sumar 100 por el redondeo.

CONSIDERACIONES DE BIOSEGURIDAD PARA TRATAR LOS DESAFÍOS 
Considerando los factores de riesgo identificados en los estudios de control y de caso y los desafíos de 
bioseguridad que informaron los productores como se describe arriba, estas son algunas acciones con 
base científica para implementar en la granja. Los resultados de estos estudios también los puede usar la 
industria para ayudar a respaldar y tratar los desafíos más frecuentemente reportado que los productores 
identificaron en sus granjas. 
Mantenga el pienso seguro 
de los roedores y la fauna 
silvestre para prevenir la 
transmisión de la influenza 
aviar y otras enfermedades. 
Exija al personal que se cambie 
de ropa (incluyendo los zapatos) 
antes de ir a un establo diferente. 
Asigne a los trabajadores de la 
granja a establos específicos 
cuando sea posible. 
Limpie y desinfecte los
