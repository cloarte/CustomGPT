 Invasion: Female: Body 520-825 µm in length, slightly arcuate to variable postures when heat relaxed. Cuticle annulated, annuli can be about 2 µm at mid-body region, smaller than 2 µm at lip region but can be coarser (more than 2 µm) around tail terminus. Lateral field with four lateral lines forming three bands of more or less equal width, outer two lines often crenated and outer two bands can be sometimes areolated (reported for a population from Sudan by Zeidan and Geraert, 1990). Lip region broadly rounded, low, with 2-3 incisures seen on lateral sides under light microscope forming 3-4 annuli, often slightly set off from body by a weak depression, but may occasionally seem continuous. Labial region weakly sclerotized. Stylet 17-23 µm long with distinct cone and shaft and rounded knobs which appear sloping towards posterior direction. DGO 2-4 µm from knobs. Median bulb ovoid with clear valves. Secretory-excretory (SE) pore often at pharyngeal isthmus level. Hemizonid may be seen just above SE pore.

 developmental stages can be grouped into embryonic and postembryonic phases with the former lasting from oviposition to up to 145 h (hatching of J2) and the latter lasting from 7 days to 25 days after oviposition. Gravid females generally with a single egg in uterus were found ovipositing in distilled water within 10 h of extraction from soil, but also sometimes retained eggs for 2-3 days. Eggs were usually single-celled at the time of oviposition and the two-, three-, four-, five-cell, blastula and gastrula stages were formed at 16, 20, 24, 27, 63 and 83 h, respectively, after oviposition. At 5 and 7 days, the moving J1 and J2 stages were completely formed, respectively. On the 7 th day, hatching was observed for the first time. The 2 nd , 3 rd and 4 th stage juveniles and adults appeared 7, 13, 19 and 25 days after inoculation, respectively. The life cycle from egg to adult was completed in 25 days. The feeding behaviour of this nematode was studied by Coates-Beckford (1982b) on aseptically grown 10-17 days old seedlings of ‘Newport’ Kentucky bluegrass ( Poa pratensis ) and three-day-old seedlings of red clover ( Trifolium pratense ). The feeding behaviour was found to be similar on both plant species which usually began by penetration of cell wall by the nematode stylet after 3-10 rapid, irregular probes. After this, an opaque mass started accumulating around stylet tip in bluegrass cell indicating salivation of the nematode parasite. During stylet penetration and ingestion, the nematodes assumed a feeding position typical for stunt nematodes, i.e. head was positioned at a right angle to the longitudinal axis of the root surface whereas the posterior body laid against

During stylet penetration and ingestion, the nematodes assumed a feeding position typical for stunt nematodes, i.e. head was positioned at a right angle to the longitudinal axis of the root surface whereas the posterior body laid against the surface. Only the stylet tip was found inserted into the cell and the stylet angle was altered occasionally. During ingestion, the median bulb also continuously pulsated rhythmically. All juvenile stages and adults were found to be able to feed. The reported duration of feeding was 15 sec-4.5 min after which nematodes moved away from feeding sites and continued moving around the root system. Exceptionally, two nematodes were found feeding for about 30 min after which they migrated away from the feeding site and remained motionless for over 1 h. Subsequently, the nematodes moved away from the vicinity of the root ( Coates-Beckford, 1982b ). Nematodes were found to always feed singly and ectoparasitically, usually on epidermal cells in the root hair zone of clover and at all regions, except the tips, of bluegrass roots which bore root hairs over the entire surface. They also occasionally probed on root hair of bluegrass and root cap cells of clover. Individuals that were starved for 1 and 2 months started probing cells within 10 min of arriving at the root surface unlike the freshly extracted nematodes which wandered about most of the time ( Coates-Beckford, 1982b ). Based on a study conducted by Sikora et al.

The effects of three nematode species, T. crassicaudatus , P. penetrans and Meloidogyne naasi , on top growth of the host was also found additive. Furthermore, T. crassicaudatus (= T. agri ) was found to inhabit population increase of M. naasi in the host due to nematode-nematode competition but not vice versa. Also, high populations of T. crassicaudatus (= T. agri ) and Paratrichodorus minor (= Nanidorus minor ) together reduced infection by M. naasi on red clover ( Sikora et al., 1979 ).
 Sintomas: Plant hosts may show reduced growth of roots and shoots, stunting and chlorosis due to infestation by T. crassicaudatus .
