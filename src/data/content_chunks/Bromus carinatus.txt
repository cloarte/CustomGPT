This is a bunchgrass native in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast regions.The plant grows up to 4 feet. Leaf blades are up to 8 inches long, about 0.5inch wide. It produces large quantities of leafy forage, relished by all kindsof livestock while immature. The mature foliage is less palatable, but the seedheads are palatable and nutritious. The plant is relatively short lived.
