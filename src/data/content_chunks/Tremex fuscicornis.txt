 Reproduccion: The biology of T. fuscicornis is only partially known. However, general descriptions of the biology of siricids are available ( Smith and Schiff, 2002 ). These insects live in true symbiosis with basidiomycete fungi, which are capable of degrading lignin, concentrating nutritive elements in their mycelia, which are scarce in wood, and serve as food for the larvae. These feed and develop inside the tree, compromising the heartwood, until reaching pupation. The mitochondrial genome of T. fuscicornis was published by Park et al. (2020) , who also found the taxon to be phylogenetically well-supported. Adult wasps often mate in the upper branches of trees ( USDA-APHIS, 2011 ). Females then select stressed or injured trees to begin egg laying. A description of the oviposition and hatching behaviour can be found in Suttrop (2006) . The females will lay 300-400 eggs and will usually die in oviposition ( Isebrands and Richardson, 2014 ). Eggs are placed perpendicularly and at an oblique angle, so that they are separate in the wood, but grouped together. The sex ratio is usually 1:1 ( Isebrands and Richardson, 2014 ). When the first-instar larvae emerge, they exclusively feed on the hyphae of the developing symbiont fungus. Later the larvae construct longitudinal, semi-circular galleries, which can run either upwards or downwards. The total length of a gallery is approximately 1 m and it gradually increases in diameter as the larvae grow. Pupation occurs inside the wood at a depth of approximately 4 cm from the bark surface.

 larvae emerge, they exclusively feed on the hyphae of the developing symbiont fungus. Later the larvae construct longitudinal, semi-circular galleries, which can run either upwards or downwards. The total length of a gallery is approximately 1 m and it gradually increases in diameter as the larvae grow. Pupation occurs inside the wood at a depth of approximately 4 cm from the bark surface. Adult emergence occurs over an extended period from summer to autumn (October to May). Due to the prolonged period of adult emergence, it is possible to encounter all life stages during much of the growing season. In Germany, most sightings occur in August and September ( Sonnenburg, 2022 ). Parra et al. (2005) , through studies of the emergence of adults for two regions of Chile, determined that this species appears in two well-defined seasons of the year, the most important peak being recorded in the month of November. They found that T. fuscicornis exhibits phenological variation depending on studied locality ( Parra et al., 2007 ). Depending on the wood wasp species and latitude, larval development can take 1-3 years before the adult emerges, usually in late summer or fall. Considering this species is univoltine, and taking into account the observations by Parra et al. (2005; 2007), the adult phase lasts less than 1 year. Males emerge and disperse first, possibly to prevent inbreeding, and cluster high in trees; when the females emerge they fly towards them to mate ( Schiff et al., 2006 ). The females use their long ovipositor to deposit eggs in the cambium layer of host trees. The female simultaneously inoculates a phytotoxic mucus and a fungus into a tree. The larvae will hatch in 3-4 weeks and will feed on the hyphae of Cerrena unicolor . Later, they will tunnel into the tree toward the xylem, creating galleries. When the larvae reach the

itor to deposit eggs in the cambium layer of host trees. The female simultaneously inoculates a phytotoxic mucus and a fungus into a tree. The larvae will hatch in 3-4 weeks and will feed on the hyphae of Cerrena unicolor . Later, they will tunnel into the tree toward the xylem, creating galleries. When the larvae reach the final instar, they will tunnel to the edge of the tree to pupate ( Isebrands and Richardson, 2014 ), with pupation usually occurring about 4 cm from the bark surface. According to Whitman and Hodges (2016) , one tree is capable of harbouring 2000 adult wasps. When the first-instar larvae emerge, they exclusively feed on the hyphae of the developing symbiont fungus (Pažoutová and Šrůtka, 2007). In general, adult wood wasps live exclusively on escaping tree sap ( Reder, 2010 ). However, based on other wasps in the same family, it has been assumed that T. fuscicornis adults do not feed ( Whitman and Hodges, 2016 ). A report from Finland suggests that the symbiotic fungus associated with T. fuscicornis may be Bjerkandera fumosa ( Savela, 1998 ). Meanwhile, in Chile and in the Czech Republic, the basidiomycete C. unicolor is the fungus spread through spores and mycelia stored in two sacs or mycangia located in the abdominal cavity of the female ( Palma et al., 2005 ; Pažoutová and Šrůtka, 2007). During oviposition, the female lays her eggs on the cambium layer and simultaneously inoculates spores of the fungus and injects a phytotoxic mucus (Pažoutová and Šrůtka, 2007). This

During oviposition, the female lays her eggs on the cambium layer and simultaneously inoculates spores of the fungus and injects a phytotoxic mucus (Pažoutová and Šrůtka, 2007). This lesion as a whole produces the decay of the colonized trees. In Chile, Parra et al. (2007) found that the populations of T. fuscicornis exhibit phenological variation depending on the studied locality, but little information is available on the environmental requirements of this species. Although it is recorded from many localities over Eurasia, studies do not mention any climatic preferences.
 Sintomas: The symptoms of attack by T. fuscicornis in dead and dying trees are limited to the presence of round adult emergence holes, approximately 5-6 mm in diameter ( Ciesla, 2003 ), in trees where this insect has completed its life cycle. Larvae bore through wood while feeding. Additionally, the fungal symbiont of T. fuscicornis causes wood decay. Trees may have dark patches on the bark from sap production caused by larval feeding ( Isebrands and Richardson, 2014 ). Infected trees exhibit many symptoms such as reduced growth, yellowing leaves, wilting leaves, branch and crown dieback, loose bark, sapwood discolouration, leaf and trunk necroses, structural weakening and tree death ( Whitman and Hodges, 2016 ).
