 X. dispar has been carried out in Europe. However, it seems probable that these studies are applicable to North America. X. dispar has one generation per year ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Schvester, 1954 ). The opinion of earlier authors, that X. dispar has two generations, may be due to the long flight period of the females and to some young and old females leaving the galleries in summer.As soon as the maximum daily temperature in spring reaches 18-20°C the female beetles start flying and searching for host plants. This is mostly in April/May, but sometimes as early as March ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Schvester, 1954 ; Roediger, 1956 ; Egger, 1973 ; Mani and Schwaller, 1983 ; Mani et al., 1990 , 1992; Schröder, 1996 ). The emergence of the females usually continues for 4-8 weeks depending on weather conditions.The main flight activity of the beetles is between 14:00 h and 16:00 h ( Mani et al., 1990 , 1992). In orchards with high populations, a distinct swarming of females was directly observed. Traps in open fields often caught many beetles, indicating that the beetles may fly over long distances. Catches of beetles in traps indicated that the flight in a shady forest started and finished later than in the adjacent orchard ( Mani et al., 1990 , 1992). A similar situation may be the cause of the unusually long period of trap catches (4 months) observed by Markalas and Kalapanida (1997) in a forest.After emergence, females may start boring in the same tree in which they have developed, if this is still in a suitable condition, or disperse to find another suitable host plant. The females first bore a short, radial entrance tunnel (1-3 cm deep) before excavating a transverse tunnel to either side. From each of these, cylindrical breeding galleries are

The females first bore a short, radial entrance tunnel (1-3 cm deep) before excavating a transverse tunnel to either side. From each of these, cylindrical breeding galleries are produced, directed perpendicularly both upwards and downwards ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Egger, 1973 ; Postner, 1974 ; Alford, 1984 ; Mani et al., 1990 ). In smaller trunks or in branches, the galleries are often simpler.Shortly after the beginning of boring, when the ambrosia fungus has become established, the female starts egg laying. The female then continues excavating the gallery and laying eggs. Larvae emerge a few days after oviposition. Adults and larvae feed on the fungus growing in the tunnels. In June/July pupation takes place and in July/August beetles of the new generation appear. Full development takes about 2 months. Due to the long flight and oviposition period of the females, different developmental stages may be found in a gallery at the same time. Teneral adults enter diapause and are unable to attack trees and to breed. The diapause is terminated during the winter ( Schvester, 1954 ).Beetles pass the winter in the breeding galleries, tightly packed one behind the other. The following spring, the young females of the new generation leave the gallery system through the parental entrance hole. Brother-sister mating takes place in the gallery. Males are unable to fly and usually die within the parental nest. However, it was noted long ago by Schneider-Orelli (1913) that males can sometimes be found in spring crawling on the bark of attacked trees, and may mate with overwintered females from other galleries. The ratio of males to females is very variable. Egg

 Brother-sister mating takes place in the gallery. Males are unable to fly and usually die within the parental nest. However, it was noted long ago by Schneider-Orelli (1913) that males can sometimes be found in spring crawling on the bark of attacked trees, and may mate with overwintered females from other galleries. The ratio of males to females is very variable. Egger (1973) found some galleries in which males outnumbered females, but more usually the sex ratio is biased towards females, from 1:5 to 1:15, and occasionally higher. The average number of beetles in a gallery is about 25, depending on the size and quality of the gallery, with a maximum of about 40 ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Schvester, 1954 ; Egger, 1973 ).X. dispar belongs to the group of ambrosia beetles ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Francke-Grosmann, 1963 ; Batra, 1963 , 1967; French and Roeper, 1972 , 1975). The larvae are exclusively mycetophagous; they do not feed on wood, but on the symbiotic fungus Ambrosiella hartigii, which grows in the tunnels. It grows as a continuous palisade within the galleries of the active brood. A. hartigii has two growth forms. The ambrosial form (conidia and sprout cells) is produced in association with the insect and the mycelial form is produced in vitro without the insect. French and Roeper (1972) found that larvae feed on the mycelial form in vitro, but ambrosia is required by the larvae to develop and pupate. They also believe that the main mechanism for ambrosia induction and control involves a secretion of the insect. Oocyte development and oviposition occurred only after the post-diapause females had fed on the ambrosial form of the fungus. French and Roeper

They also believe that the main mechanism for ambrosia induction and control involves a secretion of the insect. Oocyte development and oviposition occurred only after the post-diapause females had fed on the ambrosial form of the fungus. French and Roeper (1975) also observed a tending and nursing behaviour of the females. The quality of the host tissues affects fungal growth.The fungus is transferred by the mother beetle to the new gallery in a mycangium ( Batra, 1963 , 1967). In X. dispar, the mycangia are paired, pocket-shaped organs situated underneath the mesonotum ( Francke-Grosmann, 1956 ; Batra, 1963 ).
 Sintomas: Attacked trees have delayed growth. Whole trees or part of trees start to wilt and often perish within a short time (especially young fruit trees).In April/May small, round entry holes (about 2 mm in diameter) become visible in the bark of trunks and larger branches. Fine, white frass trickles out from such holes. In plants still in good health, plant sap or gum (especially in Prunus) flows out of the holes.In general, X. dispar attacks only stressed trees which are already damaged by frost, drought, wetness, transplanting, root feeders or diseases. The beetle may also attack trees before conspicuous external evidence appears to indicate the stressed condition of the tree. Attacks by X. dispar may be regarded as symptomatic of an altered physiological condition in the tree. However, Vasseur and Schvester (1948) , Schvester (1954) , Egger (1973) , Postner (1974) , Viggiani (1979) , Schröder (1996) and Perny (1998) report that apparently healthy trees,

This occurs mainly when insect populations are high.

 X. dispar has been carried out in Europe. However, it seems probable that these studies are applicable to North America. X. dispar has one generation per year ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Schvester, 1954 ). The opinion of earlier authors, that X. dispar has two generations, may be due to the long flight period of the females and to some young and old females leaving the galleries in summer.As soon as the maximum daily temperature in spring reaches 18-20°C the female beetles start flying and searching for host plants. This is mostly in April/May, but sometimes as early as March ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Schvester, 1954 ; Roediger, 1956 ; Egger, 1973 ; Mani and Schwaller, 1983 ; Mani et al., 1990 , 1992; Schröder, 1996 ). The emergence of the females usually continues for 4-8 weeks depending on weather conditions.The main flight activity of the beetles is between 14:00 h and 16:00 h ( Mani et al., 1990 , 1992). In orchards with high populations, a distinct swarming of females was directly observed. Traps in open fields often caught many beetles, indicating that the beetles may fly over long distances. Catches of beetles in traps indicated that the flight in a shady forest started and finished later than in the adjacent orchard ( Mani et al., 1990 , 1992). A similar situation may be the cause of the unusually long period of trap catches (4 months) observed by Markalas and Kalapanida (1997) in a forest.After emergence, females may start boring in the same tree in which they have developed, if this is still in a suitable condition, or disperse to find another suitable host plant. The females first bore a short, radial entrance tunnel (1-3 cm deep) before excavating a transverse tunnel to either side. From each of these, cylindrical breeding galleries are

The females first bore a short, radial entrance tunnel (1-3 cm deep) before excavating a transverse tunnel to either side. From each of these, cylindrical breeding galleries are produced, directed perpendicularly both upwards and downwards ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Egger, 1973 ; Postner, 1974 ; Alford, 1984 ; Mani et al., 1990 ). In smaller trunks or in branches, the galleries are often simpler.Shortly after the beginning of boring, when the ambrosia fungus has become established, the female starts egg laying. The female then continues excavating the gallery and laying eggs. Larvae emerge a few days after oviposition. Adults and larvae feed on the fungus growing in the tunnels. In June/July pupation takes place and in July/August beetles of the new generation appear. Full development takes about 2 months. Due to the long flight and oviposition period of the females, different developmental stages may be found in a gallery at the same time. Teneral adults enter diapause and are unable to attack trees and to breed. The diapause is terminated during the winter ( Schvester, 1954 ).Beetles pass the winter in the breeding galleries, tightly packed one behind the other. The following spring, the young females of the new generation leave the gallery system through the parental entrance hole. Brother-sister mating takes place in the gallery. Males are unable to fly and usually die within the parental nest. However, it was noted long ago by Schneider-Orelli (1913) that males can sometimes be found in spring crawling on the bark of attacked trees, and may mate with overwintered females from other galleries. The ratio of males to females is very variable. Egg

 Brother-sister mating takes place in the gallery. Males are unable to fly and usually die within the parental nest. However, it was noted long ago by Schneider-Orelli (1913) that males can sometimes be found in spring crawling on the bark of attacked trees, and may mate with overwintered females from other galleries. The ratio of males to females is very variable. Egger (1973) found some galleries in which males outnumbered females, but more usually the sex ratio is biased towards females, from 1:5 to 1:15, and occasionally higher. The average number of beetles in a gallery is about 25, depending on the size and quality of the gallery, with a maximum of about 40 ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Schvester, 1954 ; Egger, 1973 ).X. dispar belongs to the group of ambrosia beetles ( Schneider-Orelli, 1913 ; Francke-Grosmann, 1963 ; Batra, 1963 , 1967; French and Roeper, 1972 , 1975). The larvae are exclusively mycetophagous; they do not feed on wood, but on the symbiotic fungus Ambrosiella hartigii, which grows in the tunnels. It grows as a continuous palisade within the galleries of the active brood. A. hartigii has two growth forms. The ambrosial form (conidia and sprout cells) is produced in association with the insect and the mycelial form is produced in vitro without the insect. French and Roeper (1972) found that larvae feed on the mycelial form in vitro, but ambrosia is required by the larvae to develop and pupate. They also believe that the main mechanism for ambrosia induction and control involves a secretion of the insect. Oocyte development and oviposition occurred only after the post-diapause females had fed on the ambrosial form of the fungus. French and Roeper

Oocyte development and oviposition occurred only after the post-diapause females had fed on the ambrosial form of the fungus. French and Roeper (1975) also observed a tending and nursing behaviour of the females. The quality of the host tissues affects fungal growth.The fungus is transferred by the mother beetle to the new gallery in a mycangium ( Batra, 1963 , 1967). In X. dispar, the mycangia are paired, pocket-shaped organs situated underneath the mesonotum ( Francke-Grosmann, 1956 ; Batra, 1963 ).
 Sintomas: Attacked trees have delayed growth. Whole trees or part of trees start to wilt and often perish within a short time (especially young fruit trees).In April/May small, round entry holes (about 2 mm in diameter) become visible in the bark of trunks and larger branches. Fine, white frass trickles out from such holes. In plants still in good health, plant sap or gum (especially in Prunus) flows out of the holes.In general, X. dispar attacks only stressed trees which are already damaged by frost, drought, wetness, transplanting, root feeders or diseases. The beetle may also attack trees before conspicuous external evidence appears to indicate the stressed condition of the tree. Attacks by X. dispar may be regarded as symptomatic of an altered physiological condition in the tree. However, Vasseur and Schvester (1948) , Schvester (1954) , Egger (1973) , Postner (1974) , Viggiani (1979) , Schröder (1996) and Perny (1998) report that apparently healthy trees,

This occurs mainly when insect populations are high.
