 Invasion: Pogostemon cablinis a perennial aromatic herb that resembles ‘mint’ in both habit and leaves. It can be identified by its shaggy look. The purple stem may grow up to 150 cm in height. Leaves have an oval form and are rather broad with lobed margins (Angadi and Vasantha Kumar, 1995), measuring up to 12 cm in length and 2 cm in width. They are covered with trichomes all over the epidermis (Guenther, 1949) and have variable green color in fullsun lightbut bright green in the shade. Flowers are small, delicate, and borne both in axillary and terminal spikes. They are generally pinkish in colour and bloom from June to August. The corolla features two fused petals forming the top lip and three petals forming the lower lip, with the centre petal being much wider than the two lateral ones. The structure’s symmetry is bilateral. The seeds are highly fragile in nature.

 Reproduccion: Genetics In the Pogostemon genus, x=16 or 17 is the fundamental chromosomal number ( Cherian and Kuriachan, 1993 ). There is substantial debate over patchouli's chromosomal count. While Lavania (1984) claimed that the patchouli chromosome count was 32, further research ( Tyagi and Bahl, 1990 ; Chen et al., 2009 ; Widoretno, 2016 ; Yan et al., 2016 ) revealed that the patchouli chromosome count was 64. It appears that the most prevalent patchouli cytotypic is 2n=4x=64. He et al. (2016 , 2018 ) examined and assembled the patchouli genome. The genome of this complex plant has a high heterozygosity and substantial repeat content. Due to the limitations of next-generation sequencing and chromosome anchoring technology, the two assembled genomes varied dramatically (1.15 Gb vs. 1.91 Gb) and no chromosome-level sequences were obtained. Reproductive Biology Patchouli is propagated by cuttings. Nursery is formed in a shady region throughout the growth season by planting 10 to 12 cm long cuttings at 10 x 10 cm spacing to preserve moisture in the seed beds ( Maiti et al., 2006 ). If all goes according to plan, 85-90% of cuttings that have been developing roots for 2 weeks will be ready for field planting in 6 to 8 weeks. Transplanting of rooted cuttings in the field usually happens in the evening. The standard planting spacing is 60 × 60 cm or 60 x 90 cm ( Maiti et al., 2006 ). Within this spacing, a population of 12,000 plants per acre is considered the ideal plant density. Physiology and Phenology Patchouli's morphological traits related to roots make it susceptible to deficiencies in soil moisture ( Nasruddin et al., 2019 ). The thin roots of patchouli plants make

Physiology and Phenology Patchouli's morphological traits related to roots make it susceptible to deficiencies in soil moisture ( Nasruddin et al., 2019 ). The thin roots of patchouli plants make them less tolerant to droughts ( Nasruddin et al., 2019 ). Environmental Requirements Living in the subtropics, patchouli plants may thrive at elevations of up to 1200 m above sea level in warm, humid climates with year-round rainfall of 1500 to 3000 mm, humidity levels of 70-90% and temperatures between 24 and 28°C ( Swamy and Sinniah, 2016 ). Alluvial, latosol and regosol are suitable types of soil for commercial cultivation. A soil pH of 5.5 to 7.0 with a sandy or dusty clay texture, high absorption and resistance to flooding during the rainy season are the perfect combination for commercial growing ( Nasruddin et al., 2019 ). Typically, patchouli is grown on arid soil that receives irrigation exclusively from rainwater; fertilizer is applied according to the demands of the patchouli plants ( Nasruddin et al., 2019 ). Mulch is a useful tool for controlling excess water evaporation, which helps to regulate soil temperature and preserve soil moisture ( Nasruddin et al., 2019 ). Mulching is necessary to save soil and water in regions with irregular rainfall patterns. Patchouli plants require an adequate supply of nutrients at appropriate times. One method for patchouli plants to have strong leaves and abundant output is fertilization. The use of mulch and fertilizer with the right dose and time reduces the impact of water shortage on patchouli plants ( Nasruddin et al., 2019 ).
