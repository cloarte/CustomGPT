Vesicular Stomatitis
Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses 
and cattle. It occasionally affects swine, sheep, goats, llamas, 
alpacas, and people who handle affected animals. Vesicular 
stomatitis is found only in the Western Hemisphere, where it is 
endemic in warmer climates and occurs sporadically in more 
temperate areas. 
Vesicular stomatitis is not endemic within the United States and 
is federally reportable. In the past decade, the southwestern and 
western United States experienced several vesicular stomatitis 
outbreaks introduced from Mexico. Outbreaks usually occur 
during the warmer months, often along waterways. In some years, 
only a few premises in a single State were affected. In other years, 
multiple States and many premises were involved. 
Veterinarians and livestock owners in these regions should be 
aware that vesicular stomatitis can potentially occur in their area. 
You should also be on the alert for animals displaying clinical 
signs of the disease. 
Economic Impacts
Although vesicular stomatitis does not normally kill affected 
animals, it can cause economic losses for livestock producers 
by preventing animal movements and impacting international 
trade. Farms with affected animals are quarantined until 14 days 
after lesions appear on the last case at that location. 
Quarantine periods can be lengthy if the disease continues to 
spread within the premises. Some countries may stop imports of 
certain animals and their products when cases are reported in 
the United States. 
Vesicular stomatitis clinical signs can look like those of several 
other diseases. One of those diseases, foot and mouth disease

certain animals and their products when cases are reported in 
the United States. 
Vesicular stomatitis clinical signs can look like those of several 
other diseases. One of those diseases, foot and mouth disease 
(FMD), is a foreign animal disease that would cause devastating 
economic consequences if found in the United States. The only 
way to tell these diseases apart is through laboratory testing. It’s 
important to quickly test any animal with clinical signs to identify 
which disease is causing illness.
Clinical Signs 
The incubation period for vesicular stomatitis is 2 to 8 days. The 
first sign of illness is often excessive salivation. If you look inside 
the mouth, you will see blanched and raised vesicles or blister-
like lesions on the inner surfaces of the lips, gums, tongue, and/
or dental pad. These blister-like lesions can also form on the lips, 
nostrils, coronary band, prepuce, vulva, and teats. The blisters 
will swell and break open, which causes mouth pain, discomfort, 
and reluctance to eat or drink. This can cause severe weight loss. 
If the coronary bands of the hooves are affected, lameness can 
occur. You may also notice a rise in body temperature before or at 
the same time lesions first appear.  
Dairy cattle often suffer from teat lesions, followed by mastitis. 
A severe drop in milk production is common. Some affected 
dairy cattle can appear normal with no clearly visible signs of 
illness but may only eat about half of their normal feed intake. If 
there are no complications such as secondary infection, affected

A severe drop in milk production is common. Some affected 
dairy cattle can appear normal with no clearly visible signs of 
illness but may only eat about half of their normal feed intake. If 
there are no complications such as secondary infection, affected 
animals typically recover in about 2 weeks. 
In horses, vesicular lesions generally occur on the upper surface 
of the tongue, lips, corners of the mouth, and gums, as well as 
around the nostrils. The lesions in horses may also appear as 
crusting scabs on the muzzle, lips, ears, coronary bands, sheath, 
udder, or underside of the abdomen. Affected pigs usually first 
show signs of lameness caused by foot lesions.

Disease Spread
How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully understood. Insects, 
animal movements, and moving the virus on objects are all 
factors. The most common method of transmission is through 
biting insects. Black flies, sand flies, and biting midges have all 
been shown capable of transmitting the virus, but other insects 
may also be involved. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, 
it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to 
saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles.  
Vesicular Disease in Humans 
People can get vesicular stomatitis after coming into contact 
with lesions, saliva, or nasal secretions from infected animals.

Vesicular Disease in Humans 
People can get vesicular stomatitis after coming into contact 
with lesions, saliva, or nasal secretions from infected animals. 
The disease causes an acute influenza-like illness with symptoms 
such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise. To avoid 
exposure to this disease, use personal protective measures when 
handling affected animals. 
Recommended Actions 
There is no specific treatment or cure for vesicular stomatitis. 
Good sanitation and quarantine practices on affected farms 
usually contain the infection. 
Once a definitive diagnosis is made on a farm, the State 
Veterinarian will determine specific quarantine procedures. The 
following procedures are also recommended: 
• Separate animals with lesions from healthy animals, 
preferably by stabling. Animals on pastures tend to be 
affected more frequently with this disease.
• Do not move animals from premises affected by vesicular 
stomatitis until at least 14 days after the onset of lesions in  
the last case.
• Implement on-farm insect control programs that include 
eliminating or reducing insect breeding areas, manure 
management practices, and using insecticides or other 
insect prevention strategies on animals and around facilities.
• Use personal protective measures when handling affected 
animals to avoid human exposure to this disease.
Report Suspicious Cases
If you suspect an animal may have vesicular stomatitis or any 
other vesicular disease, immediately contact State and Federal 
animal health authorities. You can’t diagnose the disease based 
on clinical signs alone. Samples must be tested at a

A diagnosis can be based on antibody tests using serum samples 
from the animal and/or by detecting virus from swabs of lesions, 
blister fluid, and tissue (flaps, biopsies). It can generally be made 
within a few days.
