 Invasion: The following description is based onEssig (1978): A medium-sized, solitary palm to 12 m tall; stem 6-8 cm in diameter; fonds 7-11, in a spreading crown; sheath about 65 cm long, densely white-woolly and minutely brown-lepidote with punctiform to lacerate-peltate scales, an appendage lacking or to 2.7 cm long, triangular; petiole 19-35 cm long, minutely lepidote, with brown, punctiform scales, more sparsely lepidote above than below; rachis 150-230 cm long, lepidote like petiole; pinnae about 28 on each side, arranged; basal pinnae reduced but not much crowded; central pinnae 4.5-8 cm broad in middle, gradually tapering in upper part, 54-84 cm long on midrib, the apex obliquely praemorse, sometimes briefly notched above midrib, the ramenta usually numerous beneath, not congregated near base but scattered along midrib and prominent secondary nerves for up to 3/4 the length of pinnae, narrow, pale brown, basifixed or medifixed, to about 7 mm long; inflorescence

84 cm long on midrib, the apex obliquely praemorse, sometimes briefly notched above midrib, the ramenta usually numerous beneath, not congregated near base but scattered along midrib and prominent secondary nerves for up to 3/4 the length of pinnae, narrow, pale brown, basifixed or medifixed, to about 7 mm long; inflorescence 65-70 cm long, 100-125 cm broad, with 4 or 5 orders of branching, the peduncle about 7 cm long; axes pale green, becoming orange-yellow in fruit, thickly but very finely brown lepidote-tomentose in lower parts, very sparsely so in extremities, white-woolly when very young; upper peduncular and rameal bracts reduced to inconspicuous stubs in horizontal, scarlike grooves; rachillae 1.5-2.5 mm thick in middle, 23-30 cm long, bearing 67-73 flower clusters; flowers green or greenish white; staminate flowers 4.5-5.5 mm long, 2 mm wide; calyx 1.5 mm high, the sepals glabrous and inconspicuously whitish fimbriate; petals glabrous; stamens 20-22; pistillate buds 3.5 mm high and broad at staminate anthesis; fruit red at maturity, globose to ellipsoid when dry, (9-) 12-14 mm long, 8-10 mm in diameter, the exocarp drying apart from endocarp; cupule about 4 mm high, the staminodes about 6, narrowdentiform or fused into double segments; seed 10-11 mm long, 7-7.5 mm in diameter, broadly 5-grooved, the lobes obtusely angled; endosperm deeply ruminate.

 Reproduccion: The chromosome number reported for P. elegans is 2 n =32 ( Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 2017 ). DNA barcode information for the species is available at the Barcode of Life Data Systems ( BOLDS, 2017 ). P. elegans hybridizes in cultivation with other species in the same genus ( Useful Tropical Plants, 2017 ). Bees are reported as pollinators for P. elegans ( Barfod et al., 2011 ; PIER, 2017 ). The species reproduces by seed (Dave’s Garden, 2017). In cultivation, the seeds need to be sown as soon as possible, as they do not store well (Dave’s Garden, 2017). The highest and fastest germination occurs at 32% seed moisture content ( Batista et al., 2016 ). Germination takes about 2-3 months ( PIER, 2017 ). A combination of mechanical scarification and pre-soaking in gibberellic acid will increase seed germination ( Elkiey et al., 1985 ). Seeds are sensitive to desiccation and germination gradually decreases even at  20-27% seed moisture levels ( Batista et al., 2016 ). No viable seed banks are found in the wild after one year ( PIER, 2017 ). Ptychosperma elegans is reported as flowering

Seeds are sensitive to desiccation and germination gradually decreases even at  20-27% seed moisture levels ( Batista et al., 2016 ). No viable seed banks are found in the wild after one year ( PIER, 2017 ). Ptychosperma elegans is reported as flowering from spring to summer ( Encyclopedia of Life, 2017 ). It is a relatively fast-growing species ( Useful Tropical Plants, 2017 ). The seeds are tolerant of salinity ( Batista et al., 2016 ). Ptychosperma elegans grows in a wide variety of soils as long as they are well drained and moist ( PIER, 2017 ). It grows best in rich, humus soils ( Palmpedia, 2017 ). The species is intolerant of frost (Dave’s Garden, 2017; Palmpedia, 2017 ). It will grow in temperatures as low as 4-10°C, although it has been reported surviving -1.6°C ( Palmpedia, 2017 ). It grows equally well in sun or shade, but does not tolerate extreme heat, drought or dry wind ( Palmpedia, 2017 ; PIER, 2017 ). P. elegans seedlings are highly sensitive to drought and fires ( Edwards and Krockenberger, 2006 ). The species has low tolerance of salt spray ( Broschat and Black, 2016 ).
