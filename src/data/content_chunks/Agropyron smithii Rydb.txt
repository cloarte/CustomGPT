Western wheatgrass is a perennial and sod-forming grass, native to mostparts of the United States except the humid southeast. It is a dominant species in the Central and Northern Great Plains. Plant growth is vigorous, reaching 2 to 3 feet in height. Leaves are up to 12 inches long, 0.25 inch wide, ratherstiff and erect. The whole plant is covered with a grayish bloom. It thrivesbest on rather heavy soil, but is adapted to a wide range of soil types,including alkaline soil. Both as pasturage and when cut for hay while stillsucculent, it is relished by all classes of livestock. The plants are usuallygrown from seed, but spread from underground rhizomes to form dense sods. This is a very valuable grass, both for feed and for erosion control.
