This confirmation was a result of State tracing and investigation, following an initial detection on silo testing under the USDA’s National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS) in Nevada. USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread. This is the first detection of this virus genotype in dairy cattle (all previous detections in dairy cattle have been HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13). Genotype D1.1 represents the predominant genotype in the North American flyways this past fall and winter and has been identified in wild birds, mammals, and spillovers into domestic poultry. The detection does not change USDA’s HPAI eradication strategy and is a testament to the strength of our National Milk Testing Strategy (NTMS). In the interest of sharing information of import to the scientific community, APHIS will publish a technical brief on the findings on our website and post the sequence data on GenBank in the coming week.
