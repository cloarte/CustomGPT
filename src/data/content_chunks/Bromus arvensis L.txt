Field bromegrass

Source:
Magness et al. 1971
This is a winter annual grass introduced from Europe in the late 1920'sand now grown in the Cornbelt and eastward. When seeded in late summer itdevelops an extensive fibrous root system, making it excellent for erosioncontrol. It is winter hardy and grows rapidly the following spring. The seedsripen in midsummer and the plants die. Although most used for erosion controland soil improvement, it furnishes palatable pastilrage during the spring.
