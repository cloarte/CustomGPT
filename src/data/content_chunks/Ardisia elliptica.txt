Overview
Appearance
Ardisia elliptica
is a tall shrub or small tree that can reach heights of 20 ft. (6.1 m).
Foliage
The leathery leaves are 3-6 in. (7.6-15.2 cm) long, 1 in. (2.5 cm) wide, elliptical and entire.
Flowers
Most flowering occurs in the summer, but flowering can continue year-round. The flowers are small, pink, star-shaped and hang in clusters from the axils of the leaves.
Fruit
Fruits are drupes that are rounded, fleshy, 0.3 in. (8 mm) in diameter, and start out red in color but turn black or purple as they mature.
Ecological Threat
Ardisia elliptica
grows well in low, wet areas and in old fields. This species is shade-tolerant. Birds eat the fruit and so disperse the seeds.
Ardisia elliptica
is a native of Southeast Asia and was introduced into the United States as an ornamental in the late 1800’s.
