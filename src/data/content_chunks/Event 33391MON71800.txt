Dear 
We believe that Monsanto Co. violated the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. § 7712 et 
seq.) (PPA), as described below.
Date of Violation: July 14, 2014
7 C.F.R. § 340.3(c) Notification for the introduction of certain regulated articles. 
This section describes required performance standards for the introduction of 
genetically engineered (GE) material under the notification procedure.
From approximately 2000 through 2003, Montana State University (MSU), Southern 
Agriculture Center (SARC) was a research cooperator with Monsanto Company 
(Monsanto) in four field trials (USDA Reference Nos. 00-038-19n, 01-016-24n, 02-
032-07n, and 03-022-01n) involving a specific glyphosate resistant wheat variety 
known as Event 33391/MON71800.  Monsanto developed and owns this GE wheat 
event (United States Patent 7268274).  
On July 14, 2014, Monsanto notified the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Biotechnology 
Regulatory Services (BRS) of the presence of glyphosate resistant wheat volunteers at 
MSU SARC.  APHIS’ investigation verified that multiple

event (United States Patent 7268274).  
On July 14, 2014, Monsanto notified the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Biotechnology 
Regulatory Services (BRS) of the presence of glyphosate resistant wheat volunteers at 
MSU SARC.  APHIS’ investigation verified that multiple wheat volunteers near the 
original trial sites tested positive for the cp4epsps gene, which indicates genetically 
modified material, and for the specific Event 33391/MON71800.  
The fact finding investigation is complete and APHIS determined that Monsanto is 
responsible for MSU SARC’s failure to adhere to performance standards for the 
introduction of regulated material under the notification procedure.  MSU SARC is 
currently under Emergency Action Notification (EAN) DM-408836. APHIS BRS 
expects Monsanto and MSU SARC to continue to fulfill obligations under the EAN 
until otherwise instructed by the Agency.
