Overview
Appearance
Murdannia keisak
is an annual, emergent plant that invades wetlands in the southeastern and northwestern United States. Plant stems are succulent, form roots at the nodes, and grow prostrate along the ground. Stems are 12-30 in. (30.5-76.2 cm) long.
Foliage
Leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and up to 3 in. (7.6 cm) long.
Flowers
From September to November small, pink, 3-petaled flowers occur singly or in small clusters at the apex of the stems and in the leaf axils.
Fruit
The fruit is a capsule that contains several small seeds.
Ecological Threat
M. keisak
invades water edges and marshes and often grows immersed. It forms dense mats that out-compete native vegetation.
M. keisak
is native to temperate and tropical Asia and was accidentally introduced into the United States, in South Carolina, around 1935.
