Overview
Crimson fountaingrass is a perennial, bunch grass that grows from 3-4 ft. (0.9-1.2 m) tall.  Leaves are narrow, flat, arching, up to 2 ft. (0.6 m) long and purplish in color.  Flowering occurs in summer through fall, when off-white/pinkish plumes develop about 1 ft. (0.3 m) above the leaves.  Fruits are dry achenes with long bristles (some cultivars do not produce seed).   Crimson fountaingrass is native to Africa and was introduced into Hawaii in 1914 and the southwestern United States in the 1940s.  Plants were introduced as ornamentals and have now become invasive in the South.
