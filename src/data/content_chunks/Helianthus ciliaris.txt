Overview
Appearance
Helianthus ciliaris
is a perennial herbaceous plant that can grow from 1.3-2.3 ft. (40-70 cm) tall. The stems are blue-green to gray-green in color and can be upright to recumbent.
H. ciliaris
is native to Arizona, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Mexico.
Foliage
The mostly opposite leaves are cauline, sessile and veined. They are linear to lanceolate and from 1.2-3.0 x 0.2-0.9 in. (3-7.5 x 0.5-2.2 cm) long by wide.
Flowers
The flowers are composites. The ray flowers are yellow while the disk flowers are reddish to purple-brown in color.
Fruit
The fruits are glabrous cypselae containing a single seed.  Seeds are smooth and hairless, 0.12-0.14 in. (3-3.5 mm) long.
H. ciliaris
also readily reproduces vegetatively by rhizomes.
Ecological Threat
H. ciliaris
