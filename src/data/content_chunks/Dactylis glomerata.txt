Overview
Appearance
Dactylis glomerata
is a cool-season perennial that grows 1.4-4 ft. (0.43-1.2 m)  tall. Under dry conditions it usually develops in clumps.
Foliage
Leaves have a bluish hue and grow up to 0.5 in. (1.3 cm) wide, folded when immature but later flat, with prominent white midrib on the under side.
Flowers
The flowers are yellow and occur in a panicle with spikelets in a compact cluster on one side of the rachilla. Flowers bloom from May to August.
Fruit
Panicle, 2-8 in. (5.1-20.3 cm) long, with spikelets grouped together in dense, one-sided clusters at the end of panicle branches; spikelets contain 2 to 5 florets; lemmas pointed to short-awned.
Ecological Threat
Dactylis glomerata
is native to Europe and was first introduced to the United States in the late 1700s. It prefers areas that are well-drained with moderately fertile to rich soils.
