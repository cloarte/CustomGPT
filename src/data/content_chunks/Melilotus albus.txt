 Reproduccion: The chromosome number is reported to be 2n = 16 ( Mulligan, 1957 ). The presence of a single gene pair distinguishes annual and biennial forms ( Clarke, 1935 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). Plants flower in June-July. In Ontario, Canada, M. albus flowers by the last week of June and continues flowering until frosts in the autumn. Flowers remain fresh for about 2 days, and the first seeds ripen by early August (in Ontario). Seeds continue to ripen until late autumn and many remain on the plant over winter ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). When pistils and stigmas are the same length, self-pollination takes please readily, but when the pistil is longer than the stamens there is little pollination ( Clarke, 1935 ). Barcikowska (1966, cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) found that M. albus is cross-fertile but sometimes exhibits high self-fertility in both its annual and biennial forms. Gorz and Haskins (1971) estimated that cross-pollination was 72% in a biennial population and 67% in an annual population.

 that M. albus is cross-fertile but sometimes exhibits high self-fertility in both its annual and biennial forms. Gorz and Haskins (1971) estimated that cross-pollination was 72% in a biennial population and 67% in an annual population. The authors mentioned that inbreeding is widely used in sweetclover ( Melilotus ) breeding programmes, resulting in a loss of vigour. However, they stress that vigour would be rapidly recovered when inbred lines are used in producing a variety. Honey bees ( Apis mellifera ) are the most important pollinators but Coe and Martin (1920, cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) listed a wide variety of insects pollinating sweetclover. Various estimates have been made of the number of seeds produced per plant, ranging from fewer than 100 seeds (for damaged plants, those on infertile ground or suffering from intense competition) to 350,000 seeds ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). M. albus has a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria in its nodules. The highest nitrogen content is in the vegetative parts in late autumn ( Dunham, 1933 ). The compound coumarin, characteristic of Melilotus plants, is concentrated in flower buds and fresh leaves from the tips of the branches ( Linton et al., 1963 ). Roots, stems and mature leaves have very low levels of coumarin. Day length affects induction of flowering. When grown in a greenhouse at 25.5 o C in the day and 20 o C at night, biennial plants of M. albus needed at least a 17 hour photoperiod to initiate flowering ( Wiggans, 1953 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ).

 night, biennial plants of M. albus needed at least a 17 hour photoperiod to initiate flowering ( Wiggans, 1953 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). However, annual plants flowered during photoperiods of 12-20 hours. M. albus produces both ‘soft’ seeds, which germinate readily, and a variable proportion of ‘hard seeds’ that are inherently dormant because of the seed coat’s impermeability to water ( Gucker, 2009 ). Although published reports present very variable results, hard seeds appear to be able to survive in the soil for periods estimated at up to 81 years. Germination of hard seeds can be encouraged by heat treatment (including burning), and also by fluctuating temperatures, with the lower temperatures around freezing ( Martin, 1945 , cited in Gucker, 2009 ; Van Assche et al., 2003). Surprisingly, in a species that seems to establish best in open spaces with little surrounding vegetation, Tobe and Gao (2007) claimed that light is not required for germination. There seems to be some evidence that neighbouring vegetation may to some extent act as a nurse crop by moderating seedling establishment conditions ( Smith et al., 2004 ). Moisture is needed for germination, but, once established, plants are tolerant of extremely dry conditions. In southern Ontario, Canada, seedlings appear at any time of the year, although there are pronounced peaks of emergence in March-April and September-October ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Smith and Graber (1948, cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) described early development of plants of the biennial M. albus . The primary stem becomes branched and a prominent primary root develops.

1948, cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) described early development of plants of the biennial M. albus . The primary stem becomes branched and a prominent primary root develops. During the first year the crown develops and top growth reaches a maximum in late summer when the roots grow rapidly in size. As root size increases crown buds develop and in the spring of the second year these buds produce rapidly growing stems. Annual and biennial seedlings are initially similar but by midsummer the top growth of the biennial is more decumbent than that of the annual and buds begin to appear on the crown. Later growth is mainly in the tops in the annual and there is rapid development of the root and crown rhizomes in the biennial ( Smith and Gorz, 1965 , reported in Turkington et al., 1978 ). Although the plants of M. albus last only for one or two years, many seeds are the ‘hard’, impermeable type, which can last in the soil for 20 years or more ( Stoa, 1933 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ; Munn, 1954, cited in Smith and Gorz, 1965 ). Seedlings in fertile loam or clay often arise in clumps, but most die, presumably from competition for light from faster growing neighbours. In gravelly, sandy or stony ground flowering plants are often large and widely spaced, with seldom more than 1 or 2 m -2 ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Seedling mortality is always high, with less than 25% of emergent seedlings surviving for more than 5 months. Late summer counts at sandy or gravelly locations showed densities of 50-125 plants m -2 of non-flowering plants, the vast majority of which died before the following spring.

 of emergent seedlings surviving for more than 5 months. Late summer counts at sandy or gravelly locations showed densities of 50-125 plants m -2 of non-flowering plants, the vast majority of which died before the following spring. Widely-spaced plants are often large with many flowering racemes. At seedling or early vegetative stages M. albus is not a good competitor with vigorous plants of other species, so that plants tend to be restricted to disturbed, ploughed or eroded ground. However, second year plants quickly grow tall in spring and are effective competitors with newly arising weeds ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Mowing of roadsides or waste areas usually favours populations ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Populations of M. albus can vary in size from year to year, with ‘boom’ populations in some years (Van Riper and Larson, 2009). In South Dakota ‘sweetclover years’ occur when populations are very high ( Johnson and Nicholls, 1970 , cited in Gucker, 2009 ). As with other legume species, M. albus growth is restricted at low levels of sulphur, and application of nitrogen depresses nitrogen fixation and nodulation ( Ashford and Bolton, 1961 ). The species appears to be able to grow on coal ash dumps ( Seraya and Komov, 1971 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) and is also salt tolerant to a degree ( Evans, 2001 ). The species has strong deep taproots and can make good growth on soils of moderately low fertility ( Smith and Gorz, 1965 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). In North America, M. albus grows in a wide range of communities and so is associated with different species (Turkingon et al., 1978). It is associated with herbs and grasses in prairies, with wheat, barley (as a weed in both) or oats (

 soils of moderately low fertility ( Smith and Gorz, 1965 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). In North America, M. albus grows in a wide range of communities and so is associated with different species (Turkingon et al., 1978). It is associated with herbs and grasses in prairies, with wheat, barley (as a weed in both) or oats (as a companion crop) in crop fields, and with a range of grasses, clover and weedy species in a well-drained abandoned field in Ontario. In the United States, Gucker (2009) mentions that less common habitats of M. albus include moderately saline marshes, disturbed subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry ( Abies lasiocarpa / Vaccinium scoparium ) forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, dry mixed oak and oak-hickory woodlands on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee, USA, and hardwood hammocks in Pinellas County, Florida, USA. In prairies, M. albus commonly occurs on soil mounds formed by wildlife like badgers ( Taxidea taxus ) and pocket gophers ( Higgins and Barker, 1982 , cited in Gucker, 2009 ). M. albus is adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions and is drought tolerant. It only requires adequate moisture for germination and is then capable of development under extremely dry conditions ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). The species is also winter hardy and its range extends as far north as the Yukon and North West Territories in Canada and Alaska in the United States. M. albus cannot withstand prolonged flooding, but is occasionally found on gravelly open banks beside rivers in Southern Ontario, Canada. Less than 10% of plants survived a 5-day immersion in water at 20 o C in Ontario ( Turkington et al., 1978 ).

Populations of M. albus can vary in size from year to year, with ‘boom’ populations in some years (Van Riper and Larson, 2009). In South Dakota ‘sweetclover years’ occur when populations are very high ( Johnson and Nicholls, 1970 , cited in Gucker, 2009 ). As with other legume species, M. albus growth is restricted at low levels of sulphur, and application of nitrogen depresses nitrogen fixation and nodulation ( Ashford and Bolton, 1961 ). The species appears to be able to grow on coal ash dumps ( Seraya and Komov, 1971 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) and is also salt tolerant to a degree ( Evans, 2001 ). The species has strong deep taproots and can make good growth on soils of moderately low fertility ( Smith and Gorz, 1965 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). In North America, M. albus grows in a wide range of communities and so is associated with different species (Turkingon et al., 1978). It is associated with herbs and grasses in prairies, with wheat, barley (as a weed in both) or oats (

 soils of moderately low fertility ( Smith and Gorz, 1965 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). In North America, M. albus grows in a wide range of communities and so is associated with different species (Turkingon et al., 1978). It is associated with herbs and grasses in prairies, with wheat, barley (as a weed in both) or oats (as a companion crop) in crop fields, and with a range of grasses, clover and weedy species in a well-drained abandoned field in Ontario. In the United States, Gucker (2009) mentions that less common habitats of M. albus include moderately saline marshes, disturbed subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry ( Abies lasiocarpa / Vaccinium scoparium ) forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, dry mixed oak and oak-hickory woodlands on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee, USA, and hardwood hammocks in Pinellas County, Florida, USA. In prairies, M. albus commonly occurs on soil mounds formed by wildlife like badgers ( Taxidea taxus ) and pocket gophers ( Higgins and Barker, 1982 , cited in Gucker, 2009 ). M. albus is adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions and is drought tolerant. It only requires adequate moisture for germination and is then capable of development under extremely dry conditions ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). The species is also winter hardy and its range extends as far north as the Yukon and North West Territories in Canada and Alaska in the United States. M. albus cannot withstand prolonged flooding, but is occasionally found on gravelly open banks beside rivers in Southern Ontario, Canada. Less than 10% of plants survived a 5-day immersion in water at 20 o C in Ontario ( Turkington et al., 1978 ).

 Seccion ambiental: Biology and Ecology Genetics The chromosome number is reported to be 2n = 16 ( Mulligan, 1957 ). The presence of a single gene pair distinguishes annual and biennial forms ( Clarke, 1935 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). Reproductive biology Plants flower in June-July. In Ontario, Canada, M. albus flowers by the last week of June and continues flowering until frosts in the autumn. Flowers remain fresh for about 2 days, and the first seeds ripen by early August (in Ontario). Seeds continue to ripen until late autumn and many remain on the plant over winter ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). When pistils and stigmas are the same length, self-pollination takes please readily, but when the pistil is longer than the stamens there is little pollination ( Clarke, 1935 ). Barcikowska (1966, cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) found that M. albus is cross-fertile but sometimes exhibits high self-fertility in both its annual and biennial forms. Gorz and Haskins (1971) estimated that cross-pollination was 72% in a biennial population and 67% in an annual population. The authors mentioned that inbreeding is widely used in sweetclover ( Melilotus ) breeding programmes, resulting in a loss of vigour. However

ertile but sometimes exhibits high self-fertility in both its annual and biennial forms. Gorz and Haskins (1971) estimated that cross-pollination was 72% in a biennial population and 67% in an annual population. The authors mentioned that inbreeding is widely used in sweetclover ( Melilotus ) breeding programmes, resulting in a loss of vigour. However, they stress that vigour would be rapidly recovered when inbred lines are used in producing a variety. Honey bees ( Apis mellifera ) are the most important pollinators but Coe and Martin (1920, cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) listed a wide variety of insects pollinating sweetclover. Various estimates have been made of the number of seeds produced per plant, ranging from fewer than 100 seeds (for damaged plants, those on infertile ground or suffering from intense competition) to 350,000 seeds ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Physiology and phenology M. albus has a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria in its nodules. The highest nitrogen content is in the vegetative parts in late autumn ( Dunham, 1933 ). The compound coumarin, characteristic of Melilotus plants, is concentrated in flower buds and fresh leaves from the tips of the branches ( Linton et al., 1963 ). Roots, stems and mature leaves have very low levels of coumarin. Day length affects induction of flowering. When grown in a greenhouse at 25.5 o C in the day and 20 o C at night, biennial plants of M. albus needed at least a 17 hour photoperiod to initiate flowering ( Wiggans, 1953 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). However, annual plants flowered during photoperiods of 12-20 hours. M. albus produces both ‘soft’ seeds, which germinate readily, and a variable proportion of ‘hard seeds

 plants of M. albus needed at least a 17 hour photoperiod to initiate flowering ( Wiggans, 1953 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ). However, annual plants flowered during photoperiods of 12-20 hours. M. albus produces both ‘soft’ seeds, which germinate readily, and a variable proportion of ‘hard seeds’ that are inherently dormant because of the seed coat’s impermeability to water ( Gucker, 2009 ). Although published reports present very variable results, hard seeds appear to be able to survive in the soil for periods estimated at up to 81 years. Germination of hard seeds can be encouraged by heat treatment (including burning), and also by fluctuating temperatures, with the lower temperatures around freezing ( Martin, 1945 , cited in Gucker, 2009 ; Van Assche et al., 2003). Surprisingly, in a species that seems to establish best in open spaces with little surrounding vegetation, Tobe and Gao (2007) claimed that light is not required for germination. There seems to be some evidence that neighbouring vegetation may to some extent act as a nurse crop by moderating seedling establishment conditions ( Smith et al., 2004 ). Moisture is needed for germination, but, once established, plants are tolerant of extremely dry conditions. In southern Ontario, Canada, seedlings appear at any time of the year, although there are pronounced peaks of emergence in March-April and September-October ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Growth Smith and Graber (1948, cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ) described early development of plants of the biennial M. albus . The primary stem becomes branched and a prominent primary root develops. During the first year the crown develops and top growth reaches a maximum in late summer when the roots grow rapidly in size.

During the first year the crown develops and top growth reaches a maximum in late summer when the roots grow rapidly in size. As root size increases crown buds develop and in the spring of the second year these buds produce rapidly growing stems. Annual and biennial seedlings are initially similar but by midsummer the top growth of the biennial is more decumbent than that of the annual and buds begin to appear on the crown. Later growth is mainly in the tops in the annual and there is rapid development of the root and crown rhizomes in the biennial ( Smith and Gorz, 1965 , reported in Turkington et al., 1978 ). Longevity Although the plants of M. albus last only for one or two years, many seeds are the ‘hard’, impermeable type, which can last in the soil for 20 years or more ( Stoa, 1933 , cited in Turkington et al., 1978 ; Munn, 1954, cited in Smith and Gorz, 1965 ). Population size and structure Seedlings in fertile loam or clay often arise in clumps, but most die, presumably from competition for light from faster growing neighbours. In gravelly, sandy or stony ground flowering plants are often large and widely spaced, with seldom more than 1 or 2 m -2 ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Seedling mortality is always high, with less than 25% of emergent seedlings surviving for more than 5 months. Late summer counts at sandy or gravelly locations showed densities of 50-125 plants m -2 of non-flowering plants, the vast majority of which died before the following spring. Widely-spaced plants are often large with many flowering racemes. At seedling or early vegetative stages M. al

Late summer counts at sandy or gravelly locations showed densities of 50-125 plants m -2 of non-flowering plants, the vast majority of which died before the following spring. Widely-spaced plants are often large with many flowering racemes. At seedling or early vegetative stages M. albus is not a good competitor with vigorous plants of other species, so that plants tend to be restricted to disturbed, ploughed or eroded ground. However, second year plants quickly grow tall in spring and are effective competitors with newly arising weeds ( Turkington et al., 1978 ). Mowing of roadsides or waste areas usually favours populations ( Turkington et al., 1978 ).
