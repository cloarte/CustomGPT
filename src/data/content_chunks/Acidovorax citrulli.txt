 from direct-seeded plants, transplants are rapidly gaining in popularity. A warm, humid environment (favourable for disease development) is maintained in transplant facilities used for raising watermelon seedlings. Bacteria from infested seed infect the developing seedling as the cotyledons emerge from the seed coat. Most transplant facilities employ overhead irrigation, which effectively splash-disperses bacteria to neighbouring seedlings. This secondary spread in the transplant house can result in high numbers of infected seedlings reaching the field. Some of these transplants may harbour the bacterium, but show no symptoms. Because a single transplant house may supply plants to several growers over a large geographical area, transplants can be the mechanism through which the bacterium is dispersed. The fruit blotch bacterium may be introduced into a field from infested seed, infected transplants, contaminated volunteer crop cucurbits, or infected wild cucurbits. In the field, symptom development and spread of A. citrulli on foliage and fruit is most rapid during periods when the weather is hot and humid, with thundershowers ( Hopkins, 1993 ). These conditions are common during the summer. In addition to wind-driven rain, the bacterium can be spread by contact with farm workers, irrigation and other cultivation equipment. The bacterium does not appear to spread as rapidly during cool, rainy weather. With favourable weather, a few primary infection sites in a field can result in infection of all plants by the time of harvest. Leaf lesions in the field do not result in defoliation, but are important reservoirs of bacteria for fruit infection. Under some environmental conditions, foliar symptoms may not be very conspicuous and the watermelon grower may not realize that there is a problem until fruit symptoms render the crop unmarketable.

 of bacteria for fruit infection. Under some environmental conditions, foliar symptoms may not be very conspicuous and the watermelon grower may not realize that there is a problem until fruit symptoms render the crop unmarketable. Acidovorax citrulli is spread from leaf lesions to developing fruit by splash dispersal during rain or irrigation. Watermelon fruits are most vulnerable to bacterial infection 2 to 3 weeks after anthesis ( Frankle et al., 1993 ). The bacterium invades the fruit through stomata on the fruit surface. Small, water-soaked lesions develop 3-7 days later. Mature watermelon fruit are covered with a wax layer that plugs stomata and prevents the entry of bacteria into the fruit. Once the wax layer forms, mature watermelons can be invaded by the bacterium only after wounding. Thus, the bacterium must invade the fruit 7 days, or more, before maturity, but the symptoms continue to develop as long as the fruit is attached to the plant. Surface lesions cease to enlarge after harvest. Wild cucurbits can become infected with A. citrulli by spread from cucurbit crops. Volunteer cucurbits that grow from previous crops that had fruit blotch can be naturally infected with the bacterium. These infected wild cucurbits and volunteer crop cucurbits may be important over-seasoning hosts for the bacterium that helps to perpetuate the disease in an area ( Latin and Hopkins, 1995 ). Production of cucurbit crop seed in areas with these alternate hosts of A. citrulli can result in the production of infested seed that begin the disease cycle again. Dutta (2011) noted that bacterial location in the seed is critical for A. citrulli survival. A. citrulli survives stress (surface and sub-surface seed treatments) better in pistil-inoculated seeds than in pericarp-inoculated seeds. Pistil inoculation of A. citrulli resulted

A. citrulli survives stress (surface and sub-surface seed treatments) better in pistil-inoculated seeds than in pericarp-inoculated seeds. Pistil inoculation of A. citrulli resulted in seeds in which the bacterium was localized in the embryo, while pericarp inoculation resulted in bacterial localization outside the perisperm-endosperm layer. In addition, significantly higher percentages of seeds became infested when A. citrulli was inoculated via the pistil than via the pericarp by 7 days post-inoculation. Based on genetic and phenotypic properties, A. citrulli strains are divided into two major groups: group I strains are generally isolated from melon and other non-watermelon cucurbits, while group II strains are closely associated with watermelon ( Zivanovic and Walcott, 2017 ). Genome sequences of several A. citrulli strains from both of these groups are available in public databases ( Wang et al., 2015a ). Eckshtain-Levi et al. (2016) provided the genome sequence of the group I strain M6, isolated from melon. Complete genome sequencing of the strain M6 with PacBio technology revealed the occurrence of a 53 kb plasmid named pACM6 in the bacterium ( Yang et al., 2019a ). Genome sequence of a copper-resistant strain of A. citrulli causing bacterial fruit blotch of melons became available in 2015, paving the way for further study of copper resistance mechanisms in the pathogen ( Wang et al., 2015b ).

For detailed information on the pathogenicity mechanisms and virulence repertoires of A. citrulli , refer to Burdman and Walcott (2018) . A. citrulli requires a polar flagellum for full virulence before and after host-tissue penetration ( Bahar et al., 2011 ). However, polar flagella do not contribute to the adhesion and biofilm formation of A. citrulli . It has recently been shown that A. citrulli type III effector AopP suppresses plant immunity by targeting the watermelon transcription factor WRKY6 ( Zhang et al., 2020 ). Type IV pili play a critical role in both the surface attachment and the biofilm formation of A. citrulli where null mutants are unable to perform twitching movement against the direction of medium flow. Further, type IV pili are required for wild-type levels of virulence of A. citrulli on melon. The pathogen can colonize and move thorough the xylem vessels of host seedlings. A. citrulli relies on quorum-sensing for its pathogenicity which contributes to virulence, twitching motility, seed attachment and biofilm formation ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Expanded leaves and stems are the main inoculum sources for melon blossoms and fruit ( Alves et al., 2010 ). In an experiment simulating field conditions, A. citrulli was detected in melon tissues at 0, 5 and 10 cm beneath the soil until 21 days and at 15 cm beneath the soil until 14 days. The pathogen survives in various types of soil only for 3 days. Hence, soil is not considered a potential primary source of A. citrulli inoculum ( Al

The pathogen survives in various types of soil only for 3 days. Hence, soil is not considered a potential primary source of A. citrulli inoculum ( Alves et al., 2018 ). Molecular analyses using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and DNA fingerprinting pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) technique revealed two genetically and pathogenically distinct groups among A. citrulli strains (Walcott et al., 2000). Likewise, Walcott et al. (2004) obtained a similar result using the BOX-AIR fingerprinting method. Group I strains are primarily isolated from non-watermelon cucurbits while group II strains are isolated from watermelon (Walcott et al., 2000; 2004). Later, Burdman et al. (2005) confirmed that A. citrulli strains isolated from Israel were separated into group I and group II strains. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLST) resulted in 73 sequence types among 118 A. citrulli strains isolated in China. All A. citrulli strains were typed into three groups: group 1 with 82 strains (including type strain), group 2 with 35 strains and group 3 a singleton ( Yan et al., 2013 ). Nitrogen fertilization, based on nitrate only, leads to reduced disease severity and bacterial numbers in melon leaves, as compared with two combinations of nitrate and ammonium ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, decreased potassium fertilization is associated with increased pathogen growth and disease severity caused by A. citrulli in melon foliage ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2018 ). Symptom development in bacterial fruit blotch mainly depends on environmental conditions, i.e. temperature and

 two combinations of nitrate and ammonium ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, decreased potassium fertilization is associated with increased pathogen growth and disease severity caused by A. citrulli in melon foliage ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2018 ). Symptom development in bacterial fruit blotch mainly depends on environmental conditions, i.e. temperature and relative humidity, and the population load per seed. High temperatures and relative humidity coinciding with rainstorms as well as high seed inoculum loads of A. citrulli will lead to more rapid symptom development ( Burdman and Walcott, 2018 ).
 Sintomas: Initial symptoms of A. citrulli in watermelon seedlings appear as water-soaked areas on the underside of cotyledons and leaves ( Webb and Goth, 1965 ). In young seedlings, lesions can develop in the hypocotyl resulting in collapse and death of the emerging plant. As cotyledons expand, water-soaked lesions turn dark brown and often extend along the length of the midrib. Leaf lesions are light brown to reddish brown and frequently spread along the midrib of the leaf ( Latin and Hopkins, 1995 ). As the growing season progresses, leaf symptoms may become sparse and inconspicuous.

A. citrulli relies on quorum-sensing for its pathogenicity which contributes to virulence, twitching motility, seed attachment and biofilm formation ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Expanded leaves and stems are the main inoculum sources for melon blossoms and fruit ( Alves et al., 2010 ). In an experiment simulating field conditions, A. citrulli was detected in melon tissues at 0, 5 and 10 cm beneath the soil until 21 days and at 15 cm beneath the soil until 14 days. The pathogen survives in various types of soil only for 3 days. Hence, soil is not considered a potential primary source of A. citrulli inoculum ( Al

The pathogen survives in various types of soil only for 3 days. Hence, soil is not considered a potential primary source of A. citrulli inoculum ( Alves et al., 2018 ). Molecular analyses using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and DNA fingerprinting pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) technique revealed two genetically and pathogenically distinct groups among A. citrulli strains (Walcott et al., 2000). Likewise, Walcott et al. (2004) obtained a similar result using the BOX-AIR fingerprinting method. Group I strains are primarily isolated from non-watermelon cucurbits while group II strains are isolated from watermelon (Walcott et al., 2000; 2004). Later, Burdman et al. (2005) confirmed that A. citrulli strains isolated from Israel were separated into group I and group II strains. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLST) resulted in 73 sequence types among 118 A. citrulli strains isolated in China. All A. citrulli strains were typed into three groups: group 1 with 82 strains (including type strain), group 2 with 35 strains and group 3 a singleton ( Yan et al., 2013 ). Nitrogen fertilization, based on nitrate only, leads to reduced disease severity and bacterial numbers in melon leaves, as compared with two combinations of nitrate and ammonium ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, decreased potassium fertilization is associated with increased pathogen growth and disease severity caused by A. citrulli in melon foliage ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2018 ).

 two combinations of nitrate and ammonium ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, decreased potassium fertilization is associated with increased pathogen growth and disease severity caused by A. citrulli in melon foliage ( Zimerman-Lax et al., 2018 ). Symptom development in bacterial fruit blotch mainly depends on environmental conditions, i.e. temperature and relative humidity, and the population load per seed. High temperatures and relative humidity coinciding with rainstorms as well as high seed inoculum loads of A. citrulli will lead to more rapid symptom development ( Burdman and Walcott, 2018 ).
 Sintomas: Initial symptoms of A. citrulli in watermelon seedlings appear as water-soaked areas on the underside of cotyledons and leaves ( Webb and Goth, 1965 ). In young seedlings, lesions can develop in the hypocotyl resulting in collapse and death of the emerging plant. As cotyledons expand, water-soaked lesions turn dark brown and often extend along the length of the midrib. Leaf lesions are light brown to reddish brown and frequently spread along the midrib of the leaf ( Latin and Hopkins, 1995 ). As the growing season progresses, leaf symptoms may become sparse and inconspicuous.

 A. citrulli can survive for several years on seeds that have been dried and stored. While some watermelon production is still from direct-seeded plants, transplants are rapidly gaining in popularity. A warm, humid environment (favourable for disease development) is maintained in transplant facilities used for raising watermelon seedlings. Bacteria from infested seed infect the developing seedling as the cotyledons emerge from the seed coat. Most transplant facilities employ overhead irrigation, which effectively splash-disperses bacteria to neighbouring seedlings. This secondary spread in the transplant house can result in high numbers of infected seedlings reaching the field. Some of these transplants may harbour the bacterium, but show no symptoms. Because a single transplant house may supply plants to several growers over a large geographical area, transplants can be the mechanism through which the bacterium is dispersed. The fruit blotch bacterium may be introduced into a field from infested seed, infected transplants, contaminated volunteer crop cucurbits, or infected wild cucurbits. In the field, symptom development and spread of A. citrulli on foliage and fruit is most rapid during periods when the weather is hot and humid, with thundershowers ( Hopkins, 1993 ). These conditions are common during the summer. In addition to wind-driven rain, the bacterium can be spread by contact with farm workers, irrigation and other cultivation equipment. The bacterium does not appear to spread as rapidly during cool, rainy weather. With favourable weather, a few primary infection sites in a field can result in infection of all plants by the time of harvest. Leaf lesions in the field do not result in defoliation, but are important reservoirs of bacteria for fruit infection. Under some environmental conditions, foliar symptoms may not be very conspicuous and the watermelon grower may not realize that there is a problem until fruit symptoms render the crop unmarketable.

 of all plants by the time of harvest. Leaf lesions in the field do not result in defoliation, but are important reservoirs of bacteria for fruit infection. Under some environmental conditions, foliar symptoms may not be very conspicuous and the watermelon grower may not realize that there is a problem until fruit symptoms render the crop unmarketable. Acidovorax citrulli is spread from leaf lesions to developing fruit by splash dispersal during rain or irrigation. Watermelon fruits are most vulnerable to bacterial infection 2 to 3 weeks after anthesis ( Frankle et al., 1993 ). The bacterium invades the fruit through stomata on the fruit surface. Small, water-soaked lesions develop 3-7 days later. Mature watermelon fruit are covered with a wax layer that plugs stomata and prevents the entry of bacteria into the fruit. Once the wax layer forms, mature watermelons can be invaded by the bacterium only after wounding. Thus, the bacterium must invade the fruit 7 days, or more, before maturity, but the symptoms continue to develop as long as the fruit is attached to the plant. Surface lesions cease to enlarge after harvest. Wild cucurbits can become infected with A. citrulli by spread from cucurbit crops. Volunteer cucurbits that grow from previous crops that had fruit blotch can be naturally infected with the bacterium. These infected wild cucurbits and volunteer crop cucurbits may be important over-seasoning hosts for the bacterium that helps to perpetuate the disease in an area ( Latin and Hopkins, 1995 ). Production of cucurbit crop seed in areas with these alternate hosts of A. citrulli can result in the production of infested seed that begin the disease cycle again. Dutta (2011) noted that bacterial location in the seed is critical for A. citrulli survival. A. citrulli survives stress (surface and sub-surface seed treatments) better in pistil-

 ). Production of cucurbit crop seed in areas with these alternate hosts of A. citrulli can result in the production of infested seed that begin the disease cycle again. Dutta (2011) noted that bacterial location in the seed is critical for A. citrulli survival. A. citrulli survives stress (surface and sub-surface seed treatments) better in pistil-inoculated seeds than in pericarp-inoculated seeds. Pistil inoculation of A. citrulli resulted in seeds in which the bacterium was localized in the embryo, while pericarp inoculation resulted in bacterial localization outside the perisperm-endosperm layer. In addition, significantly higher percentages of seeds became infested when A. citrulli was inoculated via the pistil than via the pericarp by 7 days post-inoculation. Genetics Based on genetic and phenotypic properties, A. citrulli strains are divided into two major groups: group I strains are generally isolated from melon and other non-watermelon cucurbits, while group II strains are closely associated with watermelon ( Zivanovic and Walcott, 2017 ). Genome sequences of several A. citrulli strains from both of these groups are available in public databases ( Wang et al., 2015a ). Eckshtain-Levi et al. (2016) provided the genome sequence of the group I strain M6, isolated from melon. Complete genome sequencing of the strain M6 with PacBio technology revealed the occurrence of a 53 kb plasmid named pACM6 in the bacterium ( Yang et al., 2019a ). Genome sequence of a copper-resistant strain of A. citrulli causing bacterial fruit blotch of melons became available in 2015, paving the way for further study of copper resistance mechanisms in the pathogen ( Wang et al., 2015b ).

Pathogenicity mechanisms For detailed information on the pathogenicity mechanisms and virulence repertoires of A. citrulli , refer to Burdman and Walcott (2018) . A. citrulli requires a polar flagellum for full virulence before and after host-tissue penetration ( Bahar et al., 2011 ). However, polar flagella do not contribute to the adhesion and biofilm formation of A. citrulli . It has recently been shown that A. citrulli type III effector AopP suppresses plant immunity by targeting the watermelon transcription factor WRKY6 ( Zhang et al., 2020 ). Type IV pili play a critical role in both the surface attachment and the biofilm formation of A. citrulli where null mutants are unable to perform twitching movement against the direction of medium flow. Further, type IV pili are required for wild-type levels of virulence of A. citrulli on melon. The pathogen can colonize and move thorough the xylem vessels of host seedlings.
