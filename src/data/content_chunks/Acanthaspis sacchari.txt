(Hall, 1923) Diagnosis Adult female scale cover in life mussel-shaped, convex, 2.0-3.0 mm long, light to dark brown, with pale straw-coloured terminal exuviae occupying about 1/3 of total length of scale cover. A thin, white ventral scale is produced. Scale cover of male similar to that of female but smaller, narrower, light to dark brown. Exposed body of live adult female white (Hall, 1923; Balachowsky, 1954). Body of slide-mounted adult female elongate, more than 1.8 times as long as wide, membranous; median lobes not zygotic, with pair of gland spines between their bases; without any club-shaped internal sclerosis arising from each median lobe; perivulvar pores present in five groups; with four or five enlarged marginal macroducts present on each side of pygidium.  ACASACP.jpg  Host range Acanthomytilus sacchari  has been recorded only on hosts from the plant family Gramineae (Borchsenius, 1966), such as species of  Anadelphia ,  Arundo ,  Imperata ,  Phragmites ,  Saccharum . Affected plant stages:  vegetative growing, flowering and fruiting stages Affected plant parts:  on stems under the leaf sheath Biology and ecology The biology of  A. sacchari  has not been studied. Crawlers are the primary dispersal stage and move to new areas of the plant or are dispersed by wind or animal contact. Mortality due to abiotic factors is high in this stage. Dispersal of sessile adults and eggs occurs through human transport of infested plant material.  Economic impact No mention of economic damage by  A. sacchari  has been found in the literature.

Dispersal of sessile adults and eggs occurs through human transport of infested plant material.  Economic impact No mention of economic damage by  A. sacchari  has been found in the literature. Detection and inspection methods Pull back the leaf sheaths of sugarcane and other giant grasses and look for brown mussel scale covers on the exposed stems. Phytosanitary risk Balachowsky, 1954, expressed concern about the likely impact if  A. sacchari  were accidentally introduced to other tropical continents. It could have damaging effects on sugarcane production and natural ecosystems.   Natural enemies The natural enemies of  Acanthomytilus sacchari  have not been studied. Distribution See  Acanthomytilus sacchari  distribution. Microscopic examination of slide-mounted adult females is required for authoritative identification to species.  Acanthomytilus intermittens  (Hall, 1924) could be misidentified as  A. sacchari , but it has only one submarginal macroduct on each side of abdominal segment VII, whereas  A. sacchari  has two or more macroducts in this position  ACASACP.jpg .  A. intermittens  is known from Italy, Algeria, Morocco, Crete, Egypt, Israel, Iraq, Iran, Tadjikistan and Mauritius on grasses including species of  Bambusa ,  Imperata ,  Panicum ,  Pennisetum ,  Vetiveria  and  Saccharum  (Balachowsky, 1954; Borchsenius, 1966; Williams and Williams, 1988; Longo  et al.,  1995) .

Adult female scale cover in life mussel-shaped, convex, 2.0-2.2 mm long, medium to light brown with terminal exuviae. Scale cover of male similar to that of female but smaller, 1.6 mm long, light brown. Exposed body of live adult female white with a brownish pygidium (Balachowsky, 1954). Acanthomytilus vermiformis  (Takahashi) could be misidentified as  A. sacchari , but it has a body more than 8 times as long as wide  ACVERS.jpg  , whereas in  A. sacchari  the body is about 3-4 times as long as wide.  Acanthomytilus vermiformis  is known from Taiwan and China (Hong Kong) on  Bambusa   vulgaris  (Takagi, 1970; The Natural History Museum collection, London, UK).  ACVERP.jpg  Comments Acanthomytilus sacchari  probably originated in tropical Africa on giant grasses (Balachowsky, 1954).
