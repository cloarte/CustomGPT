Plantago maritimaL. - Sea Plantain  -Plantaginaceae© Paul Hackney© Paul Hackney© Neville McKee(Map updated: March 2008)A common species of sea cliffs and rocky sea shores, often growing withPlantago coronopus. The leaf is the narrowest of any IrishPlantagospecies.Like all native Irish plantains, the flowers are wind-pollinated and produced in tight spikes on the ends of long scapes. The spike ofP. maritimais rather long and narrow. The plant is at its most attractive at the stage when the pollen is produced, when the yellow anthers hang out from the flowers on the ends of their long filaments, but otherwise the flower and fruit spike is drab and uninteresting-looking.All names:Plantago maritimaL.;Plantago hudsonianaDruce;Plantago edmondstoniiDruceNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
