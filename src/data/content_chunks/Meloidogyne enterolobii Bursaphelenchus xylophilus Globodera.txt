7 th Meeting of the ad hoc Panel on Nematodes Wädenswil, CH, 2010-12-07/08 The ad hoc Panel on Nematodes met at the Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW) at the kind invitation of Mr Kiewnick. The Panel continued its work on the preparation of diagnostic protocols. To date, 10 diagnostic protocols for nematodes have been published. The Panel worked on a new draft protocol on Meloidogyne enterolobii . The main issues considered were the extraction from soil, the morphological characteristics (in particular the overlap between different species) and the molecular tests to be included. The revised version will be circulated to the Panel on Diagnostics and Quality Assurance for e-mail consultation prior to country consultation. The Panel agreed to work on a new Standard on Extraction. A draft will be prepared to be circulated before the next meeting of the ad hoc Panel on Nematodes. Meloidogyne enterolobii on tomato roots Courtesy: Dr S. Kiewnick, ACW (CH) Revisions of the protocols for Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, Globodera rostochiensis & pallida and Nacobbus aberrans were considered during the Panel meeting: The protocol on B. xylophilus was revised as the Panel recognized that morphology is difficult due to variance in the population. The revised version will be reworked and re-circulated to the ad hoc Panel on Nematodes and then sent for country consultation. If the EPPO Secretariat and the authors are able to address comments made during country consultation then this revision will be submitted for Final Approval in 2011. The protocol on Globodera rostochiensis & G. pallida will be revised and reconsidered at the Panel on Diagnostics and Quality Assurance. New molecular tests will be added and validation data included

The protocol on Globodera rostochiensis & G. pallida will be revised and reconsidered at the Panel on Diagnostics and Quality Assurance. New molecular tests will be added and validation data included. The protocol on Meloidogyne chitwoodi & M.fallax was discussed but it was agreed that a new version should be prepared for the next ad hoc Panel on Nematodes as this would allow time to include 2 real time PCR tests and information should also be gathered from the ongoing ring tests on this pest. The Panel was thanked for their work on the pictorial glossary which explains the morphological terms used in the protocols for nematodes and has now been published on the Diagnostic Standards page of the EPPO website. The Panel was informed of the latest developments concerning the EPPO Panel on Diagnostics and Quality Assurance, in particular on the plans for a horizontal standard on ring-testing and proficiency testing, on the collection of validation data and on the planned revision of the EPPO standard PM 7/98 on Specific requirements for laboratories preparing for accreditation for a plant pest diagnostic activity . A presentation of the status of the QBOL project concerning nematology was given by Mr Holterman. Mr Karnkowski presented an interactive key for nematode identification and Mr Sirca gave a presentation on Meloidogyne ethiopica . The Panel suggested the addition of M. ethiopica to the Alert List . The next meeting of the ad hoc Panel on Nematodes should be held at the EPPO headquarters in February 2012.
