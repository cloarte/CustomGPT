 Invasion: Sweet (1839)first describedA. macrorrhizos. It is a large succulent perennial herb with large and elongated stems. It is normally 1-1.5 m tall but can grow up to 5 m (Manner, 2011). Factors such as plant age, genotype and environmental conditions influence the height of the plant (Lebot, 2020). Individual plants can become too heavy for the stem to hold upright in which case the stem falls to the ground, but the plant continues to grow from the tip or lateral buds. Adventitious roots can develop from the stem. Inflorescences are relatively large and usually appear in clusters. Fully mature plants develop up to 8 to 16 inflorescence clusters (Garcia et al., 2008). Two or more inflorescences subtended by bracts. Peduncles 20-45 cm long; spathe a whitish to yellowish green, oblong tube; spadix 11-

 develop from the stem. Inflorescences are relatively large and usually appear in clusters. Fully mature plants develop up to 8 to 16 inflorescence clusters (Garcia et al., 2008). Two or more inflorescences subtended by bracts. Peduncles 20-45 cm long; spathe a whitish to yellowish green, oblong tube; spadix 11-32 cm, pistil 3-4 cm long and about 1.5 cm thick. The upper part of the spathe falls soon after anthesis, and is pale yellow, membranous, oblong and hood-forming (Hay, 1999). Fruit is a fleshy berry, red when mature, globose or ovoid; possibly containing several seeds, (10-50 per fruit). Leaves are arranged in a rosette, ascending; blades flattened, ascending, with basal sinus projecting downward, 25-50 (-100) × 20-36 (-100) cm, green (although white-variegated in some cultivars), slightly lustrous, lance-ovate, coriaceous, wavy or slightly plicate along secondary veins, the apex acute or obtuse and apiculate, the base hastate, the sinuses non-overlapping, up to 30 cm long, the margins wavy, with a sub-marginal vein within 2 mm from the margin; mid-vein broad and conspicuous with 4-7 primary lateral veins per side; lower surface with dark spots on secondary vein angles; petioles 60-100 cm long (Flach and Rumawas, 1996;Wagner et al., 1999;Acevedo-Rodríguez and Strong, 2005;Lebot, 2020;Müller and Guzzon, 2024).The midrib and petiole have laticifers with raphide bundles attached to their inner walls.

The laticifers secrete a milky sap reported to contain calcium oxalate crystals (Osuji and Ihenko, 2023). It is suggested that raphide bundles are storage facilities in which calcium is stored in the form of calcium oxalate (Okoli and Green, 1987). Raphides have become an important indicator of aroids in the archaeological record.A. macrorrhizosraphides may be distinguished from other aroid species studied by their bridge, which is visible with light microscopy and relatively short compared to overall crystal length, as well as the shape of the short, wedge-shaped termination (Crowther, 2009).

28. Total length of the 2n chromosome complement was recorded as 98.83±1.39 μm. Chromosomal length range was 2.50±0.10-4.70±0.10 μm. Total form (TF%) value was found to be 43.58%, karyotype symmetry index (Syi %) was 77.00 % and karyotype asymmetry index (AsK %) was 56.66%. The centromeric formula was 18m+4sm+2ac, representing asymmetric karyotype. In DAPI banding, the 1.48% positive banded region indicates the lower amount of AT rich repeats in this material ( Warasy, 2021 ). Alocasia macrorrhizos showed more symmetric karyotype consisting of maximum metacentric chromosomes compared to A. fornicata and A. longiloba ( Das, 2018 ). The complete chloroplast sequence of A. macrorrhizos is 154 995 bp in length, containing a pair of inverted repeats of 25 944 bp separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 87 366 bp and 15 741 bp, respectively. The chloroplast genome encodes 132 predicted functional genes, including 87 protein-coding genes, four ribosomal RNA genes and 37 transfer RNA genes, 18 of which are duplicated in the inverted repeat regions. In these genes, 16 genes contained single intron and two genes double introns ( Wang and Han, 2016 ). The genotypes of A. macrorrhizos are divided into wild (non-edible) and cultivated. Wild plants are not used as food because of an extremely high concentration of calcium oxalate crystals. There is a degree of doubt whether truly wild populations exist; there is some speculation that A. macrorrhizos is a cultigen only (

 Wang and Han, 2016 ). The genotypes of A. macrorrhizos are divided into wild (non-edible) and cultivated. Wild plants are not used as food because of an extremely high concentration of calcium oxalate crystals. There is a degree of doubt whether truly wild populations exist; there is some speculation that A. macrorrhizos is a cultigen only ( Hay, 1999 ; Boyce, 2008 ). Escapees from cultivation can be found among wild plants feral genotypes; they look like wild plants but are edible ( Garcia et al., 2008 ). Reproductive Biology In the Araceae family, flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a ‘spadix’, which is usually accompanied by a spathe or leaf-like bract ( Stevens, 2012 ). The spadix is divided into different zones with a female zone at the bottom of the spadix and a male zone at the top. These two zones are separated by a sterile mid-zone. At the top of the spadix is a sterile appendix, whose main purpose is to release odorous substances. The spadix is covered by a cream-coloured spathe and forms a floral chamber, which narrows around the sterile mid-zone. Soon after pollen is released, the upper spathe and spadix begin to decay, wither and then drop off ( Bown, 2000 ; Takano et al., 2012 ; Müller and Guzzon, 2024 ). The protogynous flowers in Alocasia are pollinated by insects. For example, in Borneo, flowers of A. macrorrhizos are pollinated by Colocasiomyia flies. A syndrome of pollination mutualism has been described by Takano et al. (2012) . Within its native range, A. macrorrhizos reproduces sexually by seed, and vegetatively by tubers and root suckers.

 For example, in Borneo, flowers of A. macrorrhizos are pollinated by Colocasiomyia flies. A syndrome of pollination mutualism has been described by Takano et al. (2012) . Within its native range, A. macrorrhizos reproduces sexually by seed, and vegetatively by tubers and root suckers. However, in Puerto Rico, this species is not known to flower and plants mainly spread vegetatively ( Acevedo-Rodríguez and Strong, 2012 ). Garcia et al. (2008) considered sexual reproduction to be rare due to self-incompatibility and lack of effective pollinators. Lebot (2008) noted that it is predominantly a cross-fertilizing species. The main pollinators are insects, mostly flies and small beetles, which are attracted by a strong odour. Wind may also be a pollinating agent. Rain usually causes self-pollination and self-fertilization of self-compatible genotypes that can produce numerous seeds. Self-fertilization can be prevented by self-incompatibility, protogyny and the constriction of the spathe in the sterile region between the female and male parts of the spadix. In wild populations, flowering is usually synchronized, which enables cross-fertilization. Insect pollination is assisted by thermogenesis in the inflorescence, first described by Lamarck (1778). Ivancic et al. (2005) showed that the fertile male part and the sterile appendix were thermogenically active, and that the thermogenic period lasted 38-42 h, with the highest temperatures observed during the female phase, in the sterile appendix tissue. A later study suggested that there are probably three independent heating tissues during the female phase, namely, sterile appendix, fertile male part and differentiated sterile area below fertile male part. The main purpose of thermogenesis of this latter area is heating of the floral chamber

 active, and that the thermogenic period lasted 38-42 h, with the highest temperatures observed during the female phase, in the sterile appendix tissue. A later study suggested that there are probably three independent heating tissues during the female phase, namely, sterile appendix, fertile male part and differentiated sterile area below fertile male part. The main purpose of thermogenesis of this latter area is heating of the floral chamber, thereby optimizing the environment for pollinating insects ( Ivancic et al., 2009 ). Thermogenic activity occurs in cycles and is synchronized with the receptivity of the stigmas, release of odour and pollen, and visits by pollinating insects ( Müller and Guzzon, 2024 ). The fruits of A. macrorrhizos are berries that may contain several, but not many, seeds. The berries are ovoid and 8-10 mm long ( Manner, 2011 ); the colour of ripe berries appears to be controlled genetically and can be red, orange or yellow. The number of seeds per fruit head varies from 10 to 50 ( Lebot, 2008 ). Longevity For cultivated A. macrorrhizos , the crop life is usually 12-18 months, but harvesting can be delayed for up to 4 years. Plants can live for several years and flowering occurs sometime during the second year of growth ( Manner, 2011 ). Environmental Requirements Alocasia macrorrhizos prefers to grow in humid tropical and sub­tropical climates with temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C and more than 1700 mm of rainfall at elevations from sea level to 600-800 m ( Smith, 1979 ; Wagner et al., 1999 ). It is the most drought tolerant of the edible aroids, and cold resistant tolerating temperatures down to 10°C. Freezing temperatures damage the leaves, but new ones sprout readily ( Kay, 1987 ). A study investigating the occurrence of cuticular wax (CW) and its role in physiological mechanisms found that, despite

Freezing temperatures damage the leaves, but new ones sprout readily ( Kay, 1987 ). A study investigating the occurrence of cuticular wax (CW) and its role in physiological mechanisms found that, despite having lower CW than Colocasia and Xanthosoma , A. macrorrhizos had higher sun protection which correlated with the thin and glossy appearance of wax crystals ( Pieniazek et al., 2022 ). The species can be found growing in a wide variety of soil types, ranging from freely drained sandy soils to deep, well drained clayey soils. It tolerates shallow flooding, but it does not tolerate waterlogged soils. A. macrorrhizos has the capability to grow in habitats ranging from full sunlight to deep shade and tolerates up to 4 months of drought ( Flach and Rumawas, 1996 ). Consequently, it can be found growing in limestone rocky soils with low water-holding capacity and holes in the exposed limestone substrate ( Manner, 2011 ). It also grows in gaps in the forest understorey, margins of wet fields, and alongside streams or in roadside ditches. It is moderately salt tolerant and occurs on many South Pacific atolls ( Lim, 2015 ). It is not wind tolerant ( https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alocasia+macrorrhizos ).

 Invasion: Sweet (1839)first describedA. macrorrhizos. It is a large succulent perennial herb with large and elongated stems. It is normally 1-1.5 m tall but can grow up to 5 m (Manner, 2011). Factors such as plant age, genotype and environmental conditions influence the height of the plant (Lebot, 2020). Individual plants can become too heavy for the stem to hold upright in which case the stem falls to the ground, but the plant continues to grow from the tip or lateral buds. Adventitious roots can develop from the stem. Inflorescences are relatively large and usually appear in clusters. Fully mature plants develop up to 8 to 16 inflorescence clusters (Garcia et al., 2008). Two or more inflorescences subtended by bracts. Peduncles 20-45 cm long; spathe a whitish to yellowish green, oblong tube; spadix 11-

 develop from the stem. Inflorescences are relatively large and usually appear in clusters. Fully mature plants develop up to 8 to 16 inflorescence clusters (Garcia et al., 2008). Two or more inflorescences subtended by bracts. Peduncles 20-45 cm long; spathe a whitish to yellowish green, oblong tube; spadix 11-32 cm, pistil 3-4 cm long and about 1.5 cm thick. The upper part of the spathe falls soon after anthesis, and is pale yellow, membranous, oblong and hood-forming (Hay, 1999). Fruit is a fleshy berry, red when mature, globose or ovoid; possibly containing several seeds, (10-50 per fruit). Leaves are arranged in a rosette, ascending; blades flattened, ascending, with basal sinus projecting downward, 25-50 (-100) × 20-36 (-100) cm, green (although white-variegated in some cultivars), slightly lustrous, lance-ovate, coriaceous, wavy or slightly plicate along secondary veins, the apex acute or obtuse and apiculate, the base hastate, the sinuses non-overlapping, up to 30 cm long, the margins wavy, with a sub-marginal vein within 2 mm from the margin; mid-vein broad and conspicuous with 4-7 primary lateral veins per side; lower surface with dark spots on secondary vein angles; petioles 60-100 cm long (Flach and Rumawas, 1996;Wagner et al., 1999;Acevedo-Rodríguez and Strong, 2005;Lebot, 2020;Müller and Guzzon, 2024).The midrib and petiole have laticifers with raphide bundles attached to their inner walls.

The laticifers secrete a milky sap reported to contain calcium oxalate crystals (Osuji and Ihenko, 2023). It is suggested that raphide bundles are storage facilities in which calcium is stored in the form of calcium oxalate (Okoli and Green, 1987). Raphides have become an important indicator of aroids in the archaeological record.A. macrorrhizosraphides may be distinguished from other aroid species studied by their bridge, which is visible with light microscopy and relatively short compared to overall crystal length, as well as the shape of the short, wedge-shaped termination (Crowther, 2009).

28. Total length of the 2n chromosome complement was recorded as 98.83±1.39 μm. Chromosomal length range was 2.50±0.10-4.70±0.10 μm. Total form (TF%) value was found to be 43.58%, karyotype symmetry index (Syi %) was 77.00 % and karyotype asymmetry index (AsK %) was 56.66%. The centromeric formula was 18m+4sm+2ac, representing asymmetric karyotype. In DAPI banding, the 1.48% positive banded region indicates the lower amount of AT rich repeats in this material ( Warasy, 2021 ). Alocasia macrorrhizos showed more symmetric karyotype consisting of maximum metacentric chromosomes compared to A. fornicata and A. longiloba ( Das, 2018 ). The complete chloroplast sequence of A. macrorrhizos is 154 995 bp in length, containing a pair of inverted repeats of 25 944 bp separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 87 366 bp and 15 741 bp, respectively. The chloroplast genome encodes 132 predicted functional genes, including 87 protein-coding genes, four ribosomal RNA genes and 37 transfer RNA genes, 18 of which are duplicated in the inverted repeat regions. In these genes, 16 genes contained single intron and two genes double introns ( Wang and Han, 2016 ). The genotypes of A. macrorrhizos are divided into wild (non-edible) and cultivated. Wild plants are not used as food because of an extremely high concentration of calcium oxalate crystals. There is a degree of doubt whether truly wild populations exist; there is some speculation that A. macrorrhizos is a cultigen only (

 Wang and Han, 2016 ). The genotypes of A. macrorrhizos are divided into wild (non-edible) and cultivated. Wild plants are not used as food because of an extremely high concentration of calcium oxalate crystals. There is a degree of doubt whether truly wild populations exist; there is some speculation that A. macrorrhizos is a cultigen only ( Hay, 1999 ; Boyce, 2008 ). Escapees from cultivation can be found among wild plants feral genotypes; they look like wild plants but are edible ( Garcia et al., 2008 ). Reproductive Biology In the Araceae family, flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a ‘spadix’, which is usually accompanied by a spathe or leaf-like bract ( Stevens, 2012 ). The spadix is divided into different zones with a female zone at the bottom of the spadix and a male zone at the top. These two zones are separated by a sterile mid-zone. At the top of the spadix is a sterile appendix, whose main purpose is to release odorous substances. The spadix is covered by a cream-coloured spathe and forms a floral chamber, which narrows around the sterile mid-zone. Soon after pollen is released, the upper spathe and spadix begin to decay, wither and then drop off ( Bown, 2000 ; Takano et al., 2012 ; Müller and Guzzon, 2024 ). The protogynous flowers in Alocasia are pollinated by insects. For example, in Borneo, flowers of A. macrorrhizos are pollinated by Colocasiomyia flies. A syndrome of pollination mutualism has been described by Takano et al. (2012) . Within its native range, A. macrorrhizos reproduces sexually by seed, and vegetatively by tubers and root suckers.

Within its native range, A. macrorrhizos reproduces sexually by seed, and vegetatively by tubers and root suckers. However, in Puerto Rico, this species is not known to flower and plants mainly spread vegetatively ( Acevedo-Rodríguez and Strong, 2012 ). Garcia et al. (2008) considered sexual reproduction to be rare due to self-incompatibility and lack of effective pollinators. Lebot (2008) noted that it is predominantly a cross-fertilizing species. The main pollinators are insects, mostly flies and small beetles, which are attracted by a strong odour. Wind may also be a pollinating agent. Rain usually causes self-pollination and self-fertilization of self-compatible genotypes that can produce numerous seeds. Self-fertilization can be prevented by self-incompatibility, protogyny and the constriction of the spathe in the sterile region between the female and male parts of the spadix. In wild populations, flowering is usually synchronized, which enables cross-fertilization. Insect pollination is assisted by thermogenesis in the inflorescence, first described by Lamarck (1778). Ivancic et al. (2005) showed that the fertile male part and the sterile appendix were thermogenically active, and that the thermogenic period lasted 38-42 h, with the highest temperatures observed during the female phase, in the sterile appendix tissue. A later study suggested that there are probably three independent heating tissues during the female phase, namely, sterile appendix, fertile male part and differentiated sterile area below fertile male part. The main purpose of thermogenesis of this latter area is heating of the floral chamber

A later study suggested that there are probably three independent heating tissues during the female phase, namely, sterile appendix, fertile male part and differentiated sterile area below fertile male part. The main purpose of thermogenesis of this latter area is heating of the floral chamber, thereby optimizing the environment for pollinating insects ( Ivancic et al., 2009 ). Thermogenic activity occurs in cycles and is synchronized with the receptivity of the stigmas, release of odour and pollen, and visits by pollinating insects ( Müller and Guzzon, 2024 ). The fruits of A. macrorrhizos are berries that may contain several, but not many, seeds. The berries are ovoid and 8-10 mm long ( Manner, 2011 ); the colour of ripe berries appears to be controlled genetically and can be red, orange or yellow. The number of seeds per fruit head varies from 10 to 50 ( Lebot, 2008 ). Longevity For cultivated A. macrorrhizos , the crop life is usually 12-18 months, but harvesting can be delayed for up to 4 years. Plants can live for several years and flowering occurs sometime during the second year of growth ( Manner, 2011 ). Environmental Requirements Alocasia macrorrhizos prefers to grow in humid tropical and sub­tropical climates with temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C and more than 1700 mm of rainfall at elevations from sea level to 600-800 m ( Smith, 1979 ; Wagner et al., 1999 ). It is the most drought tolerant of the edible aroids, and cold resistant tolerating temperatures down to 10°C. Freezing temperatures damage the leaves, but new ones sprout readily ( Kay, 1987 ). A study investigating the occurrence of cuticular wax (CW) and its role in physiological mechanisms found that, despite

Freezing temperatures damage the leaves, but new ones sprout readily ( Kay, 1987 ). A study investigating the occurrence of cuticular wax (CW) and its role in physiological mechanisms found that, despite having lower CW than Colocasia and Xanthosoma , A. macrorrhizos had higher sun protection which correlated with the thin and glossy appearance of wax crystals ( Pieniazek et al., 2022 ). The species can be found growing in a wide variety of soil types, ranging from freely drained sandy soils to deep, well drained clayey soils. It tolerates shallow flooding, but it does not tolerate waterlogged soils. A. macrorrhizos has the capability to grow in habitats ranging from full sunlight to deep shade and tolerates up to 4 months of drought ( Flach and Rumawas, 1996 ). Consequently, it can be found growing in limestone rocky soils with low water-holding capacity and holes in the exposed limestone substrate ( Manner, 2011 ). It also grows in gaps in the forest understorey, margins of wet fields, and alongside streams or in roadside ditches. It is moderately salt tolerant and occurs on many South Pacific atolls ( Lim, 2015 ). It is not wind tolerant ( https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alocasia+macrorrhizos ).
