 Invasion: On blight-susceptible American chestnut stems, conspicuous, yellow-orange or orange-brown stromata, 0.75-3 mm in diameter by 0.5-2.5 mm high, are typically abundant, randomly distributed, and sometimes contiguous on smooth-bark cankers. On rough-bark cankers of blight-resistant chestnuts, or on oaks, stromata may be infrequent or inconspicuous.

, are typically abundant, randomly distributed, and sometimes contiguous on smooth-bark cankers. On rough-bark cankers of blight-resistant chestnuts, or on oaks, stromata may be infrequent or inconspicuous. They may be found only in cracks and crevices, solitary or in small or large linear groups that may be confluent. Stromata are typically slightly to moderately erumpant through the bark, are composed of both fungal and host cells, and contain conidiomata and ascomata.The conidiomata are the first structures to form in the stroma and are surrounded by a loose growth of hyphae or prosenchyma. When the stroma first breaks through the bark periderm, stromatic cells become shorter and thicker, densely crowded together, and appear as a pseudoparenchymous tissue. This tissue layer covers the exposed surface of the stroma and the necks of the typically later-formed perithecia. Conidiomata locules are often large, convoluted, and 100 to 300 µm in diameter. Conidiophores are branched, bearing differentiated conidiogenous cells that are cylindrical, tapering at the apex, sometimes with a collarette. Conidia are hyaline, aseptate, oblong to cylindrical, 3 to 5 x 1-2 µm, and during moist periods are expelled in mucilaginous spore tendrils that are yellowish when young and coral red when old. The tendrils readily wash away during rains. Some stromata contain conidiomata and no ascomata; this is especially common for hypovirulent strains of C. parasitica, which form very small stromata on blight-susceptible chestnuts.The ascoma is a subglobose perithecium, 300-400 µm in diameter, which often develops in the

Some stromata contain conidiomata and no ascomata; this is especially common for hypovirulent strains of C. parasitica, which form very small stromata on blight-susceptible chestnuts.The ascoma is a subglobose perithecium, 300-400 µm in diameter, which often develops in the stroma below the conidiomata, but at times is formed well up in the stroma at the level with or above the conidiomata. The perithecia are white to brown, with black necks. Perithecia commonly have a valsoid arrangement, with the oblique and central long (600 or more µm) periphysate necks converging and erumpent through the stromatic disc. Some stromata have an upright arrangement of perithecia. Stromata may contain one to 60 perithecia (usually 15 to 30), which show on the surface of the stroma as a number of raised papillae or a number of black ostiolate necks. Asci (30-60 x 7-9 µm) are unitunicate, ellipsoid to subclavate with a refractive apical ring, evanescent at the base, then free at maturity, 8-spored. Ascospores (7-12 x 3-5.5 µm) are hyaline, two-celled with a median septum, ellipsoid or ovoid, with a gelatinous envelope.For further information seeShear et al.

 Reproduccion: Wounds in the bark, of mechanical or biological origin are the main infection court of C. parasitica and cankers are often associated with a dead branch stub on the stem. The primary source of virulent inoculum is ascospores, which are produced in abundance on blight-susceptible chestnut trees, and, to a lesser extent, on blight-resistant chestnut trees and oaks. Ascospores are disseminated in air currents and have been detected in large numbers as far as 90-120 m from a perithecial source; they were expelled every day for 168 days. Ascospores are expelled from perithecia in stroma on cankers following a warm rain, primarily in the spring and early summer. The optimum temperature range for expulsion is 20-27°C. The amount of sexual reproduction in a C. parasitica population is critical to the genetic diversity in that population and the number of vegetative compatibilty types of the fungus, which affects the spread of hypoviruses involved in blight control (see Control). The smaller conidia are considered less infective than ascospores and are primarily water and insect-borne. Tendrils of conidia in cirrhi, formed in wet weather on a stroma, may contain 100 million conidia ( Heald, 1926 ).

Large numbers of conidia have been recovered from birds ( Heald and Studhalter, 1914 ).The fungus colonizes bark tissues by the growth of mycelial fans that may be found in several layers of the bark; host cells are killed in advance of colonization. Resistant hosts, such as Chinese chestnut, infected with virlulent strains, and susceptible chestnut hosts, infected with hypovirulent (reduced virulence) strains, have fewer mycelial fans. Hypovirulent strains of C. parasitica may naturally be present in cankers (see Control) and are frequently infected with a dsRNA virus (hypovirus). Most chestnut cankers resulting from colonization by virulent strains are sunken, which kills the stem or branch and all foliage above the canker. Resistant hosts, infected with virulent strains, or susceptible chestnuts, infected with hypovirulent strains, may have non-killing, swollen, superficial cankers or callused and swollen cankers. Stromata containing conidiomata and/or perithecia are abundant on sunken cankers but often infrequent on swollen cankers. Sunken cankers on main stems can kill the entire tree above the ground, often within 1or 2 years, but stump sprouts commonly develop after stem death unless sunlight is too low for shoot growth or browse damage is high ( Sivanesan and Holliday, 1981 ; Roane et al., 1986

 Sintomas: The first evidence of infection on blight-susceptible chestnut trees may be a small, flat, orange-brown area on the smooth bark tissues of the main stem or branches. These small lesions may be associated with a small, shade-killed branch. The lesions develop into sunken cankers as buff-colored mycelial fans develop in the bark, at one or more bark depths in the phloem to the vascular cambium. The margin of the cankers may slight slightly and the bark may crack. Small, yellowish to orange stromata containing conidiomata break through the bark and become larger and more numerous as the canker grows. Distinctive yellow tendrils (cirrhi) of conidia extrude from the stroma in wet weather. In the later months of the first year, papillae and/or the black necks of the perithecia become apparent on the stromata. Stromata may reach densities of 50 or more per cm² and over 1000 per canker on American chestnuts. Cankers or stromata on European chestnuts may contain no, few, or many perithecia. Soon after, depending on the diameter of the stem, the canker expands around the circumference of the stem and the vascular cambium is girdled and killed on susceptible chestnuts.

Wilting and death of the foliage above the branch or stem canker follows. On older and rougher bark with rhytidome, or on blight-resistant chestnuts or oaks, cankers may not be as obvious, and stromata may be infrequent. Blight-resistant trees infected with virulent strains may have superficial and swollen cankers with thick rhytidome, due to the wound periderm formation, or callused and swollen cankers, which develop after a small area of the vascular cambium has been killed. Intermediate cankers may be formed also with irregularly swollen and sunken areas within a canker. Killing of the vascular cambium and stem death can occur in normally blight-resistant Chinese chestnuts after severe spring frosts or at high altitude, but it is uncommon. Blight-susceptible chestnuts infected with hypovirulent strains may exhibit the same canker types exhibited by blight-resistant chestnuts and oaks infected with virulent strains. In the case of the former, only stromata with conidiomata may be formed by the hypovirulent strains. For further information, see Shear et al.

Large numbers of conidia have been recovered from birds ( Heald and Studhalter, 1914 ).The fungus colonizes bark tissues by the growth of mycelial fans that may be found in several layers of the bark; host cells are killed in advance of colonization. Resistant hosts, such as Chinese chestnut, infected with virlulent strains, and susceptible chestnut hosts, infected with hypovirulent (reduced virulence) strains, have fewer mycelial fans. Hypovirulent strains of C. parasitica may naturally be present in cankers (see Control) and are frequently infected with a dsRNA virus (hypovirus). Most chestnut cankers resulting from colonization by virulent strains are sunken, which kills the stem or branch and all foliage above the canker. Resistant hosts, infected with virulent strains, or susceptible chestnuts, infected with hypovirulent strains, may have non-killing, swollen, superficial cankers or callused and swollen cankers. Stromata containing conidiomata and/or perithecia are abundant on sunken cankers but often infrequent on swollen cankers. Sunken cankers on main stems can kill the entire tree above the ground, often within 1or 2 years, but stump sprouts commonly develop after stem death unless sunlight is too low for shoot growth or browse damage is high ( Sivanesan and Holliday, 1981 ; Roane et al., 1986 ; Griffin et al.,
