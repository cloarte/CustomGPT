1. Reagent Name: Leptospira grippotyphosa Polyclonal Antibody (LG PAb) 
2. Strain or Source: Rabbit origin anti-LG serum 
3. Lot Number: IRP 511-04 
4. Fill Date: December 1, 2004 
5. Expiration Date: March 31, 2028 
Precautions: There are no known hazards associated with the use of this reagent. 
6. Intended Use: For use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described 
in Supplemental Assay Method (SAM) 626 for serial release potency testing of leptospiral 
bacterins containing serovar grippotyphosa. This reagent may also be used in the 
microagglutination test. 
7. Instructions for Use: Dilute LG PAb 1:10,000 in carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer 
and use immediately, according to SAM 626. 
8. Test of Reagent: L. grippotyphosa 
antigen by the microagglutination test (MAT). MAT titers against other serovars are negligible. 
The optimal use dilution was determined by titration, using the assay described in SAM 626. 
9. Container Size, Type, Weight, or Volume: 150 µL aliquots in plastic microcentrifuge 
tubes. 
10. Storage Conditions: -20° to -80°C for long-term storage. Vial may be held at 2°- 7°C for 
several weeks.

13. Method of Preparation: LG PAb was prepared by hyper-immunizing New Zealand 
white rabbits with heat-inactivated whole cells of NVSL L. grippotyphosa challenge strain 
11808, followed by an injection of viable whole cells. Individual rabbit sera were tested by the 
MAT. Satisfactory sera were pooled, filtered, and frozen at -20°C or lower. 
14. Other: None.
