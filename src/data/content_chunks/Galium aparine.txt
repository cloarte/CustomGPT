 Invasion: G. aparine is a slender, annual herb with branched roots. Cotyledons are petioled, ovate, usually notched at the apex, slightly rough above, 8-15 mm long and 6-9 mm broad.The stems are green, soft, freely branched, numerous, weak, straggly and semiprostrate. They may be up to 120 cm long. G. aparine climbs or ascends by adhering to or lying on adjacent vegetation. Stems are quadrangular in cross-section, with prominent ribs, densely set with recurved thorn-like spines. They are jointed and branched at the first node. The nodes are usually densely tomentose, but sometimes only slightly so.The leaves are sessile in whorls of 4-8 at the nodes. They are simple, narrow, oval-lanceolate, mucronate, single-veined, 30-60 mm long, 3-8 mm broad, usually dark green, thin, lax and mucronate. The leaf margins are weakly retrosely scabrous. The upper surface of the leaf is hairy and the lower surface has a row of forward directed spines along the midrib.The flowers are 2 mm in diameter on peduncles in the axils of the leaf whorls. There are two to five flowers per peduncle (five to six bracts), in cymes. The corolla is white with four acute lobes.

There are two to five flowers per peduncle (five to six bracts), in cymes. The corolla is white with four acute lobes. The flowers are bisexual, with four stamens and one pistil with two styles. The pollen grains are oval in equatorial view and the polar diameter (width) of the hexaploid plant is 25-31 µm.The fruit is a schizocarp with two capsules per flower forming two globose mericarps. The fruits are grey or greyish-brown and oval in outline. They are 2-4 mm long, excluding the spines, with the scar somewhat oblong. The surfaces of the fruit are covered with hooked bristles, about 0.8 mm long, on tuberculate bases that are dilated and usually arise from a small tubercle formed by the elevation of the surface of the fruit. Fruits are sometimes sparsely spiny and very rarely smooth or tuberculate.

 Habitat: 
 Reproduccion: G. aparine is an annual herb that reproduces solely by seed. It behaves predominantly as a winter annual, and has been described as one of the most winter hardy weeds of winter-sown crops in Germany. In Japan, germination and emergence occurred between mid-November and February, with a peak in December, approximately 40 days after initial germination ( Noda et al., 1965 ). In some years, a second flush of germination was observed in late February or March. This protracted germination periodicity helps G. aparine to escape herbicide treatments.

 occurred between mid-November and February, with a peak in December, approximately 40 days after initial germination ( Noda et al., 1965 ). In some years, a second flush of germination was observed in late February or March. This protracted germination periodicity helps G. aparine to escape herbicide treatments. In Canada, flowering begins in late May and is completed by mid-June, with mature fruits present from late June to mid-July ( Moore, 1975 ). In some instances, flowering plants have been collected as late as August and September. In the UK, some emergence was observed in the field as late as April and May ( Froud-Williams et al., 1984 ). Flowers are self-compatible and self-pollinated, each giving rise to two seeds. On average, one plant produces 300-400 seeds ( Hanf, 1983 ).Much research on the germination requirements for G. aparine is contradictory. Seed dormancy patterns vary greatly between populations, with hedgerow populations showing less dormancy than those in arable fields ( Froud-Williams, 1985 ). In Sweden, freshly harvested seeds exhibited little innate dormancy, but germination occurred most readily in darkness ( Sjostedt, 1959 ). Hirinda (1959) reported 50-76% germination in the dark, compared with 0-4% in light and 39-50% in intermediate conditions. Ueki and Shimizu (1970) showed that germination was enhanced by 5-10 minutes of light compared with continuous darkness. Various other techniques for breaking dormancy were tested (scarification, puncturing, soaking in enzymes, kinetin, thiourea or nitrate solutions), but soaking in 1000 p.p.m. gibberellic acid was the only treatment that resulted in an increase in germinability. Froud-Williams (1985) reported that seed germination was enhanced by nitrate, and that, in general, germination was

Froud-Williams (1985) reported that seed germination was enhanced by nitrate, and that, in general, germination was promoted by light. He also found that hedgerow populations germinated over a wider range of temperatures (5-20°C) than field populations (5-15°C). Soil pH has little effect on germination ( Holm et al., 1977 ).Seeds of G. aparine buried in the soil display cyclical changes in dormancy, they lose dormancy in the autumn and re-acquire it in the spring so that seeds are dormant in the summer months. Dormancy was released again in the late summer to early autumn ( Froud-Williams, 1985 ).Numerous studies have examined the ability of G. aparine seeds to emerge from depth. Noda et al. (1965) reported that the maximum number of seeds emerged from a depth of 8-15 mm, and that the greatest depth was 33 mm. Hirinda (1959) reports the optimum depth of emergence as 2-5 cm. Other authors have reported the maximum depth from which seeds are capable of emerging as 4-20 cm ( Kurth, 1967 ; Tsuruuchi, 1971 ). These variations probably depend on soil type. Holm et al. (1977) report that seeds are unable to emerge from 4 cm in a heavy, firm soil, but in light soils will emerge 7-12 days after being sown at a depth of 10 cm. Brenchley and Warington (1930) , in long-term field trials in the UK, indicated that the longevity of G. aparine seeds in the soil is usually less than 2 years

(1977) reported viability in soils in Germany as being limited to 2-3 years.Seeds may be dispersed by wind, water, animals, farm machinery or as contaminants of crop seed. The hooked bristles on the fruits and seeds provide a mechanism for attachment to animal fur, feathers or human clothes and bags. The fruits also have a hollow space near to the point of attachment between the two halves, which enables them to float on water. In the Canadian prairie provinces, the planting of rapeseed contaminated with G. aparine seed is the principal means of spread ( Malik and van den Born, 1988 ). G. aparine may also be spread with contaminated straw and manure and during the movement of harvesting machinery.
