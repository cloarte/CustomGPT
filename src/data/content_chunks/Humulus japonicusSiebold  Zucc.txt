Plant Notes:  Japanese Hops is an introduced annual vine in the Hemp family (Cannabaceae). It is native to East Asia. In Alabama it can be found in the northern third of the state. Japanese Hops occurs along rivers and streams, along railroad tracks, near old home sites, and in other moist, disturbed habitats. It is an annual with a tap root. Stems are twining or sprawling, green or purple streaked, 4-angeld, and armed with stiff 2-branched stalked hairs that aid in climbing. Stems can reach lengths of 35 feet. Leaves are opposite, petiolate, palmately 5-9 lobed, pubescent with stiff hairs on the upper surface and along the veins on the lower surface, and with serrate margins. The petiole is usually longer than the blade and pubescent with prickly hairs. Flowers are produced in the axils of the leaves. Male and female flowers occur on separate plants (dioecious). Female flowers occur in cone-shaped clusters that hang down and male flowers occur in upright panicles. The female inflorescence consists of several overlapping bracts that are green or purplish in color, pubescent, with densely hairy margins. A pair of inconspicuous female flowers without petals is located at the base of each bract. Male flowers consist of 5 greenish or purplish sepals, no petals, and 5 anthers. The fruit is

A pair of inconspicuous female flowers without petals is located at the base of each bract. Male flowers consist of 5 greenish or purplish sepals, no petals, and 5 anthers. The fruit is an ovoid, yellow-brown achene. Japanese Hops is a larval food source for Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), Eastern Comma (Polygonia comma), Question Mark (Polygonia interrogationis), and Red Admiral (Vanessa atalanta) butterflies. Japanese Hops is listed as an invasive species in the United States.—A. Diamond  ;
