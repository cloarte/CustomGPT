Euphrasia officinalis agg.L.sensu lato - Eyebright  -Scrophulariaceae© John Wilde(Map updated: March 2008)This is not one species but actually a complex of many separate but somewhat similar species which are semi-parasitic on grasses and other plants. They occur in a variety of grassy or heathery places from sea level up to quite high altitudes. The map shows the distribution of the eyebright group as a whole, but we have produced separate pages for a few of the more distinctive species, each with its own account and distribution map.All names:Euphrasia officinalis agg.L.sensu latoNBN Atlas mapping:Species account: NBN Atlas UK Species Observations databaseiNaturalist:Species account: iNaturalist World Species Observations database«« Return to previous pageNext Species »
