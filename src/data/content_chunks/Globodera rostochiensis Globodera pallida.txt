Clarification of the Definition of “Field” in Potato Cyst Nematode Guidelines 
 
In May 2014, The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) revised the “Canada and United States 
Guidelines on Surveillance and Phytosanitary Actions for the Potato Cyst Nematodes Globodera 
rostochiensis and Globodera pallida” (Guidelines). The revision enhanced the ability of these 
countries to prevent the spread of potato cyst nematodes (PCN) while limiting disruptions to 
trade.  
 
Effective May 19, 2015, APHIS and CFIA, at the request of and in consultation with their 
stakeholders, further clarified the term “field” as used in these Guidelines.  
 
Within Sections 4, 7, and 9  
A “field” refers to a distinct plot of land distinguished from neighboring plots of land by physical 
boundaries such as roads, fences, waterways, etc. If PCN presence is confirmed within a field, 
the entire field as defined by its physical boundaries will come under regulatory control.  
 
Within Section 8  
A “field” is defined by the boundaries of the specific area of land that was surveyed for PCN. 
Boundaries must be permanently recorded and traceable using Global Positioning System 
coordinates or physical markers accepted by the national plant protection organization of the 
exporting country. If the area of land sampled for PCN differs from one potato crop to the 
subsequent potato crop, only the area sampled in common to these two potato crops

 land that was surveyed for PCN. 
Boundaries must be permanently recorded and traceable using Global Positioning System 
coordinates or physical markers accepted by the national plant protection organization of the 
exporting country. If the area of land sampled for PCN differs from one potato crop to the 
subsequent potato crop, only the area sampled in common to these two potato crops will be 
eligible for the PCN survey exemption provision specified in Section 8, provided all PCN survey 
results are negative.
