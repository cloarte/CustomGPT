 Invasion: The species was redescribed and figured byMaiti and Saha (1986).Adult FemaleLength 1.9-2.0 mm. Frons broadly convex, surface shining, reticulate, with sparse, small and large punctures. Antennal club solid on posterior face, no sutures visible. Pronotum slightly wider than long, sides strongly arcuate, anterior margin broadly rounded, with 8 coarse serrations. Elytra equal in length to pronotum, about as long as wide, apex broadly rounded. Elytral declivity commencing at posterior third, very steep, convex; strial punctures obsolete, replaced by close granules and very small setae; interstrial punctures also obsolete, with irregular small granules and a single row of erect scales and small setae over entire surface.Immatue StagesThe egg and pupa have not been described.Gardner (1934) describes the mature larva (as Xyleborus discolor) as follows: length about 4 mm. Head pale, slightly wider than long. Labrum with moderate posterior extension. Epipharyngeal setae normal, short and very fine; the two pairs of setae between the rods rather close, the setae of each pair widely separated. Maxillary palp with apical segment slightly longer than wide. Labial palps widely separated; apical segment globular, slightly transverse. Abdominal terga with two distinct folds and an extremely narrow intermediate strip. Spiracles with atrium not wider than air tubes together. Skin smooth

 the two pairs of setae between the rods rather close, the setae of each pair widely separated. Maxillary palp with apical segment slightly longer than wide. Labial palps widely separated; apical segment globular, slightly transverse. Abdominal terga with two distinct folds and an extremely narrow intermediate strip. Spiracles with atrium not wider than air tubes together. Skin smooth. Too little is known of the larvae of other species of Xylosandrus to be sure whether the description is adequate to separate X. discolor larvae from those of related species. Gardner (1934) distinguishes the species from X. crassiusculus by the smooth (versus micro-asperate) skin.

 Habitat: No encontrado
 Reproduccion: The important pest species in the genus Xyleborus and the related genera Ambrosiodmus, Euwallacea, Xyleborinus and Xylosandrus are all ambrosia beetles in the Xyleborini, a tribe with a social organization of extreme polygamy. The sexual dimorphism is strongly developed, and the ratio of females to males is high. Some species infest small twigs and shoots, others are found in larger branches and poles, while others are found in large timber; others may breed in material of almost any size. In general, most species bore through the bark and into the wood where an enlarged chamber of varying size and shape is constructed. The tunnels into the wood are highly variable in depth and shape, depending on the species involved in the construction. Generally only unhealthy or newly fallen material is infested, but some species are capable of attacking host plants following only a slight set-back, for example, transplanting or temporarily unfavourable conditions such as drought or mechanical injury. A few species have become aggressive under certain conditions, and have thereby attained the status of important pests.All species of

Generally only unhealthy or newly fallen material is infested, but some species are capable of attacking host plants following only a slight set-back, for example, transplanting or temporarily unfavourable conditions such as drought or mechanical injury. A few species have become aggressive under certain conditions, and have thereby attained the status of important pests.All species of Xyleborus and the related genera are closely associated with ambrosial fungi. Some of these fungi are phytopathogenic and all species of Xyleborus and related genera should be considered to be possible vectors of plant disease.Some details of the biology of X. discolor are given by Beeson (1961) , Browne (1961) and Kalshoven (1959) . The species usually breeds in stems from about 0.8 to 3.0 cm diameter, but occasionally up to about 7.5 cm diameter. There is a short radial gallery penetrating the stem, and one or more longitudinal galleries, which may be irregularly enlarged, and in which the brood develop. Brood size is usually small (six to ten), but development is rapid. In most parts of the range, there will be numerous overlapping generations during the year.
 Sintomas: Attacked plants may show signs of wilting, branch die-back, shoot breakage, chronic debilitation, sun-scorch or a general decline in vigour.
